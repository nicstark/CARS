The '''Lincoln Versailles''' is a [[mid-size]] [[luxury car]] manufactured by [[Ford Motor Company]] and marketed by its [[Lincoln automobile|Lincoln]] division as a [[badge engineering|rebadged]] variant of the [[Ford Granada (North America)|Ford Granada]] and [[Mercury Monarch]].&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;{{cite news

and was noted as the first production vehicle to offer [[Automotive paint#Clearcoat|clearcoat paint]].&lt;ref name="ref5"/&gt;

The Versailles nameplate derives eponymously from the noted 17th century [[Palace of Versailles|palace]] outside [[Paris, France|Paris]]. 

== Background ==
{{refimprove|date=January 2016}}
During the mid-1970s, the Lincoln division of Ford sought to expand its model range for multiple reasons.  Since 1961, Lincoln had marketed the Lincoln Continental as its sole model line (while sold by Lincoln-Mercury, the [[Lincoln Mark series|Continental Mark series]] would not officially adopt the Lincoln nameplate until 1986).  By comparison, Cadillac offered four distinct model lines and Chrysler (''excluding'' Imperial) offered two distinct sedans.

While sales of large luxury cars recovered following the [[1973 oil crisis]], its impact led to the rise of imported cars.  As the economy-car segment saw market share increases from Honda and Toyota, the luxury car segment saw its own changes as well.  While competing in price with Cadillac, Imperial, and Lincoln, the West German [[BMW New Six|BMW 3.0Si]] and [[Mercedes-Benz W116|Mercedes-Benz 350SE/450SE]] offered American luxury-car buyers a far different vehicle than produced by American manufacturers.

In May 1975, General Motors introduced the [[Cadillac Seville]] as a 1976 model, developed in response to the fuel crisis and European luxury sedans.  While the Seville was the smallest Cadillac in 40 years, it was also introduced as its most expensive sedan.  Although using the chassis and mechanical underpinnings of the [[Chevrolet Chevy II / Nova|Chevrolet Nova]] to save on engineering and development costs, the Seville was given its own exterior; no body panels were shared between the vehicles.

For the 1977 model year, Lincoln introduced the Versailles as its compact sedan offering, expanding the Lincoln model line for the first time since 1960.  Although the smallest Lincoln, the Versailles carried the highest base price at $11,500 ($48,154 in 2017 dollars&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=11500&amp;year1=197701&amp;year2=201706|title=CPI Inflation Calculator|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), in line with its Cadillac counterpart.  The first Lincoln manufactured outside of [[Wixom Assembly Plant|Wixom Assembly]] since 1957, the Versailles was produced alongside the Mercury Monarch and Ford Granada. The model was notable for being the first production vehicle to be sold with [[Automotive paint#Clearcoat|clearcoat paint]] and halogen headlights in North America.&lt;ref name="ref5" /&gt;

== Overview ==

=== Exterior ===
[[File:1977 Lincoln Versailles at 2015 Macungie show 2of2.jpg|left|thumb|1977 Lincoln Versailles, showing rear trunk detail]]
During the development of the Lincoln Versailles, Ford had a smaller budget than General Motors.{{cn|date=November 2018}}  As it was released in 1977, the Lincoln Versailles showed relatively few exterior differences from the Mercury Monarch sold beside it in the same showroom.

With the front fascia, the body was restyled slightly from the Monarch to give a resemblance to the [[Lincoln Continental Mark V|Continental Mark V]] and restyled 1977 Lincoln Continental Town Car. In a major departure, the Versailles marked the debut of rectangular headlamps on a Lincoln, also becoming the first Lincoln with exposed headlamps since 1969. The rear fascia was restyled slightly, with a Mark V styled "Continental spare" trunklid lettered LINCOLN instead of CONTINENTAL.

In sharp contrast to the Seville, the Versailles shared many visible body panels with the Monarch and Granada, including its entire roofline.  For 1979, the rear roofline was redesigned for a notchback appearance distinct from the Monarch. Using a fiberglass cap on the rear roofline, the update required new quarter windows and included the standardization of the vinyl [[Landau (automobile)|landau roof]].

=== Interior ===
Essentially taking over the role of the [[Mercury Monarch#Grand Monarch Ghia|Mercury Grand Monarch Ghia]], the Lincoln Versailles inherited many standard interior features, including many seen in the larger Mercury Grand Marquis and Lincoln Continental.  Along with power-operated leather-trim seats and steering wheel, power steering and windows, the Versailles included features such as a digital LCD clock,dual map lights, lighted passenger vanity mirror, rear-seat map pockets, and plush carpeting with soundproofing.

=== Chassis ===
The Versailles shares its wheelbase with the Ford Granada/Mercury Monarch and the four-door Ford Maverick/Mercury Comet.  Marketed as a compact car, the Versailles is closer in size to the mid-size segment of today, in terms of exterior footprint.

According to Lincoln advertising, a quality-control regimen was used at the factory.  According to the marketing, final assembly included dynamometer testing of the engine/transmission, a water spray test to pinpoint body leaks, and a simulated road test.  The Versailles featured "matched and balanced" driveline elements, low-friction lower ball joints, double isolated shocks, reinforced chassis areas, sound insulation, and balanced forged 14" aluminum wheels with Michelin whitewall X-radials. Bodywork received the first [[clear-coat]] paint on a regular production car.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Flammang, James ''Standard Catalog of American Cars 1976-1999 3rd Edition'' (Iola, WI: Krause Publications, Inc 1999), p.595.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Versailles shared its powertrain with the Monarch upon which it was based, with a V8 engine as a sole choice.  Initially, the Versailles was powered by the 351 cubic-inch V8, phased out in favor of the 302 cubic-inch V8. The three-speed C4 automatic transmission was the only transmission available.  The rear differential used in the Versailles was [[Ford 9-inch axle|Ford 9-inch]] with rear [[disc brake]]s, replacing the drums on the Granada and the Monarch.

== Sales ==
In comparison to the Cadillac Seville, the Lincoln Versailles fared poorly, outsold by the Cadillac by a three to one margin in its 1977 debut year.  Following its update for the 1979 model year, sales of the Versailles would more than double, though remaining far behind its Cadillac counterpart.

In its entire production run, Lincoln would sell 50,156 examples of the Versailles.&lt;ref name="gmvprod" /&gt;  By comparison, Cadillac would outsell that total in both 1978 and 1979, the last two years of the first-generation Seville.

The '''Lincoln Continental''' is a series of [[Mid-size car |mid-sized]] and [[Full-size car|full-size]]d [[luxury car]]s produced by [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln]], a division of the American automaker [[Ford Motor Company]].  The model line was introduced following the construction of a personal vehicle for [[Edsel Ford]], who commissioned a coachbuilt 1939 Lincoln-Zephyr convertible, developed as a vacation vehicle to attract potential Lincoln buyers. In what would give the model line its name, the exterior was given European "continental" styling elements, including a [[Continental tire|rear-mounted spare tire]].

In production for over 55 years across nine different decades, Lincoln has produced ten generations of the Continental. Within the Lincoln model line, the Continental has served several roles ranging from its flagship to its base-trim sedan. From 1961 to 1976, Lincoln sold the Continental as its exclusive model line.  The model line has also gone on hiatus three times. From 1949 to 1955, the nameplate was briefly retired. In 1981, the Continental was renamed the [[Lincoln Town Car]] to accommodate the 1982 seventh-generation Continental.  After 2002, the Continental was retired, largely replaced by the [[Lincoln MKS]] in 2009; in 2017, the tenth-generation Continental replaced the MKS.

As part of its entry into full-scale production, the first-generation Continental was the progenitor of an entirely new automotive segment, the [[personal luxury car]].  Following World War II, the segment evolved into coupes and convertibles larger than [[sports car]]s and [[Grand tourer|grand touring cars]] with an emphasis on features, styling, and comfort over performance and handling. From 1956 to 1957, the Continental nameplate was the namesake of the short-lived Continental Division, marketing the 1956–1957 [[Continental Mark II]] as the worldwide flagship of Ford Motor Company; as a second successor, Ford introduced the [[Lincoln Mark series |Continental Mark series]] in 1969, produced over six generations to 1998.

Along with the creation of the personal luxury car segment, the Lincoln Continental marked the zenith of several designs in American automotive history. The Continental is the final American vehicle line with a factory-produced V12 engine (1948), the final four-door convertible (1967), and the final model line to undergo [[Downsize (automobile) |downsizing]] (for the 1980 model year).

==Edsel Ford prototype (1939)==
The Lincoln Continental began life as a personal vehicle for Ford Motor Company President Edsel Ford.&lt;ref&gt;Dammann, George ''The Cars of Lincoln Mercury'' (Sarasota, FLA: Crestline, 1987), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1938, Ford commissioned a one-off design he wanted ready for his March 1939 vacation from company Chief Stylist  [[Eugene Turenne Gregorie|Eugene T. "Bob" Gregorie]]. Using the blueprints of the streamlined [[Lincoln-Zephyr]] as a starting point, Gregorie sketched a design for a convertible with a redesigned body; allegedly, the initial sketch for the design was completed in an hour.

At the time work had begun on the first Continental coupe, Lincoln had previously cancelled the [[Lincoln K-series]] coupes, sedans, and limousines, and produced the very limited [[Lincoln Custom]] limousine, along with the smaller [[Lincoln-Zephyr]] coupes and sedans. Ford wanted to revive the popularity of the 1929–1932 [[Lincoln K-series#1932|Lincoln Victoria]] coupe and convertible but with a more modern approach, reflecting European styling influences for the Continental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lincoln Series KA Victoria coupe|url=http://www.desertclassics.com/Linc32KAcp.html|website=Desert Classics|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By design, the Edsel Ford prototype could be considered a [[Chopping and channeling|channelled and sectioned]] Lincoln-Zephyr convertible; although the vehicle wore a conventional windshield profile, the prototype sat nearly 7 inches lower than a standard Lincoln. With the massive decrease in height, the [[running board]]s were deleted entirely. In contrast to the Zephyr (and in a massive change from the K-Series Lincoln), the hood sat nearly level with the fenders. To focus on the styling of the car, the chrome trim on the car was largely restricted to the grille; instead of door handles, pushbuttons opened the doors. As with the Lincoln-Zephyr, the prototype was fitted with a 267 cubic-inch V12 engine; it was fitted with front and rear transverse leaf springs and hydraulic drum brakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Lincoln/1955_Lincoln/1955-Lincoln---The-Continentals-Brochure |title=1955 Lincoln – The Continentals Brochure |website=Oldcarbrochures.org |accessdate=2015-03-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402090323/http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Lincoln/1955_Lincoln/1955-Lincoln---The-Continentals-Brochure |archivedate=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design would introduce two long-running features used in many American automobile designs. The modified body gave the design new proportions over its Zephyr counterpart; with the hoodline sitting lower over the V12 engine and the passenger compartment moved rearward, the prototype had more in common with classic era "long-hood, short deck" body configurations versus being a strict adherent of contemporary [[streamline moderne]] design trends. As a consequence of the smaller trunk space, the spare tire was mounted behind the trunk; while disappearing on American cars, the [[Continental tire|externally mounted, covered spare tire]] remained a feature on European-produced cars.

The prototype designed by Gregorie was produced on time, making the deadline to be delivered to Edsel Ford in Florida. Interest from well-off friends was high; Edsel sent a telegram back to Michigan that he could sell a thousand of them. In reference to its European-inspired design, the Lincoln-based prototype received its name: Continental.

Immediately, production commenced on the Lincoln Continental, with the majority of production being "Cabriolet" convertibles and a rare number of coupes. They were extensively hand-built; the two dozen 1939 models and 400 1940-built examples were built with hand-hammered body panels; dies for machine-pressing were not constructed until 1941. The limited number of 1939 models produced are commonly referred to as '1940 Continentals'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ritch|first=Ocee |title=The Lincoln Continental |publisher=Motorbooks International Publishers &amp; Wholesalers, Inc. |location=Minneapolis, Minnesota |year=1963 |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln Continentals from 1939 to 1941 shared largely the same body design with each other; based on the [[Lincoln-Zephyr]], the Continental received few updates from year to year.

For the 1942 model year, all Lincoln models were given squared-up fenders, and a revised grille. The result was a boxier, somewhat heavier look in keeping with then-current design trends, but perhaps less graceful in retrospect. 1942 production was shortened, following the entry of the United States into World War II; the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] led to the suspension of production of automobiles for civilian use.

After World War II, the Lincoln division of Ford returned the Continental to production as a 1946 model; Lincoln dropped the Zephyr nomenclature following the war, so the postwar Continental was derived from the standard Lincoln (internally H-Series). To attract buyers, the design was refreshed with updated trim, distinguished by a new grille. For 1947, walnut wood trim was added to the interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1947_Lincoln/1947_Lincoln_Folder/1947%20Lincoln-a04.html |title=Directory Index: Lincoln/1947_Lincoln/1947_Lincoln_Folder |website=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of Edsel Ford in 1943, Ford Motor Company re-organized its corporate management structure, which led to the 1946 departure of the Continental's designer Bob Gregorie. That year's Continental, the first postwar model, was designed by famed industrial stylist [[Raymond Loewy]]. 1948 would become the last year for the Continental, as the division sought to redevelop its new 1949 model line as an upgraded version of the Mercury; the expensive personal-luxury car no longer had a role at Lincoln.

The 1939–1948 Continental is recognized as a "Full Classic" by the [[Classic Car Club of America]], one of the last-built cars to be so recognized. As of 2015, the 1948 Lincoln Continental and 1948 Lincoln were the last cars produced and sold by a major U.S. automaker with a V12 engine.&lt;ref name="flory2008" /&gt;

After an eight-year hiatus, for the 1956 model year, the Continental nameplate made its return; to launch the vehicle, Ford created a namesake Continental division centered around its new flagship vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Lincoln/1956_Lincoln/1956_Continental_Mark_II_Brochure/1956-Continental-Mark-II-04|title=1956 Continental Mark II sales brochure|website=oldcarbrochures.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208123647/http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Lincoln/1956_Lincoln/1956_Continental_Mark_II_Brochure/1956-Continental-Mark-II-04|archive-date=2015-12-08|access-date=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975|last=Gunnell|first=John|publisher=Krause Publications, Inc|year=2002|edition=4th|location=Iola, WI|page=498}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To again highlight the European influence of the original Continental, Ford assigned the "Mark II" suffix to the new Continental (also in an effort to distinguish itself from the similar [[Bentley R Type#R-Type Continental|Bentley Continental]]). Slotted (far) above Lincoln-Mercury, Continentals would be marketed and serviced through the Lincoln dealership network.

At its 1956 launch, the Continental Mark II was the most expensive automobile sold by a domestic manufacturer in the United States, rivaling the [[Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud]].&lt;ref&gt;Gunnell, p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z7531/Continental-Mark-II.aspx|title=The Continental Mark II Story|website=conceptcarz.com|access-date=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At $10,000, the Mark II (equivalent to nearly $90,000 in 2016) cost the same as five [[Ford Customline#Second generation: 1955 to 1956|Ford Customline]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. With a large number of power-equipment features included, the Mark II was offered with only a single option: air conditioning priced at $595.

On a unique, low-slung chassis sharing its 126-inch wheelbase dimension with the Lincoln Capri and Premiere, the Mark II was assembled with its own body panels and interior; each vehicle was hand-built, with hand-sanding and finishing of body panels. In several elements of its design, the Mark II broke from American styling precedent. As with a Rolls-Royce or [[Mercedes-Benz W189|Mercedes-Benz 300d]], the Mark II essentially restricted chrome trim to the window trim, grille, and bumpers. With a nearly flat hood and trunklid, the Mark II was also designed with neither tailfins (prominent on American sedans) nor [[Ponton (car)|pontoon fenders]] (then current in Europe). Rather than a separate assemblage the "[[Continental spare tire]]" was now integrated into the deck lid stamping, serving to accommodate the vertically-mounted spare tire beneath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Classic American Cars|last=Wilson|first=Quentin|publisher=DK Publishing, Inc.|year=1997|location=New York, NY|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, 2,996 Continental Mark IIs were produced (including two prototype convertibles).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Gunnel, p. 499.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a consequence of the nearly hand-built construction, Ford estimated it lost nearly $1000 on every Continental Mark II produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=80 Years of Cadillac La Salle|last=McCall|first=Walter|publisher=Crestline Publishing|year=1982|location=Sarasota FL|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After 1957, the Mark II was discontinued; the Continental Division was re-branded as a competitor to Imperial and Cadillac (rather than Rolls-Royce and Bentley).&lt;gallery&gt;

To build a better business case for its flagship and the division that marketed the vehicle, the Continental model line underwent extensive changes for the 1958 model year. To widen its sales potential, Ford required Continental to reach a $6000 price (a 40% reduction from the Mark II), allowing the division to better compete against [[Cadillac Eldorado]] and [[Imperial (automobile)#Second generation (1957–1966)|Imperial LeBaron]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newfreelifestyle.com/?p=1742|title=LINCOLN CONTINENTAL MARK IV 1960|date=2016-08-27|website=newfreelifestyle.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217223951/http://newfreelifestyle.com/?p=1742|archive-date=17 February 2017|url-status=dead|accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To allow for production at a larger scale, the Continental model line was more closely integrated with Lincoln, differing primarily in roofline, trim, and grille.  For 1959, Ford cancelled the Continental Division outright, with its model line remaining through the 1960 as part of the model cycle. 

The first all-new unibody design since World War II, this generation of the Continental is one of the largest sedans ever built by Ford Motor Company (or any American automaker).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 1959|title=Annual Auto Section|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|journal=Popular Mechanics|publisher=Hearst Magazines|accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

===Development===
To facilitate continuation of the Continental model line, the division was forced to abandon hand-built construction. Sharing a common chassis and much of the exterior of the Lincoln Premiere, Continental production shifted to the then-new Wixom Assembly plant.

To set itself apart from a Lincoln, along with a division-specific grille, all versions of the Continental (including convertibles) were styled with a reverse-slant roofline, fitted with a retractable "[[Breezeway (car)|breezeway]]" rear window. First introduced on the 1957 [[Mercury Turnpike Cruiser]], the feature allowed for augmented interior ventilation (along with air conditioning). Unlike the Turnpike Cruiser, the reverse slant of the roofline included the rear window, an element that would reappear on Mercury sedans in the next decade. 

The Continental Mark III was designed by [[John Najjar]], Chief Stylist of Lincoln, assisted by [[Elwood Engel]] largely drawing influence from the 1955 Ford La Tosca concept model designed by Alex Tremulis.  Engel would style the 1959 Mark IV, with Don Delarossa (who replaced Najjar as Lincoln Chief Stylist in 1957) developing the 1960 Mark V.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  As a result of its massive size and the configuration of its headlights, the model line was nicknamed the "slant-eyed monster" in the Ford design studio.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

===Chassis/body===
The 1958–1960 Continental Mark III–V are built upon the same mechanical components utilized by the Lincoln Capri and Premiere.  For 1958, Lincoln split further from Mercury in body design as part of ongoing efforts to outdo Cadillac, with Lincoln adopting unibody construction for the first time;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Lincoln/1958_Lincoln/1958_Lincoln_Brochure/1958-Lincoln-10-11|title=1958 Lincoln-10-11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002041759/http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Lincoln/1958_Lincoln/1958_Lincoln_Brochure/1958-Lincoln-10-11|archivedate=2016-10-02|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Continental shares a common body with the Premiere, with the exception of the reverse-slant roofline.

Shared with Lincoln, Mercury, and the [[Ford Thunderbird (second generation)|Ford Thunderbird]], the Continental Mark III–V were fitted with a 430 cubic-inch [[Ford MEL engine|MEL]] V8 engine; a 3-speed [[Cruise-O-Matic|Turbo-Drive]] automatic was the sole transmission. In 1958, the engine produced 375&amp;nbsp;hp, and was retuned to 350&amp;nbsp;hp in 1959, making 315&amp;nbsp;hp in 1960.

Using a 131-inch wheelbase, the 1958 Continentals are the longest-wheelbase sedans ever built by Ford Motor Company. Longer than a Ford Excursion, the 1958–1960 Continentals are the longest sedans ever produced by Ford without [[5 mph bumper]]s. The 1958 Continental Mark III convertible is the longest convertible ever mass-produced in the United States, with the sole exception of the (extremely rare) 1934–1937 [[Cadillac V-16|Cadillac V16]] convertibles.

===Models===
In line with the previous Continental naming tradition, Continental introduced its 1958 model line as the Mark III. In a break from previous practice, the two subsequent model years were marketed as incrementally increased "marks" (Marks IV and V).

====Mark III (1958)====
For 1958, Continental released the Mark III in four bodystyles, including a 2-door hardtop and convertible, a 4-door pillared sedan, and a four-door hardtop sedan (called Landau). Although far less expensive than the Mark II, the Mark III remained well-equipped, retaining air conditioning as an option (relocated from the ceiling to the dashboard).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1957_Lincoln/1957_Lincoln_Brochure/1957%20Lincoln-10-11.html|title=1957 Lincoln Brochure|website=Oldcarbrochures.com|accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mark III became the first Ford Motor Company vehicle to offer an FM radio tuner (as a rarely ordered option).&lt;ref name="flory2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1958_Lincoln/1958_Lincoln_Brochure/1958%20Lincoln-12.html|title=1958 Lincoln Brochure|website=Oldcarbrochures.com|accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A unique option was "Auto Lube", allowing for the car to lubricate itself (as long as an oil reservoir was kept full).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1959" /&gt;

====Mark IV (1959)====
For 1959, the Continental Mark IV saw a minor restyling, with the elimination of [[Dagmar bumpers|Dagmars]] from the front bumpers and side sculpting becoming much less deeply drawn. Coinciding with the end of the Continental Division, "Continental III" fender badging is replaced by separate "Continental" and "Mark IV" badging. The grille is restyled slightly, with the headlight clusters now integrated into the egg-crate grille.

====Mark V (1960)====
For 1960, the Continental Mark V saw another styling update, with flatter front bumpers (with Dagmars). The Continental badging was restyled, with "Mark V" badging moved to the rear fenders. On the front fenders, several horizontal chrome strakes were added. Using a similar layout as the Mark IV, the Mark V was given a restyled grille.

====Town Car/Limousine====
Alongside the Mark III, IV, and V, there are two additional models of the third-generation Continental. In 1959, Lincoln added the Limousine and Town Car bodystyles; the latter marked the first use of the Town Car name by Lincoln. Available only in black, both versions were built with a model-specific formal rear roofline with a padded roof; the Limousine featured a partition between the front and rear seats. The roofline of Town Car and Limousine was designed in an effort to avoid extending the wheelbase; the deletion of the reverse-slant rear window allowed for the rear seat to be moved rearward several inches.

The 1959–1960 Town Car and Limousine are among the rarest Lincoln vehicles ever sold; only 214 examples of the $9,200 Town Car were produced and only 83 examples of the $10,200 Limousine were produced.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Nameplate reuse===
Nearly 40% lower in price than the Continental Mark II, the Mark III would go on to sell better than the Mark II predecessor. From 1958 to 1960, the Lincoln Division would lose over $60 million; along with the launch of newly developed vehicles in a recession economy (a factor that contributed to the downfall of the Edsel line), Lincoln and Continental was faced with overcoming the expense of developing a vehicle that was shared with neither Ford nor Mercury.

In 1961, as Lincoln redesigned its model line, the Continental went from being the flagship Lincoln to the only model line sold by the division (for the next 16 years). In the mid-1960s, Ford made a decision to develop a new successor to the Mark II, naming it the [[Lincoln Continental Mark III|Continental Mark III, effectively beginning the]] [[Lincoln Mark series|Mark series]]. As with the Mark II and the 1958-1960 Continentals, it was sold, marketed, and serviced by Lincoln, though not officially badged as such. As part of the launch, the existence of the 1958 Continental Mark III that shared its name was heavily downplayed; a second nickname to this generation is dubbed the "forgotten Marks"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

For the 1961 model year the [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln]] range was consolidated into one model. Following the $60 million in losses to develop the 1958–1960 cars, all models were replaced by a new Lincoln Continental. Making its first appearance since 1948, the fourth-generation was available only as a four-door sedan and convertible until its refresh in 1966.

The fourth-generation Lincoln Continental was styled by Ford design vice president [[Elwood Engel]].&lt;ref name=HSW&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1961-lincoln-continental7.htm|title=1961 Lincoln Continental - Almost Got Discontinued|date=2007-10-11|website=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1958, Lincoln was struggling against Cadillac,{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} with its lack of profitability putting the future of the division at risk.&lt;ref name="HSW" /&gt;  In 1958, Engel developed a proposal for the [[Ford Thunderbird (third generation)|1961 Ford Thunderbird]] with staffers Howard Payne and John Orfe in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1961-lincoln-continental2.htm|title=1961 Lincoln Continental - Development Begins|work=HowStuffWorks}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the proposal was not selected for the Thunderbird, the design interested Ford executives to the point of desiring the vehicle as a four-door Lincoln.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1961-lincoln-continental6.htm|title=1961 Lincoln Continental - Product Planning Meetings|date=2007-10-11|website=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the approval, Ford product planners had come to two conclusions critical to restoring the Lincoln Division to profitability. First, to instill design continuity, Lincoln would adopt a model cycle distinct from Ford or Mercury, moving from three years to eight or nine.&lt;ref name=DesignStudy&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1961-lincoln-continental1.htm|title=1961 Lincoln Continental - Lincoln Institutes Design Study|date=2007-10-11|website=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Second, the 1958 Lincoln model line was too large for a standard-length sedan; consequently, the 1961 Lincoln would have to decrease its exterior footprint.&lt;ref name="DesignStudy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1961-lincoln-continental9.htm|title=1961 Lincoln Continental - Engineering|date=2007-10-11|website=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chassis===
The fourth-generation Continental rode on a stretched version of the unibody platform produced for the 1961 Thunderbird,&lt;ref name="curbsideclassic.com"/&gt; lengthened to a 123-inch wheelbase From 1961 to 1963. This was extended to 126 inches from 1964 to 1969.

The only engine available was the {{convert|430|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford MEL engine#430|MEL V8]] carried over from the Mark V. It was expanded to [[Ford MEL engine#462|462]] cubic inches in 1966, becoming the largest-displacement engine ever used in a Ford Motor Company passenger car. A new engine, the {{convert|460|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford 385 engine|''385-series'']]-based V8, took its place in 1969, shared with the [[Lincoln Continental Mark III|Continental Mark III]]. All versions of the Continental were fitted with a 3-speed automatic transmission.  New for 1966 was Ford's C6 automatic, designed for use in big block, high-horsepower V8 engines.

===Body===
At its 1961 launch, the fourth-generation Lincoln Continental was offered solely as a four-door, as either a sedan or a convertible. For the first time on a Lincoln since 1951, rear doors were rear-hinged ([[suicide door]]s). To alert drivers of open doors, Lincoln fitted the dashboard with a "Door Ajar" warning light (as seen on many modern automobiles). Latching together at the B-pillar with a vacuum-operated central locking system, convertibles used an abbreviated pillar while sedans were "pillared hardtops". In the configuration, a thin B-pillar supported the roof structure while all four doors utilized frameless door glass (in the style of a hardtop or convertible); the layout would become used by several Ford Motor Company sedans during the 1960s and 1970s.

In what would be the first four-door convertible from a major American manufacturer after World War II, the Lincoln Continental convertible was fitted with a power-operated top on all examples. Deriving its mechanism from the [[Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner]] hardtop convertible, the Continental was fitted with a fabric roof that stored under a rear-hinged deck lid/filler panel. In a similar fashion as the Skyliner, to access the trunk for storage, the deck lid was opened electrically (without raising or lowering the roof).

A somewhat rare and unusual option for 1964–1965 was the vertically adjustable steering column. Unlike most tilt-adjustable columns that employ a lever-activated locking pivot joint just behind the steering wheel the Lincoln version employed a vacuum-actuated clamp, a dash-mounted height indicator window and a pivot point much further down the column.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Ford Swing-Away, Tilt-Away, and Tilt Steering Wheels|url=http://automotivemileposts.com/tbird1961swingaway.html|website=Automotive Mileposts|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Model timeline===
During its production, the fourth-generation Lincoln Continental would be produced in three versions, undergoing model revisions in 1964 and 1966.

===1961–1963===
The 1961 Lincoln Continental was introduced with four-door sedan and four-door convertible versions, replacing the Lincoln Premiere and Lincoln Continental Mark V. For the first time in a car manufactured in the United States, the Lincoln Continental was sold with a 2 year/ {{convert|24000|mi|km|abbr=on}} bumper-to-bumper warranty.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1964"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1964_Lincoln/1964_Lincoln_Continental_Brochure/1964%20Lincoln%20Continental-19.html|title=1964 Lincoln Continental Brochure|website=Oldcarbrochures.com|accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[California Walnut]] [[Wood veneer|veneer]] was used on the doors and instrument panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1962_Lincoln/1962_Lincoln_Continental_Brochure/1962%20Continental-06.html |title=1962 Lincoln Continental Brochure |website=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1962, a simpler [[grille (motor vehicle)|front grille]] design with floating rectangles and a thin center bar was replaced the heavy-gauge, Thunderbird-like, high mounted bumper of the '61.

For 1963, the Continental underwent several functional updates. The front seatbacks were modified in an effort to increase rear seat legroom. To increase luggage space, the trunklid was reshaped. In line with a number of vehicles in the United States, the electrical charging system introduced an [[Alternator (automotive)|alternator]], replacing the [[Dynamo|generator]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===1964–1965===
For 1964, the Lincoln Continental underwent its first mid-cycle redesign. Alongside styling updates, several functional changes were focused towards increasing rear-seat space. The wheelbase was increased from 123 to 126 inches, shifting the rear seats backward.   The roofline underwent several changes, with the adoption of flat side glass (replacing curved window glass). To increase rear headroom, the rear roofline became additionally squared off, in a notchback style.

In a slight exterior restyling, to eliminate the "electric shaver" appearance, the front fascia added vertical chrome accents to the grille; the recessed rear grille was replaced by a much simpler decklid with trim panel (moving the fuel-filler door to the left-rear fender). The interior was completely revised with a full-width instrument panel, updated upholstery patterns, door panels and fittings.

In 1964, Lincoln debuted the Continental Town Brougham concept car,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://automotivemileposts.com/lincoln/lincoln1964townbroughamshowcar.html|title=1964 Lincoln Continental Town Brougham Show Car – AUTOMOTIVE MILEPOSTS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had a 131 in. wheelbase, overall length at 221.3, and had a retractable glass partition between the front and rear compartments, with an exposed area over the front compartment, in typical 1930s style [[town car]]/[[Brougham (car body)|brougham]] appearance.

For 1965, Lincoln made additional updates to the Continental. In a styling change, the convex "electric shaver" front fascia was replaced by a more angular blunt hood with an upright flat grille design. As part of the redesign, the front turn signals and parking lights are moved from the front bumpers to wraparound lenses on the front fenders, with similar parking lights/turn signals on the rear; all four lights received metal trim to match the horizontal lines of the new grille. To improve braking ability, the Continental was given Kelsey-Hayes [[disc brake]]s for the front wheels; in addition, front seat belts with retractors became standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1965_Lincoln/1965_Lincoln_Continental_Brochure/1965%20Lincoln%20Continental-14%20001.html |title=1965 Lincoln Continental Brochure |website=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===1966–1969===
[[File:Royal motorcade (8075978363).jpg|thumb|right|[[British royal family]] in 1967 Continental]]
For 1966, the fourth-generation Lincoln Continental underwent a second mid-cycle redesign. To better compete against the [[Cadillac Coupe de Ville]] and the [[Imperial (automobile)#1966|Imperial Crown Coupe]], Lincoln introduced its first two-door pillarless hardtop since 1960. The convertible remained offered solely as a four-door. In an effort to increase sales of the five year-old model range, Lincoln reduced the price of the Continental nearly $600 from 1965 while keeping equipment levels identical.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt;  The marketing decision proved successful; boosted by the introduction of the two-door body style, the model range increased sales by 36%.&lt;ref name="Flory, p.456"&gt;Flory, p. 456.&lt;/ref&gt;

While following much of the 1965 restyling (distinguished largely by a new grille and the addition of "Continental" to the hood), the 1966 Lincoln Continental wore an all new body, growing 5 inches longer (implemented primarily in the rear seats to accommodate more leg room), and nearly an inch taller and wider. Curved side glass made its return (with less obvious [[tumblehome]], to increase interior room). To offer an engine sized comparably to those in the Imperial (440 cubic inches in 1966) and Cadillac (429 cubic inches, 472 cubic inches in 1968), the 430 V8 was enlarged to 462 cubic inches.

The convertible underwent several equipment revisions for the first time, adding a glass rear window and the top mechanism added a second hydraulic pump for opening the convertible roof and the trunklid (making the two systems separate); hydraulic solenoids were deleted from the top mechanism. The interior underwent several revisions, adding a tilt steering wheel and an 8-track tape player as options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1966_Lincoln/1966_Lincoln_Continental_Brochure/1966%20Lincoln%20Continental-16.html|title=1966 Lincoln Continental Brochure|website=Oldcarbrochures.com|accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1967, the Lincoln Continental was given only minor trim updates, with the deletion of the Lincoln star emblem from the front fenders being the largest change. Several functional changes were made, as Lincoln added a number of indicator lights to the dashboard. Along with an oil pressure warning light, the dashboard was given indicator lights for an open trunk and the cruise control (if on).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1967_Lincoln/1967_Lincoln_Continental_Brochure/1967%20Continental-18.html|title=Directory Index: Lincoln/1967_Lincoln/1967_Lincoln_Continental_Brochure|work=oldcarbrochures.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following federal safety mandates, lap safety seatbelts became standard equipment, coupled with an energy-absorbing steering column.

Following years of decreasing sales, 1967 marked the final year of the Lincoln Continental convertible, with only 2,276 sold.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p. 529.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flory, p.530"&gt;Flory, p. 530.&lt;/ref&gt;  After becoming the first four-door convertible sold after World War II, the Lincoln Continental would become the final (as of the 2018 model year) example of its type sold by an American manufacturer. As a result of numerous frame reinforcements (in comparison to the sedan), the 5,712 pound 1967 Lincoln Continental convertible is one of the heaviest passenger cars ever sold by Ford Motor Company.&lt;ref&gt;Gunnell, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1968, several updates were made to the Continental, primarily in response to federal safety mandates. To meet requirements for side marker lights, wraparound lenses were returned to the fenders; the front turn signals were styled similar to the Continental Mark III. The "Continental" wording was removed from the front fascia, replaced by the Lincoln star emblem (as seen on the rear); the hood ornament was deleted, in anticipation of a federal ban on the feature (which never came to effect). For the interior, torso seatbelts were added for the outboard front seats.

Intended as a 1968 introduction, the all-new 460 cubic-inch [[Ford 385 engine|385-series/Lima]] V8 was shared with the Mark III, introduced as an early 1969 model.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Flory, pp. 603 &amp; 679.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the supply of 462 engines was sufficient to last through most of the model year, pushing the introduction of the 460 in the Continental towards the end of the model year.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;''Cars of the Sizzling '60s'', p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1968, Lincoln made several styling changes to the Continental. To meet federal safety standards, the parking lights, taillights, and front turn signals were returned to a wraparound design on the fenders to satisfy Federal standards for side marker lights. For the outboard front seats, shoulder seatbelts were added. The new {{convert|460|cid|l|abbr=on}} [[Ford 385 engine]] was to be available at the beginning of the model year, but there were so many {{convert|462|cid|l|abbr=on}} [[Ford MEL engine]] engines still available, the 460 was phased in later that year.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In April, the new [[Lincoln Continental Mark III|Mark III]] made its debut, as a 1969 model.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Total sales would be down to just 39,134.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Flory, p. 605.&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1969, few changes were made in the final year of production. To comply with federal regulations, the front seats were updated with [[head restraint]]s for the outboard passengers.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''., p.393.&lt;/ref&gt;  The front fascia was updated, with the grille enlarged for the first time since 1965, with the "Continental" wording returning above the grille. Shared with the Mark III, the 460 V8 became the sole engine for the Lincoln Continental, paired with the Ford C6 3-speed automatic transmission.

After a nine-year hiatus, the Town Car name made a return in 1969 as part of an interior trim option package for the Continental.

The Secret Service acquired two versions of the fourth-generation Lincoln Continental for use as a [[Presidential state car (United States)|Presidential state car]], serving from 1961 to 1977.

[[SS-100-X]] is a 1961 Lincoln Continental limousine modified by [[Hess &amp; Eisenhardt]] of [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. Designed as an open car with a series of tops for inclement weather, the car was rebuilt with a permanent roof, armoring, and bulletproof glass following the 1963 [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]]. Subsequently, all United States presidential limousines have been constructed as armored vehicles.

The Secret Service acquired a 1969 Lincoln Continental limousine for Richard Nixon; although an armored vehicle, the limousine roof was designed with a sunroof to allow President Nixon to stand in the vehicle to greet crowds in a motorcade.

===In media===
The fourth generation of Continental is favored by collectors and has appeared in many motion pictures, such as ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'', ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'', ''[[Topkapi (film)|Topkapi]]'', ''[[The Matrix]]'', ''[[Last Action Hero]]'', ''[[Kalifornia]]'', ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', ''[[Hit and Run (2012 film)|Hit and Run]]'', ''[[Animal House]]'', and the [[Inspector Gadget (film)|Inspector Gadget]] films. It has also appeared in the television series ''[[Pushing Daisies]]'', in the opening sequence of the television series [[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|''Entourage'']], and as the vehicle of choice for [[Michael Chiklis]]'s character Vincent Savino in the series ''[[Vegas (2012 TV series)|Vegas]]''. In the CBS television situation comedy ''[[Green Acres]]'' (1965–1971), in which the cars were furnished by Ford, lead character [[Oliver Wendell Douglas]] ([[Eddie Albert]]) is shown driving a 1965 Continental convertible and then in later episodes owns a 1967 model. ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' also drove a fourth generation Continental convertible in many episodes; here too the cars were furnished by Ford. A 1968 variant was also featured as a lead character in the video game [[Interstate '76]].

For the 1970 model year, Lincoln introduced the fifth-generation Lincoln Continental. Building on the success of the Mark III introduced the year before, Lincoln sought to modernize the Continental for the 1970s after a nine-year production run.

Although shorter in wheelbase and slightly narrower than 1958–1960 Lincolns, the addition of 5-mph bumpers make 1977–1979 Lincolns the longest automobiles ever produced by Ford Motor Company.

===Chassis===
The fifth-generation Lincoln Continental is based on body-on-frame construction, the first Lincoln to do so since 1957. To save on its engineering and development costs, the Continental was no longer given its own chassis, instead given a longer-wheelbase version of the Mercury Marquis chassis (stretched from 124 inches to 127 inches; 1974–1979 vehicles received a 127.2-inch wheelbase).

Shared with the LTD and Marquis, the Continental was equipped with coil springs at all four corners. From 1970 to 1974, the Continental was fitted with front disc and rear drum brakes;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1970_Lincoln/1970%20Lincoln%20Continental%20Brochure/1970%20Lincoln%20Continental-07.html|title=1970 Lincoln Continental Brochure|website=Oldcarbrochures.com|accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1975 to 1979, four-wheel disc brakes were available.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Dammann, p. 492.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 460 cubic-inch V8 returned as the standard engine, becoming available from 1970 to 1977; from 1970 to 1972, the 460 remained exclusive to Lincoln. In an effort to increase fuel economy and comply with emissions standards, Lincoln added a 400 cubic-inch V8 for California for 1977, with the 460 remaining available in 49 states. For 1978, the 400 became standard (with the 460 as an option), with the 460 discontinued for 1979. Both engines were paired with the Ford C6 3-speed automatic transmission.

===Body===
In a major departure from its fourth-generation predecessor, the 1970 Lincoln Continental's Marquis-based frame forced the sedan to abandon "suicide doors" for conventional front-hinged doors. As with its predecessor and the Mercury Marquis, the Lincoln Continental was offered as a two-door hardtop and as a four-door "pillared hardtop" sedan (B-pillar with frameless door glass). Unlike Ford or Mercury, no Lincoln two-door convertible was introduced.

Shared with the Mark series, the fifth-generation Continental was equipped with vacuum-operated [[hidden headlamp]]s; as a fail-safe, the headlamp doors were designed to open in the event of failure (a dashboard indicator light indicated their status).&lt;ref name="1970Brochure" /&gt;

===Model timeline===
During its production, the fifth-generation Lincoln Continental was sold in two versions, with a major revision in 1975. Following the downsizing of the full-size General Motors and Chrysler product lines, the Lincoln Continental became the largest mass-market automobile produced worldwide for the 1977 model year. It was surpassed only by purpose-built limousines such as the long-wheelbase version of the Mercedes-Benz [[Mercedes-Benz 600|600]], the Rolls-Royce [[Rolls-Royce Phantom VI|Phantom VI]], and the [[ZIL-4104]]. Following the 1979 downsizing of the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis, the Lincoln Continental was marketed as the final "traditional" or "large" sedan in the United States.

===1970–1974===
For 1970, Lincoln introduced a redesigned Continental two-door, Continental four-door, and Continental Town Car; sold only as a four-door, the Town Car was distinguished by a vinyl roof.

For 1971, the grille underwent a minor styling change, partially in an effort to better distinguish the Continental from the Mercury Marquis. The grille and headlight doors were redesigned, with the latter painted in body color. Rear-wheel ABS brakes (called Sure-Trak) was optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=1971 Lincoln Continental &amp; Mark III |publisher=The Ford Motor Company |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---June/1971-Lincoln-Continental-Mark-III-Brochure-Cdn/1971-Continental-Mark-III-Cdn--08-09 |access-date=2018-06-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612140112/http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---June/1971-Lincoln-Continental-Mark-III-Brochure-Cdn/1971-Continental-Mark-III-Cdn--08-09 |archive-date=2018-06-12 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1972, several functional changes were made, as the 460 V8 decreased in compression; though intended to decrease emissions and adapt to unleaded gasoline, output dropped. The tradition of Lincoln-exclusive engines came to an end, as Mercury began use of the 460 in the Mercury Marquis and Colony Park as an option. Minor styling changes were made, as the grille and the fenders were restyled; to better separate the Continental from the Mark IV, Lincoln reintroduced chrome fender trim. For the first time since 1967, the Continental was equipped with a hood ornament. On the inside, more rear seat legroom was added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---December/1972-Lincoln-Continental-Mk-VI-Brochure/1972-Lincoln-Continental-Mark-IV-02 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220124222/http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---December/1972-Lincoln-Continental-Mk-VI-Brochure/1972-Lincoln-Continental-Mark-IV-02 |archivedate=2016-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1973, the Lincoln Continental was brought into compliance with federal crash regulations as it was fitted with a 5-mph front bumper. While a number of vehicles underwent significant revisions to comply with the regulation, the Continental was able to meet the standard by moving its front bumper several inches forward and fitting it with rubber-tipped impact overriders. The rear bumper was modified in a similar manner, with a 2 1/2&amp;nbsp;mph rating; in total, the Continental gained nearly 5 inches in length.

As a counterpart to the Continental Town Car, a two-door Continental Town Coupe was introduced. In a similar fashion as the Town Car, the Town Coupe was distinguished by its padded vinyl top.

For 1974, the Lincoln Continental was given a new grille, moving from an egg-crate style to a waterfall design. As part of federal regulations, a 5-mph bumper was added to the rear, leading to a redesign of the rear bumper; the taillamps were moved from inside the bumper to above it.

===1975–1979===
After 5 years on the market, Lincoln made an extensive revision to the Continental. Coinciding with the 1975 introduction of the [[Mercury Grand Marquis]], Lincoln and Mercury sought to better visually differentiate their two flagship model lines, in spite of their mechanical commonality. As part of the revision, the Lincoln Continental was able to adopt a greater degree of styling commonality with the Continental Mark IV. For 1975, the exterior of the Lincoln Continental underwent a major revision. Although the body below the beltline saw only minor change with the taillights redesigned with vertical  units, the roofline was completely restyled. To separate itself from the Mark IV, the two-door Continental/Town Coupe adopted a fully pillared roofline with a square opera window in the C-pillar. In place of the pillared hardtop shared with the Mercury Marquis and Ford LTD, the four-door Continental/Town Car adopted a wide B-pillar; to distinguish itself from the [[Cadillac Sixty Special#1971–1976|Cadillac Sixty Special Brougham]]; Town Cars were given the oval opera window introduced on the Mark IV. Along with the styling upgrades, 1975 Lincolns received substantial upgrades to the braking system. Designed by [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix]],&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; the Lincoln Continental became one of the first American cars equipped with a 4-wheel disc brake system (as an option). To further improve the emissions performance of the 460 V8, the engine was fitted with catalytic converters, ending its compatibility with leaded regular gasoline.

For 1976, the exterior remained essentially the same as the year before (marking the first carryover styling year for Lincoln since 1963). In an effort to price the Continental more competitively, Lincoln deleted a number of previously-standard features, making them extra cost options.

For 1977, the Lincoln Continental would undergo another exterior revision. The wide Mercury-style grille was replaced by a narrower Rolls-Royce radiator-style grille, nearly identical to the Mark V (variations of the radiator grille would remain in use on Lincolns through 1997). In another trim revision, the "Continental" script was removed from the rear fenders.

For 1978, the dashboard was updated for the first time, as the Lincoln Continental adopted a revised version of the Mercury Grand Marquis dashboard. In addition to increasing parts commonality, the update was done to save weight; the plastic-frame Mercury dashboard was lighter than the previous steel-frame version. In a similar move, Lincoln redesigned the rear fender skirts, adopting a version that covered less of the rear wheels. Alongside the optional sliding glass sunroof, a fixed glass moonroof with an interior sunshade was introduced (for the first time since the [[Ford Fairlane Crown Victoria Skyliner|1955 Ford Skyliner]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/lincoln/78lin/bilder/11.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1979, the interior underwent further updating, as the Mercury-sourced dashboard received additional wood trim. The 460 V8 was deleted from the Lincoln/ Mark V model line entirely, leaving the 400 V8 as the sole engine.

===Special editions===
Throughout its production, the fifth-generation Lincoln Continental was offered with several special-edition option packages. In contrast to the Mark series, the fifth-generation Continental was not offered with any Designer Series editions.

====Golden Anniversary (1971)====
To commemorate the 50th anniversary of Lincoln in 1971, a ''Golden Anniversary Town Car'' was offered as a limited-edition option package for the Lincoln Continental. Although technically available in any of 25 paint colors available for any Lincoln, the Golden Anniversary Town Car featured an exclusive gold moondust metallic paint color as an option; 1,040 examples were painted in the gold moondust color.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://automotivemileposts.com/lincoln/lincoln1971goldenanniversary.html|title=1971 Lincoln Continental Golden Anniversary Town Car|website=automotivemileposts.com|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All examples were given a color-keyed vinyl roof with a color-keyed leather interior (with trim exclusive to the package).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Other features included a commemorative brochure, a glove compartment vanity mirror, a commemorative plaque on the dashboard, and keys plated in 22 carat gold presented in a jewelry box.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  In total, 1,575 examples were produced; initial production was 1,500 vehicles, with an additional 75 produced exclusively for employees within Ford Motor Company.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

====Williamsburg Edition (1977–1979)====
From 1977 to 1979, Lincoln sold a ''Williamsburg Edition'' Continental Town Car. Intended as a cosmetic option package, the Williamsburg Edition was the only Continental or Town Car sold with two-tone paint;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://automotivemileposts.com/contentslincoln.shtml|title=1952-1979 Lincoln and Lincoln Continental {{!}} AUTOMOTIVE MILEPOSTS|website=automotivemileposts.com|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the edition also standardized a number of options. Along with two-tone paint, the Williamsburg Edition also included a full vinyl roof, pinstriping, power vent windows, lighted vanity mirrors, and 6-way twin "Comfort Lounge Seats".

For 1977, the option package was designed as one of the most conservative versions of the Town Car, without any opera windows or coach lights fitted to the roofline. For 1978 and 1979, the opera windows and coach lights were added to the roofline.

==== Collector's Series (1979) ====
To commemorate the end of production of the Lincoln Continental and Continental Mark V while denoting them as the final "traditional" full-size American sedans and coupes, Lincoln offered a ''Collector's Series'' for both the Continental and Mark V. As with its Mark V counterpart, the Continental Collector's Series was equipped with essentially every available feature as standard equipment. Only four options were available for the Collector's Series: a power moonroof, 40-channel CB radio, "Sure-Track" [[anti-lock brakes]], and a plush Kashmir velour interior (in lieu of leather). The Continental Collector's Series could reach $18,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|18000|1979}}}} in current dollars) when fully equipped; within Ford Motor Company, it was only surpassed by its $22,000 Mark V Collector's Series counterpart at the time.

Along with four options, the Continental Collector's Series was produced in four colors: dark blue, white and limited-issue medium blue (197 built) and light silver (125 built) with a dark-blue vinyl top.

}}With the impending adoption of federal fuel-economy standards ([[Corporate Average Fuel Economy|CAFE]]) making the large cars of the 1970s a potential financial threat to Ford Motor Company, the full-size cars of all of its divisions underwent extensive downsizing for the 1979 model year. For various reasons, delays pushed the release of the downsized Lincoln model lineup into 1980, three years after the downsizing of its Cadillac counterparts. The downsizing undergone by the 1980 Continental and Mark VI provided Lincoln with the best year-to-year fuel economy improvement (38%) in Ford history.&lt;ref&gt;Dammann, p. 528.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of a standard overdrive transmission enabled the division to leap its competitors, going from the company with the worst [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy|CAFE]] rating to the most fuel-efficient full-size car sold.

One of the most touted options the 1980 Continental offered was the new digital instrument cluster, which used vacuum fluorescent displays for the vehicle speedometer, odometer, fuel gauge, and temperature gauge. However, the biggest feature was the included "trip computer" that showed the driver "miles to empty" and (based on driver input) an "estimated time of arrival", as well as real-time average fuel economy figures. The digital instrument cluster with the trip computer, along with the engine's new standard electronic fuel injection, 4-speed AOD transmission, power steering and suspension advances, and the new EEC III engine management system allowed the 1980 Lincoln Continental to gain a major technological advantage over its competition; instead of being just a mere redesign and downsize of the 1979 models, the 1980 Continentals would be some of the most advanced vehicles ever sold by Ford up to that point.

This version of the Continental would last only for a single model year. To eliminate saturation of the Lincoln model line, the car was re-released as the [[Lincoln Town Car]] for 1981, while the Continental name would move to the midsize segment as an early 1982 model. While not officially announced as the replacement for the Versailles, the 1982 Continental would become the Lincoln competitor for the Cadillac Seville. After the end of its model cycle, the Continental Mark VI was replaced by the Mark VII, a far different vehicle.

===Chassis===
Central to the redesign was the adoption of the all-new [[Ford Panther platform]], shared with the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis. While retaining the body-on-frame layout of its predecessor and using a rear-wheel drive powertrain, the Panther platform made major engineering changes to lower curb weight. In addition, the chassis itself was smaller in several key dimensions. While only approximately 2 inches narrower, the 1980 Continental shed 10 inches of its wheelbase and 14 inches in length. In losing nearly 1000 pounds of curb weight, the 1980 Continental came within 200 pounds of the curb weight of the "compact" Lincoln Versailles.

In its focus on fuel economy, the Panther platform was developed without the use of the 400 or 460 V8s powering full-size Lincoln-Mercurys throughout the 1970s. In their place was the first fuel-injected V8 engine produced by Ford Motor Company. Based on the 302 cubic-inch small block V8, the newly christened 129&amp;nbsp;hp 5.0L V8 (rounded up from its true 4.9L displacement) was the first "metric-displacement" American Ford engine. As an option, a 140&amp;nbsp;hp carbureted 351 cubic-inch Windsor V8 was available. In place of the C6 3-speed automatic transmission was an all-new 4-speed Automatic Overdrive Transmission ([[Ford AOD transmission|AOD]]). Developed under the name Ford Integral Overdrive (FIOD), this industry-first transmission featured both a mechanically-engaged [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] (0.67/1 ratio) fourth gear and third and fourth-gear [[torque converter]] lock-up.

The new Panther platform allowed for changes in the new Continental's suspension geometry and many improvements were made to the power steering. With this, and the reduced overall size, the 1980 Lincoln Continental was able to retain the traditional big car ride and feel, while offering a major enhancement to its handling. Compared to the 1980 Continental's GM and Chrysler counterparts and the 1979 Lincoln models, the new car offered more agile maneuvering, as well as a reduced turn diameter by over 8 feet (compared to the 1979 Lincoln Continental).

===Body===
Although sharing a common platform and powertrain with the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis, the Lincoln Continental was well differentiated from its counterparts; no visible body panels were common between the three vehicles. In contrast, the 1980 Continental was positioned as the base model of the Lincoln model line; the Continental Town Car/Town Coupe made its return as the top-trim model. As all Continentals wore padded roofs, Continental Town Cars were largely differentiated by two-tone paint. Lincolns were differentiated from Continental Mark VIs by their exposed headlights and full-width taillamps (instead of a "Continental spare tire trunk"). Two-door Lincolns can be distinguished from Mark VI two-doors with their "notchback" roofline; they share a common wheelbase with four-door Lincolns. {{Clear}}

Following the downsizing and adoption of the Panther platform for the 1980 model year, the Lincoln division was faced with a critical issue. After the discontinuation of the compact [[Lincoln Versailles]] early in 1980, Lincoln was left with two full-size sedans. Although each was brand-new for the model year, the Lincoln Continental and Continental Mark VI were functionally identical vehicles. Aside from the "Continental tire" trunklid, unique rear quarter panels, different taillamps and [[hidden headlamp]]s of the Mark VI, the two vehicles offered little differentiation.

The Lincoln Continental made its return in early 1981 as a 1982 model. To further separate Continental from the Town Car, Lincoln designers shifted the Continental nameplate into the mid-size segment. Only offered as a four-door sedan, the Continental was styled with a "bustle-back" rear end and marketed to compete directly with the [[Cadillac Seville]] and the [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]]. Using the lessons learned from Lincoln Versailles and [[badge engineering]], Lincoln stylists took great care to differentiate the expensive Continental from the Ford Granada and Mercury Cougar sedans sharing the [[Ford Fox platform]] with it; unlike the Versailles, no visible body panels were shared. The Continental shared its wheelbase and powertrain with the [[Lincoln Continental Mark VII|Continental Mark VII]] introduced for the 1984 model year.

Beginning with the 1981 model year, all manufacturers were required to use a 17 character VIN-code. The first three digits is the [[Vehicle identification number|World Manufacturer Identifier]] which gives the make of the car. 1982–1985 Continental 4-door sedans have the separate VIN-code 1MR which designates Continental as the make instead of 1LN as Lincoln (as is the Town Car).
In 1986, the situation was clarified by Ford Motor Company as the Continental was reassigned the 1LN VIN-code to designate Lincoln as the make.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cars Of Lincoln-Mercury|last=Dammann, George H.|first=Wagner, James K.|publisher=Crestline Publishing Co.|year=1987|isbn=978-0912612263|location=Sarasota, Florida|pages=414, 545, 577, 582, 583}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=List of manufacturers of motor vehicles and their trailers - numerical - SV 3.2 |url=https://www.kba.de/SharedDocs/Publikationen/EN/SV/sv32_pdf_en.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=6 |publisher=Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt |location=Germany |date=2018-01-15 |access-date=2019-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chassis===
Shifting from the Ford Panther platform to the [[Ford Fox platform]], the Lincoln Continental became a mid-size car for the first time. In its redesign, the Continental would lose nearly 9 inches in wheelbase and 18 inches in length, along with over 400 pounds of weight. Although it would be the shortest-wheelbase Lincoln ever (at the time), the Continental would use a stretched 108.5" wheelbase version of the Fox platform used by the [[Ford Thunderbird (eighth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]] and [[Mercury Cougar]]. In marked contrast to its Cadillac Seville competitor, which switched to a front-wheel drive GM platform, the Continental retained the use of rear-wheel drive.

The 1982 Lincoln Continental was fitted with two different engines. The standard engine was a 131&amp;nbsp;hp carbureted version of the 5.0L V8. At no cost, a 3.8L V6 (shared with the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar&lt;ref&gt;Flammang, p. 603.&lt;/ref&gt;) was an option; it was the first non-V8 Lincoln since 1948. Both engines were discontinued for the 1983 model year, replaced by the fuel-injected 5.0L V8 from the Town Car. All three engines were fitted with the 4-speed [[Ford AOD transmission|Ford AOD overdrive transmission]]. As a response to the diesel engine options available in Cadillacs and a number of European luxury brands, Lincoln introduced an optional 114-hp 2.4L turbodiesel inline-6 sourced from BMW (with a ZF 4-speed automatic transmission) for 1984. WIth only 1,500 sold, the diesel-powered Continental was rarely ordered and discontinued after the 1985 model year. The seventh-generation introduced two features as industry firsts: gas-charged shock absorbers and self-sealing tires.

For the first time on a Lincoln-badged Continental, its namesake "Continental spare tire trunk" seen on the Mark Series was used as a decklid design feature. In addition, the decklid was lettered "CONTINENTAL" instead of "LINCOLN" (as was the Versailles, the first Lincoln to do so). As Ford Motor Company intended for the Lincoln Continental to compete against the Cadillac Seville, the rear half of the car was designed with a sloping "bustle-back" decklid, drawing inspiration from the [[Lincoln-Zephyr]] of the late 1930s. The decklid design of the Continental proved less extreme than that of the Seville. The addition of a horizontal brushed-chrome strip that ran along each side of Continental, along with plentiful two-tone color combinations, gave it a more conventional appearance in comparison to the Cadillac.

Coinciding with the introduction of the two-door Continental Mark VII, the Lincoln Continental was given a styling update for the 1984 model year. The body was fitted with flush-fitting front and rear bumpers and revised taillamps. While not fitted with the composite headlights of the Mark VII, the front fascia of the Continental was revised with an angled grille flanked by recessed quad headlamps and larger wrap-around marker lights incorporating cornering lamps, which made it more aerodynamic looking. On the inside, the doors and dashboard were fitted with satin-black trim (accented with low-gloss genuine walnut veneer for the 1986 model year only). Other changes through the rest of production run were primarily limited to paint colors and upholstery pattern details. The car continued thereafter with few changes. All models were also fitted with Ford's door-mounted Keyless Entry System, not to be confused with a [[Remote keyless system|Remote Keyless Entry System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = 1982 Lincoln Continental-16-17|url = http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Lincoln/1982-Lincoln/1982-Lincoln-Continental-Brochure/1982-Lincoln-Continental-16-17|website = oldcarbrochures.org|accessdate = 2015-09-09|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160107075145/http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Lincoln/1982-Lincoln/1982-Lincoln-Continental-Brochure/1982-Lincoln-Continental-16-17|archivedate = 2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trim===
For 1982, the Continental was offered in base trim, Signature Series, and Givenchy Designer Series trim. For 1983, the Signature Series trim was discontinued and given to the Town Car and Mark VI; the Valentino Designer Series was added. After the 1985 model year, the Valentino Designer Series was discontinued in favor of the Givenchy Series. Including many additional standard features, the Signature Series, Valentino, and Givenchy Designer Series Continentals added $3,100 to $3,500 to the price of a standard model. Fully optioned Signature and Givenchy models would top out at over $26,500 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|26500|1982}}}} in current dollars).

By the late 1980s, the luxury segment in which the Continental competed had changed drastically from a decade before. In addition to traditional competitors Cadillac and Chrysler, the Continental now competed against [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[BMW]], and [[Audi]] as well as the top of the line vehicles of [[Acura]], [[Lexus]], and [[Infiniti]]. In anticipation Lincoln had chosen to completely reinvent the Continental, starting with development of eighth generation model in the 4th quarter of 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d0LnCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=en53+1987+ford&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2iRBfpPpcP&amp;sig=ACfU3U1qtiQ9ibFDXbMdAo-nxv7NW6f61g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjb1N2hnp7gAhVPZawKHVUqBXIQ6AEwCHoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=en53+1987+ford&amp;f=false|title=The Perpetual Enterprise Machine: Seven Keys to Corporate Renewal Through Successful Product and Process Development|first1=H.

This Continental became the first front-wheel drive Lincoln and the first Lincoln since 1948 sold without an available V8 engine. As part of a more conservative exterior, the sloping  "Continental trunklid" was deleted. Although four inches longer, it was 170 pounds lighter than its predecessor. For the first time since 1980, the Continental closely matched its [[Cadillac de Ville series#1985–1993|Cadillac Sedan de Ville]] counterpart in size.

By interior volume the Continental was the largest front-wheel drive car sold in 1988, and was recognized by ''[[Car and Driver]]'' on its 1989 [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]]. Power was provided by a 140&amp;nbsp;hp 3.8L Essex V6 newly introduced to the Taurus/Sable for 1988. An exclusive feature to the Continental was adaptive air-ride suspension and variable assist power steering was standard. In 1990 (MY 1991), engine output was revised to 155&amp;nbsp;hp, and to 160&amp;nbsp;hp for MY 1993. All Continentals were equipped with a 4-speed overdrive automatic transmission.

===Body===
While the exterior of the Continental adopts many of the flowing lines, including the flush-mounted glass, flush-mounted headlights, and wraparound doors of its counterparts alongside the Taurus, it also adopts several more conservative styling features, including a more upright C-pillar, chrome grille, and long deck, and the redesign of the sloping trunklid increased trunk space from 15 to 19 cubic feet (nearly matching the Town Car).

In October 1988 for 1989 model year, a redesigned dashboard was introduced to accommodate dual air bags. This unprecedented move made the Ford Motor Company the first US automaker to offer airbags as standard equipment for both the driver and front passenger (the second automaker worldwide after Porsche's 1987 944 Turbo).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1988/Ford-Offers-Airbags-For-Passengers-As-Standard-Equipment/id-79d97f461ef138ab538726bf1b418ead|title=Ford Offers Airbags For Passengers As Standard Equipment|work=apnewsarchive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 for the 1990 model year, a minor exterior update featured a new grille, hood ornament, and taillights. In late 1993 for MY 1994, a larger facelift was given, including new bumpers, rocker moldings, and bodyside moldings. Exterior trim was redesigned including a restyled argent-colored grille, redesigned taillamps, revised decklid trim, and the Lincoln nameplate is moved onto the grille and taillamps. The bucket seat option was given a redesigned steering wheel.

===Trim===
As part of the redesign, Lincoln simplified the trim lineup; only standard (later named "Executive") and Signature Series remained. 
For the first time since 1981, 6-passenger seating made its return. Leather seats were standard (with velour available as a no-cost option). Major options included a compact disc player, [[InstaClear]] electrically heated windshield (1988–1992), JBL sound system, power glass moonroof, [[keyless entry]], anti-theft alarm system, cellular phone (starting MY 1990), three-position memory seat, and choice of wheels. For model year 1993 (1992 production), an "Individual Seats" group was available which ditched the usual chrome column shifter and 50/50 "comfort lounge" split bench seating (and 6-passenger capacity) for a center console with floor shifter (a Continental first), storage armrest, cup holder, and 5 seats. 1994 was the last year that the Continental was offered in Executive and Signature Series trims. An Executive Touring package was also available.

{{clear}}

===50th Anniversary Edition (1990)===
A 50th Anniversary Edition Continental Signature Series was offered during MY 1990 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the model. It featured "50th Anniversary" badging, geometric spoked aluminum wheels with unique center hub ornaments, titanium exterior paint with unique red/blue accent striping, and two-toned interior.

For the 1995 model year, the Continental was substantially updated with more rounded lines similar to the Mark VIII and launched on December 26, 1994;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=thTtrQVR8EIC&amp;pg=PA554&amp;lpg=PA554&amp;dq=lincoln+continental+fn74&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mto5vCH9Hc&amp;sig=ACfU3U2ivIWKEVw70Yuu6DwPv6dB_uih4A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiVrPys-53gAhVS7qwKHfzGB3AQ6AEwE3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=lincoln+continental+fn74&amp;f=false|title=The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook: Strategies and Tools for Building a Learning Organization|first1=Peter M.|last1=Senge|first2=Art|last2=Kleiner|first3=Charlotte|last3=Roberts|first4=Richard B.|last4=Ross|first5=Bryan J.|last5=Smith|date=February 16, 1994|publisher=Currency, Doubleday|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; the interior also saw a major overhaul. Production commenced at Wixom Assembly in November 1994. While the body was all-new, the new Continental shared underpinnings with the previous generation. In a departure from the previous generation and its Ford/Mercury counterparts, the Continental was given back its V8 engine for the first time since 1987 and more closely matched the [[Northstar V8]] engine that Cadillac was using for its DeVille and Seville sedans at the time. The base price for the new Continental was $40,750 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|40750|1995}}}} in current dollars).

[[File:1996 Lincoln Continental 4.6L rear 9.11.18.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of 1995–1997 Lincoln Continental]]
The sole engine for the Continental was the Modular/InTech 32v DOHC 4.6L V8 shared with the Lincoln Mark VIII, but slightly de-tuned for front wheel drive use. It produced {{convert|260|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|265|lb·ft|Nm|abbr=on}} torque; {{convert|0|-|60|mph|abbr=on}} was reached in 7.2 seconds. Inside, the Continental featured a plush leather interior with many amenities and advanced electronics for the time. Some of the options included JBL sound system, 6-CD changer, power moonroof, heated seats, onboard cellular phone, anti-theft alarm system, traction control, and chrome wheels. As before, buyers could choose between five and six-passenger seating, offering [[Bridge of Weir]] leather on upper trim packages. A March 1992 customer clinic video features a final design prototype of the 1995 Continental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjL2hpl9JBc|title=FN74 Team Visioning Overview (Voice over early 1990s)|date=11 March 2013|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1995–1996 Continentals had [[air suspension|air ride suspension]] on all four wheels while the 1997 model had rear air suspension and traditional steel coil springs up front. An increasingly competitive luxury market and decontenting of the 1997 Continental saw its base price decreased by 10% that year.

===1998 facelift===
[[File:Lincoln Continental 09-12-2019.jpg|alt=1998-2002 Lincoln Continental photographed in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada|left|thumb|1998-2002 Lincoln Continental]]
The Continental was updated again in late 1997 for 1998 with redesigned front and rear end styling. The front-end also held a strong family resemblance to the newly redesigned 1998 Town Car. Also new for 1998 was a dashboard redesign, though still keeping the reflective dash cluster. Despite these notable changes, pricing on the Continental was up only slightly over the 1997 model which itself had seen a price reduction from the year before.

For 1999, the Continental once again saw only a modest price increase to [[suggested retail price|MSRP]] $38,525 — the same price as the Town Car. The Continental offered buyers front wheel drive, while the Town Car remained rear wheel drive, and was joined by the slightly smaller [[Lincoln LS]]. This generation Continental gained seat-mounted side airbags and even more power (now up to {{convert|275|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. Six-passenger capability was still available via the no-charge option of a split-bench front seat and column shifter. Also available on the 1999 Continental was the "RESCU package" (Remote Emergency Satellite Cellular Unit) which included Global satellite positioning (similar to GM's "OnStar"), 3-channel [[HomeLink]] compatible garage door opener mounted in the driver's sun visor, voice-activated cellular telephone, and the Alpine audio system (which included a digital sound processor, subwoofer amplifier, and additional speakers). One could also opt for the 6-disc CD changer, heated front seats, and a tinted glass power sunroof with sliding shade. New for 1999 was an extra-cost "Luxury Appearance Package" that included a wood-trimmed steering wheel and shift knob with unique two-tone seat trim and floor mats inside, and chrome alloy wheels and a special grille up front. Other available packages were the "Driver Select System" which included a semi-active suspension, selectable ride control, steering wheel-mounted controls for the audio and climate systems, automatic day/night outside mirrors, the "Memory Profile System" that recalled power steering assist and ride control settings for two drivers, and the "Personal Security Package" which included special [[run-flat tire]]s mounted on polished alloy wheels, low tire pressure alert system, and universal garage door opener.

Between the 2000 and 2002 model years, changes to the Continental remained relatively minor as production of the model eventually came to an end. In 2000, various safety features became standard including child seat-anchor brackets, emergency trunk release, and "Belt Minder" system. In 2001, the universal garage door opener was now standard. A new Vehicle Communication System (VCS) featuring hands-free voice activated phone, Safety and Security Services (SOS), information services, and route guidance assistance was optional for 2002.

===Special Editions===
For 1996, Lincoln offered two special editions of the Continental. To commemorate the 75th anniversary of Lincoln, a ''Diamond Anniversary Edition'' of the Continental was offered as an option package. The package included "Diamond Anniversary" badging, leather seats, voice-activated cellular phone, JBL audio system, auto electrochromatic dimming mirror with compass, and traction control. As a continuation of the version offered the year before on the Town Car, Lincoln offered a ''Spinnaker Edition'' of the 1996 Continental. The option package featured "Spinnaker Edition" badging, tri-coat paint, two-toned leather seats, and 16" spoked aluminum wheels.

For 2001, a ''Limited Edition'' was offered, featuring unique leather interior with "Limited" embroidery, two-toned interior trim, wood steering wheel, 6-disc CD changer, and 16" spoked aluminum wheels. It was sold as a Greenbrier Limited Edition Continental in select markets.

To commemorate the end of the model run for 2002, a ''Collector's Edition'' was offered featuring a genuine walnut burl steering wheel, instrument panel, and side door trim, "CE" logos, platinum painted grille, 10-spoke chrome wheels, and more. In addition to the Continental's other exterior color choices, a CE-exclusive charcoal gray was also available. Approximately 2,000 were produced.

===Cancellation and replacement===
After several years of declining sales, Lincoln announced that 2002 would be the last year for the Continental. Along with declining sales of the model line, Lincoln faced a significant model overlap as the Continental, LS V8, and Town Car competed in nearly the same price range. As the LS V8 was a mid-size sport luxury sedan and the Town Car was a full-size luxury sedan, the Continental was withdrawn, with the final ninth-generation vehicle rolling off the Wixom Assembly production line on July 26, 2002.

After 2002, the Continental was not directly replaced. For 2009, Lincoln introduced the MKS; while intended to replace the Town Car (which remained until 2011), the MKS was closer in length and width to the ninth-generation Continental and based on a front-wheel drive chassis (with all-wheel drive as an option). In place of a V8 engine, the MKS offered a twin-turbocharged V6 as an option. For the 2017 model year, the MKS was replaced by the new tenth-generation Continental.

In the fall of 2016, after a fourteen-year absence from the Lincoln model line, a new tenth generation Continental went on sale.&lt;ref name="Lincoln Media Center"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://media.lincoln.com/content/lincolnmedia/lna/us/en/continental.html|title=2017 Continental {{!}} Lincoln Media Center|publisher=Ford Motor Company|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previewed by a namesake concept car at the [[New York International Auto Show#2015|2015 New York Auto Show]], the 2017 Lincoln Continental is the successor of the [[Lincoln MKS]]. The Continental is manufactured in Flat Rock, Michigan, alongside the Ford Mustang. This is the first Continental generation since 1958 that is not assembled at the Ford Motor Company [[Wixom Assembly Plant]].

===Chassis===
The tenth-generation Lincoln Continental is based upon the [[Ford CD4 platform]]. Shared with the Ford Fusion (Mondeo) and Lincoln MKZ, the Continental shares an extended-wheelbase CD4 chassis with the seventh-generation Ford Taurus. At 117.9 inches (5.7 inches longer than the Fusion/MKZ), the Continental is the longest-wheelbase Lincoln sedan produced since 1979 with the exception of the long wheelbase L Town Cars. While front-wheel drive is standard, this generation marks the first use of all-wheel drive on a Lincoln Continental, but depending on trim, all-wheel drive is either optional or standard equipment.

While sharing its fundamental chassis underpinnings with the Lincoln MKZ, the Continental is powered exclusively by V6 engines. As a standard engine, a 305&amp;nbsp;hp 3.7L Ti-VCT V6, shared with the MKZ and MKS. As an option, a 335&amp;nbsp;hp 2.7L twin-turbocharged V6 is available, shared with the Lincoln MKX. At the top of the engine lineup, the Continental is fitted with a {{Convert|400|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.0L twin-turbocharged V6; exclusive to the Continental and MKZ, the 3.0L engine is the highest-horsepower engine ever fitted to a production Lincoln car (Navigator SUV is available with {{Convert|450|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.5L twin-turbo V6 ).{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} All three engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. When fitted with the 3.0L engine, all-wheel drive (with [[torque vectoring#All-Wheel Drive Vectoring|torque vectoring]]) is standard equipment.

===Body===
Deriving much of its exterior from the 2015 Lincoln Continental concept car, the tenth-generation Continental introduced a new design theme for the Lincoln division, shifting from the previous split grille to a rectangular design, with a slightly recessed grille. Standard equipment includes electronically-latched doors, marketed as "E-Latch", to pulls the door closed. Interior door panels use a button near the door pull handle to unlatch the door;&lt;ref name="Lincoln Media Center" /&gt; on the outside, the exterior door pulls are integrated into the [[Beltline (automotive)|beltline window trim]].

In place of a console or column-mounted transmission shifter, control of the transmission was changed to "PRNDS" buttons mounted to the left of the infotainment/navigation touch screen. "S" represents "Sport mode", where the suspension, power steering, and transmission shifting are programmed for more spirited driving. While largely done in an effort to increase center console space, the layout is a similar approach to [[Chrysler PowerFlite transmission|Chrysler]] and [[Ultramatic#1956: Ultramatic and Touchbutton Ultramatic|Packard]] designs of the 1950s (though the Continental is also fitted with paddle shifters as standard equipment). As an option, the Continental is available with either 13 or 19-speaker audio systems from the "Revel" division of [[Harman International Industries|Harman]], distinguished by aluminum speaker grilles in the door panels. As with the Lincoln MKS, the Continental is fitted with adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping technology, as an option, the Continental offers a 360-degree camera system to produce a "virtual overhead view" of the vehicle.&lt;ref name="media.lincoln.com"&gt;https://media.lincoln.com/content/dam/lincolnmedia/lna/us/2016/01/12/effortless-power-fact-sheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trim ===
In line with current Lincoln product offerings, the Lincoln Continental is offered in three standard trims, Premiere, Select, and Reserve. In continuing with Lincoln tradition, [[Bridge of Weir]] "Deepsoft" leather is used for upper-level trim (Select and Reserve).&lt;ref&gt;https://media.lincoln.com/content/dam/lincolnmedia/lna/us/2016/01/12/serenity-fact-sheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As a flagship trim level, Lincoln revisits the tradition of the 1970s [[Lincoln Continental Mark IV#Continental Mark IV designer editions|Designer Editions]] for the "Black Label" Continental.  As with the Designer Editions, the Black Label vehicles have specially-coordinated exterior and interior appearance packages, including Rhapsody Blue (exclusive to the Continental), Chalet, and Thoroughbred.    

====80th Anniversary Coach Door Edition====

==Concept cars==

===2002 (Los Angeles Auto Show)===
[[File:2002 Lincoln Continental concept car.jpg|thumb|2002 Lincoln Continental concept (2002 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance)]]
Unveiled at the [[LA Auto Show#2002|2002 Los Angeles Auto Show]], the 2002 Lincoln Continental concept served as one of the first projects of Lincoln under [[Premier Automotive Group|PAG]].&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/1174/Lincoln-Continental-Concept.html|title=Lincoln Continental Concept|website=ultimatecarpage.com|accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Combining traditional and advanced design features, the concept is a full-size sedan (at 214.3 inches long, it is an inch shorter than a 2002 Town Car&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimatecarpage.com//spec/1174/Lincoln-Continental-Concept.html|title=2002 Lincoln Continental Concept Specifications|website=Ultimatecarpage.com|access-date=2019-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;) with design features intended to maximize passenger and cargo space.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  The concept is powered by a {{Convert|414|hp|0|abbr=on}} 6.0L V12, paired to a 6-speed automatic transmission sending power to the rear wheels.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

To ease passenger access, the Continental utilizes rear-hinged coach doors (in line with 1960s Lincolns); to further increase cabin space, a 136.6 inch wheelbase is used, effectively centering the passenger compartment.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

While the 2002 concept never reached production, certain design elements were adapted in other Lincoln vehicles, as its roofline was adapted by the 2006 Lincoln Zephyr (later MKZ) and its front fascia was adapted by the 2007-2010 MKX.  {{Clear}}

Between the concept vehicle and the production 2017 Continental, were several differences; the concept vehicle was fitted with a glass roof and four-seat interior that were not included for production.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  The production Continental has larger side view mirrors, larger air intakes in the front fascia, and red-colored brake lights.

The '''Lincoln Navigator''' is a [[full-size]] [[luxury SUV]] marketed and sold by the [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln]] brand of [[Ford Motor Company]] since the 1998 model year. Sold primarily in North America, the Navigator is the Lincoln counterpart of the [[Ford Expedition]]. While not the longest vehicle ever sold by the brand, it is the heaviest production Lincoln ever built. It is also the Lincoln with the greatest cargo capacity and the first non-limousine Lincoln to offer seating for more than six people.

Lincoln Navigator production was sourced from 1997 to 2009 at the [[Michigan Assembly Plant]] in [[Wayne, Michigan]]. Since 2007, production has also been sourced from the [[Kentucky Truck Assembly|Kentucky Truck Plant]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].

== Background ==
At the end of the 1980s, in the United States, sport-utility vehicles gradually began to transition from dedicated off-road vehicles towards dedicated family vehicles, similar to station wagons.  In 1991, the [[Jeep Wagoneer (SJ)|Jeep Grand Wagoneer]] ended its 28-year production run.  However, by the time of its discontinuation, the vehicle had gained a famous reputation for its high content, featuring the same content as a luxury sedan.  Following its official entry into the United States in 1987, the [[Range Rover Classic|Range Rover]] was upgraded in trim corresponding with its higher price.

As a response, General Motors introduced the [[Oldsmobile Bravada]] in 1990, convincing several other manufacturers to introduce mid-size luxury SUVs. As full-size SUVs such as the [[Chevrolet Suburban]] and [[Ford Expedition]] are highly profitable vehicles, the Lincoln Navigator came to life.

The Lincoln Navigator was launched on July 1, 1997 for the 1998 model year, with the first vehicle rolling off the assembly line on May 14, 1997.&lt;ref name="theautochannel.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/press/date/19970514/press002443.html|title=Lincoln Navigator Rolls Out With Large Order Bank|date=May 14, 1997|accessdate=February 28, 2009|work=theautochannel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/date/19970610/news003273.html|title=Lincoln Navigator (1998) Debuts Sans Jackie Stewart.|date=June 10, 1997|work=The Auto Channel|author=Maloney, Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based directly on the [[Ford Expedition]], introduced the year before, the Navigator gave the Lincoln-Mercury division its first full-size SUV (slotted above the Ford Explorer-based [[Mercury Mountaineer]]).

In its first calendar year of sales (1998), Navigator contributed to an unprecedented event of recent decades – with Lincoln overtaking perennial rival [[Cadillac#Competition with Lincoln - Escalade|Cadillac]] in annual sales volume. Initially, published figures indicated that Cadillac had outsold Lincoln by a scant 222 vehicles sold, thanks to an enormous surge in Cadillac Escalade sales in December 1998, from hundreds in previous months to almost 5,000. A subsequent audit resulted in a retraction/apology in May 1999, attributing the "error" to "overzealous" "low-level" employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/may/06/business/fi-34467|title=Cadillac Apologizes to Lincoln for Inflating Sales Numbers – Los Angeles Times|last=O'Dell|first=John|date=May 6, 1999|publisher=Articles.latimes.com|accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chassis ===
The Lincoln Navigator was also developed under the Ford program code name UN173, with the Expedition developed under the UN93 program code name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/in/frankquenneville|title=Frank Quenneville|date=|publisher=LinkedIn|accessdate=October 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A full-size body-on-frame vehicle, the Navigator was mechanically related to the Ford Expedition; both vehicles were related to the [[Ford F-Series tenth generation|1997 Ford F-Series]]. The Navigator featured independent front suspension (short-long arm/SLA); the rear suspension was of a live rear axle design. Using an optional feature from its Ford counterpart, the Navigator was designed with load-leveling [[air suspension]]; tuned primarily for ride comfort, the air suspension lowered itself when the vehicle was parked.

Although technically available with rear-wheel drive, the primary drivetrain on the Lincoln Navigator was [[ControlTrac]], a computer-controlled automatic four-wheel drive system. As with the Expedition, the Navigator was fitted with four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes.

Using the same 230&amp;nbsp;hp 5.4L Triton V8 as the Expedition/F-150 paired with the 4-speed 4R100 automatic transmission, the 1998 Lincoln Navigator came with a towing capacity of {{convert|7700|lb||0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, Jeff. "One-Year Test Verdict: 1998 Lincoln Navigator." ''Motor Trend''. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; During 1999, Lincoln would fit two different engines in the Navigator in an effort to better match full-size SUVs from General Motors. At the beginning of the model year, the Triton V8 was upgraded to 260&amp;nbsp;hp; as a running change during the model year, Lincoln would replace the SOHC Triton with a 300&amp;nbsp;hp DOHC 5.4L V8, named InTech (borrowing a name from the Mark VIII).  Due to the increase in power, towing capacity would increase to over {{convert|8500|lb|abbr=on}}.

=== Body ===
Although the Lincoln Navigator shares the same bodyshell as the Ford Expedition, giving it a similar exterior appearance, Lincoln stylists would make many design changes to differentiate the two vehicles.  Forward of the windshield, the Lincoln Navigator shares no body panels with its Ford counterpart, with its own front fascia (a grille design shared with the 1998 Lincoln Town Car and the 2000 Lincoln LS), wheels, roof rack, lower body trim, and taillights.  The interior of the two vehicles shared more commonality, with the dashboard common to both vehicles (with greater use of wood trim); the Navigator was given its own seat design.  To make for a quieter interior over the Expedition and Ford F-Series, the Navigator made greater use of sound deadening materials and higher-quality carpeting.

The Lincoln Navigator included standard features available or optional on the Expedition, including power driver and passenger bucket seats, 2nd-row bucket seats (with a 2nd-row bench seat as a delete option), floor consoles, and keyless entry.  The few options available included a power moonroof, a universal garage door opener, 7 seven to 8 eight passenger seating an electrochromic rearview mirror (filtering out headlight glare from vehicles seen in the mirror), and a premium audio system (a seven speaker, 290-Watt audio system with a 6-disc front console-mounted CD-changer, and rear seat audio controls), and 17-inch alloy wheels.&lt;ref&gt;"1998 Lincoln Navigator Review." The Car Connection. 2008. http://www.thecarconnection.com/fullreview/lincoln_navigator_1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the unique features on the first-generation Navigator were power-adjustable pedals (a first-of-its-kind feature on a luxury SUV), a feature on the factory radio that only illuminated the controls necessary for the selected function, full controls for the audio system, climate controls, and cruise controls on the front of the steering wheel, and rear seat radio and climate controls. 

During its production run, Lincoln made few changes to the first-generation Navigator.  In 1999, alongside the addition of the InTech V8, power-adjustable brake and accelerator pedals were added; the previously optional 17-inch wheels became standard.

For 2000, the fender-mounted radio antenna was integrated into the right-rear window, while the interior received  ''Nudo'' leather seating surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/products/model.cfm?vehicle_id=19 |title=2000 Navigator Overview |year=2000 |publisher=Ford Motor Company |work=Ford Media |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051104143838/http://media.ford.com/products/model.cfm?vehicle_id=19 |archivedate=November 4, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The options list expanded to include a satellite navigation system, heated and cooled front seats, a reverse-sensing system, and side-impact [[airbag]]s.

For 2001, several minor cosmetic changes were made.  On the grille and tailgate, the Lincoln emblem was given a black background (replacing the previous red); on the tailgate, the Lincoln and Navigator badging switched sides. A [[VHS|VHS-based]] video entertainment system became an option.

Launched in May 2002 for 2003&lt;ref&gt;https://www.automotive-fleet.com/11341/ford-motor-co-reports-may-2002-us-retail-sales-of-3299031&lt;/ref&gt;, a number of changes and improvements were made to the Navigator thanks to a thorough redesign. The Navigator continued to share a platform with the [[Ford Expedition]], which was also redesigned for 2003, but continued to differ from it in terms of styling and various upscale features. The redesign featured a thoroughly revised exterior, the first since the Navigator's launch, with only the front doors and roof panel unchanged from the previous generation. The new exterior came with things such as a larger chrome waterfall grille, brighter quad-beam headlights with larger housings, revised chrome door handles set in color-keyed bezels, and slightly wider running boards. Inside the Navigator was an all-new instrument panel and dashboard area which, significantly, was not shared with the Expedition. Inspired by the symmetrical, "dual-cockpit" layout of the 1961 [[Lincoln Continental]], the instrument panel and dashboard area was adorned with real walnut burl wood inserts and panels and switches painted with a low-luster satin nickel color. Adding to the upscale interior design further were white [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]], 120 in all, which provided backlighting for controls and switches. Additionally, to direct attention to the high-quality satin nickel-faced [[analog clock]] mounted in the dashboard, an articulating door is present to conceal the radio head unit and optional satellite navigation system when they are not in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Ford Motor Company |work=Ford Media |title=2003 Lincoln Navigator – Distinctive Design, Incomparable Luxury |year=2003 |url=http://media.ford.com/products/presskit_display.cfm?vehicle_id=644&amp;press_subsection_id=420&amp;make_id=93}}{{Dead link|date=August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Highlighting the Navigator's design changes were other new features and options for 2003. Newly available features like Ford's ''Safety Canopy'' side curtain airbags and a tire pressure monitoring system improved occupant safety. Convenience was enhanced by the availability of power running boards (an industry first), power-folding third row seats, a power liftgate, and [[High-intensity discharge lamp|HID headlights]] (for top end models). The available rear-seat video entertainment system was updated to be [[DVD|DVD-based]] and all Navigators now came with standard 18x7.5-inch alloy wheels with 18x8-inch chrome wheels available as an option.

Like the redesigned 2003 Expedition (U222), the Navigator benefited from a reworked chassis, new [[rack and pinion|rack-and-pinion]] steering, and an all-new [[independent suspension|independent rear suspension]] (IRS), which brought better handling and ride comfort. The Navigator continued to benefit from a load-leveling air suspension but it now lowered the vehicle by an inch when stopped in the interest of easing entry and exit. The Navigator's powertrain was modified from the UN173, but the 5.4&amp;nbsp;L DOHC V8 used before was no longer advertised under the InTech name. But it now produced {{convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5500 rpm and {{convert|355|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 3750 rpm. Due to changes brought with the redesign, the Navigator's base curb weight increased to {{convert|5760|lb||0|abbr=on}} in two-wheel drive models and nearly {{convert|6000|lb|abbr=on}} in four-wheel drive models. In turn, towing capacity dropped slightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Ford Motor Company |work=Ford Media |title=2003 Navigator Specifications |year=2003 |url=https://runbidsell.com/resources/2003-navigator-specifications/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tire-pressure monitoring was made standard for 2004 while Ford's ''AdvanceTrac'', a type of [[traction control system]], with [[Electronic stability control|Roll Stability Control]] was an option. In 2004, for 2005 the Navigator received a minor facelift with new square-shaped foglights replacing the circular ones used previously. AdvanceTrac with RSC was now standard while HID headlights were available on all models. In the interest of cost effectiveness, the 5.4&amp;nbsp;L DOHC V8 introduced in the 1999 model year was replaced by the same [[Ford Modular engine#5.4|5.4&amp;nbsp;L 3-valve SOHC V8]] that had been available in the [[Ford F-Series|F-150]] since the 2004 model year. Though having a different head design, the new engine offered similar overall output, producing {{convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5000&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|365|lbft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque at 3750&amp;nbsp;rpm. The new engine was not marketed under the ''Triton'' name in the Navigator even though it is mechanically identical to the F-150's engine. The 4R75W 4-speed automatic transmission used from 2003 until 2004 was replaced with a new [[ZF Friedrichshafen AG|ZF]]-sourced 6-speed automatic transmission. The 2005 Navigator's base curb weight fell to {{convert|5555|lb||0|abbr=on}} while four-wheel drive models dropped to {{convert|5842|lb||0|abbr=on}}. Towing capacity increased slightly over the previous model year to {{convert|8600|lb||0|abbr=on}} in two-wheel drive models and {{convert|8300|lb||0|abbr=on}} in four-wheel drive models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Ford Motor Company |work=Ford Media |title=2005 Navigator Specifications |year=2005 |url=http://media.ford.com/products/presskit_display.cfm?vehicle_id=1112&amp;press_section_id=398&amp;make_id=93 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051119100520/http://media.ford.com/products/presskit_display.cfm?vehicle_id=1112&amp;press_section_id=398&amp;make_id=93 |archivedate=November 19, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2006, an ''Elite'' package for the ''Ultimate'' trim level was made available, including a DVD-based satellite navigation system with a voice-activated touch screen, [[THX]] audio system, rear-seat DVD entertainment system, and HID headlights.

[[File:2007 Lincoln Navigator SWB.jpg|thumb|left|2007–2014 Lincoln Navigator (SWB model)]]
[[File:Lincoln Navigator rear.JPG|thumb|left|2007–2014 Lincoln Navigator L (LWB model)]]

The Navigator was redesigned under the U326 program code name, with new styling and mechanical features for 2007. Unveiled at the [[Chicago Auto Show]] in February 2006, the Navigator featured its most distinctive styling update since its introduction with new front and rear fascias and side cladding. In front was a split upper and lower chrome grille with integrated fog lights resembling those of classic Lincolns like the 1946-1948 [[Lincoln Continental|Continental]], along with an all-new, more complex headlight design, and a more prominent "power dome" hood. Elsewhere, an updated rear fascia featured taillights inspired by the [[Lincoln Zephyr/MKZ|Lincoln MKZ]] and chrome trim was more prominently used along the Navigator's sides, including chrome lower body molding on the doors. The distinctiveness of the Navigator's exterior followed into the interior, highlighted by an all-new dashboard and instrument panel. These areas saw an extensive use of rectangular shapes, such as in the gauges, as well as greater use of real wood and satin nickel accents.

Accompanying the Navigator's redesign for 2007 was a new model, the '''Navigator L''' developed under the U418 program code name. Comparable to the [[Cadillac Escalade|Cadillac Escalade ESV]], the Navigator L is {{convert|14.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} longer than the standard Navigator on a {{convert|12|in|mm|0|abbr=on|sing=on}} longer wheelbase, increasing its cargo capacity. The Navigator L was introduced parallel to the Expedition EL, an extended version of the [[Ford Expedition]]. Both the Navigator and Expedition were redesigned for 2007 and based on Ford's [[Ford T platform|T1 platform]], which is related to the same platform that the 2004+ [[Ford F-Series|F-150]] is based on. Compared to the Navigator's previous platform, the new platform provides greater rigidity for better driving dynamics. The [[independent suspension|independent rear suspension]] has been replaced with a new five-link IRS design to further enhance handling and ride quality. The Navigator continued to come with standard 18-inch alloy wheels but both 20- and 22-inch wheels are now available. The [[Ford Modular engine|5.4&amp;nbsp;L 3-valve SOHC V8]] introduced in the 2005 Navigator remained unchanged for 2007. The [[ZF Friedrichshafen]] 6-speed automatic transmission was replaced by Ford's own 6-speed design, the [[Ford 6R transmission|6R80]] for the 2009 model year. Due to the Navigator's redesign, its base curb weight increased to {{convert|5872|lb|abbr=on}} in two-wheel drive models and {{convert|6070|lb||0|abbr=on}} in four-wheel drive models. Navigator L models were even heavier at {{convert|5963|lb|abbr=on}} in two-wheel drive models and {{convert|6221|lb|abbr=on}} in four-wheel drive models. In spite of this, thanks to their improved frame, the Navigator's towing capacity increased for 2007, approaching {{convert|9000|lb|abbr=on}} in two-wheel drive models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Ford Motor Company |work=Ford Media |title=2007 Navigator Overview |year=2007 |url=http://media.ford.com/products/presskit_display.cfm?vehicle_id=1379&amp;press_subsection_id=421&amp;make_id=93 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810120358/http://media.ford.com/products/presskit_display.cfm?vehicle_id=1379&amp;press_subsection_id=421&amp;make_id=93 |archivedate=August 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 2007 model redesign, the Navigator no longer uses the same [[transfer case]] as the Expedition. Expedition four-wheel drives continue to use a two-speed dual range transfer case with off-road low range [[reduction gearing]] and default off-road program that [[Engine control unit|remaps]] (reprograms) the [[electronic throttle control]] and [[traction control system]] response for off-road conditions. Navigator four-wheel drives have been demoted to a light-duty one-speed single range transfer case which lacks low range gearing.

For 2008, packaging for the Navigator's luxury and convenience features was simplified, resulting in the elimination of the perennial ''Luxury'' and ''Ultimate'' trim levels and the standardization of a number of features that were previously optional. Some of these newly standard features included heated and cooled front seats, power-folding third row seats, a power liftgate, and a 600-Watt 14-speaker [[THX]] II-Certified audio system. Also newly standard was a 3.31:1 rear axle ratio, though a 3.73:1 ratio was still available as option for the Navigator and remained standard in the Navigator L. Newly available was a rearview camera to aid in backing up.

For 2009, the Navigator's 5.4&amp;nbsp;L V8 gained {{convert|10|hp|kW|abbr=on}} as well as [[Flexible-fuel vehicle|flex-fuel]] capability. The rearview camera that was new for 2008 was now standard, as were heated second row seats, ''Front Park Assist'', a capless fuel filler, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and [[Ford Sync|Lincoln SYNC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Ford Motor Company |work=Ford Media |title=2008 Navigator Overview |year=2008 |url=http://media.ford.com/products/presskit_display.cfm?vehicle_id=1947&amp;press_subsection_id=421&amp;make_id=93 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third generation Navigator and Navigator L continued to be offered for the 2010 model year, with only slight changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mehta, Sajeev |title=Review: 2010 Lincoln Navigator L |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/contents/20090508/review-lincoln-navigator-l.htm |work=ibautos.com |publisher=International Business Times |date=May 8, 2009 |accessdate=June 18, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621075420/http://www.ibtimes.com/contents/20090508/review-lincoln-navigator-l.htm |archivedate=June 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2011, both the Navigator and the Navigator L feature [[HD Radio]], Sirius TravelLink, and Lincoln SYNC as standard on all trims.&lt;ref&gt;[https://junkcarwizard.com/resources/2011-lincoln-navigator/ 2011 Lincoln Navigator]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2013 model year, the only changes made to the Navigator were the addition of new color trims: Kodiak Brown Metallic Tri-Coat, Midnight Sapphire Metallic, and Ruby Red Metallic Tinted Clearcoat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.lincoln.com/images/10031/2013_Navigator.pdf 2013 Lincoln Navigator]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from media.lincoln.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 model year was a carryover from 2013 with the same features and no cosmetic changes. This would be the last model year that it would feature the front grille fascias.

===2015 refresh===
[[File:Lincoln-Navigator-L.jpg|thumb|Refreshed 2015 Lincoln Navigator]]
In March 2013, Ford had confirmed reports that the next generation Lincoln Navigator would not be a repackaged Ford Expedition as the previous generations were, despite trailing the MKX in terms of sales but ahead of the MKT, but hopes to make it more competitive in the luxury SUV segment as they prepare to take on the [[Cadillac Escalade]], [[Infiniti QX80]], and the [[Mercedes-Benz GL-Class]], each of which had already or would launch new generations within 2013 or 2014,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wot.motortrend.com/lincoln-navigator-to-drop-v8-for-ecoboost-v6-expedition-may-get-v6-and-v8-340245.html#axzz2Z2rAGoU4 "Lincoln Navigator to Drop V-8 for EcoBoost V-6, Expedition May Get V-6 and V-8"] from Motor Trend (March 11, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; and would be designed by the new Lincoln design team that also designed the new 2013 MKZ. It would be completely new and would feature the 3.5 [[Ecoboost]], new interior and exterior and performance upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2013/03/12/next-lincoln-navigator-to-drop-v8-in-favor-of-v6-but-ford-exped/ "Next Lincoln Navigator to drop V8 in favor of V6, but Ford Expedition might get both"] from Autoblog (March 12, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; But in May 2013 a prototype Navigator with a different front grille was tested featuring the EcoBoost in preparation for the updated Navigator,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wot.motortrend.com/caught-lincoln-navigator-prototype-spied-343857.html#axzz2Z2rAGoU4 "Caught: Lincoln Navigator Prototype Spied"] from Motor Trend (May 20, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; which was followed by more spy shots taken in September 2013 that was sporting Lincoln's updated signature front grille.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trucktrend.com/future/spied/163_news130918_2015_lincoln_navigator_spied_testing/ 2015 Lincoln Navigator Spied Testing On Public Roads] From Truck Trend (September 18, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 22, 2014, three photos of the 2015 Navigator were released on [[Twitter]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/CliffordAtiyeh/statuses/426072162370609153 from Twitter] posted January 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Instagram]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://instagram.com/p/jdSIKSomIn/ From Lincoln Motor Co.] posted January 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; along with an announcement that the refreshed SUV would be revealed at the [[Washington Auto Show]] the following day (January 23, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/kicking-tires/post/2015-lincoln-navigator-first-look/2014/01/23/828bff9c-83ec-11e3-a273-6ffd9cf9f4ba_blog.html "2015 Lincoln Navigator: First Look"] from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' (January 23, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; However, hours after the leaks were made public, Lincoln held a press event in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] for the vehicle&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freep.com/article/20140123/BUSINESS0102/301230027/Ford-2015-Lincoln-Navigator-Expedition-auto "2015 Lincoln Navigator gets new look"] from ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' (January 23, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; and revealed the updated Navigator earlier than expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6licT8RkQY|title=2015 Lincoln Navigator SUV|first=|last=Carscoops|date=January 22, 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 Navigator and Navigator L kept the same exterior styling design as the Expedition instead of the reported repackaging that was announced earlier by Ford. However, it now featured an updated front grille with the rear tailgate lights bearing a resemblance to the [[Dodge Durango]]. The EcoBoost V6 engine is the only engine offered for the 2015 model year and makes {{Convert|380|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|460|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The exterior included HID headlamps with LED running lights and full LED taillights. Twenty-inch wheels came standard, replacing the 18-inch wheels, while a reserve package featured 22-inch wheels. The dashboard panels features MyLincoln Touch with Sync as a standard and controlled through an eight-inch, touchscreen display in the dash, and home to twin 4.2-inch displays that flank a central speedometer, falling in line with the rest of the Lincoln models. The push-button start became standard, likewise a passive entry and a rear-view camera. The blind-spot monitoring was added as an optional feature.

Both the refreshened and redesigned Navigator and Navigator L went into production in the Summer of 2014, and arrived to dealers in the fall of 2014 as a 2015 model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2014/01/23/2015-lincoln-navigator-redesign-ecoboost-v6/ "2015 Lincoln Navigator puts on a brave face, offers EcoBoost V6 only"] from Autoblog (January 23, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carscoops.com/2014/01/2015-lincoln-navigator-teased-debuts-on.html "2015 Lincoln Navigator Teased, Debuts on Thursday, Gets 3.5L V6 EcoBoost"] from Carscoops (January 22, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 12, 2017, the fourth-generation 2018 Lincoln Navigator was introduced at the [[New York International Auto Show#2017|2017 New York Auto Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carscoops.com/2017/04/watch-out-escalade-lincoln-teases-all.html|title=Watch Out Escalade: Lincoln Teases All-New 2018 Navigator Ahead Of NY Show|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   As with previous generations, the fourth-generation remains the Lincoln counterpart of the Ford Expedition, offered in both a standard and long-wheelbase configuration (Lincoln Navigator L).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.autonews.com/article/20170412/OEM04/304129982/lincolns-2018-navigator-lighter-faster-and-more-spacious "Lincoln's 2018 Navigator lighter, faster and more spacious"] from Automotive News (April 12, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;  As before, both two and four-wheel drive versions are offered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

The fourth generation marked a significant shift in the exterior styling of the Navigator, as it adopted styling features of the 2017 Lincoln Continental.  In another major shift, the model line adopted aluminum body construction.  

=== Chassis ===
The fourth-generation Lincoln Navigator uses the [[Ford T platform#T3|Ford T3 platform]], developed under the U554 code name.  Retaining body-on-frame construction, the Lincoln Navigator (and Ford Expedition) were engineered alongside the [[Ford F-Series (thirteenth generation)|2015 Ford F-150]].  The four-wheel independent suspension configuration was retained, with a redesigned rear suspension layout.  

Shared with the Ford F-150 Raptor, the Lincoln Navigator is equipped with a 450 hp twin-turbocharged [[Ford EcoBoost engine#3.5-L (second generation)|3.5L EcoBoost V6]] (although Lincoln has ended its use of the EcoBoost nomenclature).  The highest-output engine ever sold by Lincoln, the 3.5L V6 is paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission (replacing the previous 6-speed automatic).

=== Body ===
Entering production with only minor differences from the Lincoln Navigator concept vehicle shown at the [[New York International Auto Show#2016|2016 New York Auto Show]] (no inclusion of the [[Gull-wing door|gullwing doors]] and stair-style running boards, used largely for display purposes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/lincoln-navigator-concept/42460/ "Lincoln Navigator SUV concept opens wide in New York"] from Gizmag (March 23, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;).  The 2018 Lincoln Navigator adopted several design features from the 2017 Lincoln Continental, including the style of its headlights, taillights, side vents, and its front fascia, with a large rectangular grille and a centered Lincoln star emblem.  While sharing its roofline and side doors with the Ford Expedition, in the style of [[Range Rover|Range Rovers]], the B, C, and D-pillars are blacked out for a "floating roof" effect.  

As with the 2015 Ford F-150, the body of fourth-generation Lincoln Navigator (and Ford Expedition) was designed as a part of a shift to aluminum body construction, with the use of steel largely reserved for the chassis frame rails.  Nearly 200 pounds lighter than the previous generation, the fourth-generation Navigator is physically larger than its predecessor, with the standard-wheelbase configuration gaining three inches in wheelbase, while the long-wheelbase L gaining nearly an inch (becoming the longest-wheelbase Lincoln ever produced excluding the Mark LT pickup).  In terms of body length, both versions were shortened approximately half an inch.  

Shared with the Lincoln Continental, the dashboard of the 2018 Lincoln Navigator replaced a conventional console (or column)-mounted shifter with dashboard-mounted buttons and paddle shifters.  For the first time in the model line, the fourth-generation Navigator offers a head-up display along with a 12-inch reconfigurable instrument cluster.

=== Trim ===
The fourth-generation Lincoln Navigator continues the same trim line introduced in the 2015 model update, with Premiere (new to the Navigator for 2018) as the standard trim, Select as the mid-level trim, and Reserve as the highest trim level.  

Alongside the revival of the Continental, the fourth-generation Navigator marked the debut of the Lincoln Black Label series.  A series of vehicles with interiors and exteriors coordinated around a theme (similar to the Designer Series Lincolns and Continentals of the 1970s and 1980s), the Navigator is sold with three Black Label themes: Chalet, Destination, and Yacht Club.  

At a base price of approximately $95,000, the Black Label edition of the Lincoln Navigator is the most expensive vehicle ever sold by Ford Motor Company (with the exception of the [[Ford GT]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecarconnection.com/news/1111150_2018-lincoln-navigator-destination-still-all-about-the-journey "2018 Lincoln Navigator Destination still all about the journey"] from The Car Connection (June 21, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
On January 14, 2018, The Lincoln Navigator was awarded Truck of the Year at the 2018 [[North American International Auto Show]], marking the first time that a Lincoln vehicle has been given a NAIAS award, as well as the first American-built Luxury Sport Utility Vehicle in this segment to win in this category.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/mark-phelan/2018/01/15/lincoln-navigator-truck-year-detroit-auto-show/1033464001/ “Is 2018 Lincoln Navigator really a truck?

In production since 2007, the MKX ("X" stands for "crossover") is the first [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover SUV]] offered by the Lincoln brand; it is currently in its second generation.  Initially the smallest Lincoln SUV, it is now slotted between the MKC and the MKT.  The Lincoln counterpart of the [[Ford Edge]] [[Crossover (automobile)|CUV]] across both generations, the MKX has been the best-selling Lincoln model line since 2016.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The first-generation MKX was produced from 2007 to 2015, based upon the [[Ford CD3 platform|CD3 platform]].  The second generation is currently in production, based on the [[Ford CD4 platform|CD4 platform]].  As Lincoln is phasing out its use of "MK" model names, as part of a mid-cycle update for the 2019 model year, the MKX adopted the '''Lincoln Nautilus''' nameplate.&lt;ref name="lincoln-nautilus-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://media.lincoln.com/content/lincolnmedia/lna/us/en/news/2017/11/28/new-lincoln-nautilus.html|title=New Lincoln Nautilus Pairs Powerful Performance with Driver-Assist Technologies That Inspire Confidence|date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Both generations of the MKX (and Nautilus) were manufactured at [[Oakville Assembly]] in [[Oakville, Ontario]], Canada alongside the Ford Edge, Ford Flex, and Lincoln MKT.

==Development==
The Lincoln MKX made its first appearance as the [[Lincoln Aviator]] [[concept car|concept vehicle]] at the [[North American International Auto Show#2004|2004 North American International Auto Show]] as a successor to the first generation Aviator. The concept vehicle was smaller and more car-like with a V6 that was rated at {{Convert|245|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|240|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}. The Aviator Concept also differed from the production model stylistically and with its panoramic sunroof. The production model received the '''MKX''' nameplate, with Lincoln management suggesting a "mark ex" pronunciation during the 2006 auto show circuit, which was then changed to the phonetic ''M-K-X''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cars.com/kickingtires/2006/07/lincoln_mkx_mkz.html |title=Lincoln Dealer Confusion Forces Model-Name Changes |publisher=Blogs.cars.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the similarity of the MKX name to the MDX name used by Acura for their competing luxury crossover, [[Honda]], Acura's parent company, filed a lawsuit against Ford in January 2006, eventually settling the case out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=109081 |title=Honda Takes Ford to Court Over SUV Name |publisher=Insideline.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427062405/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId%3D109081 |archivedate=2006-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 MKX debuted in December 2006 as a rebadged variant of the [[Ford Edge]]. In addition to the chrome grille, the MKX's front fascia features projector-beam headlight assemblies with standard chrome-accented fog lights mounted in the lower fascia. The MKX features an optional  [[Adaptive headlamp|adaptive headlight]] system that pivots the aim of the light projectors to match the steering inputs of the driver. In the rear, the MKX features dual chrome exhaust tips and brake lights backlit by [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]] with a light bar that crosses the MKX's liftgate. The optional sunroof, marketed as a ''Panoramic Vista Roof'', is the production version of the glass roof feature shown on the 2004 Aviator Concept. The Vista Roof features a forward power sunroof and a fixed rear moonroof with dual power sunshades.

Like the Edge, which shares the powertrain, the MKX's engine produces {{Convert|265|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,250&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{Convert|250|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,500&amp;nbsp;rpm; noticeable improvements over what the Aviator Concept's engine was rated at. The MKX, Edge, and Lincoln MKZ were the first recipients of Ford's 3.5&amp;nbsp;L Duratec V6. Front-wheel drive versions of the MKX come with a {{Convert|19|usgal|L impgal|0|abbr=on}} fuel tank while all-wheel drive models come with a {{Convert|20|usgal|L impgal|0|abbr=on}} fuel tank. The MKX has a base curb weight of {{convert|4220|lb|kg||abbr=on}} when front-wheel drive only and {{convert|4420|lb|kg||abbr=on}} when equipped with all-wheel drive.&lt;ref name="specs"/&gt;

For 2008 changes for the MKX included Lincoln badges added near the front doors as well as [[Ford Sync]], ''Limited Edition'' and ''Monochromatic Limited Edition'' packages with unique styling elements and 20-inch chrome wheels, and a voice-activated DVD navigation system. Previously optional features that were now standard included AdvanceTrac with RSC, a reverse sensing system, Sirius satellite radio, the THX II-Certified audio system, heated and cooled front seats, and driver and passenger power lumbar supports. No major changes were made for the 2009 MKX.

===Refresh (2011–2015)===
[[File:Lincoln MKX -- 11-10-2011.jpg|thumb|2011–2015 Lincoln MKX]]
For the 2011 model year, the MKX was refreshed with a new interior, a new front-end resembling the 2010–2012 MKZ, a new rear end and a 3.7-liter [[Overhead camshaft#Dual overhead camshaft|DOHC]] V6 which boosts the MKX's power up to {{convert|305|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|280|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.

The 2011 MKX featured the first application of the all-new [[MyLincoln Touch]] driver connect technology system.

===Lincoln MKX (2016–2018)===

[[File:Lincoln MKX (12).JPG|thumb|left|Lincoln MKX concept at the 2014 Beijing Auto Show]]
The second generation Lincoln MKX was revealed as a concept vehicle at the 2014 [[Auto China|Beijing Auto Show]]. The production model was revealed at the [[North American International Auto Show#2015|2015 North American International Auto Show]] and officially went on sale in the fall of 2015 as a 2016 model. The base price remained similar to the 2015 MKX at just over $38,000.

The Lincoln MKX features Bi-Xenon HID Projector Headlights, LED Daytime Running Lights, LED Fog Lights, LED Taillights, or Full Adaptive LED Headlights with LED Amber Turn Signals, LED Daytime Running lights, LED Taillights, and LED Fog Lights which replaces the standard Bi-Xenon Headlights if the Lincoln MKX is equipped with Luxury Package. The standard engine is the [[Ford Duratec engine#Duratec 3.7|Duratec 3.7]] [[V6 engine|V6]] rated at {{convert|303|bhp|kW||abbr=on}} at 6500&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|278|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 4000&amp;nbsp;rpm. The optional engine is the all new [[Ford EcoBoost engine#2.7 L EcoBoost V-6|Ecoboost]] V6 that produces {{convert|335|bhp|kW||abbr=on}} at 5500&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|380|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3000&amp;nbsp;rpm. Trim levels include Premiere, Select, Reserve and top level Black Label, which is three special appearance packages, a tradition started with the [[Lincoln Continental Mark IV#Continental Mark IV designer editions|Designer Editions]] in 1976. The MKX offers the "Thoroughbred" (shared with the [[Lincoln MKZ|MKZ]] and the [[Lincoln Continental#Tenth generation (2017–present)|Continental]]), "Modern Heritage", and "Indulgence" theme appearance packages.

[[File:2016 Lincoln MKX 3.7L rear 6.15.18.jpg|thumb|left|Lincoln MKX rear view]]
The transmission is no longer activated with a center console installed [[gear stick#Electronic gear shifts|transmission selector]]; the computer controlled transmission uses buttons installed to the left of the MyLincoln Touch infotainment touch screen labeled "P, R, N, D, S", a revival of an approach used in the 1950s by the [[Chrysler PowerFlite transmission|Chrysler push button PowerFlite]] and the [[Ultramatic#1956: Ultramatic and Touchbutton Ultramatic|Packard Touchbutton Ultramatic]]. The "S" transmission selection represents "Sport" mode, where the Continuously Controlled Damping suspension, electric power steering and transmission shift points take on a different posture.

=== {{anchor|Nautilus}}Lincoln Nautilus (2019–present) ===
[[File:2019 Lincoln Nautilus "Reserve" 2.7L front 4.22.19.jpg|left|thumb|Lincoln Nautilus, front view]]
[[File:2019 Lincoln Nautilus "Reserve" 2.7L rear 4.22.19.jpg|left|thumb|Lincoln Nautilus, rear view]]
For the 2019 model year, the second-generation MKX underwent a mid-cycle revision, taking on the '''Lincoln Nautilus''' nameplate.&lt;ref name="lincoln-nautilus-1" /&gt; Adopting the design language of the newly introduced Continental and Navigator, the Nautilus transitioned from the previous split-wing grille to a large rectangular grille with a large Lincoln star emblem.

The counterpart of an updated Ford Edge, the Nautilus is slotted between the Aviator and the [[Lincoln MKC|MKC]] (which, in a parallel move, will be known as the Corsair from 2020). A 245 hp 2.0L [[Ford EcoBoost engine|EcoBoost]] inline-four is the standard engine, with a 335 hp 2.7 L [[Ford EcoBoost engine|EcoBoost]] V6 from the MKX as an option; both engines are fitted with [[start-stop system|start-stop capability]]. An 8-speed automatic transmission is paired to both engines (replacing the previous 6-speed).

The '''Lincoln MKS''' is a full-sized luxury [[sedan (car)|sedan]] that was manufactured and marketed by the [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln]] subdivision of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] from 2009 to 2016. First shown at the [[LA Auto Show#2007|LA Auto Show]] in November 2007, the MKS began production for the 2009 [[model year]] at Ford's [[Chicago Assembly]] plant in May 2008 with sales beginning a month later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://wot.motortrend.com/6251732/auto-news/lincoln-mks-orders-start-strong-car-is-do-or-die-debut/index.html |title=Lincoln MKS orders start strong, car is "do-or-die" debut |work=Motor Trend |date=June 2, 2008|accessdate=June 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The MKS was the second Lincoln to adopt the "MK" nomenclature and the first model to wear it through its entire production run.  With the discontinuation of the [[Lincoln Town Car]] in 2011, the MKS at 205.6-inches in length became the longest production sedan sold by an American automaker through 2016.

Sharing the [[Ford D3 platform]] with the fifth and [[Ford Taurus (sixth generation)|sixth-generation Ford Taurus]], the Lincoln MKS offered front-wheel drive with optional [[all-wheel drive]] (a first in a full-size Lincoln).  Shared with the [[Ford Taurus SHO|Taurus SHO]], the 3.5L [[EcoBoost]] twin-turbocharged V6 became the first turbocharged gasoline engine in a Lincoln.&lt;ref name="EcoBoost"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Ford to Equip Half a Million Vehicles with EcoBoost Engine Technology for Up To 20% Better Fuel Economy|date=January 6, 2008|url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=27455|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728152234/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=27455|archivedate=July 28, 2013|website=Media.Ford.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lincoln MKS was discontinued after the 2016 model year and replaced by the new [[Lincoln Continental#Tenth generation (2017–present)|Lincoln Continental]].&lt;ref name="autonews-2015-03-30"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20150330/OEM04/303309964/lincoln-to-bring-back-continental-name?cciid=email-autonews-blast|title=Lincoln to bring back Continental name|last=Bunkley|first=Nick|date=March 30, 2015|work=Automotive News|accessdate=June 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2006 MKS Concept==
The Lincoln MKS made its first appearance as a [[concept car]] at the [[North American International Auto Show#2006|2006 North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. The MKS Concept provided a preliminary view of the design direction that Lincoln was taking for their new [[Full-size car|full-size]] flagship sedan of the same name.

The MKS included Lincoln's signature waterfall grille with a crosshatching that was later used in the grille for the 2007-2009 [[Lincoln MKZ]]. The concept car's headlights featured ''adaptive lighting'' that pivoted the headlight projectors in concert with steering inputs. The headlight assemblies incorporated a series of [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]] that would blink in sequence for turn indication. Side vents at the rear of the front wheel wells were adorned with the Lincoln star. The MKS Concept featured a large sunroof and moonroof combination that takes the place of a conventional roof. The MKS Concept's rear were LED-based parking and brake lamps and dual chrome, trapezoidal-shaped exhaust tips. The MKS Concept rode on 20x8.5-inch, ten spoke wheels.&lt;ref name="concept"&gt;{{cite press release |title=2006 MKS Concept Overview |website=Media.Ford.com |date=January 9, 2006 |url= http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=1372&amp;item_id=4260&amp;press_section_id=2870 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110525183229/http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=1372&amp;item_id=4260&amp;press_section_id=2870 |url-status= dead |archive-date= May 25, 2011 |accessdate=2009-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MKS Concept seats were covered in cream-colored [[Aniline leather]] while the doors and interior panels were covered in pearl-white [[suede]]. The dashboard was covered in dark grey suede. Instrumentation and controls featured satin nickel inserts and chrome trim with backlighting provided by white LEDs. An [[applique]] of real [[maple]] wood ran across the instrument panel, dividing it into upper and lower sections. Features included [[Bluetooth]] device connectivity, a [[DVD]]-based navigation system, a 14-speaker, 500-[[watt]] audio system, a passive entry system that identifies the driver and allows starting the vehicle by carrying its key fob, and a push button ignition system. Safety was provided by dual front [[airbag]]s, driver and passenger side airbags, and side curtain airbags.&lt;ref name="concept"/&gt;

The MKS Concept was based on Ford's [[front-wheel drive]], [[Volvo]]-derived [[Ford D3 platform|D3]] [[Automobile platform]] that was already in use in the then-[[Ford Five Hundred]], [[Ford Taurus X|Ford Freestyle]], and [[Mercury Montego]] (the version used for the MKS in particular was coded ''D385''). It has independent suspension with [[MacPherson strut]]s and rearward-facing lower L-arms with a stabilizer bar in the front and a multilink coil over shock setup with a stabilizer bar in the rear. The MKS Concept featured an active [[Four-wheel drive|all-wheel drive]] system. Powering the MKS Concept was a [[Volvo B8444S engine|Ford/Yamaha]] 4.4&amp;nbsp;L [[DOHC]] [[V8 engine|V8]] producing 315&amp;nbsp;hp (235&amp;nbsp;kW) at 4500&amp;nbsp;rpm and 320&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (433&amp;nbsp;N·m) of torque at 3000&amp;nbsp;rpm. The engine was mated to a 6-speed [[automatic transmission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=2006 MKS Concept Technical Specifications |website=Media.Ford.com |year=2006 |url=http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=1372&amp;item_id=4259&amp;press_section_id=2878 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525183237/http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=1372&amp;item_id=4259&amp;press_section_id=2878 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-05-25 |accessdate=2009-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production version of the Lincoln MKS was unveiled to the public in November 2007 at the [[LA Auto Show#2007|LA Auto Show]]. Sales began in the summer of 2008 as a 2009 [[Model year|model]]. The front [[Fascia (car)|fascia]] of the production version received a new grille, a chrome, split-wing design. The trapezoidal-shaped chrome exhaust tips of the MKS Concept were replaced with more common circular chrome tips.&lt;ref name="int/ext"&gt;{{cite press release|title=MKS Showcases Signature Lincoln Design Cues |website=Media.Ford.com |year=2008 |url=http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=1678&amp;item_id=5443&amp;press_section_id=2869 |accessdate=2009-09-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424214635/http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=1678&amp;item_id=5443&amp;press_section_id=2869 |archivedate=April 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production MKS uses leather seating surfaces, [[thermoplastic olefin]] door and interior panels, as well as [[leatherette]] for the top of the dashboard. The [[maple]] wood instrument panel applique from the concept car was replaced with [[Ash tree|olive-ash]] or [[ebony]] wood.&lt;ref name="int/ext"/&gt;

The MKS was the first series production Lincoln with [[radar]] [[autonomous cruise control system]]. Other features include intelligent access system with a push button start, a keyless entry keypad that is mounted flush inside the driver-side B-pillar with buttons that only appear when touched, and optional adaptive [[High-intensity discharge lamp|HID]] headlights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=2009 MKS Special Features |website=Media.Ford.com |year=2008 |url=http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=1678&amp;item_id=5444&amp;press_section_id=2879 |accessdate=2009-09-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501043202/http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=1678&amp;item_id=5444&amp;press_section_id=2879 |archivedate=May 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other features include automatic HID headlights, foglights, an ''Easy Fuel'' capless fuel filler, foldable power adjustable mirrors with memory, 18x7.5-inch machined aluminum wheels, a 6-speaker audio system with an AM/FM radio and 6-disc in-dash CD changer, [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius]] satellite radio with a six-month prepaid subscription, dual-zone automatic climate control, an auto-dimming rear view mirror with compass, 12-way, heated and cooled power driver and passenger seats, heated rear seats, a power tilt and telescoping steering wheel with memory, a universal garage door opener, and [[Ford Sync|Lincoln SYNC]].

Safety features include dual front [[airbag]]s, driver and passenger side airbags, and side curtain airbags. Three equipment packages include the ''Navigation Package'' (a DVD navigation system, a [[THX]] II-Certified, 14-speaker, 600-watt audio system with an AM/FM radio and six-disc in-dash CD player, and a rearview camera); ''Technology Package'' (adaptive HID headlights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, a forward-sensing system{{clarify|date=January 2015}}, a power sunshade for the rear window, and the intelligent access system with push button start); the ''Ultimate Package'' includes everything in the Navigation and Technology packages and a dual panel moonroof, premium 19x8-inch painted alloy wheels, ''Ultimate'' seating trim with color-keyed suede strip in the center of the seat back, and a Lincoln Star logo embroidered into the front seat headrests; an ''Aluminum Applique Package'' (aluminum dash trim in the place of wood, as well as a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob), is also available but requires the Navigation, Technology, or Ultimate packages. Options include [[Four-wheel drive|all-wheel drive]], 19x8-inch machined aluminum wheels, 20x8-inch polished aluminum wheels, adaptive cruise control, and a ''PowerCode'' remote starter.&lt;ref name="specs"&gt;{{cite press release|title=2009 MKS Technical Specifications |website=Media.Ford.com |year=2008 |url=http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=1678&amp;item_id=5486&amp;press_section_id=2878 |accessdate=2009-09-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424214819/http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=1678&amp;item_id=5486&amp;press_section_id=2878 |archivedate=April 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Active Park Assist, a system which uses [[ultrasonic sensor]]s to find and measure a parking space, then operate the steering wheel to accomplish the [[parallel parking]] task, will be available in mid-2009 as an option on the 2010 MKS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=29625 |title=Ford makes parallel parking a breeze with new 'Active Park Assist' |website=Media.Ford.com |date=April 6, 2009 |accessdate=2009-09-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826123648/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=29625 |archive-date=2009-08-26 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; This feature is accomplished by using [[software]] control of the [[Electric Power Steering]] (EPS) system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=30019 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715033151/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=30019 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 15, 2012 |title=Ford builds on electric power steering technology to enhance drive quality, enable more features |date=March 12, 2009 |website=Media.Ford.com |accessdate=2009-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production MKS rides on Ford's [[Ford D3 platform|D3]] [[Automobile platform|platform]]. The MKS features an independent suspension with [[MacPherson strut]]s and rearward-facing lower L-arms with a {{convert|26|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} stabilizer bar in the front and a multilink coil over shock setup with stamped steel lower control arms and cast upper control arms in the rear; "Lincoln Drive Control" with [[continuously controlled damping]] (CCD) available as optional feature. The car features four-wheel [[Anti-lock braking system|antilock]] disc brakes ({{convert|12.25|in|mm|adj=on}} rotors in the front and {{convert|12.75|in|mm|adj=on}} rotors in the rear) with standard ''AdvanceTrac'' [[Traction control system|traction control]] and [[Electronic stability control|Roll Stability Control]] (RSC). Front-wheel drive (FWD) is standard while all-wheel drive (AWD) is optional. In a significant departure from the MKS Concept and past Lincoln flagship sedans, the production MKS does not offer a V8 engine. In the place of the 4.4&amp;nbsp;L [[Ford Yamaha V8 engine#Volvo 4.4L V8|Ford/Yamaha]] V8 found in the MKS Concept, the production MKS is powered by an all-aluminum 3.7&amp;nbsp;L [[Ford Duratec engine|Duratec]] [[DOHC]] V6, a larger bore derivative of the Duratec 35 and a member of Ford's [[Ford Cyclone engine|Cyclone]] engine family. The engine was designed to accept either regular grade, 87 [[Octane rating|octane]] gasoline or premium grade, 91 octane gasoline. Using regular grade gasoline, the 3.7&amp;nbsp;L V6 produces 273&amp;nbsp;hp (204&amp;nbsp;kW) at 6250&amp;nbsp;rpm and 270&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (366&amp;nbsp;N·m) of torque at 4250&amp;nbsp;rpm. Using premium grade gasoline results in a small boost in output to 275&amp;nbsp;hp (205&amp;nbsp;kW) at 6250&amp;nbsp;rpm and 276&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (374&amp;nbsp;N·m) of torque at 4250&amp;nbsp;rpm. Power from the MKS' V6 is transmitted to the wheels via Ford's [[GM-Ford 6-speed automatic transmission|6F50]] 6-speed [[automatic transmission]]. The transmission is equipped with ''SelectShift'' which simulates the operation of a [[manual transmission]].&lt;ref name="specs"/&gt; A road test by ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine of an AWD-equipped MKS recorded acceleration from [[0 to 60 mph|zero to 60 mph]] in 7.5 seconds and a [[Dragstrip|quarter-mile]] in 15.7 seconds at {{convert|90|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Testers noted the MKS' heavy weight of over 4300&amp;nbsp;lbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bedard|first=Patrick |title=2009 Lincoln MKS AWD - Road Test |magazine=Car and Driver |date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford introduced its [[EcoBoost]] V6, an all-aluminum, twin-[[Turbocharger|turbocharged]], [[Gasoline direct injection|direct injection]] 3.5&amp;nbsp;L DOHC V6, in the 2010 MKS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=30369 |title=EcoBoost debut: Fuel-efficient new V6 engine gives flagship Lincoln MKS the power of a V8 |website=Media.Ford.com |date=May 14, 2009 |accessdate=2009-09-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618040657/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=30369 |archivedate=June 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; arriving in showrooms in the summer of 2009.&lt;ref name="EcoBoost"/&gt;

===2013 facelift===

}}
The facelifted 2013 MKS debuted at the [[Los Angeles International Auto Show#2012|2012 Los Angeles International Auto Show]], with a mildly refreshed exterior and interior (front "Multicontour" seats) as well as safety updates such as auto high beam, adaptive cruise control, [[forward collision warning]], [[blind spot information system]] with cross-traffic alert, and lane-keeping system.  The new MKS also grew slightly in overall length to {{convert|205.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, making it the longest domestic production sedan.

==Reception==
A reviewer from Canada's ''[[National Post]]'' gave the MKS a positive reception in a comparison test with the [[Cadillac STS]] and [[Infiniti M]]45, two cars that Ford picked to bring along.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Booth |first=David |title=Preview: 2010 Lincoln MKS |date=May 22, 2009 |work=National Post |url=https://nationalpost.com/cars/story.html?id=1618759 |accessdate=2009-09-10 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MKS has dimensions comparable to the 2010 [[Audi A8]] 4.2 FSI quattro, a sedan with all-wheel drive which is equipped with a naturally aspirated 4.2 L V8 engine with direct gasoline injection. The MKS is almost an inch longer than the A8L (long-wheelbase version), an inch wider and five inches (127&amp;nbsp;mm) taller, has four more cubic feet of trunk space, and extra {{convert|25|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque, while being {{convert|100|lb|abbr=on}} lighter. The MKS starts at $30,000 less than the base A8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/buy/2010-Lincoln-MKS/expert-review/ |title=2010 Lincoln MKS |publisher=Autoblog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While praised for its large interior and long list of luxury features, the MKS has been criticized for not being as refined as other luxury sedans in a similar price range. It is also noted that the MKS's platform-mate, the [[Ford Taurus]], offers the same powertrain and many available technological features, starting at an MSRP of $10,000 less than the MKS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.edmunds.com/lincoln/mks/2010/ |title=2010 Lincoln MKS Reviews |website=Edmunds.com |date=March 9, 2010 |accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of production==
Due to declining sales, the Lincoln MKS was replaced by a new car based on the [[Lincoln Continental#Tenth generation (2017–)|Lincoln Continental]] concept in 2016.&lt;ref name="autonews-2015-03-30" /&gt; The Chicago Assembly Plant where the MKS was produced continued to manufacture the [[Ford Taurus]] (until March 2019). The plant continues to build the [[Ford Explorer]] and Police Interceptor vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kelsey|last=Mays |url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2015/06/11/lincoln-mks-ford-killed/71059740/ |title=Ford is killing off the Lincoln MKS sedan |newspaper=USA Today |date=June 11, 2015 |accessdate=June 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1951 Lincoln Cosmopolitan.JPG|thumb|left|1951 Lincoln Cosmopolitan convertible]]In 1949, Lincoln introduced its first postwar bodies, also marking the first product lines of the combined Lincoln-Mercury Division.  Although sharing many body panels with the [[Mercury Eight]] and the [[Lincoln EL-series|standard Lincoln]], the 1949 Lincoln Cosmopolitan was marketed as the flagship of the Lincoln line; the model was distinguished by its own rear roofline.

In a departure from previous Lincoln vehicles, the bodywork featured no running boards, with the fenders and doors enclosed together; the Lincolns featured headlights and taillights recessed ("[[Frenching (automobile)|frenched]]") into the bodywork.  At the time, the styling was referred to as a [[Ponton (car)|pontoon design]].  Using a feature that would later appear in the later [[Lincoln Continental]] sedan, all Lincoln-Mercury four-door sedans featured rear-hinged [[suicide door]]s. Alongside the four-door, the Cosmopolitan was sold as a two-door (in standard and Capri trim) and two-door convertible. There was also a four-door [[fastback]] sedan body style (marketed as the Cosmopolitan Town Sedan), but fastbacks rapidly went out of style after WWII and after only 7302 Town Sedans were ordered, the model did not return for 1950. Although Lincoln moved 73,507 total cars for the 1949 model year, 1950 production totaled only 28,150, a nearly 60% drop.&lt;ref&gt;https://macsmotorcitygarage.com/one-year-wonder-the-fastback-1949-lincoln-town-sedan/&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharing its engine with the Ford heavy truck line, the Lincoln and the Lincoln Cosmopolitan were powered by a 337 cubic-inch [[Ford flathead V8 engine|Ford Flathead V8]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1949_Lincoln/1949_Lincoln_Brochure/1949%20Lincoln-07.html|title=Directory Index: Lincoln/1949_Lincoln/1949_Lincoln_Brochure|date=|publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com|accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the first Lincoln powered by a V8 engine. Ford did not have a full automatic transmission yet, although an experimental automatic known as Liquamatic had been tested in 1941. An attempt to purchase [[Packard]]'s Ultramatic transmission was unsuccessful as Packard could not supply the transmissions in sufficient quantities, so Ford instead purchased GM Hydramatics. Although Ford and Mercury would gain automatics for 1951, Lincoln continued using the Hydramatic until 1955. The 1951 model year saw the last Lincolns with manual transmissions until the 2000 [[Lincoln LS]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For the suspension, the chassis was given front coil springs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1949_Lincoln/1949_Lincoln_Brochure/1949%20Lincoln-08.html|title=Directory Index: Lincoln/1949_Lincoln/1949_Lincoln_Brochure|date=|publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com|accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;     [[File:1949 Lincoln Cosmopolitan convertible rear.JPG|thumb|left|1949 Lincoln Cosmopolitan convertible rear]]
In 1951, on all versions of the Cosmopolitan, Lincoln added power windows and seats as standard equipment.&lt;ref name="Flory Jr. 2008" /&gt;

Alongside the Mercury Eight, the 1949-51 Lincoln Cosmopolitan would gain popularity among customizers creating "[[lead sled]]s".

For 1952, the Lincoln-Mercury model line saw a redesign.  The Lincoln Cosmopolitan took the place of the standard Lincoln, with the [[Lincoln Capri]] becoming the new Lincoln flagship line.  Again sharing its body with Mercury (now the [[Mercury Monterey]]), the rear body introduced pontoon rear fenders, with the adoption of larger headlamps and taillamps.  In a major change, four-door Lincoln-Mercury vehicles saw the introduction of front-hinged rear doors.  With the convertible reserved for the Capri range, the Cosmopolitan was now sold as two-door and four-door sedans.

Retaining the 337 Lincoln flathead for 1952, Lincoln introduced a 317 cubic-inch [[Lincoln Y-block V8 engine|Lincoln Y-block V8]], with the 4-speed Hydramatic as the exclusive transmission for 1953.

Lincolns won the top four spots in the Stock Car category of the [[Carrera Panamericana|Pan American Road Race]] in both 1952 and 1953. while taking first and second place in 1954.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997" /&gt;

== Presidential state car ==
In 1950, under the [[Harry S. Truman]] presidency, legend has it that Truman held a grudge with [[General Motors]] because they would not give him use of their cars during his run for the [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 presidential election]]; thus, he chose Lincoln for the presidential state car.&lt;ref name="POPMECH20090119"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a4151/4300349/|title=The Secret Seven: The Top Presidential Limousines of All Time|date=2009-01-19|website=[[Popular Mechanics]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323204544/http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a4151/4300349/|archive-date=2015-03-23|url-status=live|access-date=2016-02-06|last1=Huffman|first1=john Pearley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The White House leased ten Lincoln Cosmopolitans, built by the [[Henney Motor Company]] for Lincoln, and modified by the [[Hess and Eisenhardt Company]]. The cars were modified with extra headroom to accommodate the tall silk hats popular at the time, and were painted black.  Nine of the automobiles had enclosed bodies, while the tenth was an armored convertible especially for President Truman.  The tenth Cosmopolitan was {{convert|20|ft}} long, {{convert|6.5|ft}} wide, and weighed {{convert|6500|lbs}}, {{convert|1700|lbs}} heavier than a stock Cosmopolitan.  All ten cars were outfitted with {{convert|152|hp|adj=on}} [[V8 engine]]s "with heavy-duty [[Hydra-Matic]] [[transmission (mechanics)|transmissions]]."&lt;ref name="POPSCI195009"&gt;{{cite journal|date=September 1950|title=President Gets New Convertible|journal=[[Popular Science]]|location=[[Harlan, Iowa]]|publisher=[[Bonnier Corporation]]|volume=157|issue=3|pages=158–159|issn=0161-7370|oclc=488612811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] had the Cosmopolitan convertible fitted with a [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|Plexiglas]] roof that became known as the "Bubble-top"; it remained in presidential service until 1965.

The '''Lincoln Capri''' is an automobile that was sold by the [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln]] division of [[Ford Motor Company]] from 1952 to 1959.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 19972"&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975|last=Kowalke|first=Ron|publisher=Krause publications|year=1997|isbn=0-87341-521-3|url=https://archive.org/details/standardcatalogo00beve}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975|last=Kowalke|first=Ron|publisher=Krause publications|year=1997|isbn=0-87341-521-3|url=https://archive.org/details/standardcatalogo00beve}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[Luxury vehicle#High-end luxury/full-size luxury cars|full-size luxury car]], the Lincoln Capri derives its name from an [[Capri|Italian island in the Gulf of Naples]].  Introduced as a premium trim variant of the two-door [[Lincoln Cosmopolitan]], the Capri was introduced in 1952 as a stand-alone model line serving as the premium Lincoln.  With the introduction of the Lincoln Premiere (and Continental), the Capri replaced the Cosmopolitan as the standard Lincoln product line.

The Lincoln Capri was produced across three generations; following its withdrawal, Lincoln rebranded the Capri using only its division name (following a practice used from 1946 to 1951).  Along with the Lincoln Premiere and the Continental model lines, the Lincoln Capri was replaced by the 1961 Lincoln Continental.

In the October, 1952 issue of [[Popular Mechanics]], a Lincoln Capri was tested. 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph time was 14.8 seconds, while the quarter-mile was 21.3 seconds. The '52 models were still powered by the 154&amp;nbsp;hp '51 flathead and these times are not representative of the OHV cars that debuted in the '53 models. Also the '55's with 341 cu.in.and dual exhausts were considerably faster than the '53 and '54 models.  Flathead fuel economy was recorded at 21mpg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/?id=jdwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title = Popular Mechanics|publisher = Hearst Magazines|date = October 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1956, the Capri shared a division-wide restyling&lt;ref name="Flory 2008"/&gt; and gained the new 285&amp;nbsp;hp (213&amp;nbsp;kW) {{convert|368|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Lincoln Y-block V8 engine#368|Lincoln Y-Block]] [[V8 engine|V8]]&lt;ref name="Flory 2008"/&gt; (with a [[Carburetor#Multiple carburetor barrels|four-barrel]] [[carburetor]] and 9:1 compression),&lt;ref name="Flory 2008"/&gt; as well as all-new 12-volt electrical system to cope with the proliferation of power accessories.&lt;ref name="Flory 2008"/&gt; The Capri moved down-market, becoming Lincoln's entry-level model and the newly introduced [[Lincoln Premiere|Premiere]] based on it became the upper level Lincoln-branded model.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flory 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1956"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1956_Lincoln/1956_Lincoln_Brochure/dirindex.html |title=Directory Index: Lincoln/1956_Lincoln/1956_Lincoln_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the convertible disappeared from the model range, which already lacked for a four-door [[hardtop]].&lt;ref name="Flory 2008"/&gt; Sales dropped dramatically, to only 8,791 in 1956.&lt;ref name="Flory 2008"/&gt;
This is not to imply that over all sales did not increase for 1956.  The total production for both Capri and Premiere models was 50,322.

A new [[camshaft]] and higher 10:1 compression boosted output to 300&amp;nbsp;hp (224&amp;nbsp;kW),.&lt;ref name="Flory 2008"/&gt; The new cam did not, however, increase compression, contrary to Flory's misapprehension.&lt;ref name="Flory 2008"/&gt; Even so, sales declined again, to 5,900 units (despite the addition of a 4-door [[landau]] hardtop).&lt;ref name="Flory 2008"/&gt;  A facelifted design for 1957 featured more pronounced fins.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;
Total production for 1957 for the Capri and Premiere lines was 41,123.

The 1958 full-size Lincoln sold poorly in all models because of the economic [[Recession of 1958|recession]] in the U.S.

Despite an increase in sales in 1959, to 7,929 units,&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flory 2008"/&gt; the Capri was not renewed for 1960.

=== 1960 Lincoln ===
For the 1960 model year, Lincoln introduced a namesake model line to serve as a replacement for the discontinued Lincoln Capri.  Intended as a competitor for the [[Cadillac Series 62]] and [[Chrysler New Yorker]], the 1960 Lincoln combined the trim of the Lincoln Capri with the facelift adopted by the 1960 Lincoln Premiere and Continental Mark V.

As with the Premiere and Continental, the Lincoln was fitted with a 430 cubic-inch V8; a switch to a 2-barrel carburetor for all three vehicles reduced engine output to 310&amp;nbsp;hp.

For 1961, Lincoln consolidated its model lines from three to one, with a Lincoln Continental serving as the replacement for the Lincoln, Premiere and Continental Mark V.

== Use in motorsport ==
The Lincoln Capri competed in the Stock Car category of the [[Carrera Panamericana|Pan American Road Race]] from 1952 to 1954.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997" /&gt;  In 1952 and 1953, the Capri earned first through fourth place, with the model taking first and second place in 1954 (the final year of the race).&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997" /&gt;

== Further use of nameplate ==
Following its use by the Lincoln division, the Capri nameplate would see subsequent use by both Ford and Mercury for the next three decades.  [[Ford of Britain|Ford UK]] produced the [[Ford Consul Classic#Consul Capri|Ford Consul Capri]] from 1962 to 1964 as a coupe version of its mid-size model range.  [[Ford of Europe]] produced the [[Ford Capri]] [[Sports coupe|compact sports coupe]] from 1968 to 1986, largely designed as the European equivalent of the [[Ford Mustang]].

As a Mercury, the Capri nameplate first saw use as a trim level for the [[Mercury Comet]] from 1966 to 1967.  From 1970 to 1978, the Ford Capri was sold by Lincoln-Mercury in North America (without a divisional nameplate).  As a replacement, from 1979 to 1986, the [[Mercury Capri]] was sold as the Mercury counterpart of the [[Ford Mustang (third generation)|Ford Mustang]].   From 1991 to 1994, the Mercury Capri was sold as a 2+2 roadster, imported from [[Ford Australia|Ford of Australia]], which produced its version as the [[Ford Capri (Australia)|Ford Capri]].

Alongside Zephyr, Capri is the only nameplate ever used by all three Ford divisions.

The '''Lincoln LS''' is a four-door, five-passenger  luxury sedan that was manufactured by the [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln]] division of [[Ford Motor Company]].  The LS was introduced in June 1999 as a 2000 model-year vehicle with either a V6 engine (which was offered with a [[manual transmission]]) or a [[V8 engine]], both featuring [[rear-wheel drive]] and near 50/50 [[weight distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/lincoln/ls/ |title=Lincoln LS |publisher=Edmunds.com |date=2010-08-11 |accessdate=2011-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LS shared the [[Ford DEW platform|Ford DEW98 platform]], along with the [[Jaguar S-Type]] and the [[Ford Thunderbird (eleventh generation)|Ford Thunderbird]]. The Lincoln LS was originally to be marketed in two versions: the '''LS6''' and the '''LS8''' (the names had reflected the vehicle's engine sizes), however, [[Toyota]]'s [[Lexus]] division became concerned about the potential name confusion with its [[Lexus LS]] and Lincoln ended up using only the name "LS".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/FullTests/articleId=44148 Edmunds.com Inside Line - ''Stars, Stripes and a Healthy Dose of Das Vaterland'' - 01 Jan 1999]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080825131349/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/FullTests/articleId%3D44148 |date=August 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trim levels ranged from the base [[V6]] model to the Special Edition V8 LSE trims in 2004, which featured revised front and rear fascia, taillights and foglights, and front grille.

LS models were manufactured at [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]'s [[Wixom Assembly Plant]] until production ended on April 3, 2006 and the plant was idled as part of  Ford's [[The Way Forward]]. Approximately 262,900 LS models were manufactured, including 2,331 manual transmission V6 models, and 1,500 LSE editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/2006/04/03/lincoln-ls-run-will-end/ |title=Lincoln LS run will end |work=LeftLaneNews |date=April 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2001 Lincoln LS -- NHTSA.jpg|thumb|left|2001 Lincoln LS]]
In 1999, the LS debuted as Lincoln's first rear-wheel drive sport luxury sedan for the 2000 model year, under influence from the newly established [[Premier Automotive Group]]. In designing the LS to be competitive in its segment (which was also shared with its domestic rival, the [[Cadillac Catera]], which debuted in 1996), Helmuth Schrader, the LS' German-born chief designer, said of the car, "In a segment defined and dominated by BMW and Mercedes, the car had to have a functional, no-nonsense look. This redefines the Lincoln brand, but we still had to make sure it was recognizable as a member of the same family as the [[Lincoln Town Car#Third generation (1998–2011)|Town Car]], [[Lincoln Continental#Ninth generation (1995–2002)|Continental]], [[Lincoln Mark VIII|Mark VIII]], and the [[Lincoln Navigator|Navigator]]."&lt;ref&gt;Phelan, Mark. "Lincoln LS: Ford's car du jour." Automotive Industries Magazine. Sep. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Heeding this insight, the LS featured an understated, well-proportioned exterior design with squared rectangular fog lights. The body was tightly sculpted with short front and rear overhangs to emphasize an athletic appearance while well-rounded wheel housings were intentionally made small to suggest that the car's wheels were larger than their actual size. The [[Greenhouse (automotive term)|greenhouse]] of the LS offered spacious headroom and was accentuated by a smoothly arched roofline. Completing the exterior were chrome accents on the front and rear fascias and a waterfall grille.

Relative to the exterior, the interior of the LS bore a stronger resemblance to the S-Type, with a similar dashboard layout, gauges, and controls. The interior of the LS was simple, straightforward, and comfortable. Large gauges were designed to convey sportiness, while other controls, such as audio and climate controls, were positioned in the car's center stack for convenience to both the driver and the front passenger. The steering wheel could be wood- and leather-wrapped while wood accents continued around the interior on the door panels and dashboard area. Leather seating surfaces were standard and the front power bucket seats were bolstered for a firm feel like the LS' European competitors. Other standard interior features included power windows, power door locks with keyless entry, power heated mirrors, automatic headlights, air conditioning with automatic climate control, cruise control, and an AM/FM cassette radio. Some of the available options included a six-disc in-dash CD changer (only accessible through the glove box initially; changed on later models), a power moonroof, and a universal garage door opener.

[[File:02LSDash.jpg|thumb|right|Instrument panel and dash area of a 2002 Lincoln LS: Other model years are similar.]]
As mentioned above, the Lincoln LS shared a platform and equipment with the Jaguar S-Type. The [[Ford DEW platform|DEW98]] platform on which the cars were based was a rigid chassis that featured [[Independent suspension|independent]] [[Double wishbone suspension|double wishbone]] (short-long arm; SLA) front and rear suspensions for excellent handling and ride quality. Enhancing ride quality further, as well as increasing interior space, was the LS' large {{convert|114.5|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase. Four-wheel [[Anti-lock braking system|antilock]] disc brakes were standard while Ford's ''AdvanceTrac'' [[traction control system]] was available as an option for improved driving control. A number of suspension components, as well as the hood, decklid, and front fenders, used [[aluminum]] to save weight. The LS came with standard 16-inch alloy wheels while 17-inch wheels were available through an optional sport package. The sport package for only an extra $1000.00, gave a stiffer suspension, 17-inch rims and a "slap shift" selecter. The battery of the LS was positioned in the spare tire well inside the car's trunk because too little room for it was left in the engine bay. However, moving the heavy battery and its interconnecting cables to the rear of the vehicle contributed to its near-50/50 weight distribution.

The base LS was powered by an all-aluminum 3.0 L [[DOHC]] V6 that was a variant of the [[Jaguar AJ-V6 engine]]. Optional in the LS was an all-aluminum 3.9 L DOHC V8, a shorter-stroke variant of the Jaguar 4.0 L [[Jaguar AJ-V8 engine|AJ-26]] V8. The V8 was not offered as a manual because the Getrag could not handle the torque produced. Both engines required premium-grade gasoline for optimum performance. Ford's [[Ford Bordeaux Automatic Transmissions#5R44E/5R55E/N/S/W|5R55S]] five-speed automatic transmission with an optional manual shift ability called ''SelectShift'' was standard with either engine, while a [[Getrag#Products|Getrag 221]] five-speed [[manual transmission]] was available for V6-equipped LS models through an optional sport package. Automatic transmission-equipped cars featured a 3.58:1 rear-axle ratio, while manual transmission-equipped versions came with a 3.07:1 rear-axle ratio. The available manual transmission made the LS the first Lincoln since the 1951 [[Lincoln Cosmopolitan|Cosmopolitan]] to have this option. In spite of this, Lincoln stopped production of the manual-transmission model LS after 2002 due to low sales figures; only 2,331 were produced. Road tests by ''[[Motor Trend]]'' and ''[[Car and Driver]]'' found that a V8-equipped LS could accelerate from zero to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in the low seven-second range, while V6 models were up to two seconds slower in the same test.

The LS was named ''Motor Trend's'' [[Car of the Year]] for 2000, and was nominated for the [[North American Car of the Year]] award, as well.  Early 2000 LS models included a full-sized spare tire. This was changed (starting in February 2000) to a space-saving spare tire, to reduce weight to keep the car in the mid-size class per government specifications. However, the spare tire well in all LS models still has space for a full-sized spare.

The powertrain control module in 2000-2002 automatic transmission models with the ''SelectShift'' option originally would not allow the car to start off in first gear when shifting manually (the car started in second gear). It would quickly shift to first gear, however, if the throttle were&lt;!-- subjunctive --&gt; depressed more than 60%. Second-gear starts were programmed to meet fuel economy regulations as required by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]. This was changed in 2003 when the regulations were amended and first-gear starts were permitted.

In 2002, the LSE (Limited Special Edition) package was introduced in V6 and V8 versions, with a revised fascia including round fog lamp openings and a special metallic grille treatment, and with enlarged lower body rocker panels, special wheels, and twin dual-exhaust tailpipes. Also for 2002, V6-equipped LS models gained {{convert|10|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|10|lbft|abbr=on}} of torque.

[[File:Lincoln LS 2006 2.jpg|thumb|left|2006 Lincoln LS]]
The Lincoln LS received its first, and only, major refresh for 2003, coinciding with Lincoln's then-new "Travel Well" ad campaign. The exterior received a slight facelift, with [[High-intensity discharge lamp|HID]] headlamps (optional), and a revised trunklid with new taillights. For the powertrains, both available engines received a boost in power and torque, as well as slightly improved fuel efficiency. The 3.0&amp;nbsp;L DOHC [[V6]] with which the LS was introduced now featured [[Variable Cam Timing|continuously variable intake cam timing]], improved [[Variable length intake manifold|variable-length intake runners]], and electronic [[Drive by wire|"drive-by-wire"]] throttle control (which replaced the traditional mechanical cable-linked throttle control system used previously). The optional 3.9&amp;nbsp;L DOHC [[V8 engine|V8]] with which the LS was also introduced received [[Variable valve timing|variable exhaust-valve timing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Ford Motor Company |title=Modular Gasoline Engine Family Delivers Performance, Flexibility |work=Ford Media |date=November 5, 2002 |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=13624 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525181948/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=13624 |archivedate=May 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its upgraded design, the 3.9&amp;nbsp;L V8 now produced over 87% of its peak torque output at only 2000 rpm and cars equipped with the V8 could now accelerate from zero to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in around 6.5 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Ford Motor Company |title=Exceptional Performance of New Lincoln LS Makes A Splash in Ad Campaign |work=Ford Media |date=March 28, 2003 |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=14857 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525182105/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=14857 |archivedate=May 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable additions to the LS included an electronic push-button [[parking brake]] (similar to that of the [[BMW E65]] [[BMW 7 Series|7 Series]]), replacing the traditional center console-mounted hand lever (or foot pedal), a touchscreen DVD satellite navigation map system, and an industry-first, 10-speaker [[THX]]-certified sound system. LSE versions were also available in the 2004 and 2005 model years, with unique [[fascia]], unique 17-inch wheels, all-red tail lights, a color-keyed grille, unique floormats, and additional wood paneling in the interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Ford Motor Company |title=Lincoln to Unveil New LSE Sedan at Division's Top Sales Dealership |work=Ford Media |date=July 29, 2003 |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=16010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525182450/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=16010 |archivedate=May 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier LS models had a mechanical engine cooling fan that was operated with a hydraulic pump because the electrical charging system did not have sufficient capacity to effectively power an electric fan. Later on, due to an improved alternator design, the fan was changed to an electric version for the 2003-2006 models.

The 2003-2006 GPS navigation system uses a [[DVD player]] mounted in the trunk (under the package tray) to contain the map data.

For the 2006 model year, the LS received a minor facelift, which resembled the LSE fascia and body treatments used in previous model years. The V6-powered model was dropped from the lineup due to poor sales volume and as a part of Ford's plan to discontinue the LS altogether. As a result of this change in the lineup, the base MSRP for the Lincoln LS increased from $32,370 in 2004 to $39,285.

In spite of Ford's initial success with the LS, a lack of meaningful updates to the car prevented it from staying competitive and, ultimately, caused sales to plummet.&lt;ref name="thetruthaboutcars2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2006/05/lincoln-ls-v8-sport/ |title=Lincoln LS V8 Sport Review |publisher=The Truth About Cars |date= |accessdate=2011-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LS went from a peak of over 51,000 cars sold in 2000 to fewer than 9,000 sold in its abbreviated 2006 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sales Figures &amp; Financial Results |year=2008 |work=Blue Oval News |url=http://www.blueovalnews.com/index.php?categoryid=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given this situation and Ford having no interest in further investments into the LS in favor of other products for Lincoln,&lt;ref name="thetruthaboutcars2006"/&gt; production of the Lincoln LS at the Wixom plant was ended in April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060203/AUTO01/602030367/1148 |title=Detroit News - 3 Feb 2006 |publisher=The Detroit News |date= |accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wixom plant itself was idled a year later.

==Safety==
The Lincoln LS has received very high marks in occupant protection. The [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] has rated the LS as a "Best Pick" with a perfect score in their frontal offset crash test. The [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] gave the LS almost perfect scores in its side impact and rollover tests. In fact, [[CNBC]] rated the LS as “one of the five safest cars of all time.”

==Model naming controversy==
Lincoln originally intended to designate LS models as "LS6" and "LS8", depending on the engine size option. Toyota threatened a trademark infringement lawsuit, due to the similar naming scheme used on the [[Lexus LS]], while at the same time, Ford threatened a lawsuit regarding the Toyota T150 concept, arguing that the name was too close to that of the [[Ford F150|F150]].  Lincoln settled on designating the cars as "LS V6" and "LS V8" and Toyota changed the name of their pickup truck to the [[Toyota Tundra|Tundra]].

==Milestones==

The Premiere name is currently used as a trim level on Lincoln models.

The Premiere was introduced in 1956 as an upscale version of the [[Lincoln Capri]].  It featured a {{convert|368|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Lincoln Y-block V8 engine#368|Lincoln Y-Block]] [[V8 engine|V8]] and it was approximately 223" (5664&amp;nbsp;mm) long in 1956. The vehicle weighed 4357&amp;nbsp;lb (1976.3&amp;nbsp;kg) and had a base price of $4,601 in 1956, which converts to roughly ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4601|1956}}}} in current dollars. The top-end Lincoln, it was substantially different from the much more expensive [[Continental Mark II]] sold by Ford's Continental Motorcars division.

The Premiere's appearance reflected the Capri's derivation from the radically different concept cars, the [[Mercury XM-800]] and the [[Lincoln Futura]].  It was known for a stylish exterior, high-grade interior and some unique features, such as optional "factory [[air conditioning]] being run through overhead ducts much like those in an [[aircraft]].  The cool air was directed to the roof via a pair of clear plastic ducts visible through the rear window at each side, connecting upward from the rear package tray.  Four way power seats were standard.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; Front suspension was independent with a stabilizer bar.

These were the first Lincolns produced at the new Wixom plant, and were made on a unibody platform, Lincoln's first since the [[Lincoln-Zephyr]].&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; While advertising brochures made the case that Continental was still a separate make, the car shared its body with that year's Lincoln.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; The Lincoln Premiere was placed between the [[Lincoln Capri#1958–1959|Lincoln Capri]] and Continental in trim level, with a traditional roof treatment instead of the Continental's extravagant reverse-angle power rear "breezeway" window that retracted behind the back seat.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Lincoln lost over $60 million during 1958-1960, reflecting the enormous expense of developing the largest unibody car produced to date&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Popular Mechanics - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and poor consumer reception. The 1958 full-size Lincoln sold poorly in all models, compounded by the economic [[Recession of 1958|recession]] in the U.S.

The 1958–60 Lincoln Premiere was truly hulking. One of the largest cars ever made regardless of platform, larger than contemporaneous [[Cadillac Sixty Special#1957–1958|Cadillac Sixty-Specials]] or [[Imperial (automobile)#Second generation (1957–1966)|Imperials]].

The '''Lincoln-Zephyr''' is a line of [[Luxury vehicle|luxury cars]] that was produced by the [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln]] division of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] from 1936 to 1942.  Bridging the gap between the [[De Luxe Ford|Ford V8 DeLuxe]] and the [[Lincoln K series|Lincoln Model K]] (in both size and price), the Lincoln-Zephyr expanded Lincoln to a second model line, competing against the [[Chrysler Airstream]], [[LaSalle (automobile)|LaSalle]], and the [[Packard One-Twenty]].     

Following the discontinuation of the Model K after 1940, Lincoln shifted its production exclusively to the Lincoln-Zephyr design; after World War II, the Zephyr name was dropped, lasting through 1948.  The Lincoln-Zephyr would serve as the basis of the first [[Lincoln Continental]], the longest-running nameplate of the Lincoln brand.  The model line was powered by a [[Lincoln-Zephyr V12 engine|V12 engine]], in contrast to the V8 and inline-8 engines of its competitors.  

The Lincoln-Zephyr was conceived by [[Edsel Ford]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated155"&gt;{{harvnb|Dammann|Wagner|Cars of Lincoln-Mercury|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; and designed by [[Eugene Turenne Gregorie]].  The model line was assembled at the [[Lincoln Motor Company Plant]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]].   

==Overview==
Introduced on November 2, 1935,&lt;ref name="autogenerated155"/&gt; as a 1936 model, the Lincoln-Zephyr was extremely modern with a low raked windscreen, integrated fenders, and [[Streamliner|streamlined]] aerodynamic design, which influenced the name "zephyr", derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word [[zephyrus]], or the god of the [[west wind]]. It was one of the first successful streamlined cars after the [[Chrysler Airflow]]'s market resistance. In fact, the Lincoln-Zephyr actually had a lower coefficient of drag than the Airflow, due in part to the [[prow]]-like front grille on the Zephyr, reflecting the popularity of leisure [[speedboat]]s like [[Chris-Craft Boats|Chris-Craft]]. The Lincoln-Zephyr succeeded in reigniting sales at Lincoln dealerships in the late 1930s, and from 1941 model year, all Lincolns were Zephyr-based&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dammann|Wagner|Cars of Lincoln-Mercury|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Lincoln-Zephyr marque was phased out. Annual production for any year model was not large, but accounted for a large portion of the Lincoln brand's sales. In its first year, 15,000 were sold, accounting for 80% of Lincoln's total sales.

Production of all American cars halted in 1942 as the country entered [[World War II]], with Lincoln producing the last Lincoln Zephyr on February 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dammann|Wagner|Cars of Lincoln-Mercury|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the war, most makers restarted production of their prewar lines, and Lincoln was no exception.  The Zephyr name, however, was no longer used after 1942, with the cars simply called Lincolns.

The idea of a smaller and more modern luxury car to fill the gap in Lincoln's traditional lineup was revisited in the 1950 [[Lincoln Lido]] (The Lido was the same size as other two-door Lincolns, though&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dammann|Wagner|Cars of Lincoln-Mercury|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;), 1977 [[Lincoln Versailles]], 1982 [[Lincoln Continental#Seventh generation (1982–87)|Continental]], and 2000 [[Lincoln LS]].  The Zephyr name was resurrected in 2006 for the car's spiritual successor, the [[Lincoln MKZ|Zephyr]], which was quickly renamed the MKZ for 2007.

==Models==
[[File:Lincoln Coupe 1942.jpg|thumb|1942 Lincoln Zephyr coupe]]The following were the Zephyr models for 1936 to 1940:

For 1938 a Convertible Coupe and a Convertible Sedan was added. For 1940 the Coupe-Sedan was replaced by the Club Coupe, the Convertible Sedan was discontinued. Trunk space was increased in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Lincoln-Zephyr Continental (1940) was the first time the name Continental appeared on a car from Lincoln, as a model under Lincoln-Zephyr rather than a separate model. They were partially hand-built since dies for machine-pressing were not constructed until 1941. Production started on December 13, 1939, with the Continental Cabriolet, from June 1940 also available as Continental Club Coupe. Just 350 Cabriolets and 54 Club Coupes were built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dammann | first = George H. | authorlink = |author2=Wagner James K.  | title = The Cars of Lincoln-Mercury | publisher = Crestline Publishing Co. | year = 1987 | location = | pages = 203–204 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-912612-26-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the last Lincoln V-12 (Model K) had been delivered on January 24, 1940,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dammann|Wagner|Cars of Lincoln-Mercury|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Lincoln Motor Company was soon to be transformed into Lincoln Division, effective on May 1, 1940,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dammann|Wagner|Cars of Lincoln-Mercury|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for 1941 model year the Lincoln-Zephyr was no longer a separate marque. All 1941 models were Lincolns and the Zephyr-based [[Lincoln Custom]] replaced both the large Lincoln K-series cars and the Lincoln-Zephyr Town-Limousine. It also had full instrumentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following Lincoln-Zephyr heritage models were sold under Lincoln marque after Lincoln and were merged for the 1941 model year:

* [[Lincoln Zephyr V-12]] (1941–1942)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dammann | first = George H. | authorlink = |author2=Wagner James K.  | title = The Cars of Lincoln-Mercury | publisher = Crestline Publishing Co. | year = 1987 | location = | page = 199 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-912612-26-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both years available as Sedan, Coupe, Club Coupe and Convertible Coupe
* [[Lincoln Custom]] (1941–1942) Sedan and Limousine, some with blinded quarter roof option&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dammann|Wagner|Cars of Lincoln-Mercury|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lincoln Continental]] (1941–1948) Cabriolet and Coupe
* [[Lincoln H-series|Lincoln]] (1946–1948)

When Lincoln resumed production after [[World War II]] the Zephyr name was dropped&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dammann|Wagner|Cars of Lincoln-Mercury|pp=223–224}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the cars sold without a proper model name, known just by their body styles - Sedan, Club Coupe, or Convertible Coupe - during the 1946-1948 model years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dammann | first = George H. | authorlink = |author2=Wagner James K.  | title = The Cars of Lincoln-Mercury | publisher = Crestline Publishing Co. | year = 1987 | location = | pages = 223–224 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-912612-26-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For identification purposes, they are typically referred to as the [[Lincoln H-series|H-Series]], while the approach of offering a luxuriously equipped vehicle in a smaller size was ceded to the all-new [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] in 1938.

==Specifications==
[[File:Lincoln Zephyr V12 engine (Autocar Handbook, 13th ed, 1935).jpg|thumb|Lincoln-Zephyr V12 engine]]
The Zephyr was designed by [[John Tjaarda]] (1897–1962), who was fascinated with airplanes, resulting in [[unibody]] construction{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} relatively light and rigid for its size and a [[drag coefficient]] of 0.45. Weight was 3,350&amp;nbsp;lb (1,520&amp;nbsp;kg).

The Zephyr was powered by a small 75° [[Lincoln-Zephyr V12 engine|V12 engine]]&lt;ref name="kimes1996" /&gt; developed from Ford's [[Ford Flathead engine|Flathead]] [[V8 engine|V8]] and unrelated to the larger K-series [[Lincoln L-head V12 engine|Lincoln V12 engine]]s. The valve-in-block flathead engine was quite compact, allowing a low hood.  But like the V8 Fords of the era, the Zephyr V12 often suffered from hot spots due to exhaust passages through the cylinder block. In addition, the earliest Zephyrs suffered from poor oil pressure, resulting in upgrades to the oil pump.

The 1936 to 1939 models were 267&amp;nbsp;in³ (4.4&amp;nbsp;L) with hydraulic lifters added in 1938.  The 1940 and 1941 cars used an enlarged 292-in³ (4.8-L) engine, while 1942 and early 1946 models used a 306-in³ (5.0-L), but lower compression ratio because of the iron heads.  Late 1946 to 1948 Lincolns based on the Zephyr used a 292-in³ engine.

The original engine had 110&amp;nbsp;hp (82&amp;nbsp;kW) and gave the car a top speed of {{convert|90|mph}}.
Suspension was Henry Ford-era transverse springs front and rear, with dead axle front and torque tube rear, already quite outdated when the car was introduced.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Brakes were cable-activated for 1936 to 1938; 1939 and onwards were hydraulic. The Zephyr was the first Ford product to have an all-steel roof, except the late 1931 Model AA truck.

The second Lincoln sport-utility vehicle, the Aviator is currently in its second generation, slotted between the [[Lincoln Nautilus]] and [[Lincoln Navigator]] in size.

The first generation of the Aviator was produced from the 2003 to 2005 model years as a rebadged version of the [[Mercury Mountaineer#Second generation (2002–2005)|Mercury Mountaineer]] (itself based on the [[Ford Explorer#Third generation (2002–2005)|Ford Explorer]]); following the [[Lincoln Versailles]] and [[Lincoln Blackwood]] pickup truck, the Aviator was among one of the shortest-produced vehicles ever sold by Lincoln.  For the 2007 model year, Lincoln expanded its use of [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover SUVs]]; the five-passenger [[Lincoln MKX|MKX]] offered a similar exterior footprint while the [[Lincoln MKT|MKT]] (introduced in 2009) offered the three-row seating of the Aviator.  

For the 2020 model year, the Aviator made its return to the Lincoln model line (again based on the Ford Explorer).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For the first time in a Lincoln-brand vehicle, the Aviator is offered as a [[Plug-in hybrid|plug-in hybrid]].  

The first-generation Aviator was assembled at the now-closed [[St. Louis Assembly]] in [[Hazelwood, Missouri]] alongside the Explorer and Mountaineer.  The second-generation Aviator is assembled at [[Chicago Assembly]] in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]] alongside the Explorer and the Ford Police Interceptor Utility.

The Aviator was launched for 2003 model year, slotted below the Navigator. As with the Explorer and Mountaineer, a three-row seating configuration was standard; in contrast to the Explorer and Mountaineer, a six-passenger configuration was standard, with bucket seats and a center console in the second row (a second-row bench seat was available as a no-cost option).

Alongside the choice of [[four-wheel-drive]] drivetrain configuration and towing packages, the Aviator was offered with relatively few options. In addition to all the standard features, options included heated/cooled front bucket seats, xenon (HID) headlights, 17-inch chrome wheels and a DVD based navigation system. These options were late availability in 2003 on the premium model and 2004 (''Ultimate''), 2005 (''Elite''). Shared with the Mountaineer, the Aviator was equipped with dual front/side airbags, side curtain airbags, along with stability and [[traction control]].

=== Chassis ===
Sharing its chassis with the third generation Explorer, the Aviator is derived from the body-on-frame [[Ford U platform#U1|Ford U1 platform]]. Sharing its {{convert|113.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} wheelbase with the Explorer/Mountaineer, the Aviator is fitted with four-wheel independent suspension.

A standard towing package was fitted to all AWD Aviators with a heavy-duty towing package optional on either RWD or AWD models.

=== Powertrain ===
In place of the [[SOHC]] [[Multivalve|2-valve]] version of the 4.6 L ''[[Ford Modular engine#4.6&amp;nbsp;L|Modular]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] shared with the Explorer/Mountaineer and other Ford trucks, the Aviator was fitted with the [[DOHC]] 4-valve version of the engine, shared with the [[Ford Mustang Mach 1 #Fourth generation (2003–2004)|Mustang Mach 1]] and [[Mercury Marauder|Marauder]].

Producing {{convert|225|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|407|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque, the DOHC V8 engine in the Aviator came with two more horsepower than the 5.4 L V8 in the Navigator (though with {{convert|75|Nm|abbr=on}} less of torque). As with the Explorer/Mountaineer, rear-wheel-drive was standard, with Lincoln offering all-wheel-drive as an option; all versions were equipped with a 5-speed ''[[Ford C3 transmission#5r55S|5R55S]]'' [[Automatic transmission|overdrive automatic]] 
transmission.

=== Body ===
As with the Mountaineer, the Aviator derived its body construction from the third generation Explorer, sharing its body structure, doors, and roofline with both model lines. The Aviator adopts a number of styling cues from the second generation Navigator which gave it the nickname "The Baby Navigator", with visually similar front and rear fascias, lower door panels/running boards, grilles and headlamps, and license plate surrounds. The Aviator was styled with a Lincoln-specific dashboard, adopting a design nearly identical to the Navigator. Styled similar to later-1960s Lincolns, the rectangular-designed dashboard of both models featured an instrument cluster with electroluminescent gauges and needles. The primary visual difference between an Aviator and a Navigator is the lettering on the radio cover panel; an Aviator is lettered "LINCOLN", with its Navigator counterpart lettered "NAVIGATOR". As with the Navigator, the Aviator was given model-specific seats and leather, with American walnut wood trim on the doors and steering wheel.

=== Trim ===
At its 2002 launch, the Aviator followed the trim nomenclature of the [[Lincoln LS|LS]] and Navigator, with a ''Luxury'' base trim and ''Premium'' top-level trim. For 2004, the ''Premium'' trim was renamed ''Ultimate'', matching the Navigator and [[Lincoln Town Car|Town Car]]. For 2005, the ''Luxury'' trim became the sole offering, with previous content remaining available as stand-alone options, including a rear-seat DVD player. An ''Elite'' option package was offered, which bundled all features of the ''Premium''/''Ultimate'' trims; the package offered a DVD-based navigation system.

==== Kitty Hawk Special Edition ====
To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Wright Brothers' 1903 flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, and the 100th anniversary of Ford Motor Company, Lincoln created a "Kitty Hawk" limited edition of the Aviator; it was the official vehicle of the 2003 EAA Countdown to Kitty Hawk. Along with special Kitty Hawk badging and trim, the limited-edition vehicles were fitted with special wood trim which is mink zebrano, argent painted and chrome grille, and a rear spoiler, chrome exhaust tip, chrome wheels, xenon (HID) headlamps, black premium leather heated/cooled seats with Kitty Hawk logo embossed on front seat backs, black carpet floor mats with stitched Kitty Hawk logo, available only in black exterior color.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lincoln-aviator-kitty-hawk-edition-celebrates-100-years-of-flight-74706312.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marketing and reception ===
Lincoln played up the similarity to the Navigator full-size SUV with magazine ads that read, "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Especially when it's yourself you're imitating." The Aviator seemed to have been met with relatively positive press coverage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/1864/lincoln-aviator.html "Lincoln's derailed gravy train hitches to another car."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095647/http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/1864/lincoln-aviator.html|date=2007-09-29}} ''Car and Driver'', December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Aviator's styling borrowed cues from its big brother, the Navigator, it also looked similar to the very widespread Explorer with which it shared the platform. Also working against the Aviator was it was priced similar to the larger and relatively popular [[Ford Expedition|Expedition]]. [[Car and Driver]] magazine said in a comparison test, in which the Aviator tied for fifth place, that only the car's high price and lack of certain features and no low range with the 4WD model held it out of contention for the top spots.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/comparison-test/a15135370/2003-gmc-envoy-vs-land-rover-discovery-lincoln-aviator-volvo-xc90-bmw-x5-acura-mdx-lexus-gx470-vw-touareg-comparison-tests/ "The Bradsher Bunch"], ''Car and Driver'', January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Replacement ===
Coinciding with the model cycle of the Ford Explorer, the first-generation Lincoln Aviator was discontinued after the 2005 model year, with the final vehicle produced by St. Louis Assembly on August 19, 2005.  At the [[North American International Auto Show#2004|2004 Detroit Auto Show]], Lincoln previewed an intended second generation of the Aviator.  In a break from the Explorer/Mountaineer, the model line was shift its design from a three-row SUV to a two-row crossover SUV, becoming a Lincoln counterpart of the [[Ford Edge]] CUV.  The second-generation Aviator was to skip the 2006 model year entirely, released as an early 2007 vehicle.    

During 2007, Lincoln phased in a rebranding of its model line, adopting a "MK" model nomenclature for all vehicles (with the exception of the [[Lincoln Navigator|Navigator]] and the [[Lincoln Town Car|Town Car]]).  The Aviator nameplate was dropped, becoming the Lincoln MKX (X= crossover); based on the [[Ford CD3 platform]], the production MKX served as a counterpart of the Ford Edge.

At the [[New York International Auto Show#2018|2018 New York Auto Show]], Lincoln unveiled a prototype version of its planned second generation Aviator, slated to enter production in 2019.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.motortrend.com/news/2018-lincoln-aviator-first-look-review/|title=Lincoln Aviator Concept First Look: SUV is Back on New Rear-Drive Platform - Motor Trend|date=2018-03-27|work=Motor Trend|access-date=2018-04-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2018/03/28/lincoln-new-aviator-debuts-new-york-auto-show/33347423/ “Lincoln amps up design with Aviator reboot”] from The Detroit News (March 28, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt; While not officially announced as a replacement for the MKT, the Aviator is marketed above the [[Lincoln Nautilus|Nautilus]] and below the standard-wheelbase Navigator. 

A more detailed production was later introduced at the [[Los Angeles Auto Show]] on November 28, 2018. Lincoln confirmed that the Aviator will go on sale in the Summer of 2019 as a 2020 model in North America and in China afterwards. Lincoln notes that it will be marketed as a mid-size SUV rather than a Crossover.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.autoblog.com/2018/11/28/2020-lincoln-aviator-crossover-400-horsepower-la-auto-show/ "2020 Lincoln Aviator crossover is a hot rod with 400 horsepower standard"] from Autoblog (November 28, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; 

With 494 horsepower and 630 lb-ft of torque, and all of the power and torque coming from a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6 with a hybrid system, the Aviator Hybrid's output makes it on par with likes of other midsize performance SUVs such as the [[BMW X5]] xDrive 50i (456 hp and 479 lb-ft), and the [[Porsche Cayenne]] E-Hybrid (455 hp and 516 lb-ft).

=== Vehicle overview ===
The 2018 Aviator prototype marked the debut of an all-new vehicle platform for Ford Motor Company; while the vehicle is rear-wheel-drive, the architecture is designed for multiple powertrain layouts, including all-wheel-drive and [[front-wheel-drive]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The second generation Aviator shares its platform architecture with the sixth generation Explorer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While again mechanically related to the Explorer, the Aviator will be given its own body design.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Adopting design cues from the [[Lincoln Continental#Tenth generation (2017–present)|Continental]] and Navigator, the Aviator adopted conservative exterior styling, to contrast from a "visual attack" (seen on competing vehicles).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

No specific engine or transmission details were announced as part of the unveiling; the production Aviator will offer [[plug-in hybrid]] (PHEV) capability as an option, the first Lincoln vehicle to do so.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

Making their way into the production vehicle, several technology features made their debut on the 2018 prototype Aviator.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Tying the vehicle camera system with the continuously controlled dampers, ''Suspension Preview Technology'' looks at the road ahead for surface irregularities (i.e., potholes), preparing the suspension for impact and its effect on vehicle ride. ''Phone as a Key'' allows an Aviator to be driven without keys; the technology allows the smartphone of the owner to serve as the vehicle [[key fob]], with the door-mounted keyless entry keypad allowing access in the event of phone battery failure (the interior is designed with wireless charging for smartphones)&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://media.lincoln.com/content/lincolnmedia/lna/us/en/news/2018/03/28/elegant-aviator-suv-previews-lincolns-next-act-with-power--techn.html|title=Elegant Aviator SUV Previews Lincoln’s Next Act with Power, Technology and Plug-In Hybrid Option {{!}} Lincoln Media Center|website=media.lincoln.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A number of safety technology features are included, with ''Lincoln CoPilot360'' packaging automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, a blind-spot information system with cross-traffic alert, lane keeping system, lane centering&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cars.com/articles/2020-lincoln-aviator-finally-la-la-lands-in-production-form-in-la-1420709692577//"2020 Lincoln Aviator Finally La-La-Lands in Production Form in L.A." cars.com.

''Reverse Brake Assist'' applies the brakes if the vehicle detects an object when the transmission is in reverse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

Lincoln designers worked with the [[Detroit Symphony Orchestra]] to compose 25 unique sound effects to be used for the [[door chime]] and other indicator alerts for the Aviator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2018/11/05/2020-lincoln-aviator-debuting-at-la-auto-show-with-custom-symphonic-tonesu/#427f66a57819 |title=2020 Lincoln Aviator Debuting At LA Auto Show With Custom Symphonic Tones |author=Abuelsamid, Sam |work=Forbes |date=November 5, 2018 |accessdate=November 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lincoln MKT''' is a mid-size luxury crossover SUV that was marketed by the [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln]] division of [[Ford Motor Company]]; a single generation was produced from the 2010 to the 2019 model years.  Slotted between the [[Lincoln MKX]] (renamed the [[Lincoln Nautilus]]) and the [[Lincoln Navigator]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/buy/2010-Lincoln-MKT/expert-review/|title=2010 Lincoln MKT|publisher=Autoblog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the MKT shared its Ford D4 chassis with the [[Ford Flex]] CUV and the [[Ford Explorer#Fifth generation (U502; 2011–2019)|2011-2019 Ford Explorer]].   

While the MKT had no direct Lincoln predecessor, its introduction coincided with the discontinuation of the [[Mercury Mountaineer]] (based on the Ford Explorer); a livery variant of the MKT continued the use of the [[Lincoln Town Car]] name. 

After the 2019 model year, Ford ended the use of its D3/D4 chassis, discontinuing the MKT and counterparts.  Within the Lincoln model range, the MKT was not directly replaced, but the second-generation [[Lincoln Aviator#Second generation (U611; 2019–present )|Lincoln Aviator]] is slotted between the Nautilus and Navigator.  

Throughout its production, the MKT was assembled by [[Ford Motor Company of Canada|Ford of Canada]] at its [[Oakville Assembly]] facility at [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville, Ontario, Canada.]]

==2008 concept==

The Lincoln MKT was unveiled as a [[concept vehicle]] at the [[North American International Auto Show#2008|2008 North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit, MI]].  Largely a preview of the upcoming production vehicle, it featured a full-length glass roof and a 2+2 seating layout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topspeed.com/cars/lincoln/2008-lincoln-mkt-ar50522.html|title=2008 Lincoln MKT|author=Simona|date=14 January 2008|work=Top Speed}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The MKT concept vehicle was announced to have the 415&amp;nbsp;hp 3.5&amp;nbsp;L [[Ford Cyclone engine|Cyclone 35]] [[V6 engine|V-6]] variant of Ford's new ''[[EcoBoost]]'' engine family, which uses [[turbocharger|turbocharging]] and [[Fuel injection#Direct injection|direct injection]] technologies to offer the power of larger displacement engines with the fuel economy of smaller engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/pdf/ecoboost.pdf |work=Media.Ford.com |title=EcoBoost brochure |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306055156/http://media.ford.com/pdf/ecoboost.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model overview==
The MKT entered production at the [[Oakville Assembly]] plant in July 2009 for the 2010 model year.  While the Lincoln division was shifting from SUVs towards crossover SUVs, the MKT had no direct predecessor.  Developed as a competitor against the [[Acura MDX]], [[Audi Q7]], and [[Mercedes-Benz R-Class]], the MKT was designed as one of the largest and fastest luxury crossovers in its price range.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/08/for-the-lincoln-mkt-different-may-be-good/ For the Lincoln MKT, Different May Be Good] NYTimes, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/driven/1204_2013_infiniti_jx35_2012_bmw_x5_2013_lincoln_mkt_and_2012_acura_mdx/viewall.html|title=Four Threes: 2013 Infiniti JX35, 2012 BMW X5, 2013 Lincoln MKT, 2012 Acura MDX|date=11 April 2012|work=Automobile}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is considered a crossover SUV, it is actually closer to full-size.

=== Chassis ===
The Lincoln MKT is based upon the unibody [[Ford D3 platform#D4|Ford D4 platform]], a variant of the Volvo-derived Ford D3 platform designed for SUVs and crossovers.  With a 120.7-inch wheelbase, the Lincoln MKT is the longest-wheelbase D4 vehicle and the third-longest wheelbase Lincoln currently produced (only the Navigator/Navigator L are longer).  While sharing no common body panels, the Lincoln MKT is mechanically related to the [[Ford Flex]] and the fifth-generation [[Ford Explorer#Fifth generation (2011–present)|Ford Explorer]] (though the Explorer remains marketed as an SUV and retains a greater degree of off-road driving capability).

Sharing its powertrain with the Lincoln MKS and sixth-generation Ford Taurus, the standard engine for a Lincoln MKT is a 3.7L V6.  From 2010 to 2012, the engine produced 268&amp;nbsp;hp; after 2013, the 3.7L V6 produced 303&amp;nbsp;hp.  As an option, a 3.5L twin-turbocharged V6 is offered.  Initially producing 355&amp;nbsp;hp in the MKT, in 2013, the 3.5L engine was retuned for 365&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref name="2010specs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=2023&amp;item_id=5655&amp;press_section_id=2878|title=2010 MKT Technical Specifications|work=Media.Ford.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004162036/http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=2023&amp;item_id=5655&amp;press_section_id=2878|archivedate=2009-10-04|url-status=dead|accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both engines are mated to a Ford [[GM-Ford 6-speed automatic transmission|6F]] 6-speed automatic transmission.&lt;ref name="2010specs" /&gt;  A front-wheel drive configuration is fitted to two-wheel drive versions, with all-wheel drive fitted as an option; the latter is standard on versions fitted with the 3.5L V6.

In 2013, a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 became available for the Town Car livery variant as a special-order option.

The MKT features [[electric power steering]] over more-traditional [[hydraulic power steering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=27500&amp;make_id=trust|title=Lincoln unveils ultimate touring vehicle concept; Premium utility features elegance, space, efficiency|date=January 14, 2008|work=Media.Ford.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116020840/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=27500&amp;make_id=trust|archivedate=January 16, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electric steering system is combined with [[ultrasonic sensor]]s to form a hands-off "Active Park Assist" system that steers the vehicle into [[parallel parking]] slots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/Fords-New-Active-Park-Assist-prnews-13932026.html|title=Ford's New 'Active Park Assist' Makes Parallel Parking a Breeze for Lincoln MKT and MKS Owners|date=December 30, 2008|work=PR Newswire}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Lincoln's website the MKT has been discontinuted for the 2020 model year.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lincoln.com/luxury-crossovers/mkt/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Body ===
In the shift from the 2008 concept to the production MKT, relatively few changes were made, with the most notable exception of larger rear quarter windows, the addition of wraparound headlamp units, and a revised lower grille.  Retained from the concept, the vertically slatted split grille was a feature first introduced on the 2007 [[Lincoln MKR]] concept (along with the use of the Lincoln star emblem as fender side vents).

In the interest of fuel economy, Lincoln adapted several weight-saving measures in the construction of the MKT body.  The liftgate is constructed using an inner panel of cast [[magnesium]] and an outer panel of stamped [[aluminum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=30231|title=Light-weight Magnesium, Aluminum in Lincoln MKT Liftgate Cuts Weight, Boosts Fuel Economy|work=Media.Ford.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004212121/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=30231|archivedate=2009-10-04|url-status=dead|accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lfpress.com/news/london/2010/05/05/13840276.html|title=Auto Parts Maker Wins PACE Award|work=London Free Press May 6, 2010|accessdate=2010-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other places where magnesium replaces steel include the radiator support frame and the frames of the rear seatbacks and lower seat cushions.

Although sharing no external body panels with its Ford D4 counterpart Ford Flex, the MKT and the Flex offer the same two seating configurations.  A seven-passenger (2-3-2) configuration is standard, with an optional six-passenger (2-2-2) configuration; a second row of bucket seats replaces the three-passenger split bench seat with a full-length center console as an option.

During its production, the Lincoln MKT has seen relatively few changes, primarily limited to adjustments in color offerings and option packages.  In 2013, in line with the MKZ and MKS, the front fascia of the MKT saw a redesign, with the widely slatted grille replaced by a more narrowly-spaced design and a redesign of the lower grille.  For 2016, a new Sync 3 infotainment system replaced the previous [[MyLincoln Touch]].  In 2017, the front fascia saw a second update, with the vertical grille layout replaced by a widely spaced horizontal design, shared with the Lincoln MKC and 2016-2018 MKX.[http://www.lincoln.com/crossovers/mkt/]

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Trim ===
From 2010 to 2016 (with the exception of the Town Car livery variants) the Lincoln MKT was not sold by trim level, with examples largely identified by their engine and drivetrain configuration.  To bring the MKT in line with other Lincoln vehicles, for 2017, the MKT adopted a Premiere base model, with the Reserve as the top-trim model.

For the 2019 MY, Lincoln dropped the [[naturally aspirated]] 3.7L V6 [[Duratec]] engine from the trim lineup making the Twin-Turbocharged 3.5L V6 [[EcoBoost]] the sole engine.

==Livery use==
In October 2010, Ford announced the development of [[livery]] and [[limousine]] variants of the MKT as potential replacements for the [[Lincoln Town Car]].&lt;ref name="autoblog"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.autoblog.com/2010/10/04/ford-developing-lincoln-mkt-limousine-livery-models-to-replace/ | title=Lincoln MKT limousine, livery models announced, will replace Town Car — Autoblog | publisher=Autoblog.com | date=2010-10-04 | accessdate=2010-12-12 | last=Shunk | first=Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2011, Ford unveiled the Lincoln MKT Town Car to the limousine and livery trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brightstarlimos.ca/livery-use-of-the-lincoln-mkt/|title=Limousine &amp; Livery Use of the Lincoln MKT|publisher=Brightstar Limos|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freep.com/article/20110214/BLOG40/110214055/With-poll-Lincoln-s-new-limos-keep-Town-Car-name-?odyssey=tab%7Ctopnews%7Ctext%7CAutoNews {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001204509/http://www.freep.com/article/20110214/BLOG40/110214055/With-poll-Lincoln-s-new-limos-keep-Town-Car-name-?odyssey=tab|date=October 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To accommodate the weight of the heavier vehicle, the all-wheel drive powertrain is fitted to all limousines, along with heavy-duty brakes, suspension, and electric power steering,&lt;ref name="autoblog" /&gt;

Serving as a replacement for the long-running Town Car sedan, the MKT Town Car uses the same body as the production vehicle, with several changes made to the interior.  In place of the three-row seating, the rear row of seating is removed; the three-passenger bench seat is moved several inches rearward to increase rear legroom while the third-row seating area is converted to additional luggage space.&lt;ref name="autoblog" /&gt;

The MKT Limousine uses the rear seating configuration of the MKT Town Car, but is designed for conversion to a stretch limousine.  As with the previous Lincoln Town Car, Ford Motor Company allows the MKT Limousine to be stretched to a maximum of 120 inches over its original length.&lt;ref name="autoblog" /&gt;

Through a Ford QVM (Quality Vehicle Modifier), the Lincoln MKT is also available for conversion to a hearse, involving many of the same chassis modifications used for a livery vehicle.

In 2013, the 2.0L EcoBoost inline-4 became available for the MKT Town Car, available only through special order; it is not available on a standard production MKT.&lt;gallery&gt;

The '''Lincoln Blackwood''' is a [[pickup truck]] that was marketed by the [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln]] division of [[Ford Motor Company]]. Marketed in the United States and Mexico, it was the first pickup truck ever sold by the Lincoln division. Due to poor sales, it was only marketed in the United States for the 2002 model year and in Mexico for the 2002 and 2003 model year, making it the shortest-produced vehicle by the division.

The Blackwood was the first Lincoln manufactured outside the state of Michigan since 1958. It was produced at Ford's [[Kansas City Assembly]] in [[Claycomo, Missouri]], from August 2001 to December 2002.

== Background ==
The Blackwood was a luxuriously-trimmed version of the [[Ford F-Series|Ford F-150 Crew Cab]] pickup truck, and was greeted with enthusiasm after its debut at the [[North American International Auto Show]] in January 1999. Lincoln's success with the [[Lincoln Navigator]] emboldened the company to pursue the first-ever luxury pickup truck, and [[Cadillac]] was in hot pursuit with the [[Cadillac Escalade#Escalade EXT|Cadillac Escalade EXT]]. 

== Overview ==
[[File:Lincoln Blackwood bed open.jpg|left|thumb|View of cargo area ]]
The Blackwood was only available in [[rear wheel drive]], SuperCrew cab configuration, with black exterior and interior. The truck bed was built as a trunk, with a power [[tonneau]] and plush carpeting. The box was manufactured from plastic composites but lined with stainless steel. The exterior of the bed featured aluminum pinstripes over artificial burled black wood. The Blackwood came with only one option, which was a navigation system with a 5" color screen. All of these luxury features limited the practical usability of the Blackwood, and stood in stark contrast to the more utilitarian Cadillac, which was available with [[four-wheel drive]]. Only 3,356 Blackwoods were made in just 15 months of production, with the final models selling well below invoice. Retail price was to be [[United States dollar|US$]]52,500. Lincoln had originally hoped for about 18,000 projected sales in 2002 and 2003, but had announced the discontinuation of the Blackwood before the 2002 model year was over. Among the factors behind the Blackwood's failure were high price and limited cargo versatility. &lt;ref name="Consumer Guide: 2002-03 Lincoln Blackwood"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://consumerguide.com/used/2002-03-lincoln-blackwood|title=Consumer Guide: 2002-03 Lincoln Blackwood|work=Consumer Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Blackwood was delivered late, with first sales in October 2001, due to a supply problem with the cargo box, produced by [[Magna Steyr]]. Ford reportedly froze their contracts with [[Magna International]] for part of 2001 over the issue.

== Replacement ==
Lincoln recreated their unique luxury pickup truck as the [[Lincoln Mark LT|Mark LT]] in the 2006 [[model year]]. However, they did not repeat many of the mistakes made with the Blackwood—particularly its lack of options and versatility. The Lincoln Mark LT was discontinued after the 2008 model year in the United States, but sold in [[Mexico]] through 2014.



==Neiman Marcus Edition==

Fifty special Blackwoods were built for the 2001 [[Neiman Marcus]] spring catalog. These Neiman Marcus Edition Blackwoods featured the company logo stitched into the headrests, a [[leather]]-wrapped rear-console lid with a 7-inch [[Panasonic]] wide-screen [[LCD]] [[DVD]]/[[Video-CD]]/[[CD]] player with wireless headphones and a [[refrigerator|cooler/warmer]]. This special Blackwood was priced at [[United States dollar|US$]]58,800.

The '''Lincoln Custom''' is a custom [[limousine]] and [[long-wheelbase]] [[sedan (car)|touring sedan]] that was built by [[Lincoln Automobile|Lincoln]] in 1941 and 1942 and the lower level series Lincoln produced in 1955. Initially it was a replacement for the large Model K Lincolns (produced from 1934–1939) and earlier luxury cars of the 1920s and 1930s. Later it was simply the lower level series.

The Lincoln Custom was based on the [[Lincoln-Zephyr]], a smaller, unit-bodied, mid-range priced vehicle introduced in 1937 with a smaller 292 cu. inch V-12 (based on the Ford V-8) while drawing many similarities to the [[De Luxe Ford]] and the all-new [[Lincoln Continental]]. This car competed with the smaller [[Packard 110]], [[Packard 120]] and Cadillac [[Series 60]] and [[LaSalle (automobile)|La Salle]]; smaller cars introduced in the mid-1930s to a shrinking luxury car market. The large [[Lincoln K-series|Lincoln Model K]] sold 3024 units in 1934, the first year of its production and only 133 units in the last year, 1939. 1940 saw only the Zephyr and the higher priced [[Lincoln Continental|Continental]] carrying the Lincoln name.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Motor Cars 1920-1042 Photo Archive, Iconographix Photo Archives Series, Osceola, Wisconsin, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

The wheelbase of the Lincoln Custom was {{convert|138|in|m}} compared to the Zephyr's {{convert|125|in|m}}. Both vehicles used the same V-12 engine that was enlarged for 1942 to {{convert|305|cuin|cc}} with {{convert|130|hp|kW}}. The engine was the weakest point of the 1942 models, being very prone to overheating and premature wear. The 305 cubic inch version was reduced to a {{convert|292|cuin|cc|}}, {{convert|120|hp|kW}} version after World War II in an attempt to promote longevity. The V-12 was the only engine used in Lincolns until the new 1949 models came out with a flathead V-8 based on a Ford truck engine.
[[File:1941 Lincoln Custom Limousine Interior.jpg|thumb|left|1941 Lincoln Custom limousine interior]]
The 168H (1941) and 268H (1942) Lincoln Customs featured two models: the Model 31 eight passenger sedan and the model 32 eight passenger limousine. Differences included a division window and different front seat upholstery for the limousine. Both utilized a three speed [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] with [[Borg-Warner]] [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]]. A small number were modified by the few custom coach builders left in the United States before the war. The 1942 models introduced [[power windows]] to the luxury car field; electric and hydro-electric powered limousine dividers having previously been offered.

For 1942, the Zephyr-based waterfall grill was changed to a broad full-width grill that extended above and below the hood and was also used in the 1946-1948 models (Lincoln sedan and Lincoln Continental). These changes were undoubtedly due to the major Cadillac and Packard grill design changes during these immediate pre-war years, whose production and sales far outpaced Lincoln.

After [[World War II]], production of these vehicles was not resumed. The former Zephyr became the only Lincoln sedan and was available in both standard and DeLuxe versions. The famous [[Lincoln Continental]] remained as a limited production, very expensive (and not very reliable) semi-custom offering from the luxury division of Ford Motor Company. For 1949, a major revamp of the entire Lincoln line was made, eliminating the slant-back Zephyr and custom Continental and introducing relatively modern V-8 power.

In 1955, the Lincoln Custom name returned (for one year only) as the lower level series. Brakes were 12" drums.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1955_Lincoln/1955_Lincoln_Brochure/1955%20Lincoln-06.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidential limousine==
A special 1942 limousine was provided to the [[White House]] for the President's use. This car weighed more than {{convert|7000|lb|kg}} and was refitted with a 1946 grill clip after the war for modernization. [[Cadillac]] and Lincoln vied for visibility and prestige by supplying limousines and other special vehicles to the White House (generally by means of a $1.00 per year or other low-cost lease arrangement). [[Packard]] and [[Chrysler]] were rarely able to penetrate this exclusive advertising strategy.

      <comment>9th generation Lincoln Continental is widely considered a full-size luxury sedan. From the 8th to 9th gen, a 4.6L V8 (same block as the Town Car, but more focused on performance - 32V instead of 16V) returned as engine in the Continental. Also, the Continental grew 3 inches in a market in which cars became smaller. The price tag was amongst the same as the Town Car as well. As a reference, see Motorweek's review - they called it full size back then.</comment>

The '''Lincoln Mark LT''' is a [[luxury car|luxury]] [[pickup truck]] that was sold by [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]]. It first went on sale in January 2005 for the 2006 model year. The Mark LT is essentially a rebadged luxury-trimmed version of the popular [[Ford F-150]] truck. The Mark LT is a successor to the failed 2002-only [[Lincoln Blackwood]] (which was never sold in [[Canada]]), Lincoln's only other pickup truck, which was  a [[rear-wheel drive]] vehicle. The Mark LT was built at Ford's [[River Rouge Plant]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]], and at the Ford Cuautitlan plant in [[Cuautitlán]], [[Mexico]], on the same lines as the closely related [[Ford F-150]].  The Mark LT also had optional [[all-wheel drive]].

The Mark LT is based on the [[Ford F-150]] pickup truck. It uses the same 330-cubic-inch, {{Convert|300|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 5.4&amp;nbsp;[[Liter|L]] [[Ford Triton engine#5.4|Triton]] [[V8 engine|V8]] and has four doors.

Lincoln had hoped to sell 13,000 Mark LTs annually in the [[United States]].  The Mark LT was more successful than the Blackwood in its first year of sales with 10,274 sold in the first calendar year of sales (February 2005 through February 2006). The 2006 Mark LT outsold the [[Cadillac Escalade EXT]], but the 2007 EXT gained on the Mark LT's sales consistently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=27379 |title=CROSSOVERS, LINCOLN HIGHLIGHT FORD’S 2007 SALES PERFORMANCE; FURTHER GROWTH EXPECTED IN 2008 |publisher=Media.Ford.com |accessdate=2010-12-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525175615/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=27379 |archivedate=2011-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20090629204401/http://media.gm.com:8221/servlet/GatewayServlet?target=http://image.emerald.gm.com/gmnews/viewmonthlyreleasedetail.do%3Fdomain=6&amp;docid=42261 GM Media Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==First generation (2006–2008)==
For 2007, the Mark LT received a grille facelift, optional [[DVD]]-based [[Automotive navigation system|navigation system]] and other luxury and cosmetic features. For 2008, the Mark LT received the addition of the color of Light French Silk clearcoat metallic and an optional rearview camera back-up system.

==Retirement==
Ford ceased sales of the Lincoln Mark LT in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] after the 2008 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | authorlink = Inside Line | title = RIP: Lincoln Mark LT | date = September 2007 | url = http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId%3D122468 | accessdate = 2007-09-04 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033620/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=122468 | archivedate = 2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its place, Ford created an upper-end trim of the 2009 [[Ford F-150|F-150]] called '''Platinum'''.

==Second generation (2010–2014)==
[[File:Lincoln P415 Mark LT.jpg|thumb|left|Lincoln Mark LT 2nd Generation (Mexico)]]
Although the Mark LT met with slow sales and cancellation in the United States, in Mexico, Lincoln dealers found the pickup to become the best-selling model for the division.  As a result, Lincoln received an all-new Mark LT for the 2010 model year.  Based upon the [[Ford F-Series#Twelfth generation (2009–14)|twelfth generation F-150]] introduced a year before, the Mark LT shared its trim with the F-150 Platinum.  To differentiate it from the Navigator, the Mark LT was given a split grille in the style of the [[Lincoln MKS|MKS]] and [[Lincoln MKT|MKT]].

The Mark LT was built in two versions alongside the F-150: the short-bed ''Dearborn'' and the long bed ''Cuautitlán''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | authorlink = PickupTrucks.com | title = First Look: 2010 Lincoln Mark LT Is For Mexico Only |date=August 2009 | url = http://news.pickuptrucks.com/2009/08/first-look-2010-lincoln-mark-lt-for-mexico-only.html | accessdate = 2011-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the introduction of the [[Ford F-Series thirteenth generation|2015 F-Series]], no Lincoln LT was created, making the 2014 model year the last for the Mark LT.

==Quality==
J.D. Power Quality listed the Mark LT as overall dependability for all 3 years it was manufactured as "among the best" (with a minimum 4 stars for the 2006 variant in initial quality).

[[File:The Sunshine Special.jpg|thumb|right|250px|FDR's 1939 Lincoln K Series Presidential Limousine.]]

The '''''Sunshine Special''''' was the [[official state car]] used by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the [[List of Presidents of the United States|32nd]] [[President of the United States]]. It is said to have been the "First Presidential car to acquire its own personality".&lt;ref&gt;Siuru, William D. and Stewart, Andrea. ''Presidential Cars and Transportation''. Krause Publications, 1995, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a 1939 twelve-cylinder engine, four-door convertible originally built by [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]] and was specifically modified for the President by a speciality coach builder, Brunn &amp; Company, Inc., in [[Buffalo, New York]], at a cost of $4,950 (the original cost of the car was $8,348.74).&lt;ref&gt;Siuru, William D. and Stewart, Andrea. ''Presidential Cars and Transportation''. Krause Publications, 1995, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially called "Old 99," in reference to a number on its first license plate, it was later nicknamed the "''Sunshine Special''" (the exact origin of the nickname is unknown, but it was most likely first used in a photo caption)&lt;ref&gt;Siuru, William D. and Stewart, Andrea. ''Presidential Cars and Transportation''. Krause Publications, 1995, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; as a reference to its [[Convertible (car)|retractable roof]], and was famously enjoyed by the president, who had its roof brought down during public gatherings. At other times, the car was used as traditional presidential transportation. This was in spite of a previous [[List of United States presidential assassination attempts|assassination attempt]] on Roosevelt as he was riding in a [[Buick]] convertible, prior to the creation of the ''Sunshine Special''.

==History==

===Original specifications===
The ''Sunshine Special'' was originally a [[Lincoln K-series]] built by the [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]] division of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], and modified by Brunn &amp; Company to U.S. government specifications. It was powered by a 150[[horsepower|hp]], 414 cubic inch [[V12 engine|V12]] L-head engine. The limousine was originally equipped with a siren, running lights, and a 2-way radio, as well as extra-wide running boards and grab handles for [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents. The vehicle had a convertible roof, hence the reasoning for the car's nickname. The car quickly became known as a favorite of the president, who was a victim of polio and used a wheelchair. With the convertible top down Roosevelt sometimes appeared before crowds without actually leaving the vehicle. There are newsreels of the time showing the car being driven on stage, such as at the podium constructed for a campaign appearance at [[Ebbets Field]] in New York in 1944.

===Following Pearl Harbor===
After the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]], the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] began to express concern in relation to potential [[List of United States presidential assassination attempts|assassination attempts]] on the president, as his limousine at that time was not armored and had no protective features. The Secret Service did not use Al Capone's car on 8 December, as some{{Clarify|reason=|date=September 2019}} think. Images of the president between the White House and Capitol show him in a car that does not match any of Capone's known automobiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDR and Al Capone's Cadillac|url=http://www.myalcaponemuseum.com/id196.htm|website=My Al Capone Museum|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sunshine Special was modified to be capable of protecting him, with armor plating for the doors, bullet-proof tires, inch-thick windows and storage compartments for pistols and sub-machine guns. All of the safety modifications increased the car's weight to 9,300 pounds (4,218 kg). Despite these precautions, Roosevelt preferred to ride with the top down during parades and at most public gatherings. The car was also fitted with the then-current 1942 Lincoln front end in 1942 from the [[Lincoln H-series]].

===Travels===
When the president traveled, the ''Sunshine Special'', along with other Secret Service vehicles, was either driven to the president's destination (if the distance was short) or was transported on a special rail car. One special rail car was equipped with equipment and supplies for the maintenance of the vehicles.

Although some sources allege the ''Sunshine Special'' was transported to [[Tehran Conference|Tehran]], [[Casablanca Conference (1943)|Casablanca]], [[Malta Conference (1945)|Malta]], and [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]], there appears to be no evidence to confirm this. Wartime censorship makes these claims difficult to disprove; but while there are many photographs and newsreels of President Roosevelt riding in standard military-issue Jeeps during the aforementioned overseas trips, there are no photographs of the ''Sunshine Special'' taken on these occasions. The need to maintain secrecy about the president's travel during wartime makes it highly unlikely his special limousine would have been used overseas. The practice of transporting presidential limousines overseas did not start until after the Roosevelt administration. In March 1947 ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' featured a photograph of President Truman visiting the pyramids at Teotihuacan near Mexico City, riding in the ''Sunshine Special'' or another nearly identical Lincoln.

===Following Roosevelt's death===
After Roosevelt’s death in 1945, the ''Sunshine Special'' remained in the White House fleet and was used by [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]] until a new fleet of Lincoln limousines was acquired after the [[1948 presidential election|1948 election]]. The limousine is now on permanent display at the [[The Henry Ford#Henry Ford Museum|Henry Ford Museum]] in Dearborn, [[Michigan]]. The ''Sunshine Special'' did travel to the Potsdam Conference in July 1945, for use by President Truman, including tours of the Potsdam area accompanied by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Admiral Ernest King, and Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, among others.

Kennedy]] in the limousine in [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]], on Main Street, minutes before the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]]. Also in the presidential limousine are [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Mrs. Kennedy]], [[List of governors of Texas|Texas Governor]] [[John Connally]], and his wife, [[Nellie Connally|Mrs. Connally]]. ]]

'''SS-100-X''' was the [[U.S. Secret Service]] code name for the [[Presidential state car (United States)#Age of automobiles (1950–1969)|presidential limousine]] originally used by the [[List of Presidents of the United States|35th]] [[President of the United States]], [[John F. Kennedy]]. The [[limousine]] is the car in which Kennedy and [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]] were passengers when the President was [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] in [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]] on November 22, 1963.

Following Kennedy's assassination, the car received significant armor plating and a bullet-proof hardtop and its navy blue exterior was painted black. It resumed its role as a presidential limousine for President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] until 1967 and later remained in service until 1978, when it was sent to the [[The Henry Ford#Henry Ford Museum|Henry Ford Museum]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]].&lt;ref name="thehenryford.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehenryford.org/research/kennedyLimo.aspx|title=Kennedy Presidential Limousine|publisher=The Henry Ford |accessdate=November 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1961 Lincoln model 74A.jpg|thumb|The car on display in the [[Henry Ford Museum]]]] 
SS-100-X was originally a standard 1961 [[Lincoln Continental#Fourth generation (1961–1969)|Lincoln Continental four door convertible]] (model 74A) built by the Ford Motor Company and assembled at the [[Wixom, Michigan]] plant. It had a retail price of $7,347 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|7347|1961|r=0}}}}, as of {{inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}).

The car was moved to the Experimental Garage at the Ford Proving Grounds where an additional 41 inches was added between the front and rear doors and just beyond the rear doors.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The car's frame was strengthened to accommodate the additional length and weight. It was painted a special [[navy blue]] color and taken to [[Hess &amp; Eisenhardt]] of [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], for reupholstering and further modifications to [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] specifications.{{clarify|There appear to be dueling contentions where significant physical modifications were made|date=January 2017}} During the refit the car had no bulletproof or bullet-resistant additions added. The windshield remained the standard two-ply safety glass which could be easily replaced at any dealership.

It was first delivered to the [[White House]] on June 15, 1961 and measured {{convert|255|in|m}} long, had a wheelbase of {{convert|156|in|m}}, was {{convert|78.6|in|m}} wide, and {{convert|57|in|m}} high.  It weighed {{convert|7,800|lb|kg}}, up {{convert|1,585|lb|kg}} from factory weight, and was powered by a hand-built 350-[[horsepower]] {{convert|430|cuin|cm3|adj=on}} [[Ford MEL engine]].

An open car, the Lincoln was equipped with an assortment of tops, including a snap-together bubble top, a black cover for the bubble, a formal rear top and a [[stainless steel]] forward section (none of which were [[bulletproof]]). It also featured two-way radio telephones&lt;ref name="thehenryford.org"/&gt; and retractable steps and grab-handles for [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents. No armor plate was added to the bodywork, but the [[Chassis|undercarriage]] and all [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] components were strengthened. A [[hydraulic]]ally-lifted rear seat was fitted. At the time of the assassination, the Lincoln had been fitted with a 1962-model front clip ([[Fender (vehicle)|fender]]s, hood, [[grille]] and bumper assemblies).

It had a special short-turn radius, {{convert|61.9|ft|m}}, compared to {{convert|64|ft|m}} on the 1950 Eisenhower "bubbletop" which had been its predecessor.  Total cost of modifications was approximately $200,000 (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|200000|1961}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}). The limousine was registered to the Ford Motor Company and was leased to the Secret Service for a nominal fee of $500 per year (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|500|1961}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}{{inflation-fn|US}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarsweekly.com/news/editors-picks/ss-100-x-lincoln-became-part-history-jfk-tragedy|title=SS-100-X Lincoln became part of history with JFK tragedy|publisher=www.oldcarsweekly.com|accessdate=November 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The limousine carried the District of Columbia license plate GG 300. In November 2015, the license plates were sold at auction for $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=JFK licence plates sell for $100,000 at auction |first= |last= |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-34759098 |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=November 8, 2015 |accessdate=November 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kennedy assassination==
[[File:John F. Kennedy motorcade, Dallas crop.png|thumb|right|JFK, Jackie, and the Connallys in the presidential limousine.]]
On November 21, 1963 SS-100-X was loaded onto a [[Fairchild C-123 Provider]] piloted by Captain Thomason of the [[76th Air Transport Squadron]] and flown to [[Brooks Air Force Base]] in [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]] and then onto [[Dallas Love Field]] in [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]] where it was stored in an underground car park.

Following the shooting of President Kennedy and Governor Connally at approximately 12:30 pm, SS-100-X was driven to [[Parkland Memorial Hospital]], where Kennedy died at 1:00 pm, 30 minutes after he was shot at [[Dealey Plaza]]. The [[Plexiglas]] bubble top and cloth cover were then attached. Later that afternoon at 3:30 pm CST, the limousine was taken to Love Field and loaded on a [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] and flown to [[Andrews Air Force Base]], [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C]]., landing at 8 pm EST. After arrival at Andrews AFB, the limo was delivered to the White House garage.

==Post-assassination==
In late December 1963, the car was sent back to Hess &amp; Eisenhardt to be modified further, and was rebuilt from the ground up. For protection, the Lincoln received [[titanium]] armor plating, bullet-resistant glass and a bulletproof permanent roof. Solid aluminium rims were also fitted inside the tires to make them flat-proof. It remained in service for an additional eight years, logging 50,000 miles on the ground and over one million miles being flown to and from its destinations. The vehicle was equipped with Presidential lap robes and [[Mouton fur|mouton]] carpeting and a complete communications system including radio patch to the White House. It was replaced in 1967 and remained in service doing less important duties until 1978, when it was retired to the [[The Henry Ford#Henry Ford Museum|Henry Ford Museum]]. Finished originally in navy blue, the car was repainted black after the assassination, then repainted again{{clarify|In what color(s)?|date=January 2017}} after each assignment.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.cnn.com/2009-03-18/living/aa.obama.limo_1_jfk-protective-aol-autos/2?_s=PM:LIVING{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Secret Service agent [[Clint_Hill_(Secret_Service)|Clint Hill]], who leapt onto the limousine directly after Kennedy was shot, is the last surviving passenger of the presidential limousine during the assassination.

The '''Lincoln Town Car''' is a model line of [[luxury vehicle#High-end luxury/full-size luxury cars|full-size luxury sedans]] that was marketed by the [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln]] division of the American automaker [[Ford Motor Company]].  Deriving its name from a [[Coupe de Ville#Town car / town brougham|limousine body style]], Lincoln marketed the Town Car from 1981 to 2011, with the nameplate previously serving as the flagship trim of the [[Lincoln Continental]].  Produced across three generations for 30 model years, the Town Car served as the flagship sedan of Ford Motor Company, marketed directly against the [[Cadillac Fleetwood]] (and its [[Cadillac DTS]] successor).      

Marketed nearly exclusively as a four-door sedan (a two-door sedan was offered for 1981 only), many examples of the Town Car were sold for fleet and livery ([[limousine]]) use.  From 1983 to its 2011 discontinuation, the Town Car was the longest car produced by Ford worldwide, becoming the longest mass-production car sold in North America from 1997 to 2011.  While not a direct successor of the Town Car, the [[Lincoln MKS]] would become the longest American sedan until 2016 (overtaken by the [[Cadillac CT6]]).    

From 1980 to 2007, the Lincoln Town Car was assembled in [[Wixom, Michigan]], ([[Wixom Assembly Plant|Wixom Assembly]]) alongside the Lincoln Continental, LS, and Mark VI, VII, and VIII.  After that factory closed, Town Car production moved to [[Southwold, Ontario]], ([[St. Thomas Assembly]]) alongside that of the Ford Crown Victoria and the Mercury Grand Marquis.  That factory was closed in September 2011; the final Town Car was assembled on August 29, 2011.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;      

Within the Lincoln model line, the Town Car was not directly replaced; the nameplate was used from 2012 to 2019 to denote livery/limousine/hearse variants of the [[Lincoln MKT]].  For 2017, the [[Lincoln Continental#Tenth generation (2017–present)|revived Continental]] replaced the MKS, closely matching the Town Car in wheelbase and width.

== Background ==

=== Etymology ===
In the 1920s, a [[Coupe de Ville#Town car / town brougham|town car]] was a body design typically used for limousines. The description originated from the horse-drawn carriage that featured an open chauffeur's compartment with a fixed roof for the passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Temple |first=David W. |title=The Cars of Harley Earl |year=2016 |publisher=CarTech |isbn=9781613252345 |page=137 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=i-0mDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=Town+car+design+originated+horse-drawn+carriage+having+a+fixed+rear+roof+section |accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that era, the fixed rear roof horse-drawn carriage became a limousine and the term "de Ville" in French meant "for town (use)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haajanen |first=Lennart W. |title=Illustrated Dictionary of Automobile Body Styles |year=2018 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9781476624044 |page=65 |edition=Second |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gFwnDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=de+Ville+French+for+“for+town”+(use)+fixed+rear+roof+horse-drawn+carriage+became+a+limousine |accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1922, [[Edsel Ford]] purchased a custom-built [[Lincoln L-Series]] town car as a personal vehicle for his father, Henry Ford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lincoln.com/about/ |title=The Roaring 20s |publisher=Lincoln |accessdate=July 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618141845/http://www.lincoln.com/about/ |archivedate=June 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the "''sedan de Ville''" was used as a model name by Cadillac, the primary rival to the Lincoln Continental from the 1950s to the 1990s.

=== Continental Town Car ===

==== 1959-1960 ====
[[File:1959 Lincoln Continental.JPG|thumb|1959 Continental Mark IV Town Car formal sedan (1 of 214 produced)]]
For 1959, Cadillac and Lincoln introduced the de Ville and Town Car sedan nameplates, with the two rivals taking divergent design paths.  As its mid-range model line, the [[Cadillac de Ville series|Cadillac Sedan de Ville]] was styled with fastback or wraparound rear windows.  Lincoln marketed the Town Car within its flagship Continental model range, styled as a formal-roof sedan with extended rear legroom; slotted above the Town Car, a Limousine was offered with a partition between the front and rear seats.

In place of the reverse-slant roofline used by all other Continentals (including convertibles), the Town Car/Limousine was styled with a notchback roofline with a padded vinyl top.  In addition to the slightly restrained styling, the change in the roofline was also functional.  To add rear-seat legroom, the rear seat was repositioned without any modification in wheelbase.   

One of the rarest vehicles ever produced by Ford Motor Company&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217223951/http://newfreelifestyle.com/?p=1742|title=LINCOLN CONTINENTAL MARK IV 1960 - New Free Lifestyle|date=2017-02-17|access-date=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;, 214 Town Cars and 83 Limousines were produced from 1959 to 1960; all examples were painted black.

==== 1970-1979 ====
For 1970, the Town Car name returned as a trim package option, including leather seating surfaces and deeper cut-pile carpeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1970 Lincoln Continental Brochure |url= http://oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1970_Lincoln/1970%20Lincoln%20Continental%20Brochure/1970%20Lincoln%20Continental-09.html |website=oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=17 July 2018 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For 1971, a limited-edition (1500 produced) Golden Anniversary Continental Town Car commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of Lincoln.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://automotivemileposts.com/lincoln/lincoln1971goldenanniversary.html|title=1971 Lincoln Continental Golden Anniversary Town Car|website=automotivemileposts.com|access-date=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For 1972, the Town Car was introduced as a sub-model of the Lincoln Continental model line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://automotivemileposts.com/contentslincoln.shtml|title=1952-1979 Lincoln and Lincoln Continental {{!}} AUTOMOTIVE MILEPOSTS|website=automotivemileposts.com|access-date=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On nearly all examples, a [[Vinyl roof|vinyl top]] covered the rear half of the roof, with a full-length configuration optional. A raised molding over the roof incorporated coach lamps on the [[Pillar (car)|B-pillars]].  For 1973, Lincoln introduced a two-door variant of the Continental Town Car, named the Town Coupe.  As with the Town Car, the Town Coupe was offered with a standard vinyl roof.

As part of the 1975 redesign of the Lincoln roofline, the Town Car adopted the oval opera windows of the Mark IV coupe, with the Town Coupe given a large rectangular opera window.

The Continental Town Car proved to be a success for the division, becoming the most popular Lincoln vehicle of the 1970s (as the Mark IV and Mark V were not technically branded as Lincolns).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  &lt;gallery mode="packed" caption="(Lincoln) Continental Town Cars: 1959-1960, 1970-1979"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== 1980 ====
For 1980, Lincoln became the final American brand to market [[Downsize (automobile)|downsized full-size cars]].  In its redesign, the Lincoln Continental shifted from the largest production sedan in North America to a design with a smaller exterior footprint than Cadillac.  The Continental Town Car returned as the top trim for the Lincoln model range; in its own downsizing, the [[Lincoln Mark series|Mark series]] introduced the [[Lincoln Continental Mark VI|Continental Mark VI]].  Though technically not badged a Lincoln, the Mark VI shared its chassis and much of the body with the Continental to reduce development and production costs.

While Lincoln had brought downsized model lines to production, from a marketing standpoint, the consolidation of the Continental, Continental Town Car/Town Coupe, and the Mark VI proved catastrophic.  Following the early 1980 withdrawal of the slow-selling [[Lincoln Versailles]], Lincoln-Mercury dealers offered three highly similar vehicles across a wide price range in the same showroom.  The discontinuation of the Versailles also marked the return of Lincoln exclusively to the full-size sedan segment, leaving nothing to sell against European-brand luxury vehicles.

For 1981, Lincoln underwent a revision to transition its full-size model range from three nameplates to one, commencing a multi-year transition throughout all three Ford divisions.  For 1981, the Continental went on hiatus, with Lincoln shifting the nameplate to a mid-size sedan for 1982.  The Mark VI ended its model cycle in 1983; for 1984, the [[Lincoln Continental Mark VII|Mark VII]] exited the full-size segment, shifting the Mark Series into a different market segment.

For the 1981 model year, the Lincoln Continental Town Car was renamed the Lincoln Town Car as a stand-alone model line.  Largely similar to its 1980 Lincoln Continental counterpart, the 1981 Lincoln Town Car retained two-door and four-door configurations (with the separate Town Coupe name discontinued).  After slow sales, the Town Car two-door ended production for 1982. During its development, all vehicles of the Ford Panther platform were slated for discontinuation during the mid-1980s (largely in anticipation of further stringent fuel prices).  With an uncertain future before fuel prices stabilized in the early 1980s, few functional updates were made during its production.

=== Chassis ===
The 1980–1989 Lincoln Continental/Town Car utilized the [[Ford Panther platform|Panther platform]] shared with Ford and Mercury. Delayed to the 1980 model year due to engineering issues, the Panther platform meant radically different exterior dimensions for the Lincoln models. Although extended three inches in wheelbase over its Ford/Mercury/Mark VI coupe counterparts, the 1980-1989 versions would have the shortest wheelbase ever used for a full-size Lincoln at the time (10 inches shorter than its 1979 predecessor and shorter than a [[Mercedes-Benz W126|Mercedes-Benz 380SEL]]). The 1980 Continental/Town Car was the shortest Lincoln since the [[Lincoln Versailles|Versailles]]. In the interest of fuel economy and handling, the Panther chassis reduced weight by up to 1400&amp;nbsp;lbs compared to the 1970-1979 full-size Lincolns. As the lightest full-size Lincoln in 40 years, the 1980 Continental/Town Car came within less than 200 pounds of the curb weight of the compact-sized Versailles. The new Panther platform meant reduced overall size, better suspension geometry, and upgraded power steering with a reduced turning diameter by over 8 feet (compared to the 1979 Lincoln Continental). For 1984, gas-pressurized shocks were added.

To achieve better [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE) results, Ford discontinued the 400 and 460 big-block V8s in its full-size cars. For 1980, a 130&amp;nbsp;hp 4.9&amp;nbsp;L V8 (the 302 Windsor, marketed as a "5.0&amp;nbsp;L" V8) was the standard engine. A 140&amp;nbsp;hp 351&amp;nbsp;CID V8 was available as an option. Following the introduction of the Lincoln Town Car in 1981, the 5.0&amp;nbsp;L V8 became the only available engine (with the 351 becoming an option for Ford and Mercury). In Canada, the 5.0&amp;nbsp;L V8 remained carbureted until 1985. In 1986, the 5.0&amp;nbsp;L V8 was revised to 150&amp;nbsp;hp, following a redesign of the fuel-injection system with the introduction of sequential multi-port fuel injection. These engines are identifiable by their cast aluminum upper intake manifolds with horizontal throttle body (vertical throttle plate); this replaced the traditional throttle body with a carburetor-style top-mounted air cleaner previously used. Introduced in the Lincoln Continental for 1980 and marketed in all Panther-platform vehicles in 1981, the Lincoln Town Car was equipped with the 4-speed [[Ford AOD transmission|AOD]] automatic overdrive transmission, the sole transmission of 1981-1989 examples. 

All Town Cars from 1980 to 1989 featured an optional [[trailer (vehicle)|trailer]] towing package which included [[exhaust system|dual exhausts]], a 3.55:1 [[limited slip differential]] (code 'K') and an improved [[Radiator (engine cooling)|cooling package]] for the engine as well as transmission.

=== Body ===

==== Exterior ====
During the late 1970s, the sales of the Lincoln Continental had held steady and the Continental Mark V would go on to outsell its Cadillac Eldorado counterpart. In the development of the Lincoln Town Car, the design themes of the 1977-1979 Lincoln Continental and Mark V would both influence the exterior design of the 1980 Continental/Town Car. As with its predecessors, the Town Car features nearly flat body sides, sharp-edged fenders, and a radiator-style grille. In a major departure, hideaway headlamps gave way to exposed halogen headlamps (the first on a full-size Lincoln since 1969). Another first included fully framed door glass (retractable vent windows were now standard); in sharp contrast to its Ford and Mercury counterparts, the window frames were painted matte black. While chrome trim remained around the headlamps and window frames, in a break from Lincoln tradition, it was deleted from the top of the fenders. Though mechanically similar to the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis (the Ford LTD Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis after 1983), the Lincoln Town Car shared visible body panels only with the Continental Mark VI. In contrast to its Ford, Mercury, and Mark VI counterparts, the rooflines of 1981-1989 Town Cars feature a vertical [[Quarter glass|quarter window]] in the [[C-pillar]].

After only 4,935 two-door Town Cars were sold in 1981, the bodystyle was discontinued for 1982. In the shift from rebadging the Continental to the Lincoln Town Car for 1981, Lincoln replaced the "Continental" badging above the headlights with "Town Car", which was removed in 1984.

A padded roof was standard equipment on all Town Cars, with its design determined by trim level. On standard-trim Town Cars, a leather-grained vinyl full-length covering with center pillar coach lamps was fitted. For Signature Series and Cartier trims, a padded vinyl coach roof (covering the rear half of the roof) with a frenched (smaller) rear window opening was fitted; the coach roof was also an option on standard-trim Town Cars. On non-Cartier Town Cars, a full-length cloth (canvas) roof was an option; imitating the look of a convertible, the design deleted the C-pillar quarter windows.

During the 1980s, the Lincoln Town Car would undergo several exterior revisions. For 1985, the model was given a mid-cycle facelift. In addition to (slightly) improving its aerodynamics, the design was intended to visually shorten the car (though length was essentially unchanged). The front and rear bumpers were redesigned, better integrating them into the bodywork. The rear fascia was redesigned; distinguished by redesigned taillamps, the trunklid was better integrated with the rear fenders. For 1986, to meet federal regulations, a center brake light was added in the rear window. For 1988, the grille was updated with a brushed-metal panel between the taillamps, which now featured the reverse lamps.

1989 models are distinguished by special trim features including satin black paint for grille blades, trim between headlights, and amber (instead of clear) front parking lamps. The ''"Lincoln"'' front-end badging is moved from above left headlight onto grille and changed to large sans-serif script. In the rear, the brushed-metal panel was given a pinstripe finish and all badging was moved from the panel onto the trunk lid. All models feature a landau roof with a smaller, more formal "frenched" rear window. All non-Cartier models also include an embedded Lincoln "star" emblems in their [[opera window]]s

==== Interior ====
The interior of the Lincoln Town Car featured many advanced luxury options for its time. Signature Series and Cartier models featured 6-way power seats (and manual seatback recliners) for the driver and front passenger; the Lincoln Town Car adopted a split front bench seat previously seen on the Mark coupes. Several electronic features included an optional digital-display [[trip computer]] showing the driver "miles to empty" and (based on driver input) an "estimated time of arrival". A [[keypad]]-based [[keyless entry system]] unlocked the vehicle through a 5-digit combination (factory-programmed or owner-programmed). Mounted above the driver door handle, the keypad allowed the driver to lock all four doors; after entering the code, the driver could unlock the doors or release the trunklid. Along with keyfob-based systems, the keypad system is still in use on Ford and Lincoln vehicles (as of 2017).

As part of the 1985 update, the Lincoln Town Car was the first Ford vehicle to feature a CD player as an option (as part of a 12-speaker JBL premium stereo system);&lt;ref name="Box Panther History"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grandmarq.net/tiggie/History.htm | title=The Complete "Box" Panther History | accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 1984 was the final year for the option of 8-track players and CB radios for the Town Car.&lt;ref name="Box Panther History" /&gt;

In a functional change, the horn button was moved from the turn-signal lever to the steering wheel hub.&lt;ref name="Box Panther History"/&gt; The door trim was changed from wood to upholstery matching the seats.&lt;ref name="Box Panther History" /&gt; For 1986, the front-seat [[head restraint]]s were replaced with a taller 4-way articulating design; walnut burl trim replaced much of the satin black trim on the lower dash. For 1988, the instrument cluster was updated; for Town Cars with analog gauges, the instrument panel was given round dials in square bezels. In addition, new wood trim was added to the dashboard and steering wheel.&lt;gallery mode="packed" caption="1981-1989 Lincoln Town Car"&gt;

=== Trim ===
At its 1980 launch, the Lincoln Town Car was offered in two trim levels, a standard/base trim and a Lincoln Town Car Signature Series (a name shared with the Mark VI, though with less exclusive features).&lt;ref name="Box Panther History"/&gt; In 1982, Lincoln adopted the Mark-Series tradition of Designer Series editions as the Cartier Edition was shifted from the Mark VI to the Town Car, becoming the top trim level;&lt;ref name="Box Panther History"/&gt; the Cartier Edition would remain part of the Town Car line through the 2003 model year.

==== Special editions ====
'''Cartier Designer Edition'''

In 1982, in a trim level shift, the Cartier Edition was moved from the Mark Series to the Lincoln Town Car. As before, the special-edition package consisted of exclusively-coordinated exterior colors and interior designs, with the Cartier logo embroidered in place of the Lincoln "star" emblem on the seats. For 1987, the package underwent a redesign with new upholstery design and new two-tone (metallic beige) platinum added alongside the traditional platinum silver and two-tone arctic white.

'''Sail America Commemorative Edition'''&lt;br /&gt;This special edition 1987 Signature Series model came in white with a blue carriage roof and had a white leather interior with blue piping and special badging. Ford Motor Company was one of the corporate sponsors of the "Sail America Foundation" syndicate, owner of the 1987 America's Cup winning yacht ''Stars &amp; Stripes 87.''

'''Special Edition'''&lt;br /&gt;The 1988 Town Car Signature Series was available with a $2,461 'Special Edition package', which included a carriage roof (giving the appearance of a convertible top), wire spoke aluminum wheels, JBL audio system, leather-wrapped steering wheel, and leather upholstery with contrasting-color piping. This replaced a proposed [[Gucci]] edition Town Car that had been in the works.

'''Gucci Edition'''&lt;br /&gt;1989 Signature Series Gucci Edition had a special blue canvas roof with a fluorescent b-pillar light and a special blue badge on the C Pillar with the word signature. It was designated in the VIN number as code 84.

=== Marketing ===
For the 1985 model year, the Cadillac [[Cadillac DeVille|Sedan de Ville]] and [[Cadillac Fleetwood|Fleetwood]], traditional competitors of the Lincoln Town Car, shifted to front-wheel drive platforms, becoming smaller than the Lincoln Continental. At the time, Lincoln marketed the larger size of the Town Car as a selling point. In response to the downsized Cadillacs, Lincoln introduced a series of advertisements in late 1985 titled ''"The Valet"'' which depicted parking attendants having trouble distinguishing Cadillacs from lesser [[Buick]]s (Electras) and [[Oldsmobile]]s (Ninety-Eights), with the question "Is that a Cadillac?" answered by the response "No, it's an Oldsmobile...or Buick." At the end, the owner of a Lincoln would appear with the line "The Lincoln Town Car please." The commercial campaign saw the emergence of the new advertising line for the brand, "''Lincoln. What a Luxury Car Should Be.''" which was used into the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Youtube, 1993 Lincoln Commercial"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMJSXyTnOhI|title=Youtube, 1993 Lincoln Commercial|accessdate=August 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Town Car retained its traditional layout and large size, fuel prices dropped to a contemporary new low at the time, and operating economy became less of a concern to buyers than a decade prior.

After ten years on the market (nine of them as the Town Car) relatively unchanged, the Lincoln Town Car was given an extensive redesign inside and out, being launched on October 5, 1989, as a 1990 model. In a move to bring a new generation of buyers to the Lincoln brand, the Town Car adopted a far more contemporary image, bringing it in line with the Continental and Mark VII. In addition, the Town Car adopted a new range of safety and luxury features and would mark the debut of a powertrain that would see usage in a wide variety of Ford Motor Company vehicles.

The second-generation Town Car was a sales success and became one of the best-selling full-size U.S. luxury sedans. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Town Car sales regularly exceeded 100,000 units with 120,121 Town Cars being sold in 1994 alone.&lt;ref name="Forbes sales figures"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbesautos.com/news/headlines/2006/july/fdc071806-town_car.html?partner=rss|title=Forbes on the Town Car, sales figures since 1994|accessdate=October 3, 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212140132/http://www.forbesautos.com/news/headlines/2006/july/fdc071806-town_car.html?partner=rss|archivedate=December 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the discontinuation of the [[Cadillac Fleetwood]] by General Motors after 1996, the Lincoln Town Car became the longest-length regular-production sedan sold in the United States.

The Town Car was named the 1990 [[Motor Trend Car of the Year]].

=== Development ===
The second-generation Town Car was developed from 1985 to 1989 under the codename FN36, at a cost of $650 million USD, led by project manager John Jay. Following its downsizing to the Panther platform in 1980, the Lincoln Town Car was originally slated to be discontinued by the middle of the decade and replaced by a smaller front-wheel drive sedan; after the 1979 fuel crisis, gasoline prices were predicted to reach $2.50 per gallon and Ford Motor Company had lost $1.5 billion for 1980.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-10-08/business/fi-523_1_town-car-luxury/2|title=Town Car Odessey: In the redesign of its consummately American luxury sedan, Lincoln turned to Japan and Europe for help |last=Risen |first=James |date=1989-10-08|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-11-19 |issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1984, full-size Lincoln sales had rapidly increased, with 1984 sales up 300% over 1980.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By the early 1980s, instead of ending the product cycle of the Lincoln Town Car, Ford product planners instead chose its front-wheel drive mid-size platform (of the Ford Taurus) to become the next-generation Lincoln Continental.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In August 1985, Ford designers began sketching and constructing clay models of competing designs under lead designer Gale Halderman and Ford Group Design Vice President Jack Telnack, with a final design chosen in May 1986; two full-scale (1:1) proposals were reviewed by a four-member design committee, chaired by CEO [[Donald Petersen]], [[Jack Telnack]], Ford President [[Harold Poling]], and [[William Clay Ford Sr.|William Clay Ford]], vice chairman.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-10-08/business/fi-523_1_town-car-luxury/3|title=Town Car Odessey: In the redesign of its consummately American luxury sedan, Lincoln turned to Japan and Europe for help |last=Risen |first=James |date=1989-10-08|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-11-19 |issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various proposals were considered ranging from a conservative update of the existing Town Car to a European-style body in the design language of the 1988 Lincoln Continental (FN-9, designed in 1984).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The final compromise of the committee sought to keep the identity of the Town Car (thus avoiding repeating the mistakes of Cadillac) while introducing a contemporary vehicle for the 1990s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the interest of fuel economy, the Lincoln Town Car was required to become more aerodynamic (reducing wind noise),&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; but key parts of its design were integrated into its design, with its radiator-style grille, chrome trim, and opera windows.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a major design constraint, the design team was not to make any major reductions in size to the Town Car, preserving its large interior and trunk space as key marketing points to buyers.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-10-08/business/fi-523_1_town-car-luxury/4|title=Town Car Odessey: In the redesign of its consummately American luxury sedan, Lincoln turned to Japan and Europe for help |last=Risen |first=James |date=1989-10-08|work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=2017-11-19 |issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, a second factor driving the design of the FN36 project was initiated, as the United States government introduced regulations mandating passive restraints on vehicles produced after September 1, 1989; along with [[automatic seat belts]], out of necessity, automakers began to reconsider the use of [[airbag]]s as passive restraints. By 1988, dual airbags remained nearly unused in cars sold in the United States, with the exception of the Mercedes S-Class (W126) and the Porsche 944.&lt;ref name="Company News 1988 NY Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/26/business/company-news-airbags-on-the-way-as-chrysler-gives-in.html?pagewanted=all|title=Company News; Airbags on the Way As Chrysler Gives In|last=Holusha|first=John|date=26 May 1988|website=The New York Times|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1988/Ford-Offers-Airbags-For-Passengers-As-Standard-Equipment/id-79d97f461ef138ab538726bf1b418ead|title=Ford Offers Airbags For Passengers As Standard Equipment|last=Braunstein|first=Jane|date=22 June 1988|agency=The Associated Press|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To comply with the legislation, Lincoln introduced the 1988 Continental with dual airbags, becoming the first Ford Motor Company (and first domestically-produced vehicle) with them standard.&lt;ref name="Reuters NY Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/21/business/company-news-89-lincoln-model-to-have-2-airbags.html|title=Company News; '89 Lincoln Model To Have 2 Airbags|date=20 June 1988|website=New York Times|agency=Reuters|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Early Returns"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-01-07/travel/9001020328_1_air-bags-tempos-and-topazes-driver-and-passenger-side-air|title=Early Returns Show Air Bags Passing Crash Course|last=Szczesny|first=Joseph|date=7 January 1990|website=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As adding airbags to the 1988-1989 Town Car would require a redesign of the steering column and entire dashboard, dual airbag were moved to the FN36 project, making them an intended standard feature.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

At the time the FN36 project was launched in 1985, to extend the life of the Town Car, Lincoln-Mercury began a number of advertisements satirizing the newly introduced 1986 Cadillac model line, making them out to be indistinguishable from a Buick, Pontiac, and Oldsmobile.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although the downsizing of Cadillac initially increased sales, the Lincoln-Mercury ad campaign diverted many buyers to the Town Car and Continental, with over 200,000 Town Cars sold in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grandmarq.net/tiggie/Box%20Panther%20Production%20Numbers.htm|title=Box Panther Production Numbers|website=www.grandmarq.net|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1986, the design freeze for the project occurred, with an intended production start of mid-1989. The second-generation Lincoln Town Car would become the first domestic Ford vehicle engineered outside of the company and constructed by foreign suppliers, with [[International Automotive Design]] of Brighton, England handling the engineering, while Japan-based Ogihara Iron Works supplying all of the Town Car body panels from its own factory near the Wixom plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-10-08/business/fi-523_1_town-car-luxury/5|title=Town Car Odessey: In the redesign of its consummately American luxury sedan, Lincoln turned to Japan and Europe for help |last=Risen |first=James |date=1989-10-08|work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=2017-11-19 |issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; To improve quality of prototypes, project managers broke from automotive industry precedent, requiring successive hand-built prototypes to be built to production-level quality to determine the locations and causes of specific issues of tooling and manufacturing. From 1988 to 1989, the Town Car would go from over a year behind its production date to two weeks ahead of schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-10-08/business/fi-523_1_town-car-luxury/6|title=Town Car Odessey: In the redesign of its consummately American luxury sedan, Lincoln turned to Japan and Europe for help |last=Risen |first=James |date=1989-10-08|work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=2017-11-19 |issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chassis ===
To lower the development and production costs of the extensive redesign, Ford Motor Company retained the Panther platform for the Lincoln Town Car, continuing its use of rear-wheel drive. In a major change, rear air suspension (introduced as an option for all three Panther vehicles in 1988) became standard equipment on all Town Cars. For 1990, the Town Car was produced with 11-inch rear drum brakes (identical to its 1989 predecessor); for 1991, they were replaced by 10-inch solid rotor disc brakes.

Due to development delays in the Modular engine program, the 1990 Lincoln Town Car was released with the same powertrain as its predecessor: a 150&amp;nbsp;hp 5.0L (4.9L) V8 with a 4-speed AOD overdrive automatic.&lt;ref name="Town Car Has It All"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1990-05-31/topic/9005310883_1_lincoln-town-car-luxury-cars-quieter-car|title=Town Car Has It All - But Genuine Wood|last=Truett|first=Richard|date=31 May 1990|website=Orlando Sentinel|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1990, the 5.0L V8 was replaced by a 190&amp;nbsp;hp 4.6L SOHC [[Ford Modular engine|Modular]] V8 for 1991 models; for the 1994 model year, the optional 210&amp;nbsp;hp dual-exhaust version of the engine became standard. Shared with the Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis, the SOHC version of the 4.6L Modular V8 would see use in a number of other Ford vehicles within the Ford light-truck line, remaining in production into 2014. For 1993, the AOD transmission was converted to electronic operation, becoming the AOD-E. In 1994, along with a mid-cycle refresh, the 1995 Town Car received the higher-torque 4R70W from the Lincoln Mark VIII.

=== Body ===
The second-generation Lincoln Town Car was designed by Gale Halderman and Ford Group Design Vice President Jack Telnack.

==== Exterior ====
In its redesign for the 1990 model year, Lincoln stylists sought a completely new design for the Town Car. Many traditional Lincoln styling cues were heavily reworked or abandoned completely. Although the Town Car would keep its formal notchback sedan roofline, the flat-sided fenders and angular lines seen since the Continentals and Mark IIIs of the late 1960s disappeared. Stylists made the body more aerodynamic reducing drag coefficient from 0.46 to 0.36 (matching the 1988 Continental and besting the Mark VII).&lt;ref name="Automobile-catalog.com" /&gt; The 1990 Town Car still retained several styling influences, including its vertical taillights, radiator-style grille, hood ornament, alloy wheels, and vertical C-pillar window. In a move to market the Town Car towards buyers of contemporary vehicles, several other changes were made. Although two-tone paint remained available (featuring a lower body accent color in gray metallic), monotone paint schemes would become increasingly standard. In a major change, a vinyl roof was no longer offered, since vinyl roofs declined in popularity among many buyers. Spoked aluminum wheels were dropped from the options list for 1990, while locking wire wheel discs remained through 1992.

In late 1992, the exterior was given a minor update with a new grille and slightly redesigned tail lamp lenses (distinguished by a "checkerboard" pattern) for 1993 models. As with the Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis, the Town Car received a larger update for the 1995 model year in late 1994 as the FN116.&lt;ref&gt;http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:inMCA-Qh9rUJ:edit.autonews.com/article/19950501/ANA/505010774/%26template%3Dprint%26nocache%3D1+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&lt;/ref&gt;. This facelift is best distinguished by the deletion of the fixed quarter glass in the rear doors along with the redesign of the side mirrors (enlarged and changed to body-color). Although the bumper largely remained unchanged, the front fascia was updated as the headlamp clusters are changed to a clear-lens design and separated from the grille. The grille was redesigned, returning to the 1990-1992 design in a surround fitting closer to the body. The rear fascia saw the trim between the tail lamps redesigned, featuring additional running lights, while the reverse lamps were moved from the outer edges of the reflector panel to the center, beneath the lid lock cover (similar to the 1985 - 1987 models).

==== Interior ====
In a departure from the Lincoln Continental and Mark VII, the use of the Panther platform necessitated a degree of component sharing with the Ford and Mercury counterparts. Although fitted with its own seats and door panels,&lt;ref name="Design changes for the second generation Town Car"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolntowncar.org/|title=Design changes for the second generation Town Car|accessdate=August 2, 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060803102427/http://www.lincolntowncar.org/|archivedate=August 3, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Town Car was fitted with essentially the same dashboard as the [[Mercury Grand Marquis]] (versions with digital instruments retain the instrument panel layout from 1988-1989). In 1993, the wood trim was changed to an orange-toned walnut. Due to its popularity (and to better separate the Town Car from its Ford/Mercury counterparts), the digital instrument panel was made standard; as such, the climate-control system was converted to a digital display.

As part of its 1995 Mid-cycle refresh, the interior saw a greater degree of change than the exterior. To bring the design up to date (and in line with the rest of the Lincoln line), the dashboard and door panels featured a curved design, while influenced by the Mark VIII, the 6-passenger design of the Town Car precluded the adoption of a center console in the interior. To increase storage space, the dual center armrests of the front seats on Signature and Cartier models were redesigned to include storage compartments (to hold cassettes and the optional cellular telephone). The dashboard design continued into the new door panels, now with an illuminated power window and seat adjuster cluster, and back-lit power door lock switch placed higher on the door. Releases for the trunk and fuel door were moved from the dashboard onto the lower driver's door. Redesigned seat patterns now offered an available driver and front passenger electric heat feature. The radio antenna was integrated into the rear window.&lt;ref name="Design changes for the second generation Town Car" /&gt; Although the basic controls of the interior remained common across all Panther vehicles, the Town Car gained a model-specific instrument panel, featuring italicized readouts.

For 1996, the climate controls were again redesigned; while Cartier Designer Editions featured genuine wood trim on the dashboard and door panels. In 1997, few changes were made: the rear center armrest added a pair of cup holders, while Cartier models gained rear-seat vanity mirrors mounted in the headliner. Also in 1997, the trim level badges were moved to the front fenders in place of the "Town Car" badges. Subsequently, the rear side opera windows no longer featured their trim level engravings. &lt;gallery mode="packed" caption="1990-1997 Lincoln Town Car"&gt;

=== Trim ===
Upon its redesign in October 1989, the Lincoln Town Car carried over its three previous trim levels: base, Signature Series, and Cartier Designer Edition. For 1991, the base trim was renamed Executive Series. From 1989 to 1996, the Lincoln Town Car was available with a factory towing package.

The Base (Executive Series from 1991MY onward) Town Car offered six-passenger seating with two bench seats, a four-speaker AM/FM stereo with cassette player, 6-way front power seats, a four-speed automatic overdrive transmission, cloth seating surfaces, fifteen-inch tires, dashboard clock, and keyless entry with Ford's SecuriCode keyless entry keypad.

The Signature Series added a digital vacuum fluorescent instrument cluster, trip computer, and standard alloy wheels. The Cartier Edition was fitted with the same features as the Signature Series, adding a JBL-branded sound system with amplifier, a security system, alloy spoked wheels, and other exclusive details, such as cloth and leather seats. In a departure from tradition, starting in 1990, Cartier Designer Edition Town Cars were no longer available in a single color combination yearly, but in several different interior/exterior combinations.&lt;ref name="1990 Lincoln Town Car Brochure"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolntowncar.org/ltcgallery/brochure90towncar/index.htm |title=1990 Lincoln Town Car Brochure |accessdate=November 18, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821092348/http://www.lincolntowncar.org/ltcgallery/brochure90towncar/index.htm |archivedate=August 21, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, aside from gray lower body trim offered as an option for Signature Series Town Cars, Cartier Editions became the only two-tone versions of the Town Car.

==== Special editions ====
[[File:1992 Lincoln Town Car Jack Nicklaus.jpg|thumb|1992 Lincoln Town Car Jack Nicklaus Signature Series]]
In addition to the three standard trims of the Lincoln Town Car, various special edition option packages were produced by Lincoln (excluding dealer-produced versions).

'''Jack Nicklaus Signature Series (1992-1997)'''&lt;br /&gt;The [[Jack Nicklaus]] Signature Series was a special-edition option package for the Town Car Signature Series that was featured a green exterior with a white top; the interior consisted of white leather with green accents. Another version of the package was sold with a white exterior and a standard roof; the interior trim was similar, with white leather seats and green carpets and trim.

Most Jack Nicklaus editions have ornaments and wording on the exterior trimmed in gold including green and gold "Golden Bear" badges on the front fenders.&lt;ref name="Lincoln Town Car Special Editions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolntowncar.org/other/specialeditions.html |title=1Town Car Special Editions |accessdate=November 18, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060811031240/http://www.lincolntowncar.org/other/specialeditions.html |archivedate=August 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Options included on the 1992 to 1997 Jack Nicklaus Signature Series included: Memory Seats with Power Lumbar/Recliner, Leather Seats and Monotone Paint.

'''Regatta Edition (1994)'''&lt;br /&gt;The Regatta Edition was a maritime-themed special-edition option package for the Signature Series, with approximately 1,500 produced. The package consisted of White Oxford leather seats (with optional blue seat piping), with regatta blue carpeting; the doors and instrument panel featured matching blue-color trim.

The package was often paired with a white oxford vinyl carriage roof featuring embroidery on the "C" pillar near the opera windows.

'''Spinnaker Edition (1995)'''&lt;br /&gt;Replacing the Regatta Edition, the Spinnaker Edition option package featured tri-coat paint, two-toned leather seats, the Spinnaker logo on the floor mats, and 16" spoked [[Alloy wheel|aluminum wheels]].

'''Diamond Anniversary Edition (1996)'''&lt;br /&gt;To commemorate the 75th anniversary of Lincoln in 1996, the division sold a Diamond Anniversary Edition of the Town Car Signature Series (alongside the Continental and Mark VIII). Featuring a unique accent stripe, leather seats, wood instrument panel trim, window badging, [[Mobile phone|cellular telephone]], power [[Sunroof|moonroof]], [[JBL (company)|JBL]] audio system, auto electrochromatic dimming mirror with compass, and [[Limited slip differential|traction assist]],&lt;ref name="Lincoln Town Car Options list with Prices"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolntowncar.org/tech/LINCOLNTOWNCAROPTIONS.html |title=Town Car Options list with Prices |accessdate=November 18, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060811190447/http://www.lincolntowncar.org/tech/LINCOLNTOWNCAROPTIONS.html |archivedate=August 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Diamond Anniversary Edition included nearly every available option on the Lincoln Town Car.

'''Cypress Edition (1996)'''&lt;br /&gt;The Cypress Edition of the Signature Series featured Cypress Gold Frost exterior paint, a two-toned leather interior, and red Cypress tree badging.

=== Features ===
At its 1990 redesign, the Lincoln Town Car was offered with relatively few options, with nearly all features as standard equipment. On the Signature Series, the only options were leather seat trim, a moonroof, a 10-disc CD changer, JBL sound system, security system, and onboard telephone.

The redesign highlighted several new features that had never been available before on the Town Car. A two-position driver's memory seat was standard on Cartier Editions (optional on Signature Series); the memory seats featured 8-way adjustment for both seats and inflatable lumbar support. While technically a carryover feature from 1989, the [[Electrochromism|Electrochromic Dimming Mirror]] was redesigned for the much wider rear window of the new Town Car.

A number of advances were made in the safety features available for the Lincoln Town Car, with [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] becoming an optional feature in 1990. Following the return of 4-wheel disc brakes to the Town Car in 1991 (for the first time since 1979), ABS became standard in 1992. Initially, the 1990 Town Car came with dual airbags as standard equipment. However, due to a March 14, 1990 fire at the facility where the passenger airbag's propellant was produced,&lt;ref name="Airbag Fire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1990-03-29/topic/9003282095_1_sabag-trw-passenger-side-air-bags|title=Fire Means Passenger Airbags Are Delayed For 2 Lincolns|date=29 March 1990|website=Orlando Sentinel|publisher=Crain News Service|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the passenger airbag essentially became a [[delete option]], with a credit on the window sticker issued for the price of the missing airbag. Upon owner request, for the price of the issued credit, the passenger airbag would be installed once supply became available.&lt;ref name="Air Bag Retrofit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1990-05-31/topic/9005300027_1_retrofit-passenger-side-air-bags-town-cars|title=Air Bag Retrofitting To Cost Ford Millions|last1=Clark|first1=Laura|date=31 May 1990|website=Orlando Sentinel|publisher=Crain Communications|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the beginning of the 1992 model year, all Town Cars come equipped with dual airbags from the factory.

The third generation of the Lincoln Town Car was unveiled at the [[New York International Auto Show#1997|1997 New York International Auto Show]], going on sale in November 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lctmag.com/vehicles/article/40986/all-new-98-lincoln-town-car-focuses-on-world-class-functional-performance|title=All-New ‘98 Lincoln Town Car Focuses on World-Class Functional Performance - Vehicles - Luxury Coach &amp; Transportation|author=|date=|website=www.lctmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the 1998 model year, all three Panther-platform sedans underwent complete exterior and interior redesigns, with the Town Car given the most extensive revision.  Shifting away from the straight-lined design language used by full-size Lincoln sedans for over 35 years, the 1998 Town Car adopted the rounded exterior of the [[Lincoln Mark VIII]] and 1995 Lincoln Continental.  The third-generation Town Car was introduced nearly concurrently with the [[Lincoln Navigator]], the first SUV sold by the Lincoln division.

The third generation of the Town Car marked several major changes within Lincoln-Mercury.  From 1999 to 2002, the Lincoln-Mercury division became a brand of [[Premier Automotive Group]], a division of Ford created to manage its premium automotive brands acquired during the 1990s; following organizational difficulties (leading to Lincoln falling behind Cadillac behind sales in 2000), Lincoln-Mercury was restored under its previous divisional structure during 2002.  As part of [[The Way Forward]], the 2007 closure of [[Wixom Assembly Plant]] was announced, initially putting the future of the Town Car at risk.  To preserve production of the Town Car, for the 2008 model year, production of the Town Car was transferred to the [[St. Thomas Assembly]] plant in Canada, alongside the Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis.

=== Chassis ===
For its redesign in the 1998 model year, the Lincoln Town Car retained the Ford Panther platform that had underpinned its predecessor. To improve the cornering stability of the Town Car, a [[Watt's linkage]] was fitted to the solid rear axle suspension (a change also seen in its Mercury and Ford counterparts). The front brake calipers were changed to a larger dual-piston design; 16-inch wheels became standard.

For 2003, the chassis of the Town Car was extensively redesigned and changes were made to the tuning of the suspension. The steering system was changed from a recirculating-ball to a rack-and-pinion configuration.

==== Powertrain ====
In the redesign, the Lincoln Town Car carried over its Modular V8 (shared with the Crown Victoria/Grand Marquis). For the first time since its 1991 introduction, the 4.6L SOHC V8 saw in increase in output, rising to 200&amp;nbsp;hp in Executive/Signature models; dual exhaust Town Cars produced 220&amp;nbsp;hp in Cartier trim with 239&amp;nbsp;hp in Signature Touring versions. In 2000, the V8 was retuned to 200/215&amp;nbsp;hp, rising to 220/235&amp;nbsp;hp in 2001. For 2003, the powertrain would get a final power increase, rising to 224/239&amp;nbsp;hp.

From 1997 to 2002, the Town Car used the 4R70W 4-speed automatic introduced in 1994. From 2002&lt;ref&gt;https://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/autos/lincoln-town-car-improves-driving-dynamics-remains-vault-quiet/article_e822e3f9-271c-5745-88a2-6038247db258.html&lt;/ref&gt; onward, the heavier-duty 4R75W replaced it.

=== Body ===

==== Exterior ====
While three inches shorter than its 1997 predecessor, the 1998 Town Car gained two inches in width and an inch in height (becoming the tallest Lincoln sedan in 40 years). In a major break from Lincoln styling tradition, the Town Car abandoned many of the straight-edged lines of its predecessor. Adopting styling cues of the outgoing [[Lincoln Mark VIII|Mark VIII]] and the 1995 Continental, the Town Car adopted a curved design scheme in place of the previous straight-lined body. While the radiator grille was retained, its rectangular shape was changed to oval (its waterfall pattern was adopted by the [[Lincoln Navigator]] introduced alongside it), and the hood ornament was deleted.

The curved design scheme carried further to the rear of the Town Car, in the C-pillar (losing its opera windows) into the trunklid. To differentiate from its Mercury counterpart, the Town Car switched to individual taillamps, deleting the filler panel on the trunklid; a large chrome surround was used on the trunklid to mount the license plate.

In 2001, the stretched Town Car L was introduced, with a six-inch stretch in its wheelbase. To produce the variant at lower cost, the B-pillar was widened on 2001-2002 versions to use the existing rear door glass of the standard Town Car. In 2003, the Town Car L was redesigned, giving it model-specific doors proportioned to the longer roofline; these versions are distinguished by wider rear quarter glass in the doors.

In 2003, coinciding with the chassis redesign, the body of the Town Car underwent a number of changes. To bring it in line with contemporary Lincoln vehicles, the lower body was squared off; the oval grille was redesigned in the style of the [[Lincoln LS]]; the hood ornament made its return after a 5-year absence.&lt;gallery mode="packed" caption="Lincoln Town Car exterior, 1998-2011"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Interior ====
As with its predecessors, the 1998 Lincoln Town Car visibly shares few common interior parts with its Ford and Mercury counterparts (aside from its steering column, radio, and climate controls). To improve ergonomics, power seat controls on Signature and Cartier models are relocated from the seat to door panel (Executive Series, in 1999). Seat-mounted side airbags become standard on all Town Cars for 1999. In the same year, the Executive Series regained its rear-seat center armrest (initially deleted in a cost-cutting move).

For its 2003 redesign, the interior of the Lincoln Town Car saw extensive changes. To differentiate the Town Car from the Mercury Grand Marquis, the radio and climate controls were integrated into a single unit with an analog clock; the interior was given a model-specific wood trim bordered by satin metal. The redesign included new seats, distinguished by taller head restraints. Alongside the Lincoln LS, the 2003 Town Car introduced a DVD-based [[Global Navigation Satellite System|satellite navigation]] system designed by [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]]; it was later paired with [[THX]] sound processing. On all Town Cars except for Executive Series, ultrasonic park assist was standard, alongside a power-open/close trunk lid.

For 2004, the "Soundmark" standard stereo system is redesigned to offer dual-media capability (AM/FM/cassette/CD). For 2005, for the first time since 1996, the Town Car receives a redesigned steering wheel. For 2006, the instrument panel was redesigned, with Lincoln Town Car gaining a tachometer alongside its Ford and Mercury counterparts; Lincoln Town Car is one of the last American-market vehicles sold without one.

As part of the 2008 shift in assembly plants, to streamline production, Lincoln deleted or standardized many features of the Town Car, leaving only 4 remaining options: HID headlamps, whitewall tires, polished 18-spoke wheels (in place of 10-spoke "machine-finish" wheels), and a trunk organizer.&lt;gallery mode="packed" caption="Lincoln Town Car interior"&gt;

=== Trim ===
At its redesign for 1998, the Lincoln Town Car was produced in three trim levels: Executive Series (primarily for fleets and livery sales), Signature Series, and Cartier Designer Edition. From 1998 to 2002, Lincoln offered the Signature Series Touring; essentially the Lincoln counterpart to the Handling and Performance Package option for the Ford Crown Victoria/Mercury Grand Marquis, the Signature Series Touring offered suspension upgrades to optimize handling.

For 2002, the Town Car line was expanded as Lincoln introduced a Premium option package for the Signature Series, Cartier, and Signature Touring; the Premium option package is distinguished by a glass sunroof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autos.aol.com/cars-Lincoln-Town+Car-2002-Signature_Premium_Touring__4dr_Sedan/available-trims/|title=AOL Autos-Used cars-2002 Lincoln Town Car-Available Trims|accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2003, the Town Car was redesigned to have a new look-the Executive became the base model. Signature was the next step up, and then the Cartier and Cartier L's. 

For 2004, several shifts were made to the model line, with the Executive becoming available solely for fleet/livery customers and the Cartier discontinued altogether. To replace the Cartier, Lincoln introduced the Lincoln Town Car Ultimate, featuring a THX sound system. For 2005, the Ultimate was replaced by the Signature Limited (first introduced as an option in 2000) along with the Designer Series in 2006-2007. Effectively replacing the Cartier, the Designer Series offered a two-tone interior with ''[[Provence]]'' leather and adjustable head restraints; the exterior was distinguished by chrome wheels and B-pillar trim.

For 2008 through 2011, the Signature Limited became the sole trim available on the standard-wheelbase Town Car along with the long-wheelbase Signature L; the Executive Series remained in production for fleet and livery sales.

==== Special editions ====
[[File:Линкольн-Кабриолет (1).jpg|thumb|Major General [[Murat Bektanov]], Commander in Chief of the [[Kazakh Ground Forces]], commanding a [[military parade]] on [[Independence Square, Nur-Sultan]] in a 2003 Lincoln Town Car.]]
'''Touring'''&lt;br /&gt;Intended to enhance the driving appeal of the Lincoln Town Car, the ''Touring/Touring Sedan'' was an option package for Signature Series Town Cars from 1998 to 2002. Essentially the Lincoln counterpart of the Ford Crown Victoria/Mercury Grand Marquis Handling and Performance Package, the Touring option package featured a dual-exhaust 239&amp;nbsp;hp V8, heavy-duty [[KONI Group|KONI]] shocks, revised suspension bushings, wider 16-inch wheels with 235 mm tires, a 3.55 rear-axle ratio, and revised steering tuning. Town Cars with the option package featured a black-painted grille, exterior chrome delete, black wood interior (fitted with perforated leather seats and a [[JBL (company)|JBL]] sound system).

'''Limited Edition'''&lt;br /&gt;In 2003, Lincoln offered a Limited trim; having Limited badges on the C-pillar, fog lights, heated and memory seats, as well as arden inserts in the rims and grille. For 2005, the Limited offered two-tone paint schemes (in addition to two-tone seats) with Limited badges on the C-pillar as well, but no fog lights.

'''Pro Series'''&lt;br /&gt;Offered in 2004, a special Pro-series badge was placed on the C-pillars; having the background of a golf course. This badge was stitched onto the front seats, in addition to having chrome 9-spoke rims and a two-tone color scheme.  

'''25th Anniversary Edition'''&lt;br /&gt;Lincoln commemorated the 25th anniversary of the Town Car by offering a 25th Anniversary Edition package on the 2006 Signature Limited. The package included chrome B-pillar and door handles, unique Eucalyptus wood applique and matching steering wheel with wood inserts, scuff plates with "25th Anniversary Edition" and "25th anniversary" badging, Provence leather individual 40/20/40 lounge seating with individual comfort, shirring, contrast piping and rear seat adjustable headrests, fog lamps and 9-spoke chrome wheels.

'''Continental Edition'''&lt;br /&gt;Offered in 2010 and 2011 was the Continental Edition package; available as an option only on the Signature Limited trim. The package added Continental badging, chrome 17-inch wheels and accents to the B-pillars. On the interior, the Continental name was embroidered on the front seats and front floor mats.

=== Safety ===
The Lincoln Town Car was the first production sedan in the world to receive US five-star crash ratings in every category.

=== Livery variants ===
Featuring a standard [[V8 engine]], body-on-frame design, [[rear-wheel drive]] and large exterior and interior dimensions,&lt;ref name="Forbes, Lincoln Town Car review, 2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbesautos.com/reviews/2006/lincoln/town_car/model-update.html |title=Forbes, Lincoln Town Car review, 2006 |accessdate=August 2, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621065344/http://www.forbesautos.com/reviews/2006/lincoln/town_car/model-update.html |archivedate=June 21, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Town Car became popular in livery and commercial service. In commercial service, the typical Lincoln Town Car saw a life expectancy of over 400,000 miles.&lt;ref name="tj" /&gt; Its basis on the Ford Panther chassis gave it powertrain and suspension commonality with the [[Mercury Grand Marquis]] and the [[Ford LTD Crown Victoria]] (later the [[Ford Crown Victoria|Crown Victoria]]). This design made them durable even in the rough conditions taxi and livery cars are subjected to, and easy and cheap to repair when they did suffer damage.&lt;ref name="tj"&gt;http://telegraphjournal.canadaeast.com/opinion/article/1443706 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421200220/http://telegraphjournal.canadaeast.com/opinion/article/1443706 |date=April 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lincoln Town Car was popular as a [[limousine#Modern limousines|stretch limousine]] donor chassis; it was the most commonly used limousine and chauffeured car in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name="speroexcecution"&gt;{{cite web | title=Lincoln Town Car wins stay of execution | publisher=Spero News | date=September 19, 2006 | accessdate =July 15, 2010 | url= http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?id=5487 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hearses were also built on the Town Car chassis, through Ford's QVM program; the chassis was modified by coachbuilders for use in the funeral business.&lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

=== Presidential State Car ===
A 1989 Lincoln Town Car was commissioned by United States President [[George H. W. Bush]] as the [[Presidential state car (United States)|Presidential State Car]] of the [[United States]] to succeed the 1983 [[Cadillac Fleetwood]] used during the [[Ronald Reagan]] administration. The Presidential Town Car limousine arrived in 1989 and was the state car for the entire presidency of [[George H. W. Bush]].  It was succeeded by a 1993 [[Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham|Cadillac Fleetwood]], used by his successor, [[Bill Clinton]]. As of 2018, the 1989 Lincoln Town Car is currently the last Lincoln vehicle to have served as a Presidential State Car.&lt;gallery mode="packed" caption="1989 Lincoln Town Car [[Presidential state car (United States)|Presidential Limousine]]"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Town Car L ===

A new "L" designation was used for extended-wheelbase Town Cars from 2000 to 2011. The L editions offered an additional {{convert|6|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rear-seat legroom, as well as remote access audio and climate controls mounted in the rear center armrest. Also included was a two-way travel switch for the front passenger seat base (a feature shared with the extended-wheelbase Jaguar XJ). The L designation was applied to the top-of-line Cartier (2000–2003), Ultimate (2004 only), and Signature (2005–2011) trim levels. Fleet buyers received it under the Executive L trim designation.

For 2000–02 versions, the "L" edition is identified by a widened [[B-pillar]], bearing the Lincoln "star" ornament; maintaining parts commonality with the standard Town Car. The 2003-2011 "L" editions had longer rear doors, featuring wider versions of the fixed windows.&lt;gallery mode="packed" caption="Lincoln Town Car L (2000-2011)"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Ballistic Protection Series ===
Starting in 2003, the Lincoln Town Car had been available featuring [[Armored car (VIP)|ballistic protection]] from the factory. Adding nearly $100,000 to the base price, the armored body and bulletproof glass raised the curb weight of the Town Car to nearly 7,000 pounds.&lt;ref name="Armored Town Car pricing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2004/12/05/295093.html|title=Armored Town Car pricing|accessdate=March 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other changes included the suspension and brakes. Only a few dealers in the US were authorized to sell this series.

===Hongqi CA7460===
''See main page, [[Hongqi (marque)]]''

In China, [[First Automobile Works|FAW]] produced a licensed version of the Lincoln Town Car rebadged as the ''Hongqi CA7460(红旗,Red flag CA7460)'' and ''Hongqi Qijian(红旗旗舰,Flagship)'' from November 10, 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2012/01/panther-love-in-china-red-flag%E2%80%99s-lincoln-years/ |title=Tycho’s Illustrated History Of Chinese Cars: Red Flag’s Lincoln Years |publisher=thetruthaboutcars.com |accessdate=2013-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tieba.baidu.com/p/2015617388 |title=请别再颓废下去！红旗品牌发展史(下)_唐海吧_百度贴吧 |publisher=baidu.com |accessdate=2013-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limousine version is currently called the Hongqi Limousine L1, L2 and L3 respectively. Pricing in 1998 was at 690,000 RMB (109,710 USD) while limousines were added to the range. The L3 was introduced in 2001 and had a wheelbase of 3,190 millimetres (125.6 inches). For 2002, the L1 was introduced and had a wheelbase of 3,990 millimetres (157.1 inches) and the L2 was introduced in 2003 and had the longest wheelbase out of the three with 5,339 millimetres (210.2 inches).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carnewschina.com/2012/01/05/hongqi-of-china-the-lincoln-years/|title=Hongqi of China; the Lincoln years}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pricing for the limousine variant was 1,350,000 RMB (214,650 USD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://carnewschina.com/2010/05/27/spotted-in-china-faw-hongqi-ca7460/|title=Spotted in China: FAW-Hongqi CA7460 - CarNewsChina.com|author=|date=May 27, 2010|website=carnewschina.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discontinuation ==
During the 2000s, in spite of declining sales, the Town Car remained one of the highest-selling American-brand luxury sedans.  Outside of retail markets, it was the most used [[limousine]] and [[chauffeur]]ed car in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name=speroexcecution/&gt;

In 2006, as part of [[The Way Forward]], Ford considered ending production of Lincoln's largest model as part of the 2007 closing of the [[Wixom Assembly Plant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/09/13/bloomberg/bxtown.php |title=Search – Global Edition – The New York Times |work=International Herald Tribune|date=March 29, 2009 |accessdate=October 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry observer George Peterson said "It blows everybody’s mind that they are dropping the Town Car. Just think what Ford could do if they actually invested in a re-skin of Crown Victoria, Grand Marquis and Town Car."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/16/automobiles/16LINCOLN.html | work=The New York Times | first=Jerry | last=Garrett | title=Town Car's Next Stop: Retirement | date=July 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Ultimately, Wixom Assembly was closed following the 2007 model year, with the production of the Town Car consolidated with the [[Ford Crown Victoria]], [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]], and [[Mercury Grand Marquis]] in Canada at [[St. Thomas Assembly]]&lt;ref name="speroexcecution" /&gt;; the first Canadian-produced Town Car was assembled on January 10, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiandriver.com/news_2008/01/11/080111-1.htm|title=First Ontario-built Lincoln Town Car rolls off assembly line|publisher=CanadianDriver|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

Following the 2007 model year, however, the Town Car was discontinued for retail sale in Canada, available exclusively for fleet and livery customers afterward.  In 2009, the fate of all three Panther-platform models was determined when Ford announced the 2011 closure of the St. Thomas Assembly Plant. For the limousine and livery markets, Ford had promised availability of the Town Car through the 2011 model year;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fleet.ford.com/showroom/specialty_vehicles/TownCarExt2011.pdf |title=Ford Fleet: Town Car Extension Through 2011 |format=PDF |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; retail sales continued on a limited basis in the United States and for export.  In 2010, Ford announced the closure of the Mercury brand at the end of the year, effectively making the Town Car the final model line sold for retail sale produced by St. Thomas Assembly (retail sales of the Crown Victoria ended after 2007).   

On August 29, 2011, the final Town Car rolled off the assembly line, without any fanfare or announcement from Ford&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.olemiss.edu/~badwf/ |title=Lincoln MotorCar News |accessdate=January 11, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061118170026/http://home.olemiss.edu/~badwf/ |archivedate=November 18, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;; St. Thomas Assembly produced its final vehicle (a 2012 Crown Victoria for export) on September 15, 2011.  

While Lincoln has not developed a direct successor to the model line following its 2011 discontinuation, the use of the nameplate returned for 2012, denoting a variant of the Lincoln MKT designed for limousine/livery use.&lt;ref name="fleet.ford.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fleet.ford.com/showroom/specialty_vehicles/Lincoln%20MKT%20Livery%20releasev6%203.pdf|title=Fleet Showroom|publisher=fleet.ford.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917095115/https://www.fleet.ford.com/showroom/specialty_vehicles/Lincoln%20MKT%20Livery%20releasev6%203.pdf|archivedate=September 17, 2012|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Snavely, Brent"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20110214/BLOG40/110214055/With-poll-Lincoln-s-new-limos-keep-Town-Car-name-?|title=Lincoln's new limos to keep Town Car name|last=Snavely|first=Brent|date=February 14, 2011|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|accessdate=February 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The MKT was discontinued after the 2019 model year without a direct replacement, marking the final use of the Town Car name; the nameplate was in use for 49 continuous years by Lincoln (30 as a distinct model line, 11 as a sub-model of the Continental, 8 of the MKT).   

== Awards ==

The Town Car has received several awards and recognitions.

* ''[[Forbes magazine]]'' repeatedly named the Town Car one of the best cars to be chauffeured in along with other, often more expensive flagship sedans, such as the [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class]], [[BMW 7 Series]] and [[Lexus LS]].&lt;ref name="Forbes, best chauffeured cars"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/2005/03/10/cx_dl_0310feat_bill05.html/ |title=Forbes, best chauffeured cars |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925185610/http://www.forbes.com/2005/03/10/cx_dl_0310feat_bill05.html |archivedate=September 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Town Car Signature L features a rear seat comfort package which not only provides rear seat passengers with audio system and rear compartment climate controls, but also features a control function which allows for the rear seat occupants to move the passenger seat forward, a feature exclusive to few [[luxury vehicles|ultra-luxury sedans]].&lt;ref name="Forbes, best chauffeured cars" /&gt; In addition to its many amenities, the Signature L also features an unrivaled {{convert|46.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rear legroom, and {{convert|60|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rear shoulder room.&lt;ref name="Official Lincoln Town Car technical specifications"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lincoln.com/towncar/models.asp|title=Official Lincoln Town Car technical specifications|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614164514/http://www.lincoln.com/towncar/models.asp|archivedate=June 14, 2006|url-status=dead|accessdate=June 22, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1990, upon the introduction of the second generation Town Car, the vehicle was named [[Motor Trend Car of the Year]].&lt;ref name="Motor trend car of the year 1990"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/oftheyear/car/car_of_the_year_winners/index.html|title=Motor Trend car of the year list – 1990|publisher = Motor Trend| accessdate=July 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this award was later included by ''[[Car and Driver]]'' in a list of poorly chosen car of the year award winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autos.yahoo.com/articles/autos_content_landing_pages/846/dishonorable-mention-the-10-most-embarrassing-award-winners-in-automotive-history/ |title=Dishonorable Mention: The 10 Most Embarrassing Award Winners in Automotive History- Yahoo! Autos Article Page |publisher=Autos.yahoo.com |date=October 27, 2009 |accessdate=October 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motor Trend has changed the criteria by which it awards its highest accolade: Originally, Car of the Year awards went to the vehicle model which was the most significantly improved over the previous year's design in all respects. Currently, no such consideration is given to contenders for this award, and vehicles are considered for the award even if in their first year of production.

The '''Lincoln Mark series''' is a series of [[Personal luxury car|personal luxury cars]] that was produced by [[Ford Motor Company]].  The nomenclature was launched in 1956, as the 1939-1948 [[Lincoln Continental]] was succeeded by the [[Continental Mark II]].  From 1958 to 1960, the Mark III, IV and V were marketed by Mercury-Edsel-Lincoln (M-E-L) Division.  Following a hiatus, the Mark series was relaunched in 1968 by Lincoln-Mercury; six further generations were produced through 1998.   

Serving as the [[Flagship vehicles|flagship]] of Ford Motor Company, the Mark series has primarily been produced as a two-door coupe (other body styles have been offered through its production).  With the exception of the nearly hand-built Continental Mark II, the model line has shared chassis underpinnings with other Ford vehicles, styled with their own interior and exterior body panels (notably the use of [[Continental tire|continental tire trunklids]] associated with the brand)  

Following the 1998 model year, the Mark VIII was discontinued and not replaced, with Lincoln choosing to concentrate on its sedan and SUV model lines; the closest four-door equivalent to the Mark VIII was the [[Lincoln LS|LS V8]] (and the later [[Lincoln MKS|MKS]]).  From 2007 to 2020, Lincoln used an "MK" prefix for its sedans (phased out in favor of conventional names or dropped altogether).   From 1958 to 1998, all Mark-series vehicles were produced by [[Wixom Assembly Plant|Wixom Assembly]] at [[Wixom, Michigan]].  

== Background ==
Before there were series of "Continental Mark", "Lincoln Mark", or "Lincoln MK" models, there were various models built by the Ford organization employing the name "Continental". These began in the 1930s with a [[one-off]] car, a custom personal car that ended up serving the function of a [[concept car]], which [[Edsel Ford]] directed his designers to create. It began with the existing design of the [[Lincoln-Zephyr]] and was modified extensively. It was called the "Continental" because it was meant to capture an essence of [[Continental Europe]]an luxury. This first car led to a production model, the first of the "[[Lincoln Continental]]" series, which was built from 1939 to 1948.

At the time work had begun on the first Continental coupe, Lincoln had previously cancelled the [[Lincoln K-series]] coupes, sedans, and limousines, and produced the very limited [[Lincoln Custom]] limousine, along with the smaller [[Lincoln-Zephyr]] coupes and sedans. Mr. Ford wanted to revive the popularity of the 1929–1932 [[Lincoln K-series#1932|Lincoln Victoria]] coupe and convertible but with a more modern approach, reflecting European styling influences for the Continental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lincoln Series KA Victoria coupe|url=http://www.desertclassics.com/Linc32KAcp.html|website=Desert Classics|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, Ford Motor Company chose to introduce a new personal luxury car as a successor to the pre-war Lincoln Continental.  As it was to be one of the most exclusive and expensive automobiles in the world, Ford chose to create a stand-alone division above Lincoln.  The new [[Continental Mark II]] of the Continental Division adopted a naming convention of "mark number", also meaning "version number" or "model number"; while used in the European automotive industry, this was also used to identify versions of artillery, tanks, naval vessels, and aircraft, as demonstrated with the [[Jaguar Mark 1]]. The name was thus equivalent in original meaning to simply "Continental, version 2" or "Continental, model B", although the name "Mark" later took on a [[brand]]-like feel of its own in the minds of many customers, which later branding efforts then expanded upon.

In July 1956, the Continental Division was integrated into the Lincoln-Mercury Division, which managed the Continental as a separate marque within the division. The division introduced the Continental Mark III, IV, and V to replace the Continental Mark II; they served as the flagships of the Lincoln-Mercury Division. For 1961, Lincoln was pared down to a single model line. The Continental name was suspended as a marque as the Mark series vehicles were discontinued and Continental became the sole Lincoln model name.

For 1968, Lincoln restarted the Continental Mark series with the [[Lincoln Continental Mark III|Continental Mark III]] as a true successor to the Continental Mark II. Instead of being a flagship model of the standard Lincoln, the Continental Mark III was an all-new car. Based on the [[Ford Thunderbird]], it was strictly a personal-luxury coupe like the Continental Mark II and the 1939–1948 Continental, thus restarting the series at Mark III. Continental as a stand alone marque without Lincoln badging was resumed for the new Mark III model.

While sharing little to no common bodywork, the Mark series would share much of its underpinnings with the Ford Thunderbird for most of its entire production run from 1969 to 1998.  The only exceptions were 1977–1979 when the Thunderbird was downsized to the intermediate [[Ford Torino]] platform; and the 1980–1983 Continental Mark VI, which was based on the [[Ford LTD (North America)|Ford LTD]]/[[Mercury Marquis]] and [[Lincoln Town Car]]. The 1958–1960 Continental Mark III–V and the 1980–1983 Continental Mark VI were the only Mark series vehicles ever produced with an available 4-door body style.

The [[Continental Mark II]] was a [[personal luxury car]] produced by a newly formed Continental Division of the [[Ford Motor Company]] for only two model years: 1956 and 1957.

The Mark II was available only as a two-door [[hardtop]] coupe. The new model eschewed chrome-laden styling of the period. Its understated design evoked a European simplicity of line. The Continental Mark II featured a pre-war [[Continental tire|Continental-style]] spare tire hump, shared the new {{convert|368|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Lincoln Y-block V8 engine]] and running gear, and was sold and serviced at Lincoln dealerships. Four-door and convertible versions were explored by Ford, but not developed.

Most of the car was hand-built to high standards, including multiple coats of paint hand-sanded down, double-lacquered, and polished. The car's price was US$10,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000|1956}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}); was as much as a [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls-Royce]] or two top-of-the-line [[Cadillac]]s at that time.

All Mark IIs were equipped with power steering, power brakes, power windows, automatic transmission, motorized radio and antenna, as well as a luxurious interior of imported Scottish, [[Bridge of Weir]] leather. The only option available was air conditioning. The 1956 models had small "scoops" for air intake located on the upper rear fenders. Cool air from the trunk-mounted evaporator coil entered the passenger compartment from four vent registers located in the corners of the roof headliner.

Following the cancellation of the Continental Mark II coupe at the end of the 1957 model year, Ford Motor Company sought for ways to improve the profitability of its flagship model line.  After the Continental Division was absorbed by Lincoln-Mercury in July 1956, the Continental name was used as Ford's top level marque, sharing bodystyles with Lincoln-branded vehicles.  For marketing purposes, the new Mark III was not called a Lincoln, and wore ''Continental''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonsall|first=Thomas E.|title=The Lincoln story: the postwar years|year=2003|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4941-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0s98D99c1tsC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=Lincoln+Mark+II|accessdate=January 5, 2011|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; badging on the vehicle. This was done to position Continental-branded vehicles against top-level Cadillacs and Imperials.

In a major move to cut production costs, the hand assembly seen on the Mark II coupe was replaced as the Mark III was assembled in the same factory alongside the [[Lincoln Capri]] and [[Lincoln Premiere]].  In order to distinguish the Continental from Lincolns, stylists gave the vehicle its own roofline.  Featuring a reverse-slanted retractable rear window, called "Breezeway", it was featured in all Continental-branded models (including convertibles).  Although released in the middle of the [[Recession of 1958|1958 recession]] (that would add to the problems with the [[Edsel]]), the Mark III would prove far more successful than its predecessor due to a $4000 (nearly 40%) reduction in price; while still expensive, the number of potential buyers was far higher.  Due to the production costs of developing the unibody platform, Lincoln would lose over $60 million in total over 1958–1960 production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZNsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Popular Mechanics – Google Boeken |accessdate=December 30, 2011|publisher=Hearst Magazines |date=January 1959 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While far easier to produce, the Mark III was still advanced for the time.  Continentals were still available with air conditioning, this time with dashboard-mounted vents.  For the first time, FM radio joined AM radio as an option.  Another feature was "Auto Lube"; as long as the owner kept the oil reservoir full, the car automatically lubricated itself.

For 1959, the Mark III became the Mark IV, with two new bodystyles.  Intended to compete against formal sedans from Cadillac and Imperial, Lincoln introduced a Continental Town Car and Limousine.  To increase rear-seat room, the retractable rear window was replaced by a standard-slant window.  Limousine models were distinguished by the use of a rear-seat partition.  Other features included dual air-conditioning units and a padded vinyl top.  Both models were only available painted in black.  The Town Car cost over $9,200 with a total of 214 sold over both years, and the Limousine cost $10,200 with only a total of 83 sold, making it more expensive and perhaps even more exclusive than the Mark II.
 
For 1960, the Mark V was given a minor styling update, with a larger grille and new "[[dagmar bumpers]]".

In terms of standard production sedans without an extended wheelbase, the 1958–1960 Lincolns are some of the largest automobiles ever made.  The Continental Mark III–V are the longest cars produced by the Ford Motor Company without federally mandated 5-mph bumpers.  The 1959 Mark IV and 1960 Mark V Limousines and Town Cars are the heaviest American standard-wheelbase sedans built since World War II. 1960 is the only model year that a Mark series vehicle is mentioned as a ''Lincoln Continental Mark V'' in brochures and advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/brochures_1960_lincoln|title=1960 Lincoln Sales Brochure|website=Unique Cars and Parts|access-date=3 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reputation for the Mark III-V’s  "excessive styling" is perhaps ironic given the enormous amount of styling talent that was connected with the development and modification of Marks of this vintage.{{efn|[[George W. Walker]], known for his contribution to the development of the original [[Ford Thunderbird]], was Vice-President in charge of Styling at Ford during this time. [[Elwood Engel]], famous for being lead designer of generation four of the Lincoln Continental and for his work as chief designer at Chrysler in the 1960s, was Staff Stylist (and consequently roamed all of the design studios) at Ford during this period, and worked very closely with [[John Najjar]] in developing not only the 1958, but also the 1959 update. After John Najjar was relieved of his responsibilities as Chief Stylist of Lincoln in 1957 he became Engel's executive assistant, and the two worked closely together in the "stiletto studio" in developing the fourth generation Lincoln Continental, which won an award for its superlative styling. After Engel left Ford in 1961, Najjar became the lead designer of the [[Ford Mustang I]] concept car, which later gave birth to the [[Ford Mustang]]. Don Delarossa, who succeeded Najjar as Chief Stylist of Lincoln, was responsible for the 1960 update, and went on to become chief designer at Chrysler in the 1980s. [[Alex Tremulis]], who was Chief Stylist at Auburn-Cord-Duesenberg in the mid- to late 1930s and known for his work on the [[1948 Tucker Sedan]], was head of Ford's Advanced Styling Studio during this period. It was his Ford La Tosca concept car, with its oval overlaid with an "X" theme, that gave the "slant eyed monster" nickname to the 1958 Mark III front end. Perhaps most ironically of all, [[L. David Ash]] was Lincoln's Executive Exterior Stylist when Najjar was in charge of Lincoln styling, the same L. David Ash who would later play such a prominent role as Chief Stylist of Ford in designing the 1969–1971 [[Lincoln Continental Mark III|Continental Mark III]], which helped cause Marks of this vintage (together with a marketing decision by then Ford Executive Vice-President [[Lee Iacocca]]) to be called the "forgotten Marks".}}

The [[Lincoln Continental Mark III|Continental Mark III]] was manufactured by [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]] for model years 1969 through 1971. The Mark III was created when [[Lee Iacocca]], president of Ford Motor Company at the time, directed Design Vice President, Gene Bordinat, to "put a Rolls Royce grille on a Thunderbird"&lt;ref name="Iacocca1984p83"&gt;{{Harvnb|Iacocca|1984|p=83}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in September 1965. The Mark III was based on the four-door Thunderbird platform,&lt;ref name="Iacocca1984p83"/&gt; which was first introduced for 1967. It joined the larger 1966 [[Lincoln Continental#Fourth generation (1961–69)|Lincoln Continental]] 2-door sedan.

The Mark III competed with Cadillac's front-wheel-drive [[Cadillac Eldorado#Sixth generation (1967–1970)|Eldorado]] and [[Imperial (automobile)#Third generation (1967–1968)|Imperial Crown Coupe]], which bowed for the 1967 model year and held the upper rung in the [[personal luxury car]] market. Introduced on April 5, 1968, as a 1969 model, the Continental Mark III outsold its Cadillac and Imperial rivals each model year.

The Mark III took many of its design cues from the mainstream [[Ford Thunderbird]]. Distinguishing features included a prominent grille, hidden headlights, and a [[Continental tire|Continental spare tire]] hump in the decklid.

Differences for the 1969 model year included eight new exterior colors and an optional white leather/vinyl interior, as well as new headrests, steering wheel styling, instrument panel knobs, and color-keyed vinyl boots on the front seat belt anchors varied. A Cartier dash clock was introduced in December 1968.

The 1970 model introduced a technical innovation - it was the first [[American automobile industry in the 1950s#Tires|American-made]] vehicle with [[radial tire]]s as standard equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, Daniel [http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z10204/Lincoln-Continental.aspx Conceptcarz.com 1969 Lincoln Continental news, pictures, specifications, and information] September 2008 Retrieved July 26, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1970 model year cars included the formerly optional [[vinyl roof]] and Sure-Track anti-lock braking system. The interior wood trim was upgraded to genuine walnut wood trim (all 1969 models featured either East India Rosewood or English Oak wood appliques depending on the interior color). The Continental lettering on the decklid was bolted on (instead of glued on for 1969). The seat and door trim pattern was changed to a simpler design (instead of the diamond-pattern, button-tufted design of 1969). Also new were a locking steering column, a [[Rim Blow|rim-blow-horn]] steering wheel, map light off delay device, concealed electric windshield wipers with adjustable intermittent feature, and a three-point restraint system for front outboard occupants.

The 1971 model year cars received tinted windows, and an automatic climate control. High-back Twin Comfort lounge seats with two-way power controls were also new.

The [[Lincoln Continental Mark IV|Mark IV]] carried over many design themes of the Mark III including the grille and faux spare tire trunk lid, and grew both longer and wider &amp;mdash; sharing its [[automobile platform|platform]] with the [[Ford Thunderbird]].  In 1972, Lincoln introduced the small oval windows, marketed as [[opera window]]s, at the roof rear quarters.  The 1973 model year featured front [[Bumper (automobile)|bumpers]] to comply with new US safety regulations that required all passenger cars to withstand a {{convert|5|mph|0|adj=on}} front and a {{convert|2.5|mph|0|adj=on}} rear impact.  1974 models featured redesigned rear bumpers under mandatory federal safety regulations. It was the heaviest series of all generations.

Mark IVs were powered by a {{convert|460|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine.

'''Luxury Group options'''

Beginning in 1973 special Luxury Group packages were offered in various paint, roof, and interior color schemes from year to year. The Silver Luxury Group for 1973 included Silver "Moondust" metallic paint with a matching silver grained vinyl roof and a silver leather interior. Or, if the buyer preferred a color contrast, Cranberry (deep red) velour or leather interior trim was available. For 1974, a Gold Luxury Group and a Saddle &amp; White Luxury Group (April 1974 introduction) joined the carryover Silver Luxury Group. For 1975, a Blue Diamond Luxury Group and a Lipstick &amp; White Luxury Group joined the three carryover packages from the previous model year. For 1976, in addition to certain ones that carried over from the previous model year, Lincoln offered a dizzying array of new Luxury Group packages: Jade/White, Light Jade/Dark Jade, Red/Rose, Gold/Cream, Black Diamond (March 1976 introduction), and Desert Sand (March 1976 introduction). Lincoln continued to offer similar color-coordinating Luxury Group packages on the Mark V and Mark VI.

'''Designer editions'''

Beginning with the 1976 model year, the Mark IV was available with four unique "designer editions". The names of three famous clothing designers and one jewelry designer, were available with four exclusive color combinations. Interior seat designs were basically carried over from the "luxury group" options but featured unique color combinations. The designer names were: [[Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier]], the [[France|French]] jewelry and fragrance designer, [[Bill Blass]], the American designer, [[Givenchy]], a French clothing designer, and [[Emilio Pucci]], an [[Italy|Italian]] clothing and accessories designer. The name of the chosen package was embedded in the opera window of the car and also on the dashboard above or near the glovebox. The exterior and interior color combinations changed with each model year.

The Bill Blass edition remained with the Mark series through 1992 while the others were not available after the 1983 model year (Emilio Pucci), 1982 model year (Givenchy), and 1979 model year (Cartier).

Lincoln used designer editions for other models, as well. The 1980 through 1989 [[Lincoln Town Car|Town Car]] and the 1982 through 1987 [[Lincoln Continental|Continental]] sedan.

|caption = ''1979 Continental Mark V Cartier Edition''}}

Introduced for the 1977 model year, the Continental Mark V was a major revision of the Mark IV. The rounded styling of the previous generation gave way to a sharper-edged look.  Interior design remained similar to the Mark IV, with variants in the seat patterns and dashboard trim (while retaining the general dashboard layout of the IV) being the primary differences. As the Ford Thunderbird was downsized and based on the intermediate chassis utilized by the Ford LTD II and Mercury Cougar XR7, the Mark V utilized its own chassis carried over from the Mark IV.  The Mark V was larger and more complex than its predecessor, coming just ten inches short of {{convert|20|ft|m}} long. The electrical system and mechanical componentry shared less in common with other Ford products, and was harder to service than the corresponding equipment on the Mark IV.

The {{convert|460|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} of the Mark IV no longer remained the standard engine of the Mark V, with the 400 becoming standard and the 460 optional, for both the 1977 and 1978 model years.  The 460 was not available at all for 1979.  After the 1976 model year, the 460 was no longer available in Lincolns sold in California, because it was not able to be emissions-certified for that state.  By contrast, the 1977 Continentals were initially available ONLY with the 460 in the 49 states but around mid-production the 400 became standard and the 460 optional, except in California.  The March 1977 update of the Lincoln Product Facts Book for 1977 shows these changes in red font. Evidence of a change as early as December 1976 is available.  The author of these edits (March 2013) has a 49-state February 21 1977 Continental Town Car, the price sheet of which shows the 460 as an option. Marti reports, however, suggest that almost all 49-state Lincoln buyers chose the 460 after it became optional.

Experts from ''Motor Trend'', April 1980, which compared the then new Mark VI (a Cartier 351-2 model with a 2.73:1 diff) against the Mark V (a Bill Blass model with a 3.08:1 diff):

''"....another automotive era ended in 1979.  The press releases summed it up by calling the '79 Continental "the last traditionally full-sized American car."  The hardware of the matter is that the car is one of the largest mass-produced passenger cars ever to roll off an assembly line.  With an overall length of 230.3 inches, a wheelbase of 120.3 inches, and a curb weight of 4,763 pounds, it is a dinosaur, and the changing nature of the times will no longer tolerate such blatantly consumptive machines for personal transportation....

''....The 1979 Mark V was the essence of unconstrained American automotive opulence, conceived in a time when fuel economy and space efficiency were the concerns of lesser cars.

''....Though the styling of the Mark V was unchanged from '78 to '79, there were some mechanical and engineering refinements......Weight reduction techniques that included use of plastics, high-strength lightweight steel, thinner glass, and aluminum for such engine parts as the intake manifold and water pump produced a 400-pound weight reduction [from 1978], as compared to the 930 pounds surrendered by the Mark VI models.''

''....Even with the weight loss, the Mark V is a huge piece of machinery, albeit a desirable one in terms of potential value.  It is the last of a breed and has sufficient quality and style to assure eventual classic status It is entirely likely that, in 10 years, the owners of such cars will discover that they have a piece of collectible automotive machinery.''

''....To drive the Mark V is to be the captain of your own huge, luxurious ship.  In an operational sense, the Mark V is massive, smooth and competent only in boulevard or highway applications.....What it was designed to do, it does very well.  It isolates the driver and passengers from the outside world, and when you're driving, it makes you feel - and makes other people think you are - rich.  Even with its rather straight-lined, sharp-edged styling, the car has a certain rakishness and projects the image of the driver as an elegant rogue.''

''....This intangible quality is exactly what we found lacking in the Mark VI.  It has a more formal look - the result of a more squared-off roof and trunk line - that would tend to make you think of the driver as a successful accountant....The interior produces none of that feeling of decadence.  It is light and airy, as opposed to the cocoon feeling of the Mark V, and has a little too much space-age gadgetry and undisguised plastic to fit the traditional definitions of luxury.''

''....The Mark V is the pinnacle of 60 years of automotive definitions...."''

The Continental Mark VI introduced [[Downsize (automobile)|downsizing]] to the Mark series alongside the introduction of a four-door sedan bodystyle.  Based on the success of the Mark V, the Mark VI adopted many of the exterior styling cues of its predecessor, including its oval opera windows, radiator-style grille, "Continental" spare-tire decklid, hidden headlamps, vertical taillamps, and front fender louvers.

Sharing the [[Ford Panther platform|Panther platform]], the two-door Mark VI was derived from the shorter wheelbase of the Ford LTD/Mercury Marquis, with the four-door Mark VI sharing its chassis with the Continental (Town Car).  The four-door was distinguished largely by its fenders, opera windows, and decklid; the two-door has a separate roofline from the two-door Town Car.  In place of the previous 7.5L V8, a fuel-injected 4.9L V8 was standard (a 5.8L carbureted V8 was offered for 1980).

In place of the LED trip computer of the Mark V, the Mark VI became one of the first American automobiles to offer a fully digital instrument panel ([[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]]), pushbutton keyless entry (a system still in use on Ford automobiles), and an overdrive 4-speed automatic transmission.

The Mark VI continued the Designer Editions (Cartier, Bill Blass, Pucci, Givenchy) and introduced the first Signature Series trim.{{clear}}

}}
For the 1984 model year, to split the model line from the full-size Town Car, the Mark VI was replaced by the Mark VII, shifting the Mark series into the mid-size segment.  While marketed as a personal luxury car, the Mark VII sought a role as the technology flagship of Ford Motor Company, featuring a number of comfort, convenience, and performance options introduced during the 1980s.  Along with power accessories and leather seating, the Mark VII featured keyless entry, digital instruments, and an onboard computer/message center.  The Mark VII was notable for becoming the first vehicle in North America sold with aerodynamic composite headlights after legislation permitted their sale in the United States; in addition, electronic 4-channel anti-lock brakes were sold first on the Mark VII (November 1984, six months before the Chevrolet Corvette).

In a shift from the full-size segment, the Mark VII was derived from the [[Ford Fox platform|Fox platform]], becoming a two-door counterpart of the 1982–1987 Lincoln Continental sedan. The Mark VII was closely related to the 1983–1988 [[Ford Thunderbird (ninth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]] and [[Mercury Cougar]] sharing  the doors, windshield and much of the unibody structure but with a longer wheelbase towards the rear.  To end the marketing confusion seen since 1969, the Continental Mark VII became the Lincoln Mark VII for 1986.

The Mark VII is the final version offered with Designer Editions (Gianni Versace, 1984–1985; Bill Blass, 1984–1992) and the first with the sport-tuned LSC (Luxury Sports Coupe).

Mark VIIs were manufactured at the [[Wixom Assembly Plant]] in [[Wixom, Michigan]] through 1992.{{clear}}

Released for the 1993 model year, the Lincoln Mark VIII continued the role of the Mark VII as a luxury-oriented [[Grand tourer|grand touring coupe]].  Slightly larger than its predecessor, the Mark VIII was sized nearly halfway between the Mark VI and the Mark VII in length (with its wheelbase only an inch shorter than the Mark VI coupe).  Despite its larger footprint, the curb weight of the Mark VIII remained essentially the same as its predecessor.

As the Mark VIII remained a mechanical counterpart to the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar, the Mark Series ended the use of the Fox platform in favor of the all-new [[Ford FN10 platform|FN10 platform]] (a Lincoln-exclusive variant of the MN12 platform).  With its wheelbase stretched to 113 inches (only an inch shorter than the much larger Ford Panther platform), much of the extra interior space was given to the rear seat.  In a major change, the Mark VIII was given independent rear suspension, exclusive in rear-wheel drive four seat American cars at the time (except for the Thunderbird and Cougar).

The Mark VIII received a minor exterior redesign for the 1997 model year with a larger grille and exterior lights.  As with its predecessors, the Mark VIII was assembled at Ford's Wixom, Michigan assembly plant.

===LSC===
The 1996 LSC model got 10&amp;nbsp;hp (7.5&amp;nbsp;kW) more, true dual exhaust, lower (3.27) gearing and other luxury features. The 1996 LSC was the first car from an American automaker to be equipped with [[High-intensity discharge lamp|HID]] headlights, and the 1997 to 1998 models continued the groundbreaking lighting trend with even larger housings for the HID system, and an innovative neon third brakelight across the entire rear decklid.

==Branding==
For its entire production run, the Continental Mark series was the most distinguished within the Ford Motor Company divisional hierarchy positioned above Lincoln. Following the discontinuation of the Continental Division in July 1956, the vehicles would remain marketed within the Lincoln-Mercury dealer structure. However, the vehicles themselves were not badged as Lincolns, nor did their identification plates, VINs, and factory paperwork bear the Lincoln division name.

As the vehicles remained sold, serviced, and marketed by Lincoln-Mercury dealers alongside Lincoln Continentals, Continental was maintained as a separate marque for the Mark series vehicles, formally referred to as ''Continental Mark'' not ''Lincoln Continental Mark''. As the Continental Mark series became more popular, the Lincoln name became colloquially affixed although the Lincoln nameplate did not appear on Continental Mark series vehicles nor did ''Lincoln Continental Mark'' appear in marketing, brochures, advertising and window stickers. The only exception to this was the referral of the 1960 Mark V as a ''Lincoln Continental Mark V'' in brochures and advertising.

Beginning with the 1981 model year, all manufacturers were required to use a 17 character VIN-code. The first three digits is the [[Vehicle identification number|World Manufacturer Identifier]] which gives the make of the car. 1981–1985 Continental Mark VI–VII and 1982–1985 Continental 4-door sedans have the separate VIN-code 1MR which designates Continental as the make instead of 1LN as Lincoln (as is the Town Car).
For the 1986 model year, the situation was clarified by Ford Motor Company marketing as the Continental Mark VII was renamed the Lincoln Mark VII (the Mark VIII was always sold as a Lincoln). At this point all Lincoln Continentals and Mark VIIs were assigned the 1LN VIN-code to designate Lincoln as the make.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cars Of Lincoln-Mercury|last=Dammann, George H.|first=Wagner, James K.|publisher=Crestline Publishing Co.|year=1987|isbn=978-0912612263|location=Sarasota, Florida|pages=414, 545, 577, 582, 583}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=List of manufacturers of motor vehicles and their trailers - numerical - SV 3.2 |url=https://www.kba.de/SharedDocs/Publikationen/EN/SV/sv32_pdf_en.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=6 |publisher=Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt |location=Germany |date=2018-01-15 |access-date=2019-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continental star ===
After the Continental Division was integrated into the Lincoln-Mercury Division after the 1957 model year, its four-point star logo - the "Continental Star" - was brought with it.  As of current production, the emblem (in various forms) has remained in use on both Mark-series and Lincoln vehicles since 1958.

== Further use of name ==

===MK9, MKR, and Mark X concept cars===
{{see also|Lincoln MK9}}
In the early 2000s, Lincoln produced two personal-luxury concept cars using the Mark Series name.  The two-door MK9 (pronounced "Mark Nine") debuted at the 2001 New York International Auto Show.  Intended to explore the Mark Series past the discontinued Mark VIII, the MK9 was a two-door sedan with rear-wheel drive and a DOHC V8 engine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z3567/Lincoln-MK9-Concept.aspx | title=2001 Lincoln MK9 Concept Images, Information, and History (Mark IX) | publisher=Conceptcarz.com |date=December 2010 | accessdate=April 16, 2011 | author=Vaughan, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The styling of the MK9 influenced several later concepts, including the 2002 Continental concept and the 2003 [[Lincoln Navicross|Navicross]].

The use of letters to identify different models began during Ford's acquisition of British luxury marques [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]], [[Aston Martin]], and to a lesser extent Swedish marque [[Volvo]] in the [[Premier Automotive Group]]. Letters were used to identify the [[Jaguar XJ]], the [[Jaguar XK8]], the [[Aston Martin DB7]], and the [[Volvo S60]] and [[Volvo XC70]].

In 2004, the last car to use the Mark Series name debuted at the Detroit Auto Show.  The Mark X ("Mark Ten") was a two-seat convertible; a first for the Mark Series.  Mechanically based on the 2002–2005 [[Ford Thunderbird#Eleventh generation (2002–2005)|Ford Thunderbird]], the Mark X added a power-folding retractable hardtop.  Although its Thunderbird origins were apparent above the window line, much of the Mark X was restyled for a contemporary and modern appearance (rather than the retro styling seen on its Ford stablemate).

In a break from Mark Series tradition, the Continental spare-tire hump on the decklid was left out of the design of the two concept cars.

Another concept car was introduced in 2007, called the [[Lincoln MKR]]. It was a premium four door fastback sedan based on the Ford Mustang platform which influenced the design themes of production Lincolns for a number of years.

===Mark LT (2005–2008)===
{{see also|Lincoln Mark LT}}
After the discontinuation of the [[Lincoln Blackwood|Blackwood]] after a single year of production in 2002, Lincoln stayed out of pickup truck market for three years.  In 2005, the division tried again with the [[Lincoln Mark LT]].  As with the Blackwood, the Mark LT was based on the crew-cab version of the F-150; a major change from the Blackwood was the availability of all-wheel drive and the use of a conventional pickup box.  After the 2008 model year, the Mark LT was rebadged as the Platinum trim level of the Ford F-150 in the United States and Canada, remaining for sale only in Mexico until 2014.

===Lincoln MK naming scheme===
{{original research inline|date=March 2016}}
During the 1990s, American luxury brands such as Lincoln lost market share to German and Japanese brands.  As Lincoln and Cadillac began modernizing their lineups during the early 2000s, they both began to adopt alphanumeric naming schemes used by their competitors.  At Lincoln, this started with the 2000 LS, which created some objections by Toyota, the owners of Lexus.  As the LS and the Continental were both discontinued in the mid-2000s, the division introduced a new alphanumeric naming scheme that would partly revive the Mark Series.  From 2007 to 2015, all newly introduced Lincolns would wear the "MK" (pronounced "emm kay") designation; the lone exceptions were the Town Car and the Navigator.  After the 2011 model year, the Navigator became the sole non-MK Lincoln as the Town Car sedan was discontinued.  However, for 2017 Lincoln discontinued the [[Lincoln MKS|MKS]] and brought back the [[Lincoln Continental#Tenth generation (2017)|Continental]] name for its all-new flagship sedan, and will bring back names for other Lincoln model replacements.

The '''Lincoln L series''' (also called the '''Lincoln Model L''') is the first [[automobile]] that was produced by the [[Lincoln Motor Company]].&lt;ref name="Kimes1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kimes|first=Beverly|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1805–1942|year=1996|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=0-87341-428-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Introduced in 1920, the L series would continue to be produced after the bankruptcy of Lincoln in 1922 and its purchase by [[Ford Motor Company]].

It was an alternative to various top level luxury vehicles to include the [[Mercedes 24/100/140 PS|Mercedes-Benz 630]], [[Rolls-Royce Phantom I]], [[Packard]], and [[Cadillac Type 61]]. It was replaced during 1930 by the [[Lincoln K series|Model K]]. 

Assembly of the L series took place in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]].

== Model history ==

=== 1917–1922 ===
[[File:1922 Lincoln touring automobile.jpg|left|thumb|1922 Lincoln L-series Touring Sedan]]
After leaving the company over a dispute with [[William C. Durant|William Durant]] over World War I production, [[Cadillac]] founder [[Henry Leland]] created  the Lincoln Motor Company.   the company produced [[Liberty L-12|Liberty V12 aircraft engines]] as its only source of revenue. With the war finished Lelands decided to make the  Lincoln Motor car. The company was reorganised in 1920 &amp; created the first L-series car in 1920, for sale as a 1921 model.

The L series was designed by Angus Woodbridge, the son-in-law of Henry Leland; trained as a ladies [[Hatmaking|hatmaker]], the design of the L series was considered old-fashioned for the time.&lt;ref name="Kimes1996" /&gt;  In the years following World War I, the Lincoln Motor Company struggled in the postwar recession with repeated, false tax evasion claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mandel|first=Leon|title=American Cars|year=1982|publisher=Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang, Inc.|isbn=0-941434-19-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/americancarsfrom00mand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1922–1923 ===
[[File:District National Bank, Dupont Circle branch.jpg|thumb|left|1923 Lincoln L-series Brunn coupe]]
In financial trouble, Leland sold the company to [[Henry Ford]] in 1922 for $8 million, the amount determined by the judge presiding over the [[receivership]] Arthur J. Tuttle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=H. Eugene|title=Chrysler, Ford, Durant, and Sloan|year=2003|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-7864-1611-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Leland valued the company at over $16 million. After a few months the Lelands left the company because of Henry Ford's managerial style and his son, [[Edsel Ford]], designed a new body for the L series. Edsel became President and Ernest C. Kanzler General Manager.  the L series was a robust car. In the first year, hydraulic shock absorbers were added.&lt;ref name="Kimes1996"/&gt; Edsel and Kanzler implemented production economies, trimming manufacturing costs by about $1000 per car. 

Aside from the extension of the wheelbase from 130 to 136 inches, the chassis of the Lincoln Model L saw few major changes; the 60-degree L-head V8 remained in production.  For 1923, several new body styles were introduced for the Model L under the direction of Edsel, including two and three-window four-door sedans, and a four-passenger [[Phaeton body|phaeton]].  Other vehicles included a two-passenger roadster, and a $5,200 seven-passenger touring sedan and limousine.   

A sedan, limousine, cabriolet, and town car were also offered by coachbuilders [[Fleetwood Metal Body|Fleetwood]], [[Derham Body Company|Derham]] and [[Dietrich Inc.|Dietrich]], and a second cabriolet was offered by coachbuilder [[Brunn &amp; Company|Brunn]].  Vehicles built by these coachbuilders went for as much as $7,200; despite the relatively niche market segment, Lincoln sales rose about 45 percent to produce 7,875 cars and the company was operating at a profit by the end of 1923.

===1924–1926===
In 1924, the L series was given a newer look with such things as a nickel-plated radiator shell, while 1925 is identified by the absence of cowl lights. Front and rear bumpers became standard. The smallest L series was the 2-door, 2-passenger roadster.  1926 was basically the same except for some interior changes.&lt;ref name="Kimes1996"/&gt;

In 1924 large touring sedans began to be used by police departments around the country. They were known as Police Flyers, which were equipped with four-wheel brakes, two years before they were introduced on private-sale vehicles. These specially equipped vehicles, with bulletproof windshields measuring 7/8 of an inch thick and spot lights mounted on the ends of the windshield, also came with an automatic windshield wiper for the driver and a hand-operated wiper for the front passenger. Police whistles were coupled to the exhaust system and gun racks were also fitted to these vehicles.

[[File:1924 Lincoln Limousine.jpg|thumb|left|1927-28 Lincoln L-series limousine]]
In 1927, the L series got smaller wheels with 4-wheel standard mechanical brakes.&lt;ref name="Kimes1996"/&gt; All instruments were on an oval surface. A larger engine (though no HP increase) came in 1928. 1929 brought [[Safety glass]] and dual windshield wipers. 1930 was the last year for the L series.

== Coachbuilt examples ==
Lincoln contracted with dozens of coachbuilders during the 1920s and early 30s to create multiple custom built vehicles, to include American, [[Murray Corporation of America#Automotive bodies industry consolidation|Anderson]], Babcock, [[Holbrook Company|Holbrook]], [[John B Judkins Company|Judkins]], Lang, [[LeBaron Incorporated|LeBaron]], Locke, [[Murray Corporation of America|Murray]], [[Murray Corporation of America#Automotive bodies industry consolidation|Towson]], and [[Willoughby Company|Willoughby]] in the 1920s. [[Walter M Murphy Company|Murphy]], [[Rollston]], and [[Waterhouse Company|Waterhouse]] were added in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://willoughbycoach.com/StoryDomain_Lincoln.htm|title=Willoughby Coach|date=|publisher=Willoughby Coach|access-date=January 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=This source fails to meet Wikipedia's criteria for reliability—see [[WP:USERG]]|date=December 2012}}  Optional equipment was not necessarily an issue with 1920s Lincolns; special and bespoke items were accommodated on customer vehicles. A nickel-plated radiator shell could be installed for $25, varnished natural wood wheels were $15, or [[Rudge-Whitworth]] center-lock wire wheels for another $100. [[Disteel]] steel disc wheels were also available for $60. 

Lincoln chose not to make yearly model changes, used as a marketing tool of the time, designed to lure new customers. Lincoln customers of the time were known to purchase more than one Lincoln with different bodywork, so changing the vehicle yearly was not done to accommodate their customer base.&lt;ref name="bentley"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Old Car Book|last=Bentley|first=John|year=1952|volume=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|52–57}}

== Pop culture ==
A 1924 Lincoln was featured in the first season of the classic CBS sitcom [[The Good Guys (1968 TV series)|The Good Guys]].

In the 1986 comedy movie, [[The Money Pit]], the house came with a [http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_29723-Lincoln.html 1929-30 Lincoln L-series 4-door Sport Phaeton] as a part of the purchase.

The '''Lincoln H-series''' is  a [[full-size]] [[luxury car]] that was sold by [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln]] from the 1946 through the 1948 model years. Their appearance was very similar to the contemporaneous [[Lincoln Continental]] coupe and convertible. An electric clock was standard.&lt;ref name=Flory/&gt; This series of vehicles continued to use the 305&amp;nbsp;in³ (4.8&amp;nbsp;L) 65° L-head [[Lincoln L-head V12 engine|Lincoln V12 engine]].

The '''Lincoln EL-Series''' is a [[Luxury vehicle|full-size luxury car]] that was marketed and sold by the [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln]] division of Ford Motor Company from the 1949 to 1951 model years. For the 1949 model year, Ford introduced redesigned model lines for all three of its divisions. To share development costs, Ford combined its separate Lincoln and Mercury divisions into the Lincoln-Mercury Division following World War II. As a result, the redesigned postwar Lincoln shared much of its design with the redesigned [[Mercury Eight#1949–1951|1949 Mercury Eight]].

As with its K-Series and H-Series predecessors, the division marketed the EL-Series using only the Lincoln division name; the [[Lincoln Cosmopolitan]] was only the third Lincoln (beyond the Zephyr and Continental) to have a separate model name. In a major departure from division precedent, the EL-Series was the first Lincoln produced without a V12 engine. As a V12 developed for the EL-Series was stillborn, Lincoln utilized a version of the [[Ford flathead V8 engine|Ford Flathead V8]] shared with the [[Ford F-Series first generation|Ford F-7 and F-8]] conventional trucks.

== Model History          ==

===1949===
The first all-new postwar Lincolns were introduced on April 22, 1948.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; They had a more streamlined appearance than the 1948 models, reflecting "[[Ponton (automobile)|ponton]]" styling. However the new two-piece windshield seemed a bit out of sync with the modern styling.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; At a distance it was hard to tell a Lincoln apart from a [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]]. Recessed headlights and a shinier front end set it apart.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; The 337 cubic inch Lincoln flathead V8 produced {{convert|152|hp|kW|abbr=on}} at 3600&amp;nbsp;rpm.

===1950===
[[File:1950 Lincoln standard four-door sedan, Lime Rock.jpg|thumb|left|1950 Lincoln four-door sedan with [[suicide doors]]]]
In 1950 a new horizontal grille with elements enhanced the appearance of the standard Lincoln.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Its name was in the same location on the front fender as last year, but it was larger.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; The doorhandles were improved as was the previously confusing interior layout. The convertible was dropped from the lineup as Mercury's near-identical convertible had outsold it by a wide margin in 1949.&lt;ref name=SIA&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://assets.blog.hemmings.com/wp-content/uploads//2012/09/SIA-1950Lincoln_06_1500.jpg | page = 59 | issue = 130 | journal = Special Interest Autos | title = 1950 Lincoln: More than a Mercury? | ref = SIA1 | last = Howley | first = Tim | publisher = Hemmings Motor News | date = July–August 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 July 1950 the '''Lincoln Lido''' was introduced as somewhat of Lincoln's answer to the [[General Motors|GM]] hardtops that had debuted in 1949. List price for the 1950 model was $2721. It was similar to the [[Mercury Monterey]] and the up market [[Lincoln Cosmopolitan]] Capri coupes, while the Lido was also offered as a sedan with [[suicide doors]] for rear seat passengers. Both years of the Lido featured a vinyl or canvas-covered roof, fender skirts, bright roof drip rails and rocker panel moldings, dual door mirrors, a gold-colored hood ornament from the Cosmopolitan and a custom leather interior with special door and side panels. An electric clock was standard.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name=foldout&gt;http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1951_Lincoln/1951_Lincoln_Foldout/1951%20Lincoln%20Foldout-02-03.html&lt;/ref&gt; Few were sold, as customers preferred General Motors' hardtop offerings. The Lido name, however, reappeared on a 1963 show car called the Lincoln Continental Lido, which was a 1963 Continental with a padded vinyl roof.

Late in the 1950 model year the engine was upgraded to address vibration and oil consumption concerns. Three rather than four piston rings were fitted, and the engine balancing was improved. As a result the horsepower rating increased marginally and the car ran smoother. The cooling system was also improved and durability was increased thanks to the use of more alloy.&lt;ref name=howley60&gt;[[#SIA1|Howley]], [http://assets.blog.hemmings.com/wp-content/uploads//2012/09/SIA-1950Lincoln_07_1500.jpg p. 60]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clear_left}}

===1951===
According to the Standard Catalog of American Cars, the front end of the 1951 Lincoln "looked like a 1950 model that had gotten into a fight, and lost."&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; The grille bar only extended from the center section to the bumper guards, while a forward slanting vertical piece was added to the front fender side chrome.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; The 1951 Mercury's "fishtail" rear design was also adopted, to the detriment of rearward visibility(*).&lt;ref name=SIA/&gt; The glamorous Lido coupe returned with a canvas or vinyl roof, fender skirts, rocker panel molding and custom interior.&lt;ref name=foldout/&gt; (*)Other than here, there is no reference to a Mercury "fish tail" design. The '51 Lincoln's modified C pillar actually increased rearward vision.

The 2006 Lincoln Zephyr was initially unveiled in [[Concept vehicle|concept]] form at the [[New York International Auto Show#2004|2004 New York International Auto Show]] as a new entry-level luxury sedan, with several revised design elements from concept made their way into the production model. The front featured Lincoln's signature waterfall grille and jeweled quad projector beam headlights ([[High-intensity discharge lamp|HID headlights]] were available). Chrome trim extends along the Zephyr's beltline while the car's rear fascia features [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] taillights and dual chrome exhaust tips. All Zephyrs featured low-profile tires on 17x7.5-inch wheels with painted aluminum versions standard and chrome versions optional.

Lincoln officially revived [[Lincoln-Zephyr|the Zephyr name]] in the fall of 2005; the vehicles were based on the [[Ford CD3 platform|CD3 platform]], which was derived from the [[Mazda 6]]. Lincoln had previously used the Zephyr name in the late 1930s for the smaller [[Lincoln-Zephyr]] line of mid-size vehicles.  The "[[Ford Fairmont#Mercury Zephyr|Zephyr]]" name had also previously been used by Mercury during the late 1970s and early 1980s, for several vehicles built on the [[Ford Fox platform|Fox Platform]].

The Zephyr's sole powertrain was a 3.0&amp;nbsp;L [[Dual overhead cam|DOHC]] [[Ford Duratec engine|Duratec]] [[V6 engine|V6]] mated to an [[Aisin Seiki Co.|Aisin]] 6-speed [[automatic transmission]]; identical to the V6 powertrain that was optional in the Fusion and Milan. The interior is largely unique to the Lincoln, along with different equipment packaging. The 2006 Zephyr started at a base [[Suggested retail price|MSRP]] of $28,995 [[United States dollar|USD]], ranging up to $35,340 [[United States dollar|USD]] when fully optioned.&lt;ref&gt;Ford Motor Company. "2006 Zephyr Pricing." Ford Media. Jun. 16 2005. {{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id%3D1236%26item_id%3D3998%26press_section_id%3D2877 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601031811/http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=1236&amp;item_id=3998&amp;press_section_id=2877 |archivedate=2009-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though slightly smaller and [[front-wheel drive]], the Zephyr was marketed as a replacement for Lincoln's previous entry level mid-size, the [[Automobile layout|rear-wheel drive]] [[Lincoln LS]]. To facilitate a smooth transition, the Zephyr and LS were sold parallel to each other during the 2006 model year, the first model year of the Zephyr and the last for the LS. For 2007 the model was renamed MKZ, and took over the LS' market with sales beginning in September 2006. Lincoln's decision to resurrect the Zephyr name refers to the very early days of Lincoln before World War II. At that time, the only Lincoln manufactured was the [[Lincoln K-series]] which was a full-size sedan, and Lincoln, under the direction of [[Edsel Ford]], Henry Ford's only son, hoped to introduce a smaller product to compete with the [[Packard One-Twenty]], and the [[LaSalle (automobile)|LaSalle]], a smaller sibling offered at Cadillac dealerships.

The Zephyr featured a revised interior from the Fusion and Milan. The design featured shapes with real [[ebony]] or [[maple]] wood inserts (depending on desired trim) in metallic frames. These surfaces were contrasted with chrome-bezeled gauges, circular, chrome-finished vents and a metallic center stack where the radio and climate controls are housed. The Zephyr's steering wheel was leather-wrapped with real wood grips and satin-nickel audio, climate, and cruise control buttons. White LED backlighting was used for the Zephyr's controls and instrumentation. Leather seating surfaces were standard in all models.&lt;ref&gt;Ford Motor Company. "2006 Zephyr Exterior/Interior." Ford Media. 2005. {{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id%3D1236%26item_id%3D3864%26press_section_id%3D2869 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601024152/http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=1236&amp;item_id=3864&amp;press_section_id=2869 |archivedate=2009-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these standard features in the Zephyr included: [[cruise control]], automatic headlights, fog lights, power door locks, "global" power windows (all windows can lower simultaneously at the push of a button), power adjustable and heated mirrors with puddle lamps, remote keyless entry, a tilt and telescoping steering wheel with redundant audio and climate controls, dual-zone automatic climate control, a universal garage door opener, 10-way power driver and front passenger seats, rear-seat reading lamps, and a six-speaker audio system with an AM/FM stereo radio and a six-disc, MP3-compatible CD changer. Optional in the Zephyr was a power moonroof, a DVD-based satellite navigation system, [[High-intensity discharge lamp|HID headlights]], heated and cooled front seats, and an industry-first [[THX]] II-Certified audio system with a six-disc, MP3-compatible CD changer and ten speakers. Safety features included standard dual front-side airbags, front seat-deployed side airbags, and curtain airbags that extend from the front to rear seats.&lt;ref&gt;Ford Motor Company.

Mechanically the Zephyr was closely related to the Fusion and Milan. As mentioned, all three cars were based on Ford's [[Ford CD3 platform|CD3 platform]], which was in turn derived from the [[Mazda Atenza|Mazda 6]]. Like these cars the Zephyr is natively [[front-wheel drive]] (FWD). The Zephyr uses a coil-over damper, short- and long-arm ([[Double wishbone suspension|SLA]]) front suspension with double-ball-joint control arms while the rear suspension is an independent multi-link design with lower control arms and a {{convert|17|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} stabilizer bar. Spring rates, bushings, and dampers have been specially tuned for the Zephyr to provide excellent ride comfort without compromising handling. All Zephyrs feature standard four-wheel [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock]] disc brakes with [[Traction control system|traction control]]. The sole engine offered in the Zephyr was an all-aluminum 3.0&amp;nbsp;L [[Dual overhead cam|DOHC]] [[Ford Duratec engine|Duratec]] [[V6 engine|V6]] producing 221&amp;nbsp;hp (165&amp;nbsp;kW) at 6250&amp;nbsp;rpm and 205&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (278&amp;nbsp;N·m) of torque at 4800&amp;nbsp;rpm. This engine was mated to an [[Aisin Seiki Co.|Aisin]] 6-speed [[automatic transmission]] and had a final drive ratio of 3.46:1. This powertrain was identical to the V6 powertrain available in the Fusion and Milan from 2006–2009.&lt;ref&gt;Ford Motor Company. "2006 Zephyr Powertrain."

"2006 Lincoln Zephyr Review."

===2007 revision===
[[File:Lincoln MKZ.jpg|thumb|left|2007–2009 Lincoln MKZ]]

For 2007, the Zephyr was refreshed and renamed MKZ to follow a new [[nomenclature]] developed by Lincoln that mimics the [[alphanumeric]] naming schemes used by other luxury automakers like Mercedes-Benz. Management at Lincoln originally announced the MKZ with a "[[Lincoln Mark series|mark]]-zee" pronunciation during the 2006 auto show circuit, but eventually changed it to the phonetic "em-kay-zee" due to confusion observed among focus groups and dealership personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cars.com/kickingtires/2006/07/lincoln_mkx_mkz.html|title=Lincoln Dealer Confusion Forces Model Name Changes|publisher=Cars.com|date=2006-07-24|accessdate=2006-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 MKZ was first shown at the [[Chicago Auto Show#2006|Chicago Auto Show]] in February 2006. In addition to its new name, the MKZ gained a number of changes over its predecessor. The standard and optional versions of the MKZ's 17 x 7.5-inch wheels were restyled. An intelligent all-wheel-drive system was now available, seamlessly distributing power to each wheel for optimum traction. Powering the MKZ, and taking a large step toward further differentiating the car from the Fusion and Milan, was Ford's new, all-aluminum 3.5-L [[Dual overhead cam|DOHC]] [[Ford Cyclone engine|Duratec 35]] [[V6 engine|V6]]. The engine was tuned to produce 265&amp;nbsp;hp (196&amp;nbsp;kW) at 6250&amp;nbsp;rpm and 249&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (337&amp;nbsp;N·m) of torque at 4500&amp;nbsp;rpm. Significantly, the new engine needed only 87-octane regular-grade gasoline to achieve its output.&lt;ref&gt;Ford Motor Company. "2007 MKZ Overview." Ford Media. 2006. {{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id%3D1378%26item_id%3D4280%26press_section_id%3D2870 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601024157/http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=1378&amp;item_id=4280&amp;press_section_id=2870 |archivedate=2009-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in spite of the MKZ's power advantage over the 3.0-L DOHC V6-equipped Zephyr, the fuel economy of the MKZ rivals that of the Zephyr at {{convert|17|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} in city driving and {{convert|25|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} on the highway in front-wheel-drive models.&lt;ref&gt;United States.

Environmental Protection Agency. 2008. http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/calculatorSelectEngine.jsp?year=2007&amp;make=Lincoln&amp;model=MKZ%20FWD&lt;/ref&gt; A road test by ''[[Motor Trend]]'' found that an MKZ equipped with all-wheel-drive could accelerate from zero to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 6.8 seconds and complete a quarter mile in 15.2 seconds at {{convert|93.4|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} due to the more powerful engine and extra traction.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Matt. "First Test: 2007 Lincoln MKZ AWD." Motor Trend. 2006. http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/sedans/112_0703_2007_lincoln_mkz/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; One of the few other changes applied to the 2007 MKZ was a revision to the available [[THX]] II-certified audio system to increase speakers to 14 and its peak output to 600 [[watt]]s. Beyond the MKZ's changes, the car remained positioned as an entry-level luxury sedan with base models still starting at just under [[United States dollar|US$]]30,000 and fully optioned models remaining below $40,000.

For 2008, the MKZ received new standard features as a part of Lincoln's continued effort to refine the car. [[Sirius satellite radio]], perforated leather seats, a reverse sensing system, a tire pressure-monitoring system, and [[Ford Sync|Lincoln SYNC]] (late availability) were all newly standard.&lt;ref&gt;Ford Motor Company.

[[File:2010 Lincoln MKZ 3.jpg|thumb|right|2010 Lincoln MKZ]]
The 2010 MKZ was unveiled at the [[Los Angeles International Auto Show#2008|2008 Los Angeles International Auto Show]], revealing an extensive update with a revised interior and exterior in addition to new features. The MKZ's exterior featured revised front and rear fascias. The MKZ's headlights were new, while its fascia and split-wing grille closely resembled that of the [[Lincoln MKR]] concept. In the rear, the taillights have been revised to be longer and thinner, similar to the original Zephyr concept. The MKZ's standard and optional 17-inch wheels were restyled and featured an 18-inch wheel option. Inside, the MKZ's interior was revised, using real wood accents and metal surfaces. [[Bridge of Weir]] leather seating surfaces were standard. Other features new for 2010 included a reverse camera system, [[Sirius satellite radio|Sirius]] Travel Link, a DVD-based satellite navigation system updated to accept voice commands, rain-sensing windshield wipers, a cabin air filter, and adaptive [[High-intensity discharge lamp|HID headlights]]. Mechanically, the MKZ featured suspension revised to improve ride quality and handling and a new 'SelectShift' six-speed [[automatic transmission]]. The 2010 MKZ was released during the spring of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Ford Motor Company. "2010 Lincoln MKZ Builds on Success with New Face, New Interior, More Features, Quieter Experience." Ford Media.

Ford redesigned the Lincoln MKZ for the 2013 model year, sharing the company's CD4 platform with [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Fusion]] and [[Ford Mondeo|Mondeo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Lincoln MKZ|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/features/2013-lincoln-mkz-feature|work=Car and Driver}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[concept car|concept model]] debuted at the [[North American International Auto Show#2012|2012 North American International Auto Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/10/mkz-concept-is-the-next-step-in-lincolns-reinvention/?emc=eta1 |title=MKZ Concept Is the Next Step in Lincoln’s Reinvention |author=Jerry Garrett|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2012-01-10|accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production version of the second-generation MKZ was unveiled at the [[New York Auto Show#2012|2012 New York Auto Show]]. It followed the general concept idea released in the model displayed at the 2012 Detroit Auto Show.

The MKZ was originally set to be released in November 2012, but this was set back to January after Fusion production was delayed, which is produced at the same plant.  Its release date was again pushed back after Ford looked to iron out any possible quality issues.  Some MKZs were even shipped from the Mexican facility to Ford's Flat Rock plant to be reassured and inspected that they were ready to be sent to dealerships. This was an unprecedented move for such a big product launch, but Ford felt it would be profitable in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.autoblog.com/2013/02/12/lincoln-dealers-frustrated-over-slow-mkz-production-ramp-up/ "Lincoln dealers frustrated over slow MKZ production ramp-up" from autoblog (February 12, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;  Cars finally started to reach dealerships in sufficient quantities by mid-March 2013.

Ford offered the 2013 MKZ with three powertrains: a 240-horsepower EcoBoost 2-liter four-cylinder (FWD or AWD), a 300-horsepower 3.7-liter [[V6]] (FWD or AWD), and a hybrid system based on the 2-liter power plant. The hybrid, like the previous-generation MKZ Hybrid, was available for the same price as the non-hybrid model.&lt;ref name=AG101612&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/10/16/lincoln-mkz-hybrid-rated-at-45-mpg-below-47-mpg-fusion-hybrid/|title=Lincoln MKZ Hybrid rated at 45 mpg, below 47-mpg Fusion Hybrid |author=Sebastian Blanco|publisher=[[Autoblog.com]] |date=2012-10-16|accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/03/in-new-york-lincoln-mkz-makes-a-proposition/?emc=eta1|title=In New York, Lincoln MKZ Makes a Proposition |author=Tamara Warren|work=The New York Times|date=2012-04-03|accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the model's significant redesign for 2013, changes to the 2014 MKZ were primarily limited to color choices.  For 2015, automatic headlights, rear parking sensors and rear view camera became standard.

===EPA ratings===
[[File:Lincoln MKZ concept WAS 2012 0509.JPG|thumb|left|The Lincoln MKZ [[concept car|concept]] was unveiled at the 2012 [[North American International Auto Show]].]]
The [[US Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) rated the 2013 MKZ Hybrid at {{convert|45|mpgus|abbr=on}} with the same rating for combined/city/highway cycles. The 2013 model year 2.0-liter, 4-cylinder FWD automatic MKZ rating is {{convert|26|mpgus|abbr=on}} combined, {{convert|22|mpgus|abbr=on}} in the city, and {{convert|33|mpgus|abbr=on}} on the highway.

These ratings allowed the 2013 MKZ Hybrid to become the most fuel-efficient luxury vehicle in the U.S. and improve the fuel economy of the [[Lexus ES#Sixth generation|Lexus ES 300h]] hybrid by 5 mpg&lt;sub&gt;-US&lt;/sub&gt; on the combined cycle. Despite sharing the same powertrain, the 2013 MKZ Hybrid rated 2 mpg&lt;sub&gt;-US&lt;/sub&gt; combined less than its sibling, the second-generation [[Ford Fusion Hybrid#Second generation|Ford Fusion Hybrid]] at {{convert|47|mpgus|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=AG101612/&gt;

===2017 facelift===
[[File:2017 Lincoln MKZ 'Select' 2.0T front 5.19.19.jpg|thumb|left|2017 Lincoln MKZ]]

The MKZ received a facelift for the 2017 model year. Revealed on November 18, 2015 at the [[LA Auto Show#2015|LA Auto Show]], the MKZ is the first to adopt Lincoln's new design language previewed earlier on the [[Lincoln Continental#2015 (New York Auto Show)|Lincoln Continental]] concept car, featuring redesigned front grille and headlights. The 3.7 L V6 will be dropped in favor of an all-new 3.0 L twin-turbo V6 engine unique to Lincoln, producing between 350 and 400 horsepower depending on the drive-train.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2017-lincoln-mkz-photos-and-info-news|title=2017 Lincoln MKZ Revealed: Further from the Ford|first=Eric|last=Tingwall|work=[[Car and Driver]]|date=2015-11-18|accessdate=2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1101038_2017-lincoln-mkz-gets-major-update|title=2017 Lincoln MKZ Gets Major Update, 400 Horsepower|first=Kirk|last=Bell|work=Motor Authority|date=2015-11-17|accessdate=2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trim levels include the standard model, plus Premiere, Select, Reserve and top level Black Label, which is three special appearance packages, a tradition started with the [[Lincoln Continental Mark IV#Continental Mark IV designer editions|Designer Editions]] in 1976. The MKZ offers the "Vineyard" (unique to the MKZ), "Chalet", and "Thoroughbred" theme appearance packages. In continuing with Lincoln tradition, [[Bridge of Weir]] "Deepsoft" leather is used for the Select and Reserve trim packages.

The transmission is no longer activated with a center console installed [[gear stick#Electronic gear shifts|transmission selector]]; the computer controlled transmission uses buttons installed to the left of the [[MyLincoln Touch]] infotainment touch screen labeled "P, R, N, D, S", a revival of an approach used in the 1950s by the [[Chrysler PowerFlite transmission|Chrysler push button PowerFlite]] and the [[Ultramatic#1956: Ultramatic and Touchbutton Ultramatic|Packard Touchbutton Ultramatic]]. The "S" transmission selection represents "Sport" mode, where the Continuously Controlled Damping suspension, electric power steering and transmission shift points take on a different posture.

The '''Lincoln MKC''' is a [[Compact car|compact]] premium [[crossover (automobile)|crossover]] from [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln]]. Lincoln launched the MKC concept at the [[LA Auto Show#2013|2013 LA Auto Show]]&lt;ref name=autoweek2013&gt;{{cite journal |date=2013-12-09 |title=The Full Spectrum |journal=[[Autoweek]] |publisher=[[Crain Communications]] |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the production model officially went on sale in June 2014. The MKC is built upon the [[Ford C1 platform#Global C platform|Ford Global C platform]], shared with the [[Ford Escape]] small [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]].

For the 2020 model year, the MKC has been replaced by the [[Lincoln Corsair]], as Lincoln transitions away from "MK" model nomenclatures.  

==Model overview==
Lincoln unveiled the MKC concept at the [[North American International Auto Show#2013|North American International Auto Show]] in Detroit in January 2013. The MKC went on sale in the summer of 2014 as a 2015 model. It is assembled at [[Louisville Assembly Plant]].  According to the manufacturer, the MKC further refines Lincoln's design traits originally embodied on the second generation [[Lincoln MKZ|MKZ]].&lt;ref&gt;http://corporate.ford.com/news-center/press-releases-detail/all-new-2015-lincoln-mkc&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2016 model year, Lincoln replaced the [[MyFord Touch|MyLincoln Touch]] infotainment system with the [[Ford Sync#Sync 3|SYNC 3]] system.  On the Select trim level, the power liftgate was made standard.  For versions with the 2.3L engine, maximum towing capacity was increased to 3000 pounds.   

For 2017, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto were added to the SYNC 3 system and power liftgate and automatic brake hold were made standard.

For 2018 , Lincoln added the Lincoln Connect 4G Wi-Fi system (standard on all trims). Premium models received four way power lumbar control for the driver seat and power lumbar was added for both seats on Select and higher trims. 

=== 2019 facelift ===
For the 2019 model year, the MKC received a refresh, which included abandoning the split-wing grille for the current rectangular corporate grille.

===Powertrain===
The standard engine is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder EcoBoost gasoline engine generating {{cvt|245|hp|kW PS}} and {{cvt|275|lbft}} of torque. A 2.3-liter four cylinder EcoBoost gasoline engine generating {{cvt|285|hp|kW PS}} and {{cvt|305|lbft}} is also offered.&lt;ref name=autoweek2013/&gt;

The 6-speed, computer-controlled [[automatic transmission]] is activated with a [[Gear stick#Electronic gear shifts|transmission selector]]; it uses buttons installed to the left of the [[MyLincoln Touch]] infotainment touch screen labeled "P, R, N, D, S", a revival of an approach used in the 1950s by the [[Chrysler PowerFlite transmission]] and the [[Ultramatic#1956: Ultramatic and Touchbutton Ultramatic|Packard Touchbutton Ultramatic]]. The "S" transmission selection represents "Sport" mode, where the Continuously Controlled Damping suspension, electric power steering and transmission shift points take on a different posture.

=== Trim ===
Trim levels include the standard model, Premiere, Select, Reserve and top-level Black Label.   In line with the [[Lincoln Continental Mark IV#Continental Mark IV designer editions|Designer Editions]] of the 1970s Mark IV and Mark V, the Black Label trim a series of themed appearance packages developed specifically for each Lincoln model line.  The MKC Black Label offers the "Center Stage" (unique to the MKC), "Modern Heritage" and "Indulgence" theme appearance packages.

==Marketing==
In August 2014, Lincoln signed a multi-year endorsement contract with Oscar-winning actor [[Matthew McConaughey]] to star in a series of spots promoting the 2015 MKC.&lt;ref&gt;Wernle, Bernie (August 21, 2014) "New 2015 Lincoln MKC ads star Matthew McConaughey" http://www.autonews.com/article/20140821/RETAIL03/140829987/new-2015-lincoln-mkc-ads-star-matthew-mcconaughey#&lt;/ref&gt;

To also market the new MKC, Lincoln introduced the Lincoln Date Night promotion, which allows those who qualify and participate to experience an extended test drive in the 2015 MKC and dinner for two at a restaurant of their choice, compliments of Lincoln.&lt;ref&gt;https://securemg.lincoln.com/datenight/request_info.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lincoln K series''' (also called the '''Lincoln Model K''', in line with Ford nomenclature) is a luxury vehicle that was produced by the [[Lincoln Motor Company]].  The second motor line produced by the company, the Model K was developed from the Model L, including a modernized chassis on a longer wheelbase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1931-1940-lincoln-model-k.htm|title=1931-1940 Lincoln Model K|date=2007-11-29|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|access-date=2019-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1931, Lincoln introduced a V-12 engine, becoming a feature of the company for nearly 20 years.  

One of the most exclusive vehicles produced in the United States during the 1930s, the Model K competed against the [[Cadillac V-12]] and [[Cadillac V-16|V-16]], [[Packard|Packard Twin Six]], [[Chrysler Imperial#1931–1933|Chrysler Imperial]], [[Pierce-Arrow|Pierce-Arrow Model 53]] and the [[Duesenberg Model J]].  Alongside multiple body configurations produced by Lincoln in [[Lincoln Motor Company Plant|its Detroit assembly facility]], bare chassis were provided for [[Coachbuilder|coachbuilders]] for [[bespoke]] bodywork (in line with Rolls-Royce, Bentley, and Bugatti).      

After the 1939 model year, Lincoln ended production of the Model K, selling leftover vehicles as 1940 models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1931-1940-lincoln-model-k6.htm|title=1931-1940 Lincoln Model K|date=2007-11-29|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|access-date=2019-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For 1941 and 1942, the [[Lincoln Custom]] was sold as an indirect successor to the Model K, offered as an 8-passenger limousine or touring sedan produced as a long-wheelbase version of the [[Lincoln-Zephyr]].  Since World War II, various Lincoln sedans (the Continental or its Town Car successor) have been produced as long-wheelbase sedans or factory limousines, but no direct model line has been developed as a successor to the Model K (as of 2020 production).  

==1931==
[[File:Lincoln K 1.jpg|thumb|left|1931 Model K [[LeBaron Incorporated|LeBaron]] roadster convertible]]
The original Model K appeared in the 1931 model year on a new chassis with a 145&amp;nbsp;in (3683&amp;nbsp;mm) wheelbase.  Factory bodies included two- and four-door [[Phaeton body|phaetons]], the latter available as a dual-cowl model.  The 384.8&amp;nbsp;in³ (6.3&amp;nbsp;L) engine was a derivative of the earlier [[Lincoln L-series|L-series]] 60° [[V8 engine|V8]], but a dual venturi downdraft Stromberg [[carburetor]], higher [[compression ratio|compression]], and altered timing raised the power to 120&amp;nbsp;hp (89&amp;nbsp;kW). 

It competed with the recently introduced [[Chrysler Imperial#1931–1933|Chrysler Imperial]], [[Rolls-Royce Phantom II]], [[Mercedes-Benz 770]], [[Duesenberg Model J]], [[Packard Eight]], and the [[Cadillac Series 355]].

==1932==
[[File:Lincoln 50 L Victoria pic2.JPG|thumb|left|1932 Model KA Victoria coupe]]The Lincoln K series was split in 1932 into two lines, the V8 carryover '''Model KA''' and the new [[V12 engine|V12]]-powered '''Model KB'''. The V8 car reverted to a 136&amp;nbsp;in (3454&amp;nbsp;mm) wheelbase, though engine output was pushed to 125&amp;nbsp;hp (93&amp;nbsp;kW).  The KB, on the other hand, featured the marque's [[Lincoln L-head V12 engine|new L-head V12 engine]]. The 447.9&amp;nbsp;cuin (7.3&amp;nbsp;L) 65° L-head unit produced 150&amp;nbsp;hp (112&amp;nbsp;kW).&lt;ref name=Bonhams&gt;{{ citation | title = Greenwich Concours d'Elegance Auction | publisher = Bonhams &amp; Butterfields Auctioneers | type = Auction Catalogue | id = Sale Number 21153 | publication-place = New York, NY | chapter = 329 | page = 94 | date = 2013-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both series featured a new grille with less of a surround, vent doors rather than vertical louvers on the sides of the hood, a parking light on top of each front fender, and 18&amp;nbsp;inch wire wheels. The Lincoln V-12 competed directly with cross town rival [[Cadillac V-12]] introduced earlier in 1930, and it joined a select group of 1930s cars with multicylinder engines, namely those manufactured by [[Franklin (automobile)|Franklin]], [[Hispano-Suiza]], [[Horch]], [[Lagonda]], [[Maybach]], [[Packard]], [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]], [[Tatra (car)|Tatra]], [[Avions Voisin|Voisin]], [[Walter Engines|Walter]], and [[Marmon Motor Car Company|Marmon]]. The Victoria Coupe was offered as both a steel roof and a convertible, and the coupe was the inspiration for the smaller [[1932 Ford#1932|1932 Ford Victoria coupe]], also offered with a V8 engine but a more affordable price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lincoln Series KA Victoria coupe|url=http://www.desertclassics.com/Linc32KAcp.html|website=Desert Classics|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lincoln Victoria coupe, first introduced in limited numbers in 1929,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1929 Lincoln Victoria LeBaron coupe|url=http://significantcars.com/cars/1929lincoln2/|website=Significant Cars.com|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; also competed with the [[Packard Light Eight#Body styles|Packard Light Eight Victoria coupe]] also in 1932.
[[File:Lincoln V12 KA at Mahy Mobiles Leuze 052.jpg|thumb|1933 Model KA roadster by Murray]]
==1933==
The V8 engine was replaced in the Model KA with a new 381.7&amp;nbsp;in³ (6.3&amp;nbsp;L) V12 for 1933.  This L-head engine shared little with the big KB engine which continued unchanged.

The 1933 K-series Lincolns featured many changes, only a few of which were readily visible.  The removal of the bar linking the headlights and return of hood louvers was most noticeable, but the revised chassis, thermostatic shock absorbers, and transmission made the greatest difference.  Drivers would notice the adjustable-pressure brakes.

Both V12 engines were replaced for 1934 by a single {{convert|414|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} version of the new Model KA V12, with the KA and KB names now denoting the wheelbase only.  Styling changes included a body-colored grille surround and the replacement once again of louvers with doors on the side of the hood.

==1935==
The Lincoln line was greatly trimmed for 1935, with all cars simply called Model K.  The marque attempted to improve profitability by focusing on the lofty over-$4,000 segment, limiting sales in the depression-wracked United States.

==1936==
The Model K's days were numbered as the less-expensive and more-modern [[Lincoln-Zephyr]] debuted for 1936.  

A 7-passenger Model K limousine was the marque's best-selling model despite its $4700 price, however.  

The grille and front fascia were again redesigned, and a revised raked windshield and pressed steel wheels were now used.

The Model K continued in production for five more years, but sales declined rapidly with the modern Zephyr and new flagship [[Lincoln Continental|Continental]] being more appealing to buyers.  Production was evidently completed during the 1939 model year. 

The last Lincoln K series was delivered in January 1940. 

The "[[Sunshine Special (automobile)|Sunshine Special]]" parade phaeton built for President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] in 1939 was modified in 1942 with current Lincoln front sheetmetal.
