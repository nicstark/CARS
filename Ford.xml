The '''Ford Del Rey''' is a [[midsized car]] produced by [[Ford do Brasil]] in [[Brazil]] from 1981 to 1991. It was a successor to the popular [[Ford Corcel#Corcel II|Ford Corcel II]]. Like the [[Ford Corcel#Corcel II|Corcel II]], the Del Rey was designed exclusively for Brazil, but was sold in [[Chile]], [[Venezuela]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Paraguay]], as well.

The Del Rey was offered as a two-door coupé, four-door sedan, or three-door station wagon. A two-door convertible prototype was also shown in 1982, but never entered production.&lt;ref name="AK83"&gt;{{cite book | ref = AK83 | title = Auto Katalog 1983 | editor-last = Heitz | editor-first = Rudolf | publisher = [[:de:Motor Presse Stuttgart|Vereinigte Motor-Verlage GmbH &amp; Co.

The '''Ford Torino Talladega''' is a [[muscle car]] that was produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] only during the first few weeks of 1969.  It was named for the [[Talladega Superspeedway]], which opened the same year. The Talladega was a special, more aerodynamic version of the [[Ford Torino|Torino]] / [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Fairlane]] Cobra, produced specifically to make Ford even more competitive in [[NASCAR]] racing, and it was sold to the public only because [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologation]] rules required a certain minimum number of cars (500 in 1969) be produced and made available.

A largely equivalent vehicle was also sold under the [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] marque as the [[Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II|Cyclone Spoiler II]].

==Design==
The 1969 Torino Talladega was based on the Fairlane Cobra "Sportsroof" (Ford's trade name for a [[fastback]]) 2-door hardtop. To make the car more aerodynamic at high speeds, a sleeker front section (whose design and construction is often attributed to the Holman-Moody race team's shop) was added. Regular production Fairlanes and Torinos had a then-fashionable inset grille and headlights, which fared poorly in the wind tunnel. The Torino Talladega replaced this nose with one that extended the car's length by about six inches, with a flush-mounted grille on a more aerodynamic front end. The close-fitting bumper was actually a rear bumper that had been cut, narrowed, V'ed in the center, and filled on the ends to create a crude air dam, further improving the aerodynamics of the car at high speeds.

[[File:Bunkie Knudsen Talladega.jpg|thumb|right|Semon E "Bunkie" Knudsen's custom built Talladega]]
In another well kept secret design move, the rocker panels of the Talladega were reshaped and rolled to allow Ford teams to run their racing cars about an inch closer to the ground while staying within NASCAR rules; this also greatly enhanced the top speed of the car by lowering its center of gravity,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} and further reducing its wind resistance.  The cars were also equipped with an engine oil cooler, a power steering oil cooler, staggered shocks, a 3.25:1 Ford 9&amp;nbsp;inch 31 spline nodular open rear end, and most surprisingly: a heavy duty C-6 (cast iron tailshaft) automatic transmission that was column shifted.  These other special performance parts were normally only available when ordering a "drag pack car" which would have been equipped with a 4 speed and a limited slip rear end.

Also unique to the Talladega was the presence of competition black hoods and rear tail panels on all production cars, as well as the only interior offered:  black vinyl and cloth with a front bench seat.

==Racing involvement==
[[File:Reproduction of the 1969 Ford Talladega Race Car driven by David Pearson.jpg|thumb|left|Reproduction of David Pearson's 1969 NASCAR Championship Talladega]]
Racing versions of the car were initially fitted with the [[Ford FE engine|FE 427 side oiler]] engine that had been Ford's main racing engine since 1963.  Later in the season, the [[Boss 429 Mustang|Boss 429]] engine was used by many of the teams, after it had finally been declared "officially homologated" by NASCAR president [[Bill France, Sr.|Bill France]].  The Boss 429 engine was homologated in the 1969 [[Ford Mustang]] [[Boss 429]]. In a very unusual move, Ford homologated the engine separately from the car in which it was to race.  Many experts think this may have been done in order to get the bodywork of the Talladega officially homologated at the beginning of the 1969 race season, as the Boss 429 was not yet in production in sufficient numbers to homologate it.  All production Talladegas were actually equipped with the new [[Ford FE engine|428 Cobra Jet]], which, while very powerful and reliable, was intended as a street engine for Ford's muscle cars, as it developed high torque at low RPMs, rather than being a high-revving race engine.

===Accolades===
The Torino Talladega did exactly what Ford hoped it would do on the racing circuit: it won 29 Grand National races during the 1969 and 1970 NASCAR seasons - far more than any other model.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Further, it won the 1969 NASCAR Manufacturer's Championship with David Pearson winning the Driver's Championship, and it won the 1969 ARCA Manufacturer's Championship with Benny Parsons winning that Driver's Championship.  [[Chrysler]]'s initial competitor was the [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Dodge Charger 500]], which proved to be aerodynamically inferior to the Talladega,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} especially on NASCAR's super speedways (tracks of a mile or more in length).

After realizing that Ford's Talladega (and its sister ship, the Mercury Spoiler II) were much more effective as race cars, Dodge went back to the drawing board to create the [[Dodge Charger Daytona]], which managed to win a total of 6 races during the 1969 and 1970 NASCAR seasons. [[Richard Petty]] finished second in NASCAR's Grand National points race in 1969, driving a Talladega.

===Abandonment===
1969 was Ford's last year of factory involvement in racing of any kind for several years.  Following Congressional hearings in which they were questioned about the R&amp;D costs of racing vs. improving fuel economy and safety, Ford completely abandoned all of their racing programs, starting with the 1970 season.  Subsequently, most of the NASCAR and ARCA race teams that were running Fords continued to run their 1969 Talladegas in 1970 without any factory support, when it became apparent that their Talladegas were aerodynamically superior to the 1970 Torinos Ford had intended to be the Talladega's replacement.  After the 1970 season, NASCAR effectively banned the [[Aero Warriors|"aero cars"]] by restricting all five of these "production" cars to having to compete with engines no larger than 305 cubic inches of displacement (vs. the 426, 427, &amp; 429 cubic inches other cars could use), and the competitive history of the Talladega (and its aerodynamically-developed rivals) was essentially over.

==Production numbers==
[[File:Talladega trio.jpg|thumb|Examples of three production colors: Royal Maroon, Wimbledon White &amp; Presidential Blue]]
It is believed{{who|date=May 2017}} a total of 754 Talladegas may have been built, although the Talladega/Spoiler Registry can only account for 750.  This number includes all prototypes, pilot cars, and production cars built, plus a special post-production car  for the president of Ford Motor Company, [[Bunkie Knudsen|Semon "Bunkie" Knudsen]], in March 1969.  The Knudsen car was significantly different from all of the homologation cars with regard to options and color, and was even built at a different plant:  Ford's Lorain, Ohio plant on March 20, 1969.

All production examples were constructed during January and February 1969 at Ford's [[Atlanta Assembly]] plant in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], and all homologation cars between January 21 and February 28. (According to the Talladega/Spoiler Registry's records, Talladega number 502 was actually completed on January 31, and then the last 247 homologation cars were built between February 14 and February 28, following a 2-week break in production.)  It is unknown as to why Ford built an "extra" 247 homologation cars, once the homologation requirements had been met during the initial run, as it is thought that Ford lost several thousand dollars on every Talladega that was built.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The only options offered on the production vehicles (besides the three color choices, including Wimbledon White (286 built), Royal Maroon (258 built) or Presidential Blue (199 built)) were power steering, power brakes, color keyed racing mirrors, AM radio and argent styled steel wheels with F70 X 14 wide oval tires.  All production Talladegas received the same options with no substitutions including the C6 automatic transmission and Code 9 3.25 ratio conventional rear axle. &lt;ref&gt;Marti Auto Works #5012 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collectors==
[[File:Talladega and Spoiler Group.jpg|thumb|The seven colors and body styles of Talladega, Spoiler, and Spoiler II cars offered in 1969]]
Today, a Torino Talladega is a very collectible car.  It was a special purpose built vehicle (some have even called it a "showroom race car") with a very strong racing history, with major links to the NASCAR teams of 1969, that achieved great success during the Aero Wars.  Those few examples that still exist today, do so in very limited numbers.  Until recently, their values had not risen nearly as high as the [[Mopar]] "aero cars" in spite of their rarity and their great track successes during the pinnacle of stock car racing (the aero wars years).  Some experts have assumed that this was due to the sheer outrageousness of the Dodge Charger Daytona and the Plymouth Superbird, with their bolted on huge rear wings and nose cones; as the MOPAR winged cars' prices had eclipsed the far more subtle, and aerodynamically integrated, bodywork of the Ford Torino Talladega and its sibling, the [[Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II]].  Regardless, most experts still consider the Talladegas and the Spoiler IIs to be very undervalued; but, in 1969 (and overall during the two years of the aerowars) Ford's Talladegas (and Spoiler IIs) owned the high banks of NASCAR and ARCA.

==Description==
The '''Ford Parklane''' is a [[automobile|car]] that was produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in the United States for one year only, 1956. Launched to compete with the [[Chevrolet Nomad]], it was a two-door [[station wagon]], based on the [[Ford Ranch Wagon]],&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; but unlike that low-end [[workhorse]] model, it was equipped with all the fittings of Ford's top-end [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Fairlane]] models of that year, including the distinctive stainless steel side 'tick' and a well-appointed interior. An AM radio was $100, while the 4-way power seats were $60.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; Brakes were 11" drums.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1956"/&gt;

As a Nomad competitor, it was a successful one, since 15,186 were built in comparison to 7,886 of the competition.&lt;ref&gt;John Gunnell, Standard catalog of American Cars 1946-1975, Revised 4th Edition, page 396&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was that neither figure was particularly impressive; the Nomad (based on a Chevrolet concept car of 1954) wasn't doing all that well even before competition came over the horizon.

Two-door wagons in general have proven rather hard to sell; those who need the carrying capacity of a station wagon normally carry passengers and want easy access to those rear seats. A low-end model like the Ranch Wagon appeals to a market segment who primarily want the vehicle for its hauling capacity but occasionally need to carry people, but a higher-specification car isn't what those buyers need.

A prototype for a 1957 Parklane was built, but instead Ford produced the slightly [[downmarket]] [[Ford Del Rio|Del Rio]] as their 1957 two-door station wagon, making the Parklane a single-year only model, and quite a rarity.  Starting in 1958, the name ("[[Mercury Park Lane|Park Lane]]" separated by a space) was used for the top-line [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] series.

The Nomad, being based on a concept car, was always better known, but its main reason for fame - its use by surfers needing a vehicle to haul their boards around - came only after both cars were long discontinued. Surfers, although the perfect market for such a vehicle, never tended to buy new.

The Ford Bantam is a [[coupé utility]]/[[pickup truck|pickup]] (known in [[South African English]] as a '[[Bakkie]]') produced in [[South Africa]]. Production of the Bantam spanned three generations, with the vehicle produced in South Africa for sale within the South African market.

== History ==

Introduced in [[South Africa]] in 1983, the Bantam enjoyed success both as a rugged compact [[commercial vehicle]], and as a leisure-oriented private vehicle. It was discontinued in 2011 without immediate replacement. However, rumours continue to circulate that a next-generation replacement for the Bantam may reach the South African market by 2022.

Coupe utility pickups such as the Bantam are popular in South Africa as a more affordable, compact and [[Fuel_efficiency|fuel-efficient]] alternative to larger commercial pickups such as the [[Toyota Hilux]], [[Nissan Navara]] and Ford's own [[Ford Ranger|Ranger]]. Their [[subcompact_car|compact size and ease of handling]] means they are viable not just as light- to medium-duty commercial vehicles, but also as everyday transport.

Pickups intended for heavy commercial use (in South Africa, the so-called ''one-tonner'' class) tend to be based around a steel [[Vehicle_frame#Ladder_frame|ladder-frame chassis]], with the cab and load box mounted separately. In this class, [[gasoline|petrol]]-driven engines are generally between 2 000 cc and 4 000 cc in displacement, and [[diesel fuel|diesel]] engines are generally between 2 000 cc and 3 200 cc. The vehicles are usually [[Gross vehicle weight rating|rated to carry loads]] of between 900 and 1 100 Kilograms.

By contrast, the shells of compact pickups such as the Bantam (known as ''half-tonners'') are almost always of [[Vehicle_frame#Unibody|monocoque (unibody)]] configuration. This yields greater commonality of parts with the passenger cars they are based on, as well as easier assembly on a parallel [[production line]]. They generally have around 35% less [[tare weight|tare mass]] than a typical 'one-tonner', their engines generally displace between 1 300 cc and 1 800 cc, and they are usually rated to carry loads of no more than 800 Kilograms.

=== First generation (1983-1990) ===

[[File:Bantam Escort Mk.1A.jpg|thumb|First-generation Ford Bantam with aftermarket alloy wheels]]

The first-generation Bantam was introduced in South Africa in 1983. It was intended to compete for market share that was, at the time, almost entirely [[monopoly|monopolised]] by [[Nissan|Nissan's]] B140 1400 Bakkie (which had been derived from the [[Nissan_Sunny#B110_(1970–1973)|B110 sedan]]), with the remainder accounted for by the recently released [[Volkswagen_Caddy#First_generation_(Typ_14;_1979–1996)|Volswagen Caddy]]. The Bantam (named after a [[Bantam_(poultry)|breed of fowl known for its small size and courageous, defiant nature)]] was based on the [[Ford Escort (Europe)#Third generation (1980–1986)|Mark III Ford Escort]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ByxPAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22Ford+Bantam%22+South+Africa&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Ford+Bantam%22++ ''Financial Mail''], Volume 90, Part 2, page 164&lt;/ref&gt; It featured a South African-developed load box, tailgate, rear lights, rear quarter windows and [[leaf spring|leaf-sprung]], [[beam axle|dead-axle]] rear suspension.

Like the Escort on which it was based, the Bantam was initially available with 1 296 cc and 1 598 cc [[carburettor]]-fed versions of Ford's [[Ford CVH engine|compound valve-angle hemi (CVH)]] engine. Faced with criticism from the South African market regarding noise, vibration, harshness and unreasonably high fuel consumption, Ford South Africa opted to discontinue CVH engine installation. Subsequently, South African Escorts and Bantams were fitted with crossflow variants of the technically [[obsolescence|obsolete]] [[Ford_Kent_engine|Kent engine]].

The Bantam was initially produced at the Ford plant in Struandale, [[Port Elizabeth]]. Upon Ford's [[apartheid]]-era divestment from South Africa, Bantam production was relocated to the [[Samcor]] plant in Silverton, [[Pretoria]]. The exterior tailgate panels on pre-divestment Bantams and Rustlers have 'Ford' or 'Mazda' script pressed into them, while post-divestment vehicles have 'MMI' script.

[[File:Bantam Escort Mk.1B.jpg|thumb|First-generation Ford Bantam (facelift)]]

Within the South African market, the Bantam [[Badge-engineering|was also available]] as the Mazda Rustler.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zY21AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22Ford+Bantam%22+Mazda+South+Africa&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Ford+Bantam%22+ ''International Motor Business''], Issues 137-140, African Business Publications, 1989, page 114&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second generation (1990-2001) ===

[[File:Ford_Bantam_(second_generation).jpg|thumb|Ford Bantam (second generation)]]

In 1990, the Escort-derived Bantam was replaced with a [[Mazda Familia#Fifth generation (BF; 1985–1989)|Mazda 323]]-derived model. To save on research and development costs, the new Bantam used a slightly modified version of the existing load box from the previous Bantam. Re-styling and finishing of the new vehicle were undertaken by Samcor's in-house design studio. The new Bantam was the first South African-produced vehicle to be subjected to computer-modelled finite-element stress analysis, and also benefitted from accelerated durability testing conducted by the [[University of Pretoria]]. As before, the vehicle was also available as a Mazda Rustler.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2wY1AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Ford+Bantam%22+South+Africa&amp;dq=%22Ford+Bantam%22+South+Africa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJvtam847LAhVDVxQKHfGnDagQ6AEISzAH ''African Business''], African Business Publications, 1994, page 114&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Ford Bantam Leisure ZA.jpg|thumb|Ford Bantam (second generation)]]

323-derived Bantams and Rustlers were available in various trim levels, and with a choice of three different petrol engines: a 1 323 cc carburettor-fed Mazda B3 engine producing 50 kW, a 1 597 cc carburettor-fed Mazda B6 engine producing 60 kW, and a 1 597 cc [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] variant of the B6 engine that produced 77 kW.

[[File:Ford_Bantam_(rear_view).jpg|thumb|left|Ford Bantam, second generation (rear view)]]

Luxury-specification 60 kW versions featuring cloth-covered bucket seats, a sports steering wheel and bodywork decals were also available. The Ford variant was badged the ''Explorer'', while the Mazda variant was badged the ''Drifter''.

=== Third generation (2002-2011) ===

The third-generation Bantam was launched in 2002, based on the fifth-generation [[Ford Fiesta]]. As with the Mazda 323-derived Bantam, the Fiesta-derived Bantam retained a modified version of the Bantam Mark I load box and rear suspension. Production continued at the Silverton plant. Though the [[Mazda 121]] (a re-badged Ford Fiesta) was available in South Africa, demand was judged sufficiently low that a Mazda-rebadged Bantam was never produced.

==== Initial version (2002-2006) ====

The third-generation Bantam was initially made available with a choice of 1 297 cc and 1 597 cc Rocam (Roller Finger Camshaft) petrol engines, and a normally-aspirated 1 755 cc [[Ford_Endura-D_engine|Endura-D]] [[diesel engine]]. Being a low-cost derivative of the multi-valve Zetec-SE that was intended for developing markets, the Brazilian-designed [[Ford_Zetec_engine#Zetec_Rocam_(Duratec_8v)|Rocam]] engine is of single overhead-cam configuration with two valves per cylinder.

Rocam-engined Bantams were available in four different trim levels, with bucket seats as standard equipment on all Bantams. Basic (fleet) versions featured austere interiors with [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] seat trim, and no [[air conditioning]], [[power steering]] or audio system. XL versions featured Jacquard cloth upholstery, 14-inch [[alloy wheel|alloy wheels]], four-speaker sound systems, full instrumentation, power steering and air conditioning. In addition to XL-level features, XLT versions featured electric windows, electrically-adjustable mirrors, front fog lights, colour-coded exterior mirrors and front bumper. In addition to XLT-level features, XLE versions featured colour-coded exterior door handles, white-faced race-style instrumentation, driver and passenger [[airbag|airbags]], and [[Seat_belt#Pretensioners_and_webclamps|pyrotechnic seat-belt tensioners]].
Endura-D-engined Bantams were available in basic and XL trim levels.

==== First facelift (2006-2009) ====

[[File:Bantam Fiesta Mk.3B.jpg|thumb|right|Third-generation Ford Bantam 1.6i XLT (first facelift) with aftermarket alloy wheels and [[Light-emitting_diode|LED]] light bar]]

In 2006, the Bantam [[Facelift_(automotive)|underwent minor restyling as part of a mid-life upgrade]]. The instrumentation cluster was simplified, the double-filament headlights were replaced with headlights featuring separate bulbs for dipped and main beams, the rear lights and front fog lights were redesigned, and different alloy wheels were installed on XL, XLT and XLE versions. The diesel engine option was no longer available.

==== Second facelift (2009-2011) ====

[[File:Bantam Fiesta Mk.3C.jpg|thumb|left|Third-generation Ford Bantam 1.6i XLE (second facelift)]]

In 2009, the Bantam received a second mid-life upgrade consisting of all-new bonnet, headlights, front bumper, rear lights, 'liquid chrome' nomenclature, instrument cluster and interior trim. Rocam-engined versions also received [[catalytic convertor|catalytic convertors]]. To counter the challenge posed by more modern half-ton pickups with advanced [[Turbo-diesel|turbodiesel]] engines (such as the Opel Corsa Utility), Ford South Africa also offered the 1 399 cc [[Ford_Duratorq_engine#1.4_"Tiger"|DuraTorq]] engine option.

In 2011, Ford South Africa ended production of the Bantam, focussing its marketing efforts on the larger and more expensive [[Ford Ranger|Ranger]]. In 2013, Ford USA followed suit, discontinuing imports of the Brazilian-made [[Ford_Courier#Fiesta-based_models|Courier]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/motoring/industry-news/end-of-the-road-for-ford-s-bantam-1.1100008 End of the road for Ford's Bantam], ''[[Independent Online]]'', 15 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeslive.co.za/lifestyle/motoring/2011/08/03/end-of-road-for-faithful-bantam End of road for faithful Bantam], ''[[Times Live]]'' 3 August, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; With no equivalent replacement available, Ford's support for the half-ton coupe utility segment effectively ended.

==== Similarity to Ford Courier ====

[[File:Courier wikipedia.jpg|thumb|left|2000–2010 Ford Courier pickup (Brazil)]]

Another coupe pickup was derived from the fifth-generation Fiesta, independently of the Bantam. The resulting vehicle, the [[Ford_Courier#Fiesta-based_models|Ford Courier]], was designed and produced in Brazil, initially for the Brazilian domestic market.
Aft of the vehicle A-pillars, the Bantam and Courier share almost no common parts. Whereas the Bantam uses the shorter front doors of the [[Ford Ikon]] and 5-door Fiesta hatchback in conjunction with rear quarter windows, the Courier uses the longer front doors from the 3-door Fiesta hatchback, with no quarter windows. Production of the Fiesta-based Courier ended in 2013.

== Future Developments ==

Following the discontinuation of the Fiesta-derived Bantam, [[Fiat_Automobiles|Fiat]] South Africa's withdrawal of the Palio-derived [[Fiat_Strada|Strada]] and [[General Motors|General Motors']] disinvestment from the South African market (effectively ending production of the [[Chevrolet_Spark#Third_generation_(M300;_2009–2015)|Spark]]-derived [[Chevrolet_Montana|Chevrolet Utility]]), the [[Renault Logan]]-derived [[Nissan NP200]] is the only remaining half-ton coupe utility on the South African market as of August 2019.

South Africa's deteriorating economy, combined with the relative unaffordability of larger pickups such as the [[Toyota Hilux]] and [[Ford Ranger]] mean that demand for a Bantam replacement has never abated. Since the end of Bantam production, unconfirmed [[rumor|rumours]] have circulated regarding plans by Ford South Africa to replace the Bantam with a direct equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.georgeherald.com/News/Article/Motoring/funky-ford-freestyle-pick-up-a-bantam-successor-that-will-never-happen-201802191000] ''[[George Herald]]'' 19 February, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.georgeherald.com/News/Article/Motoring/possible-ford-bantam-replacement-on-the-cards-for-2022-201807301000] ''[[George Herald]]'' 30 July, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2019, no such vehicle has yet been produced.

Rumours continue to circulate that Ford USA may develop a replacement for the Brazilian Courier, possibly based on the next-generation [[Ford Focus|Focus]] platform. If cleared for production, the new vehicle could be released by 2022.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.automobilemag.com/news/ford-considers-compact-unibody-pickup-truck-u-s/] ''[[Automobile Magazine]]'' 27 July, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ford Model F''' is an [[automobile]] produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. It was a development of the [[Ford Model A (1903)|Model A]] and [[Ford Model C|Model C]], but was larger, more modern, and more luxurious.  Production started in 1905 and ended in 1906 after about 1,000 were made. It was built at the [[Ford Piquette Avenue Plant]].  It was a four-seater [[Phaeton body|phaeton]] with [[running board]]s and a side-entrance [[tonneau]] standard.  It was priced from {{USD|1,000|1906}}&lt;ref name="newspaper"&gt;Ford Motor Company Newspaper Advertisement from 1905. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ford-Model-F-and-Doctors-Car.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; to {{USD|1,200|1905}};&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochure"/&gt; by contrast, the [[Colt Runabout Company|Colt Runabout]] was $1,500,&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, p.63.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Fal-Car|FAL]] was $1,750,&lt;ref name="Clymer, p.104"&gt;Clymer, p.104.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Cole (car company)|Cole 30]] $1,500,&lt;ref name="Clymer, p.104"/&gt; the [[Enger Motor Car Company|Enger 40]] $2,000,&lt;ref name="Clymer, p.104"/&gt; and the [[Lozier]] Light Six Metropolitan $3,250.&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, p.111.&lt;/ref&gt; All had green bodies.&lt;ref name="Kimes 1996"/&gt;

'''Ford Courier''' is a model nameplate that was used by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]; several vehicles have been produced under the Courier name from the early 1950s to the 2010s.   Initially denoting a [[sedan delivery]], the Courier nameplate has been used for compact [[Pickup truck|pickup trucks]], [[Panel van|panel vans]], and [[coupe utility]] pickups.  

Since their production, Ford has replaced Courier models with nameplates currently in production.  The Courier pickup trucks have been replaced by the Ranger truck line worldwide, while the Courier vans have been replaced by the [[Ford Transit Connect|Transit Connect]]; within the Ford Transit range, the Transit Courier name denotes the smallest model, a [[leisure activity vehicle]].

== Sedan delivery (1952–1960) ==
[[File:1952 Ford Courier Delivery (8401366636).jpg|thumb|left|1952 Ford Courier]]
[[File:1956 Courier.jpg|thumb|left|1956 Ford Courier sedan delivery]]
The 1952 to 1960 Ford Couriers were [[sedan delivery]] variants of Ford's US mainstream passenger vehicle range of those model years. Its model code was 78A through to 1958. It had a [[front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout]].

Access to the rear storage area was through a unique door hinged on the side. For 1957 and 1958, the rear access door was a combination of the lift gate and tailgate being connected with two connecting struts. This design meant that the rear-door back glass had to be divided into three sections, two outer curved portions and a center piece. It was identical to the [[Ford Parklane]] and later the [[Ford Del Rio]] wagons without side glass installed.

In 1959, all Couriers took on the windowed body style very similar to the [[Ford Ranch Wagon|Tudor Ranch Wagons]] and the model code was redesignated as 59E. The last year for the passenger car-based Courier was 1960, when it would remain a commercial wagon.

The Courier was continued into the 1961 model year and is cataloged in the 60/64 FORD MPC. 60/61 2DR Commercial Ranch Wagon (Courier) (Body Type Code 59E)

=== First generation (1972–1976) ===
{{Main|Mazda B-Series#Second generation (1965–1977)}}
[[File:1972 Ford Courier, front right.jpg|thumb|1972 Ford Courier]]
[[File:1975 Ford Courier, right rear.jpg|thumb|left|1975 Ford Courier]]
In the early 1970s, the Ford Courier name was applied to the [[Mazda B-Series#Second generation (1965–1977)|Mazda B-Series]], a compact pickup manufactured by Mazda. It had greater fuel economy than the full-sized pickups of the time. The Courier was manufactured by Toyo Kogyo (Mazda) and imported{{where?|date=February 2019}} and sold by Ford Motor Company as a response to the unforeseen popularity of the small [[Toyota Hilux|Toyota]] and [[Datsun Truck|Nissan/Datsun]] Pickups. It occupied the market segment previously held by the Ford Falcon-based [[Ford Ranchero#1960–1965 Falcon Ranchero|Ranchero]] when that platform was upgraded to the larger [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Ford Fairlane]] in 1966.

Like the other minipickups of the time, it featured a sub-2-liter, four-cylinder engine, a four-speed [[manual transmission]], [[rear-wheel drive]], an impressive load capability of 1,400&amp;nbsp;lb (635&amp;nbsp;kg) considering its size, and a fairly small price tag compared to full-sized pickups of the time. To circumvent the 25% "[[chicken tax]]" on light trucks, Couriers (as with [[Chevrolet LUV]]s) were imported in "cab chassis" configurations, which included the entire light truck - less the cargo box or truck bed - and were only subject to a 4% tariff. Subsequently, a truck bed was attached to the chassis and the vehicle could be sold as a light truck.

The body styling was effectively that of the related Mazda B-series; however, its front styling was unique in that the grille was designed to emulate the larger Ford F-series, and large single headlights instead of the B-series' smaller twin units.

When the Courier was introduced, it came standard with a 1.8-liter overhead-cam engine, which produced 74&amp;nbsp;hp (55&amp;nbsp;kW) at 5,070 rpm, and 92&amp;nbsp;lb-ft (125 N·m) at 3,500 rpm. A four-speed manual transmission was standard, and  a three-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] was optional. A five-speed manual option was introduced for the 1976 model year.

The Courier's badging changed a few times in the first generation. In 1972 and 1973, the tailgate read "COURIER" in large raised letters, with a small "FORD" badge on the upper left. The '72 model has a small "COURIER" badge on the front driver's side edge of the hood, and from '73 through '76, the hood badging read "FORD". From the 1974 model year, the tailgate read "FORD" in large letters, with a small "COURIER" badge on the lower right. In 1976, the cab was lengthened by 3&amp;nbsp;in (76&amp;nbsp;mm), and the grille received added trim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first = Zeke | last = Yewdall | url = http://www.darkforestcreature.com/Courier/Information.html |title = Courier Information from Courier Collector | publisher = Darkforestcreature.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second generation (1977–1985) ===
[[File:1979 Ford Courier pickup.jpg|thumb|right|1979 Ford Courier]]
[[File:1985 Ford Courier (21642513989).jpg|thumb|left|1985 Ford Courier]]
Beginning in 1977, Ford gave the Courier a fresh look, moving into the more blocky, angular styling that is distinct of 1980s automotive design. In 1979, the base model engine was increased in size to 2.0 liter (120.1 cid).

The truck was available with front disc brakes, and a [[Ford Pinto engine|Ford-built 2.3-liter engine]] option (which was the same as that of the Ford Pinto &amp; Mustang II and Mercury Bobcat &amp; Capri). The key identifying feature of the Courier from the Mazda B-Series was still the singular headlights, although with park and indicator lights placed in the grille starting in '78 ('77s still had the turn signal lights in the bumper).
In 1979, the base model was increased in size to 2.0 liter (120.1 CID). The optional Ford 2.3-liter (140 cid) engine was produced in Brazil.
The Courier was never available with a diesel engine in the US. However, the 1980 Mazda B2200 was available with the S2, a Perkins-built 4.135 (four-cylinder, 135-cid) 2.2-liter diesel engine, producing 66&amp;nbsp;hp (49&amp;nbsp;kW) at 2,100 rpm. This same diesel engine was available in the 1983 and 1984 Ford Rangers, but it was replaced by the [[Mitsubishi Astron engine#Turbo .28TD04 wastegated turbo.29|Mitsubishi 4D55T]] 2.3-liter turbodiesel (also used in [[Mitsubishi Triton|Mitsubishi's own Mighty Max and the Dodge Ram 50]]) for the 1985 to 1987 Ford Rangers.

The Courier continued to be sold in North America until 1982 model year. For 1983, Ford introduced its own Ford Ranger to fill its compact truck segment in the United States and Canada, effectively replacing the Courier. However, in other markets (such as Australia), this generation of Couriers continued on until the 1985 model year, when the next generation was introduced. Australian models received a facelift around 1982/1983.

Between 1979 and 1982, a number of electric Ford Couriers were produced – Jet Industries purchased "vehicle gliders" (Ford Courier bodies minus their engines), and put in a series DC motor and lead-acid batteries, to produce the Jet Industries ElectraVan 750. These were sold mainly for use as service trucks, generally to local government departments. They had a top speed of about 70&amp;nbsp;mph (113&amp;nbsp;km/h), and would go 50 to 60 miles (97&amp;nbsp;km) on a full charge. A number of these vehicles still exist, usually with upgraded motor control systems and higher-voltage battery packs.&lt;!-- [8] --&gt;

=== Third generation (1985–1998) ===

Coinciding with the 1985 redesign of the Mazda of the Proceed/B-Series, the Courier was given a larger, more modern cab.  New options included five-speed manual transmissions, four-wheel drive, and a V6 engine.  For the first time, extended and four-door cabs were available.

In a similar fashion to the North American Ford Ranger becoming the donor platform for the Ford Explorer SUV, a sport utility would be based upon this version of the Courier.  Branded the Ford Raider (and equivalent Mazda Proceed Marvie), it was sold from 1991 to 1997.

In 1998, a new generation of the Courier pickups was released following a redesign of the Mazda B-Series.  Unlike the previous generation, the Courier nameplate was sold primarily in Australia and New Zealand.  In other markets, the Courier nameplate was phased out in favor of Ranger for all compact trucks, both Mazda-produced and Ford-produced.

In 2003, Ford released the [[Ford Everest]] midsized SUV based on the Courier/Ranger for the Asia and Central American markets.

=== Europe (1991–2002) ===

[[File:Ford Courier (40439344661).jpg|thumb|right|1993 Ford Courier van (Europe)]]
A Ford Courier van based on the [[Ford Fiesta]] was launched in [[Europe]] in mid-1991 with a [[front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout]] and petrol or Diesel power. It was initially based on the Mark III Fiesta platform, but with a longer wheelbase and Renault-derived torsion bar rear suspension.

The Courier van  was also produced in the 1995 Mark IV version and did receive that Fiesta's 1999 facelift (with the option of a turbo-Diesel engine) meaning that it was produced with three different front ends, all with similar rear ends using the 1986-2000 Transit rear lights. There was also a glazed version produced with a rear seat fitted; this model was sold as the Courier Combi.

Production of the Courier van ended in August 2002, and both it and the Escort van were replaced in September 2002 by the [[Ford Transit Connect]], based on the Focus. However, after 11 years of no direct replacement, a van based on the Fiesta bearing the [[Ford Transit Courier|Transit Courier/Tourneo Courier]] name was revealed in Yeniköy, Turkey, in 2013 under Ford Otosan (Koc-Ford Motor Company Joint Venture).

=== Brazil (1998–2013) ===
[[File:Courier wikipedia.jpg|thumb|left|2000–2010 Ford Courier pickup (Brazil)]]
The name was also applied to a small [[coupe utility]] of similar layout produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in [[Brazil]] and exported to countries such as [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ford.com.mx/vehicles/homevehicle.asp?idModel=COU Ford Courier page at www.ford.com.mx] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307113151/http://www.ford.com.mx/vehicles/homevehicle.asp?idModel=COU |date=March 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the 1998 model of the [[Ford Fiesta]]. While its front treatment is the same as the South African-built Fiesta-based [[Ford Bantam]] "[[bakkie]]" coupe utility, it has a completely different load box. The South African version had the short doors of the five-door hatchback and small quarter lights in the style of larger [[extended cab]] pickups, and the Brazilian version had the three-door's longer doors and no quarter windows.

Its load capacity is {{convert|700|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. Until 1999, the Courier used the [[Endura-D|Endura]] 1.3-liter engine and the [[Zetec-SE]] 1.4-l 16v engine. The Mk IV 1.4 16v [[Zetec-SE]] has a top speed of {{convert|170|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} and can accelerate from {{convert|0|-|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in 12 seconds. Since 2000, both engines were replaced by the [[Zetec Rocam]] 1.6-liter. The Mk V 1.6 model has top speed of {{convert|180|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} and can accelerate from 0–100&amp;nbsp;km/h in 10 seconds.

Its dimensions are {{convert|2830|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wheelbase, {{convert|4457|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} length, {{convert|1793|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} width and {{convert|1477|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} height.

From 2013, the plant in São Bernardo do Campo in Brazil has suspended the manufacturing model for ordinary consumers and business, but [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] has not confirmed that the model was taken from line definitely. Despite Ford not confirming that the Courier was taken from line definitely, the Courier had seemed to end production and was possibly replaced by the [[Ford Ranger (T6)]]. In Mexico, it stopped being sold after 2010.

The '''Ford Model N''' is an [[automobile]] produced by [[Ford Motor Company]]; it was introduced in 1906 as a successor to the Models [[Ford Model A (1903)|A]] and [[Ford Model C|C]] as the company's inexpensive, entry-level line. It was built at the [[Ford Piquette Avenue Plant]].  

The Model N diverged from its predecessors in that it was a front-engine car with a four-cylinder engine. The 15 [[Horsepower|hp]] straight-four drove the rear wheels via a long shaft. This was also the first American car to use [[Vanadium#Alloys|vanadium steel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lacey|first1=Robert|title=Ford: The Men and the Machine|url=https://archive.org/details/fordmenmachin00lace|url-access=registration|date=1986|isbn=0-316-51166-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car had a wheelbase of {{convert|84|in|mm|abbr=on}}.

A successful model, 7000 cars were made before production ended in 1908. At {{USD|500}}, the car was viewed as highly affordable at the time; by contrast, the high-volume [[Oldsmobile]] [[Oldsmobile Curved Dash|Runabout]] went for $650,&lt;ref name="Clymer 1950, p. 32"&gt;Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877-1925''. New York: Bonanza Books, 1950., p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western Tool Works (automobile company)|Western]]'s Gale Model A was $500,&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877-1925''. New York: Bonanza Books, 1950.

New York: Bonanza Books, 1950., p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Success Automobile Manufacturing Company|Success]] for $250.&lt;ref name="Clymer 1950, p. 32"/&gt; Maroon was the only factory color for the Model N.&lt;ref name=brochure/&gt;

==Model R==
The '''Model R''' was a higher [[trim level]] of the Model N with a larger body, wheels covered by full [[Fender (vehicle)|fenders]], running boards,&lt;ref name=Kimes/&gt; and oil lamps. Model R was $650, $150 above the $500 base Model N. The Model R was a 1907 model year offering, and 2500 were sold.&lt;ref name=Kimes/&gt; Color was primarily dark green, with leather seats, brass fixtures, and a fuel tank holding {{convert|8|usgal|impgal l|abbr=on}}.  Other differences from the Model N included 30-inch tires, a rounded trunk, and a McCord mechanical oiler, rather than the Model N-style exhaust pressure oiler.&lt;!-- dead links .&lt;ref&gt;[http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---June/1907-Ford-Model-R-Brochure/1907-Ford-Model-R-19]; [http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---June/1907-Ford-Model-R-Brochure/1907-Ford-Model-R-03]&lt;/ref&gt;
 --&gt;

==Model S==
Two Model S styles were produced, a runabout and a roadster.  The S runabout first appeared in late 1907 model year, and was similar to the Model R, selling for $50 less than the R, at $700.  Both models were sold for a short time before the R was discontinued for model/fiscal year 1908.  The S roadster, like the R, had fenders attached to running boards, and a mechanical oiler.  Differences from the R included Model N-style 28-inch tires and the pointed trunk. 

The '''Model S''' Roadster was based on the same chassis as models N, R, and S runabout before it.  Making its appearance during Ford fiscal/model year 1908, the S Roadster had an enclosed cowl, full fenders and fender aprons, and a third "rumble" seat.  Like R and S runabouts, the SR used a McCord pressure oiler.  Like Model R, the S Roadster was equipped with 30-inch tires.  The S Roadster and Model K Roadster were the last models produced during the summer of 1908 as Ford retooled and prepared for the advent of the [[Ford Model T|Model T]]. &lt;ref&gt;Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877-1925''. New York: Bonanza Books, 1950., p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; The S Roadster sold for $750. Extras such as a convertible top, gas lamps, and umbrella holders were available. 3750 S Roadsters were sold between 1908 and 1909.

The '''Ford LTD II''' is an automobile that was marketed and produced by [[Ford Motor Company]] between 1977 and 1979 in the United States and Canada.  Deriving its name from the full-size [[Ford LTD (Americas)|Ford LTD]] model line, the [[Mid-size car|intermediate]] LTD II consolidated the [[Ford Torino]] and Gran Torino model lines, with the [[Ford Elite]] replaced by the [[Ford Thunderbird (seventh generation)|Ford Thunderbird]].  Offered in a two-door sedan, four-door sedan, and station wagon, the LTD II also  served as a basis for the final generation of the [[Ford Ranchero]] [[Coupé utility|coupe utility]].      

During its production, the [[Lincoln Mercury|Lincoln-Mercury]] Division sold the LTD II under the [[Mercury Cougar]] badge, replacing the [[Mercury Montego]].       

The design of the Ford LTD II is notable as one of the largest vehicles ever produced as an intermediate, released just as the entire American auto industry began a period of [[Downsize (automobile)|downsizing]].  In terms of exterior footprint compared to full-size sedans, the LTD II is longer in length and wheelbase and wider than the later [[Ford LTD Crown Victoria]], [[Ford Crown Victoria]], [[Ford Five Hundred]], and the [[Ford Taurus]] ([[Ford Taurus (fifth generation)|fifth]], [[Ford Taurus (sixth generation)|sixth]], and seventh-generation versions)

== Background ==
[[File:Ford Gran Torino Brougham 1974 (4921790873).jpg|left|thumb|1974 Ford Gran Torino Brougham (LTD II predecessor) 
]]
For the 1977 model year, Ford Motor Company made substantial revisions to its intermediate segment product lines involving both the Ford and Mercury brands.  As part of the model changes, several product lines were given mid-cycle updates.  To further revive interest, other model lines were consolidated to reduce internal competition and overlap.        

Central to the model revision was the discontinuation of the [[Ford Torino]], Gran Torino, and [[Ford Elite]].  While the Torino chassis and body was given an extensive update to extend its lifespan, the Torino/Gran Torino became the Ford LTD II ("II" to distinguish the intermediate model line from the full-size LTD).  Alongside a massive exterior update, the Ford Elite became the Ford Thunderbird, allowing Ford to better compete against the [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] (and its various General Motors counterparts) and the [[Chrysler Cordoba]], reducing potential overlap between the Thunderbird and the [[Lincoln Continental Mark V|Continental Mark V]].     

As Ford discontinued the Torino, Mercury replaced the [[Mercury Montego|Montego]], as it expanded the Mercury Cougar nameplate to its entire intermediate line (with the previous Cougar becoming the highest-trim Cougar XR7 counterpart of the Thunderbird).

== Design overview ==
=== Chassis ===
The LTD II utilizes the [[Body on frame|body on frame construction]] shared with the 1972-1976 Torino/Montego.  As with the LTD, the LTD II utilized a full perimeter frame; to isolate road shock from the body, the frame was fitted with fourteen rubber body mounts and five cross members.  On the rear suspension, the four-link solid rear axle utilized coil springs.

The LTD II derived much of its powertrain line from the 1974 Torino, with one exception: in the interest of fuel economy, the 460 V8 was dropped from all Ford and Mercury intermediates, with the 302 V8 making its return as the standard engine (outside of California).  As options, Ford offered the 351M V8 and the 351 Windsor V8, with a 400 cubic-inch V8 serving as the largest engine offering.  For 1979, the 400 V8 was discontinued.  
=== Body ===
Although the transition from the Torino to the LTD II is theoretically a mid-cycle update, Ford stylists would make several styling changes to introduce the new model line, moving away from the [[Coke bottle styling|Coke-bottle styling]] that dominated the exterior of its Torino/Montego predecessor.  

Though limited funds precluded a complete redesign of the exterior, the roofline and all sheetmetal from the doors rearward were given an extensive update.  Adopting much of the design language of the redesigned Thunderbird, the roofline was given larger, straight-edged windows (including optional opera windows) and a level beltline while the body retained relatively large fender flares.    

The LTD II carried over the use of the Elite's hood and front fenders with a restyled front end panel adapting vertically stacked rectangular headlamps and a new grille. The rear end adopted styling elements of the full-size Ford LTD. Due to the cost of redesigning the rear quarter side panels, the LTD II station wagon was produced with a Mercury Montego wagon bodyshell; the station wagon was discontinued after 1977.             

The LTD II was produced in three trim levels, base-trim "S", standard-trim, and the luxury-minded LTD II Brougham.  Bucket seats with console and floor shifter were available on base- and Brougham-level coupes.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Discontinuation ==
Although initially popular, sales of the LTD II declined rapidly due to several factors.  As the LTD II made its 1977 debut, Chevrolet introduced downsized versions of the Chevrolet Impala and Caprice; although the LTD II was marketed as a competitor against the Chevrolet Malibu, the intermediate LTD II presented with a larger exterior footprint than the Impala (though with a smaller interior).  The downsizing of the General Motors full-size line was met with success, with the Impala/Caprice becoming the best-selling 1977 model line. Also, internal competition from its nearly identical platform mate the newly downsized Thunderbird (with its much lower base price) deflected sales from the LTD II two-door models.          

For 1978, the LTD II met a much larger degree of competition, as Ford introduced the [[Ford Fairmont]] as the replacement for the long-running Ford Maverick.  Though officially considered a compact (nearly two feet shorter and seven inches narrower than the LTD II), the interior dimensions of the Fairmont entered close enough into the midsize segment as downsizing extended beyond full-size vehicles.  Along with its slow sales, the potential for model overlap with the Fairmont led to the discontinuation of the LTD II station wagon.         

For 1979, the LTD II effectively became obsolete as Ford introduced the downsized Ford LTD.  In comparison to the LTD II, the downsized LTD was 11 inches shorter in length and 4 inches shorter in wheelbase, an inch narrower, and 500 pounds lighter; despite the smaller exterior footprint, the LTD rivaled its full-size predecessor in interior space.           

As the Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar were downsized to the Ford Fox platform for 1980, the Ford Torino chassis was discontinued after 1979.  After 1979, the Ford Ranchero was indirectly replaced by the Ford Ranger, as the coupe utility pickup segment was phased out in favor of compact pickup trucks in the United States.  After its 1979 discontinuation, the Ford LTD II never saw a direct successor in the Ford product line.  In 1983, the Ford LTD model name returned to the mid-size segment, with Ford renaming the Granada as part of a mid-cycle redesign.  After 1986, this vehicle was replaced by the Ford Taurus, largely marking the end of Ford LTD nameplate in North America.

== Venezuela ==
Ford manufactured the LTD II in Venezuela badged as the Fairlane and Fairlane 500.  All three body styles were available.

[[File:Ecosport.jpg|Rear view (1st generation)|thumb|left]]
The first generation EcoSport was designed by Ford Brazil Development Center (program code BV226 - AMAZON PROJECT) and was based on the Cologne-built European [[Ford Fiesta|Fiesta]] and European [[Ford Fusion (Europe)|Ford Fusion]] (not to be confused with the North American Fusion midsize sedan). Because of this, the project used the [[Ford B3 platform]].

The EcoSport became one of Ford's best-seller models in Brazil (consistently appearing on the twenty best selling vehicles),  Argentina, Venezuela, and Mexico. Its main competitors were the [[Fiat Palio|Fiat Palio Weekend Adventure]] and [[Volkswagen CrossFox]]. The EcoSport sold well, and in 2011, sales reached 700,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Ecosport Reaches Production Milestone of 700,000 Units in Camaçari|url=http://corporate.ford.com/news-center/press-releases-detail/pr-700000-ecosports-produced-in-brazil-20111215|work=Ford press release|accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear left}}

===Versions and engines===
The EcoSport was available with five [[inline-four engine]]s:
* [[Ford Zetec engine#Zetec-Rocam|Zetec-Rocam]] 1.0&amp;nbsp;L gasoline 8v [[supercharged]], {{cvt|95|PS|kW|order=flip}} (discontinued in 2006)
* Zetec-Rocam 1.6 8v [[flexible-fuel vehicle|gasoline/ethanol]], {{cvt|111|PS|kW|order=flip}}
* [[Ford Duratec engine|Duratec]] 2.0&amp;nbsp;L gasoline 16v {{cvt|145|PS|kW|order=flip}}
* [[Ford Duratorq engine|Duratorq]] 1.4&amp;nbsp;L TDCi Diesel, {{cvt|68|PS|kW|order=flip}} (export only)

All models have [[front-wheel drive]] with [[manual transmission]] as standard. The 2.0&amp;nbsp;L model can also receive a four speed [[automatic transmission]] (FWD only) or [[four-wheel drive]] (manual six speed only). In the latter case, an electronically controlled system automatically engages the rear axle when front wheel spin is detected, and also lets the driver manually engage the rear axle from the [[dashboard]].
Ford India introduces EcoSport with BS6 Engine in India. The new EcoSport’s BS6 1.5 liter diesel engine with fuel emission standards gives 100 PS power and comes with a 5-speed manual transmission.&lt;ref&gt;http://reviewdekha.com/ford-ecosport-review/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restyling===
In the end of 2007, a mid-cycle restyling was introduced, which renewed completely the front to bring it closer to then current Ford pickups, as well as the contemporary Brazilian restyling of the [[Ford Fiesta#South America|Ford Fiesta]], also updated the rear lights, both bumpers, and in the interior showed a new dashboard using better quality materials.

===Mexico===
The Ford EcoSport arrived in the end of 2003 to Mexico as a model for 2004. The reception by the public was impressive and continued until 2006. For the model year of 2007, sales of the small SUV began slipping and it stopped being a hot seller. Compared to 15,000 units sold in 2004, only 10,000 units of the model year of 2007 were sold. This trend continued to worsen for the refreshed model year of 2008 due in part to a price increase.

Only 6,345 units of the model year 2008 were sold, and the model year 2009 sales through July 2009 were a mere 2,135 units. Due to decreasing sales, and heightened competition from the [[Ford Escape]], Ford announced that a shortened 2010 model year would be the last sold in Mexico. However, a year later, Ford had announced the new EcoSport to launch in 2012 bringing back the EcoSport to Mexico after a two year absence.

The second generation of the EcoSport was developed under Ford's global product development process in Ford Brazil Development Center . It was based on the 2011 [[Ford B3 platform|Ford Fiesta B2E platform]] and it was launched globally. The second generation EcoSport was first showcased as a concept at the 2012 New Delhi Auto Expo, in India on 4 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cardekho.com/india-car-news/ford-ecosport-unveiled-at-new-delhi-auto-expo-6614.htm Ford Ecosport unveiled at New Delhi Auto Expo] CarDekho 15 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The car was launched in Brazil on 14 July 2012 at a starting price of 53,490 [[Brazilian real]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cardekho.com/india-car-news/ford-ecosport-set-to-launch-in-brazil-on-july-14th-8207.htm Ford Ecosport launch in Brazil] CarDekho 15 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford showed the production variant of the Ford EcoSport in China, planning to begin sales in March 2013. In addition to China, the SUV is also made at Ford India's [[Chennai]] plant, for domestic sale and export initially to the European, and by 2018, the North American, markets. Ford's [[Rayong]] plant in Thailand makes the EcoSport for Southeast Asian markets.&lt;ref name="TopGearPH"/&gt; The Ecosport competes with the [[Renault Duster]] and [[Nissan Terrano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ford Ecosport |url=http://overdrive.in/car-variants/ford-ecosport-2013/|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2015, Ford's Indian plant had already sold 200,000 EcoSports; 112,000 of which were sold in India while the rest were exported to South Africa, Taiwan, Japan, Australia, and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorscribes.com/Articles/200000-ford-ecosports-in-two-years-impressive-indeed|title=200,000 Ford EcoSports in two years – impressive indeed! |author=Muntaser Mirkar |date=5 August 2015 |work=Motorscribes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, Ford announced plans to supply the Ford India Ecosport to the market in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.ria.ru/news/201611261047858315-ford-import-cars-from-india/&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries The EcoSport has a {{cvt|1.0|l}} three cylinder turbocharged [[Ford EcoBoost engine|EcoBoost]] petrol engine which has a power output of {{cvt|120|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{cvt|170|Nm|lb.ft|0|abbr=on}} of torque.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The engine has Twin Independent Variable Camshaft Timing (Ti-VCT) which contributes to the turbocharged engine's peak torque starting at 1,300&amp;nbsp;rpm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=All-New, Fuel-Efficient 1.0-litre Ford EcoBoost Engine for India |url=http://corporate.ford.com/news-center/press-releases-detail/pr-allnew-fuelefficient-10litre-ford-35790|work=Ford press release |accessdate=7 January 2012 |date=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EcoSport can tow up to {{cvt|700|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hartwell.co.uk/news/how-much-can-the-new-ford-ecosport-tow/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=12 January 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150117143828/http://www.hartwell.co.uk/news/how-much-can-the-new-ford-ecosport-tow/ |archivedate=17 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are the specification differences of wipers:

2012-16 LHD version:Brazilian-built non-standard flat wipers&lt;br&gt;
2016–present LHD version:Standard flat wipers&lt;br&gt;
2012-17 South American LHD version:Brazilian-built non-standard flat wipers&lt;br&gt;

2018–present South American LHD version:Hybrid wipers with conventional wiper arms&lt;br&gt;
2018–present North American LHD version (Indian-built):Standard flat wipers (butterfly setup)

====Powertrains====
Engines available include the 1.0 litre EcoBoost developed at Ford's Dunton Technical Center in the UK. It is a turbocharged, cast aluminium block three cylinder made in a {{cvt|74|kW}} and {{cvt|88|to|92|kW}} version, with the latter delivering a peak torque of {{cvt|170|Nm}} from 1,300–4,500&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{cvt|200|Nm}} on overboost. The use of aluminium for the engine block instead of cast-iron improved engine warm-up time by 50 per cent.

The three cylinder engine design causes inherent vibrations, which are countered by a deliberately unbalanced [[flywheel]], which has less friction than balance shafts.

The [[exhaust manifold]] is cast into the [[cylinder head]], reducing engine warm up time. The engine block's height and width dimensions are comparable to an A4 size sheet of paper. This EcoSport version is available in China, Europe, India, the US, but not Brazil. The Brazilian EcoSport has a {{cvt|1.6|L}} petrol engine, which produces {{cvt|113|bhp}} and {{cvt|115|lb.ft}} torque.

The Russian EcoSport comes with two different engines: a 1.6L, which produces 122&amp;nbsp;bhp (90&amp;nbsp;kW) and 148 Nm, and a 2.0L, which produces 140&amp;nbsp;bhp (90&amp;nbsp;kW) and 186 Nm. The 2.0L version of EcoSport comes as AWD with manual transmission, while the 1.6 litre is 2WD only but available with six speed manual or [[Ford PowerShift transmission|PowerShift automotive transmissions]].

Along with the 1.0 L EcoBoost engine, the Chinese and the Indian market also get a 1.5 L Ti-VCT petrol engine, which produces 108&amp;nbsp;bhp (109.5 PS, 80.5&amp;nbsp;kW) and 140 Nm (103&amp;nbsp;lb.ft). The EcoSport also has a 1.5L TDCi BS6 diesel engine that outputs 98.6 &amp;nbsp;bhp (73.8&amp;nbsp;kW, 100 PS) power at 3750 rpm and 215 Nm (158.57&amp;nbsp;lb.ft) of torque at 1750-2500 rpm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.india.ford.com/content/dam/Ford/website-assets/ap/in/nameplate/ecosport/brochure/Brochure-Ford-Ecosport-2020.pdf] Ford India 12 March 2020&lt;/ref&gt;

====Safety====
The Ford EcoSport has [[Ford Sync|Ford SYNC]] driver connect system, a command system codeveloped with [[Microsoft]]. It also has [[airbags]], [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes (ABS)]], [[Electronic Stability Program|electronic stability program (ESP)]], electric power assisted steering (EPAS), and Hill Launch Assist, Traction control System (TCS) and rear parking sensors.

====Marketing====
=====India=====
The Indian market was among the first few to receive EcoSport. The car is being manufactured at [[Ford India Private Limited|Ford India]]'s Chennai plant, available in Six trims (Ambiente, Trend, Titanium, Titanium+, Sports &amp; Thunder edition) with the choice of two engine options, 1.5L Ti-VCT(dragon series) Petrol and 1.5L TDCi Diesel. The engines are available with five speed manual and only Petrol engine available with six speed torque converter transmission. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.india.ford.com/content/dam/Ford/website-assets/ap/in/nameplate/ecosport/brochure/Brochure-Ford-Ecosport-2020.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The 1.0 L EcoBoost Petrol engine has been dropped after the vehicle has been upgraded to meet upcoming BS6 emission compliance norms wef 01.04.2020.

=====Japan=====
At its introduction internationally, it is available in Japan, as the smallest companion to the [[Ford Kuga]] and the [[Ford Explorer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ford.co.jp/ Ford of Japan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115093553/http://www.ford.co.jp/ |date=15 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All engines, except the diesel are offered in Japan, with a five speed manual or six speed dual clutch transmission, and optional all wheel drive.

The 1.0 L and 1.5 L engines provide the opportunity for Japanese customers to save on the annual Japanese [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] obligation. The Japanese version has the width dimension slightly reduced to {{cvt|1696|mm}} so as to comply with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]] to encourage sales.

=====Europe=====
Ford launched the EcoSport in Europe during 2014, with a limited first batch of 500 units arriving in the first quarter of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorbeam.com/cars/ford-ecosport/ford-ecosport-launch-delayed-in-europe-to-2014/|title=Ford EcoSport Launch Delayed In Europe To 2014|work=MotorBeam|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202125238/http://www.motorbeam.com/cars/ford-ecosport/ford-ecosport-launch-delayed-in-europe-to-2014/|archivedate=2 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement was made in September 2013, at the [[Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin|IFA]] exhibition in [[Berlin]], and the first limited edition versions could be ordered on a dedicated website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carscoops.com/2013/09/ford-launches-ecosport-in-europe-with.html|title=Ford Launches Ecosport in Europe with Limited Edition Model Available to Order via Facebook|author=Carscoop Carscoop|work=Carscoops}}&lt;/ref&gt; After disappointing sales figures in Europe in 2014, during which the Ecosport only sold 11,000 units against over 100,000 for each of its main competitors, the car was revised in 2015, to make it more suitable to European tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europe.autonews.com/article/20150120/ANE/150129999/ford-revises-ecosport-to-counter-slow-sales|title=Ford revises EcoSport to counter slow sales|author=Nick Gibbs|work=Automotive News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2016, it was announced that the Ford EcoSport will be built in Romania, at [[Craiova]] plant starting from the autumn of 2017, moving production for the European market from the current plant in Chennai, India. This happens on the background of the growing market for the SUV segment in Europe, and will bring an investment of €200 million to the factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford to Build EcoSport Small SUV at its Craiova Assembly Plant in Romania Starting Next Year|url=https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2016/03/22/ford-to-build-ecosport-small-suv-at-its-craiova-assembly-plant-i.html|publisher=Ford Media Center|date=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EcoSport's 2017 mid-cycle updates were announced at 2016 [[LA Auto Show]], including a revised front end design, and a slightly redesigned rear end. The dashboard has an optional 8-inch floating touchscreen infotainment system that supports both [[Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://auto.ndtv.com/news/ford-ecosport-facelift-unveiled-at-la-auto-show-india-launch-next-year-1624189 2017 Ford EcoSport Facelift Unveiled At LA Auto Show; India Launch Next Year]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sales of the EcoSport in the US market began in 2018. Early models include the [[Ford EcoBoost engine#1.0 L EcoBoost I4|1.0 Ecoboost]] three cylinder turbo gasoline engine for FWD models and the 2.0 four cylinder petrol naturally aspirated engine for 4WD models. Both engines have a six speed automatic transmission. The Australian, Canadian and US-market EcoSports, made in India, have the rear mounted spare tire as optional on the base model.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2016/11/15/fords-new-ecosport-suv-imported-india/93859452/ "Ford's new EcoSport SUV will be imported from India"] from USA Today (15 November 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ford Country Squire''' (later the '''Ford LTD Country Squire''') is a series of [[station wagon]]s that was assembled by American automaker [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. The premium station wagon of the Ford division, the Country Squire was distinguished by its external woodgrain trim. From the 1950 to 1991 model years, eight generations of the Country Squire were produced. Following the discontinuation of [[Edsel]], Mercury marketed the [[Mercury Colony Park]] as a divisional counterpart of the Country Squire, sharing bodywork and trim.

As part of the [[full-size Ford]] model range, the Country Squire was the station wagon counterpart of several model lines. For its first two generations, the Country Squire was based upon the [[Ford Custom Deluxe]] (and the [[Ford Crestline]] that replaced it). For its next three generations, the Country Squire was a distinct model range; initially sharing its trim with the [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Ford Fairlane]], the Country Squire later adopted trim of the [[Ford Galaxie]]. For its final two generations, the Country Squire became a counterpart of [[Ford LTD (Americas)|Ford LTD]] (the [[Ford LTD Crown Victoria]] after its downsizing).

The Country Squire was discontinued as part of the development of the 1992 [[Ford Crown Victoria]]. Following a decline in full-size station wagon sales, the Crown Victoria was introduced exclusively as a four-door sedan, leaving the Country Squire with no direct replacement. As of 2019 production, Ford does not sell a sedan-based station wagon in North America. The 41-year production run of the Country Squire is the third-longest of a Ford car nameplate in North America, surpassed only by the [[Ford Thunderbird]] (46 years) and [[Ford Mustang]] (56 years, currently in production).

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Woodgrain trim ==
Although all Ford Country Squires feature wood-grain body trim, only the first-generation 1950-1951 versions are true "[[Woodie (car body style)|Woodies"]]. The genuine wood body panels were manufactured at the [[Ford Iron Mountain Plant]] in the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Michigan Upper Peninsula]] from lumber owned by Ford Motor Company. For 1952, all-steel bodies replaced wooden body structures to reduce production costs. Subsequently, exterior body trim consisted of simulated woodgrain (with varying degrees of coverage on the body).

During the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, Ford would use the Squire nameplate on intermediate, mid-size, compact, and subcompact vehicles, denoting station wagons with woodgrain exterior trim. Alongside full-size Fords, the Squire name was used for the [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Falcon]], [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Fairlane]], [[Ford Torino|Torino]], [[Ford Pinto|Pinto]], [[Ford Granada (North America)|Granada]], [[Ford Torino|Gran Torino]], [[Ford LTD II|LTD II]], [[Ford Fairmont|Fairmont]], [[Ford Escort (North America)|Escort]], and mid-size [[Ford LTD (Americas)|LTD]] (the last model range to use the name). The Squire name was also used on woodgrain-trim versions of the [[Ford Ranchero|Ranchero]]; in 1976, Ford offered a Pinto Squire Runabout hatchback.

For the 1949 model year, Ford introduced its first post-war model line.  While retaining body-on-frame construction, the 1949 Ford chassis abandoned several design elements retained by Ford since the Model T, including a torque tube driveshaft and transverse leaf springs.  In a major change, Ford sought to change the marketing of station wagons, transitioning their use from a commercial vehicle to a premium family vehicle.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1950-1959-ford-country-squire1.htm|title=1950-1959 Ford Country Squire|last=|first=|date=2007-10-09|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Designed by [[Eugene Turenne Gregorie|Eugene Gregorie]] and Ross Cousins, the Ford station wagon marked the first transition away from the full "[[Woodie (car body style)|woodie]]". In place of a complete wooden body aft of the firewall, the 1949 Ford station wagon was designed with a steel roof, rear fenders, and tailgate frame.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Wood construction remained for the side bodywork and upper and lower tailgate (using mahogany plywood trimmed by maple or birch).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sharing its body with Mercury,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the Ford station wagon was offered in Custom trim.  To reduce noise and improve sealing, the station wagon was offered with two doors instead of four;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; however, three seats were used, allowing eight-passenger seating.

For the 1950 model year, Ford renamed its model lines; initially, the station wagon was a Custom Deluxe with the Country Squire name introduced in early 1950.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1950-1959-ford-country-squire2.htm|title=1950-1959 Ford Country Squire|last=|first=|date=2007-10-09|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several revisions were made for 1950 to improve functionality and capability.  The second and third-row seats were redesigned, allowing their removal without tools.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In another change, the Country Squire also received heavier-duty rear-suspension, wider tires, and a larger fuel tank over Ford sedans.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Following its introduction, the Country Squire underwent several revisions distinct from Ford sedans.  For 1950, the spare-tire cover was deleted; in April 1950, the lower tailgate was redesigned, changing from all-wood construction to steel construction (with wood trim).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For 1951, the Country Squire retained the dashboard of the 1950 Ford (with the 1951 steering column).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1950-1959-ford-country-squire3.htm|title=1950-1959 Ford Country Squire|last=|first=|date=2007-10-09|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Assembly ===
As a true "woodie", assembly of the Country Squire was labor-intensive, requiring completion at three assembly plants.  Initial assembly of the steel body was completed at the [[Ford River Rouge Complex|Dearborn Assembly Plant]], with the incomplete body shipped to the Iron Mountain plant for the fitment of wood paneling; upon completion, the bodies were shipped back to various Ford assembly facilities for final assembly (mounting to frames, fitment of interiors).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For 1951, Ford outsourced final assembly of the Country Squire, contracting Ionia Body Company (an assembler of wood-bodied station wagons for General Motors).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Powertrain ===
During its production, the first-generation Country Squire was fitted with two engines, shared with Ford sedans.  The standard engine was a 226 cubic-inch 95&amp;nbsp;hp [[Ford straight-six engine#226|H-series]] inline-6, with a 239 cubic-inch 100&amp;nbsp;hp [[Ford flathead V8 engine|Flathead]] V8.  For 1950, a 3-speed manual was standard, with a 3-speed [[Cruise-O-Matic|Ford-O-Matic]] automatic becoming an option in 1951.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Following a redesign of the Ford model line for the 1952 model year, the second generation of the Country Squire was introduced, marking several major changes to the model line.  While sharing much of its body (though not its wheelbase) with the newly introduced [[Mercury Monterey]], only the Country Squire featured wood paneling as standard.  In a wider revision for 1952, Ford introduced station wagon counterparts for each of its sedan lines; the Country Squire was the equivalent of the [[Ford Crestline|Crestline]] sedan.  Slotted below the Country Squire were the four-door Country Sedan ([[Ford Customline|Customline]]) and the two-door [[Ford Ranch Wagon|Ranch Wagon]] ([[Ford Mainline|Mainline]]).

=== Model overview ===
Designed by [[Gordon Buehrig]], the second-generation Country Squire was developed under a goal to maximize parts commonality between sedan and station wagon model lines.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1950-1959-ford-country-squire4.htm|title=1952 Ford Country Squire|last=|first=|date=2007-10-09|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;   While gaining an inch in wheelbase, the second-generation Country Squire was reduced approximately 10 inches in length over its predecessor.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In contrast to the Country Sedan, two-tone paint was not offered for the Country Squire; while fewer paint choices were available, all were color-keyed to the wood exterior trim.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Matching the wood trim, the interior was offered in a single tan/brown color scheme.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  As with the previous generation, the second-generation Country Squire used a two-piece tailgate.  The spare tire was relocated under the load floor, with the upper half of the tailgate opened by counterbalanced hinges.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Over its production, the second generation saw several minor revisions.  For 1953 (marking the 50th anniversary of Ford), the Country Squire received a commemorative steering wheel center; rear-door armrests became standard.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1950-1959-ford-country-squire5.htm|title=1953 Ford Country Squire|last=|first=|date=2007-10-09|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For 1954, the range of color choices were expanded from six to twelve (remaining single-color exteriors), with red, blue/white, or green/white interiors replacing the previous tan/brown interior.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1950-1959-ford-country-squire6.htm|title=1954 Ford Country Squire|last=|first=|date=2007-10-09|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several power-assisted features became introduced; in 1953, power steering became an option, with power brakes and a power-adjusted front seat introduced for 1954.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; &lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Powertrain ====
For the 1952 and 1953 model years, the Country Squire was offered with a 110&amp;nbsp;hp 239 cubic-inch V8 (inline-sixes were offered only for the Ranch Wagon).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;    For 1954, in line with all Fords, the Flathead V8 was replaced by the overhead-valve [[Ford Y-block engine|Y-block]] V8.  While built with the same displacement as the Flathead V8, the Y-block increased output from 110&amp;nbsp;hp to 130&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  In another change, the inline-six was redesigned, with a 223 cubic-inch version becoming the standard engine, producing 115&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Assembly changes ===
Marketed as premium vehicles, wood-bodied station wagons were labor-intensive to assemble (and maintain&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;).  To reduce assembly and ownership costs, the Country Squire abandoned wood-paneled construction for a full-steel body.  To distinguish itself from the Country Sedan, [[DI-NOC]] (vinyl transfers) was used to simulate the mahogany paneling, accented by birch or maple.  To further simulate the "woodie" look, woodgrain transfers were applied to the window frames and upper liftgate.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  For 1954, the wood trim was replaced by fiberglass, colored with a woodgrain finish.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

For the 1955 model year, the third generation of the Country Squire was introduced.  Functionally an update of the second generation, the body underwent several styling revisions, along with multiple functional upgrades.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1950-1959-ford-country-squire7.htm|title=1955-1956 Ford Country Squire|last=|first=|date=2007-10-09|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Crestline was discontinued, with the Country Squire becoming the counterpart of the all-new [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Fairlane]] sedan line.

For 1955, Ford consolidated its three station wagons into a distinct model line separate from its sedans.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  In a change that would last through 1968, the Country Squire was the flagship Ford station wagon, with the four-door (non-wood) Country Sedan and the two-door Ranch Wagon.  In 1956, the two-door [[Ford Parklane|Parklane]] was introduced; intended to compete with the [[Chevrolet Nomad]], the Parklane combined the body of the Ranch Wagon with the trim of the Fairlane (similar to the Country Squire interior).

=== Model overview ===
Largely carryover from 1954, the Country Squire chassis retained its 115.5 inch wheelbase and chassis underpinnings.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  While the roofline from the B-pillar rearward was essentially identical from the previous generation, a panoramic windshield (with a vertical A-pillar) was introduced.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The wood trim was revised, with the DI-NOC transfers adopting the style of a [[Chris-Craft Boats|wood-bodied motorboat]];&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; the fiberglass trim was extended into the front fenders (the simulated "[[Ponton (car)|ponton fender]]" was removed).  For the first time, power windows were offered as an option.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

For 1956, alongside all Fords, the Country Squire received a new grille, distinguished by rectangular turn signals/parking lights and wider openings.  In an functional change, Ford upgraded to a [[Automotive battery#History|12-volt electrical system]], allowing additional starting power and capability with electrical-power options.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Coinciding with the upgrade, air conditioning was introduced as an option.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The [[Lifeguard (automobile safety)|Lifeguard]] option package was introduced, offering a deep-dish steering wheel, upgraded door latches (to prevent ejection); as an option, seat belts and a padded dashboard were offered.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; &lt;gallery mode="packed" caption="1955 Country Squire at [[National Museum of American History]]"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Powertrain ====
Carried over from the previous generation, the standard engine of the third-generation Country Squire was the 223 cubic-inch "[[Ford straight-six engine#223|Mileage Maker]]" inline-6, increasing output to 120&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  For the first time, the Country Squire was available with multiple V8 engines, with multiple power outputs available.  Shared with the Fairlane, a 272 cubic-inch [[Ford Y-block engine#272|Y-block V8]] produced 162&amp;nbsp;hp (2-barrel carburetor) or 182&amp;nbsp;hp (4-barrel carburetor).  Shared with the Thunderbird, a 292 cubic-inch V8 produced 198&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  For 1956, the 272 was replaced by the 292, increased to 202&amp;nbsp;hp.  A 312 cubic-inch Y-block (shared with the Thunderbird and Mercury) offered up to 225&amp;nbsp;hp, purchased only by special order.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

For 1957, the Ford model line underwent its first complete redesign for the first time since 1952.  In line with other American manufacturers, a central part of the redesign was lower body height, requiring an all-new chassis to accommodate a lower floor.  The only station wagon with standard-equipment wood paneling (of any type) from 1954 to 1956, the Country Squire was joined by the [[Mercury Colony Park]] in 1957 and the [[Edsel Bermuda]] in 1958.

=== Model overview ===
Coinciding with the use of a lower body and interior floor, the fourth generation was wider than its predecessor, increasing from eight passenger-seating to nine for the first time.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1950-1959-ford-country-squire8.htm|title=1957 Ford Country Squire|last=|first=|date=2007-10-09|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the fourth-generation Country Squire, Ford returned to extensive annual model revisions, with only the roofline and doors shared between all three model years.

==== Chassis specifications ====
The [[1957 Ford]] chassis was a split-wheelbase platform; the 118-inch wheelbase was exclusive to the Fairlane, with Ford (and Edsel) station wagons sharing a 116-inch wheelbase with the [[Ford Custom]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  To allow for a lower floor, the frame layout changed from a truck-style [[Vehicle frame#Ladder frame|ladder frame]] to a [[Vehicle frame#Perimeter frame|perimeter frame]].  A configuration used until the 2011 discontinuation of the Ford Crown Victoria, the perimeter frame allowed the floorpan to sit between the frame rails (instead of above them).  To further reduce vehicle height, the rear leaf springs were moved outboard of the frame rails and the wheels were decreased in diameter from 15 to 14 inches.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

For 1958, rear air suspension became an option for the first time; intended to keep the load floor at a constant height, the system saw few buyers.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1950-1959-ford-country-squire9.htm|title=1958 Ford Country Squire|last=|first=|date=2007-10-09|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In line with all Ford sedans, the 1959 Country Squire adopted the 118-inch wheelbase previously exclusive to the Fairlane.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1950-1959-ford-country-squire10.htm|title=1959 Ford Country Squire|last=|first=|date=2007-10-09|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Powertrain =====
For 1957, the Country Squire carried over all three engines from the 1956 model year, with revised power outputs.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  A 144&amp;nbsp;hp 223 cubic-inch Mileage Maker inline-6 was the standard engine.  The 292 cubic-inch V8 returned (with a two-barrel carburetor), producing 212&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  Three versions of the 312 cubic-inch V8 were offered: 245&amp;nbsp;hp (four-barrel), 270&amp;nbsp;hp (dual four-barrel), and 300&amp;nbsp;hp (dual four-barrel, supercharger).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

For 1958, while the inline-6 returned, the Y-block engines were replaced with an all-new set of V8 engines, named the [[Ford FE engine|FE-series]] (Ford/Edsel).  Two displacements were available, a 332 cubic-inch V8 (240&amp;nbsp;hp with a 2-barrel carburetor; 265&amp;nbsp;hp with a 4-barrel carburetor) or 352 cubic inches (300 horsepower, four-barrel carburetor).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  For 1959, the engine line was revised further, with a 200&amp;nbsp;hp 292 V8 becoming the standard V8, the two-barrel 332 detuned to 225&amp;nbsp;hp (the four-barrel version discontinued); the 300-hp 352 V8 remained.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Alongside the 3-speed and 4-speed manual transmissions, Ford offered the 3-speed [[Cruise-O-Matic#Fordomatic|Fordomatic]] automatic.  Coinciding with the 1958 introduction of the FE-series V8s, the 3-speed [[Cruise-O-Matic#MX/FX|Cruise-O-Matic]] automatic was introduced.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  Designed to make better use of all three gears, Cruise-O-Matic started in first gear (Fordomatic started in second, with first gear selected by downshifting into "L").

==== Body   ====
In a major shift, for 1957, Ford station wagons no longer shared a body with a Mercury counterpart; instead, the body was developed for the Edsel line of station wagons, with the Country Squire becoming the counterpart of the Edsel Bermuda (distinguished by its combination of woodgrain sides ''and'' two-tone paint).   While based on the shorter wheelbase of the Ford Custom, the Country Squire still shared trim with the Fairlane.  Along with Ford sedans, the Country Squire adopted several design elements of the [[Ford Thunderbird (first generation)#1957|1957 Ford Thunderbird]], including its wraparound windshield (restyled with a forward-slanted A-pillar), short [[Car tailfin|tailfins]], and large round taillamps.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

To further expand load capacity, the folding mechanism of the middle seat was redesigned, allowing for a completely flat load floor when stowed (the rear seat still had to be removed).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  To improve loading, the top half of the liftgate was widened, extending into the D-pillars.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

For 1958, the front and rear fascias underwent a revision; while largely to accommodate quad headlamps, the taillamp design was revised (replacing two round taillamps with four oval ones) alongside the design of the wood trim.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  In a functional change, the liftgate mechanism was redesigned.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

For 1959, coinciding with the wheelbase extension, the Country Squire grew over five inches in length.  Adopting styling elements of the Mercury Colony Park and the Edsel Villager, the Country Squire had a less angled front fascia with a wider grille, two large round taillamps, and redesigned tailfins (with turn signal lenses).  In a major change, the simulated wood trim around the roof pillars was replaced by stainless steel, leaving the wood trim below the window line.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  The third seat was redesigned, allowing it to fold flat (after seat cushions were removed and stowed).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;       &lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

For the 1960 model year, in place of a yearly update, the Ford model line underwent a complete redesign.  Coinciding with the introduction of the compact [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Falcon]], full-size Fords grew in size, adopting a 119-inch wheelbase.  As part of a model shift, the Galaxie was slotted above the Fairlane as the flagship Ford model range, with the Country Squire becoming its station wagon counterpart for 1960.  For 1961, Mercury revised its model range following the discontinuation of Edsel, with the Monterey becoming a longer-wheelbase version of the Galaxie; in a change that would last until their 1991 discontinuation, the Colony Park became the Mercury counterpart of the Country Squire.

=== Model overview ===
Retaining the use of a perimeter frame, the Country Squire grew in size over its predecessor, five inches wider and five inches longer than its predecessor.  The wood exterior trim returned to the appearance of boat decking, with a simpler border trim design.  To improve entry and exit, the forward-sloping A-pillar was replaced by a rearward-sloping design, allowing for wider front door opening.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1960_Ford/1960%20Ford%20Wagons%20Prestige%20Brochure/image11.html|title=1960 Ford Wagons Prestige Brochure|website=oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the third-row seat still required the removal of the lower cushion to fold flat, access was improved as one-third of the second-row seat folded separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1961_Ford/1961_Fords_Prestige_Brochure/1961%20Fords%20Prestige-20.html|title=Directory Index: Ford/1961_Ford/1961_Fords_Prestige_Brochure|website=oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chassis specifications ====
The [[1960 Ford]] chassis used by the fifth-generation Country Squire used a 119-inch wheelbase, shared with all other full-size Ford models.  To improve handling, the rear leaf suspension was redesigned with longer springs, as part of [[Suspension (vehicle)#Anti-dive and anti-squat|anti-dive and anti-squat control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1960_Ford/1960%20Ford%20Wagons%20Prestige%20Brochure/image13.html|title=1960 Ford Wagons Prestige Brochure|website=oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The front suspension is a [[Double wishbone suspension|double wishbone]] configuration, with ball-jointed A-arms.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1960_Ford/1960%20Ford%20Wagons%20Prestige%20Brochure/image16.html|title=1960 Ford Wagons Prestige Brochure|website=oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shared with the F-Series, the Country Squire used 11-inch drum brakes on all four wheels.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

===== Powertrain =====
At its launch, the fifth-generation retained several engines from the previous generation.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1960_Ford/1960%20Ford%20Wagons%20Prestige%20Brochure/image16.html|title=1960 Ford Wagons Prestige Brochure|website=oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 145&amp;nbsp;hp 223 cubic-inch inline-six was standard, with three optional V8 engines.  A 292 cubic-inch V8 (retuned to 185&amp;nbsp;hp) made its return, along with a 352 cubic-inch V8 (235&amp;nbsp;hp with 2-barrel; 300&amp;nbsp;hp with 4-barrel).&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  For 1961, the engines were detuned, with the six making 135&amp;nbsp;hp, the 292 175&amp;nbsp;hp, and the 352 220&amp;nbsp;hp (the 300&amp;nbsp;hp V8 remained).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1961_Ford/1961_Fords_Prestige_Brochure/1961%20Fords%20Prestige-32.html|title=Directory Index: Ford/1961_Ford/1961_Fords_Prestige_Brochure|website=oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For 1962, the engines were retuned to 138&amp;nbsp;hp for the inline-6 and 170&amp;nbsp;hp for the 292; while the 220&amp;nbsp;hp version of the 352 remained, the 300&amp;nbsp;hp version was replaced by a 390 cubic-inch V8 producing 300&amp;nbsp;hp (the only version of the 390 offered with the Country Squire).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1962_Ford/1962%20Ford%20Full%20Size%20Prestige%20Brochure/image13.html|title=1962 Ford Full Size Prestige Brochure|website=oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For 1963, the 292 V8 was discontinued, replaced by a 164&amp;nbsp;hp 260 cubic-inch V8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1963_Ford/1963%20Ford%20Full%20Size%20Brochure/image14.html|title=1963 Ford Full Size Brochure|website=oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For 1964, the 260 V8 was expanded to 289 cubic inches (producing 195&amp;nbsp;hp); the 352 was retuned to 250&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1964_Ford/1964%20Ford%20Full%20Size%20Brochure/image13.html|title=1964 Ford Full Size Brochure|website=oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the previous generation, three and four-speed (overdrive) manual transmissions were offered, along with three-speed Fordomatic or Cruise-O-Matic automatics.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  For 1964, the 3-speed manual was redesigned, becoming synchronized in all three gears.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

==== Body ====
In contrast to the fourth generation Country Squire, the fifth generation largely abandoned yearly body updates.  The body design was more conservative, integrating the headlights into the grille and fairing the bumper more closely into the fenders.  For 1961, the rear tailgate underwent a complete redesign, abandoning the two-piece tailgate for a one-piece tailgate with a roll-down window.  As part of the tailgate design, a safety lockout required the rear window to be fully lowered before the tailgate could be lowered; the window was lowered either manually or electrically.  On both tailgate designs, the tailgate used a torsion bar spring to counterbalance its hinge.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Coinciding with the liftgate redesign for 1961, the front and rear fascias were redesigned, marking the return of (small) tailfins and large round taillamps, in line with the [[Ford Thunderbird (third generation)|Ford Thunderbird]].  For 1964, the Country Squire underwent a facelift of its rear fascia (deleting the tailfins) and its side trim, with a redesign of the wood trim.&lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

For the 1965 model year, the full-size Ford model line underwent a complete redesign with an all-new chassis.  Alongside the introduction of the [[Ford LTD (Americas)|Ford LTD]], the Country Squire was a counterpart of the Galaxie 500 model line alongside the non-woodgrain Country Sedan (alongside the standard Galaxie).

During the production of the sixth-generation Country Squire, wood-trimmed station wagons (in simulated form) underwent a revival in production.  Previously exclusive to Ford and Mercury from 1954 to 1965, counterpart station wagons entered production during the end of the 1960s.  For 1966, Chrysler reintroduced wood trim for the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country (1941–1988)|Town &amp; Country]] station wagon (and for the first [[Dodge Monaco]] station wagon).  General Motors introduced wood trim for the 1966 [[Chevrolet Caprice|Chevrolet Caprice Estate]] and in 1967 for the [[Buick Sport Wagon]] and [[Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser]].  As part of the 1968 introduction of the Ford Torino and Mercury Montego, a Torino Squire and Montego Villager station wagon were introduced with woodgrain exterior trim.

As the LTD became a full model line for the 1968 model year, the Country Squire became its station wagon counterpart, with Ford adding "LTD" badging to the hood.&lt;ref&gt;Nineteen Sixty-Eight Ford sales brochure W363 (WO55 Revised) 12/67, page 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1968_Ford/1968_Ford_Brochure/1968%20Ford-18%20amp%2019.html|title=Directory Index: Ford/1968_Ford/1968_Ford_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Model overview ===
To comply with the implementation of safety regulations in the United States, many running changes were made during this generation, effectively standardizing the equipment introduced by the Lifeguard option package.  For 1966, Ford standardized front and rear seat belts, a padded dashboard and sun visors, a deep-dish steering wheel, reinforced door latches, and emergency flashers.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1966_Ford/1966%20Ford%20Full%20Size%20Brochure/image13.html|title=1966 Ford Full Size Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For 1967, as part of federal regulations, the steering wheel was fitted with a padded center and fitted to an energy-absorbing (collapsible) steering column; other requirements included padded interior surfaces, recessed controls on the instrument panel, and front outboard shoulder belt anchors.  As an added degree of redundancy, a dual-chamber brake master cylinder was added for the 1968 model year (on the Country Squire, alongside all other vehicles sold in the United States).

==== Chassis specifications ====
The rear-wheel drive [[Ford Galaxie#1965-1968|1965 Ford]] chassis used by the sixth-generation Country Squire retained the 119-inch wheelbase of the previous generation.  For higher strength and rigidity, the frame rails became fully boxed;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1965_Ford/1965_Ford_Brochure/1965%20Ford-17.html|title=Directory Index: Ford/1965_Ford/1965_Ford_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the perimeter frame configuration was retained.  While again using a double-wishbone, ball-jointed A-arm configuration for the front suspension, the front track width was widened to improve handling.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  The rear leaf springs were discontinued, replaced with a three-link coil-sprung solid rear axle;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; in various forms, Ford would use this suspension configuration on rear-wheel drive full-size vehicles through the production of the final Ford Crown Victoria in 2011.

===== Powertrain =====
For the sixth generation, the Country Squire (alongside Ford full-size cars and F-Series trucks) received a new standard engine, with a 240 cubic-inch "Big Six" inline-6 (producing 150&amp;nbsp;hp) replacing the 223 cubic-inch "Mileage Maker" six.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The three V8 engines were retained from the previous generations, with a 200&amp;nbsp;hp 289 cubic-inch V8, a 250&amp;nbsp;hp 352 cubic-inch V8, and a 300&amp;nbsp;hp 390 cubic-inch V8.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; For 1966, two versions of the 390 were introduced, producing 275&amp;nbsp;hp (2-bbl) or 315&amp;nbsp;hp (4-bbl). For the first time, a 428 cubic-inch V8 was offered on the Country Squire, producing 345&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; For 1967, the 352 FE V8 was dropped, largely replaced by the 2-bbl version of the 390 (producing 270&amp;nbsp;hp).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1967_Ford/1967_Ford_Full_Size_Brochure/1967%20Ford%20Full%20Size-26.html|title=Directory Index: Ford/1967_Ford/1967_Ford_Full_Size_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 1968, the 289 was expanded to {{convert|302|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}, producing 210&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1968_Ford/1968_Ford_Brochure/1968%20Ford-24.html|title=Directory Index: Ford/1968_Ford/1968_Ford_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2-bbl 390 and 428 were retuned, making 265 and 340&amp;nbsp;hp, respectively.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

While maintaining powertrain commonality with the Ford Galaxie, on an official basis, Ford did not offer the Country Squire with any version of the 428 V8 producing over 345&amp;nbsp;hp, nor any 427 V8.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

For the sixth-generation Country Squire, the 3-speed column-shifted manual made its return, along with the 4-speed overdrive manual.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; For 1967 only, a floor-shifted 4-speed manual was offered for the Country Squire (only with the 390 and 428 V8s). The Fordomatic 3-speed automatic was retired, with Cruise-O-Matic replaced by several 3-speed automatic designs marketed under the SelectShift name; the [[Ford C4 transmission|C4]] was developed for inline-6 and small V8s, while the [[Ford C6 transmission|C6]] was developed for large V8s; the [[Cruise-O-Matic#FMX|FMX]] was introduced for medium-size engines in 1968.

==== Body ====
For the sixth generation, the Country Squire again shared its doors with four-door Ford sedans. While the roofline of the Country Squire was shared with the Mercury Colony Park, the two model lines shared different bodywork below the window lines (including front fascias and rear quarter panels). In a major styling change, full-size Fords adopted vertically-stacked headlamps, raising the hoodline and enlarging the grille.

In a design change that would last through its 1991 discontinuation, the 1965 Country Squire replaced the third-row rear seat configuration for two (optional) flat-folding rear seats facing towards the center of the cargo area, expanding seating to 10 passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1965_Ford/1965_Ford_Brochure/1965%20Ford-14.html|title=Directory Index: Ford/1965_Ford/1965_Ford_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Coinciding with all full-size Fords, the Country Squire adopted two-sided keys for 1965, introducing a [[valet key]] (while unlocking the front doors and starting the car, the key would not unlock the glovebox and rear cargo door).

Following a minor grille update for the 1967 model year, the Country Squire underwent an exterior update for the 1968 model year.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Coinciding with its becoming a counterpart of the Ford LTD, the Country Squire adopted its split-grille front fascia, adopting vacuum-operated [[hidden headlamp]]s; as a fail-safe, the system retracted the headlamp covers if engine vacuum was lost. While the feature was shared with the Colony Park (and its Marquis counterpart), the redesign marked a significant differentiation of front fascia designs between the two model lines.  In another change, the taillamps switched from a square design (derived from the traditional Ford round taillamps of the 1940s and 1950s) to a vertically-oriented rectangle (a design used to 1991).&lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===== Magic Doorgate =====
For 1966, all Ford wagons introduced the '''Magic Doorgate''' rear door configuration'''.'''  Engineered by [[Donald N. Frey]],&lt;ref name="time1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,843628,00.html |title=The Thinker (Detroit Style) |newspaper=Time |date=April 21, 1967 |accessdate=2007-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the two-way tailgate configuration allowed the rear door to fold down (like a traditional tailgate) or hinge open to the side (as a door). The Magic Doorgate was made possible through a traditional stationary hinge on the passenger side and a combination of hinges on the driver side, carrying the weight of the tailgate when it swung outward. While opened by the exterior or interior door handle, the rear door would not open to the side or fold down unless the rear window was retracted.

In various adaptations, the two-way rear door would become utilized on full-size station wagons across Ford, General Motors, and AMC during the 1970s.

For the 1969 model year, the full-size Ford model line underwent a complete redesign, increasing in wheelbase from 119 inches to 121 inches.  In a consolidation of its branding, Ford station wagons and sedans were no longer distinct model lines.&lt;ref name="Odin"&gt;Odin, L.C.

ASIN: B01HE91Y4K.&lt;/ref&gt;  After adding LTD hood badging in 1968, the Country Squire was added to the model range for 1969,&lt;ref&gt;Ford Wagons sales brochure 5029-8/68, page 12&lt;/ref&gt; slotted above the (Galaxie) Country Sedan and (Custom 500) Ranch Wagon.

===1969–1972===
[[File:1969 Ford LTD Country Squire.jpg|thumb|left|1970 Ford LTD Country Squire]]
For the 1969 model year, a new generation of Ford and Mercury cars made their debut; station wagons for both divisions rode on a 121-inch wheelbase shared with the Ford sedan line, a gain of two inches. The "Magic Doorgate" tailgate was updated to a 3-way design: it could now swing down as a tailgate or swing out with the window down or up (the latter was previously not possible).&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;

As part of the LTD line, the Country Squire wore similar interior trim; with the obvious exception of its simulated woodgrain paneling, Country Squires wore the same bodywork from the windshield forward as their LTD sedan counterparts. For the 1970 model year, visible changes were limited to detail changes in bumper and grille trim. In 1971, the Country Squire would be given an extensive facelift (with only the roof and tailgate carried over from the 1970 model); as with the LTD, it would lose its hidden headlamps in the grille.

Initially, the standard engine was a 302 cubic-inch V8, replaced by a 351 cubic-inch V8 midway through the 1969 model year. As with its LTD counterpart, the 390 and 429 V8 engines were options. In 1971, the 390 V8 was replaced by a 402 cubic-inch V8 (though sold as a 400). For a variety of reasons, 1972 saw a major decrease in powertrain output. That year, gross horsepower was replaced by SAE net horsepower. The addition of emissions controls and adoption of unleaded fuel required lowered compression ratios and retarded ignition timing. In one example, the range-topping 429 V8 would see its output drop from 365&amp;nbsp;hp to 212&amp;nbsp;hp from 1971 to 1972. In 1972, the 429 was joined by a 224-hp 460 cubic-inch V8 seen previously in the Lincoln lineup.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;

===1973–1978===
[[File:1978 Ford LTD Country Squire wagon.jpg|thumb|left|1978 Ford LTD Country Squire]]
For the 1973 model year, the Ford full-size car line was given a major update.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt; While still built on the same chassis and 121-inch wheelbase, the addition of [[5 mph bumper]]s would add over six inches in length to the LTD Country Squire by the end of the 1974 model year. These would also be the longest and heaviest station wagons ever produced by Ford.

For 1974, 5-mph bumpers were added to the rear, a transistorized ignition system was introduced, as well as a new hood ornament. In addition, the 429 was dropped, largely replaced by the essentially identical 460 V8.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;

For 1975, Ford began to pare down its wagon lineup as the Custom 500 Ranch Wagon was relegated exclusively to fleet sales and the Galaxie Country Sedan was discontinued, replaced by a non-woodgrain LTD wagon. To better distinguish the LTD Country Squire, Ford returned hidden headlamps to the model, a feature associated with top-line LTD Landau (and Mercury Marquis) models. In all models, [[catalytic converter]]s were now standard equipment to comply with emissions regulations.

1975-1978 models were nearly identical except for small differences in trim and emblems from year to year. As a move to increase fuel economy, the 351 cubic-inch V8 was reintroduced for 1978.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;

The standard engine on all other full-size Ford sedans and wagons was the 351 Windsor V8. The Country Squire however, came standard with the Cleveland 400M V8, while the [[Ford 385 engine|385-series]] 429 and 460 V8s were optional. With manual transmissions being dropped from the lineup, the C6 3-speed automatic transmission was now the only transmission option for full-size Fords. The 429 and 460 V8s were a common option due to the especially sluggish performance of the detuned 400 engine that was now struggling to drive the ever-increasing weight of a Country Squire.

}}For 1979, Ford downsized its full-size car lines. Eleven inches shorter and nearly 1000 pounds lighter than its 1978 predecessor, the redesigned Country Squire retained its 8-passenger seating capability with only slightly reduced cargo capacity.  While retaining a V8 engine, the Country Squire shifted from the 400 and 460 V8 to the {{convert|302|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|351|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Windsor V8s, sharing engines with the Ford Granada.

For 1983, as Ford underwent a revision of its full-size model lines, the Country Squire remained in production; as the LTD became the replacement for the mid-size Granada, the Country Squire became the counterpart for the [[Ford LTD Crown Victoria|LTD Crown Victoria]]. In another change, the 4.9L V8 adopted throttle-body fuel injection. For 1986, the V8 was updated again, adopting sequential multi-port fuel injection (identified by a large EFI 5.0-badged intake above the engine).

For 1988, the Country Squire received its first external updates since 1979, sharing the front fascia update of its sedan counterpart; new front seats received larger head restraints.  For 1990, the dashboard received its first major update (since 1979) with the addition of a driver-side airbag; the outboard rear seats received 3-point seatbelts. For 1991, the front turn signal/parking lamp lenses were changed from amber to clear.&lt;gallery mode="packed" caption="Eighth-generation (Panther) Ford LTD Country Squire (1979-1991)"&gt;

===Discontinuation===
[[File:Ford LTD Country Squire -- 05-23-2012 front.JPG|thumb|1991 Ford Country Squire LX|alt=]] 
During the mid-1980s, sales of full-size station wagons began to decline, following the introduction of the [[Chrysler Minivans|Chrysler minivans]] and the Ford Aerostar. By 1991, the Country Squire was the slowest-selling Ford vehicle in North America, with less than 4,000 produced. Production of the model ceased in December 1990.

For 1992, as Ford redesigned its Ford and Mercury full-size vehicles, the station wagon body style was not included in the redesign, although there is published photographic evidence that a full-size clay model for a 1992 Country Sedan was made in 1988.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} General Motors redesigned its B-platform station wagons for 1991, which were poorly received in the marketplace.

At Ford, the role of the 8-passenger station wagon was passed onto the Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable; redesigned alongside the Crown Victoria for 1992, the Ford Taurus became the best-selling car in the United States. Functionally, the role of the family towing vehicle in the Ford product line was split between the Aerostar (and the larger Ford Club Wagon) as well as the then-new Ford Explorer (as buyers began to shift towards SUVs).

==Unique options and features==
With certain versions of the Country Squire one could install an AM/FM-Cassette stereo with a combined and fully integrated Citizens' Band (CB) two-way radio, and replacement dual-purpose automatic antenna (with only one visible difference; the aerial mast was a larger diameter, and black-band at approximately half-way up). The radio would then have the appearance of an original equipment, factory radio.

Options included; opposing side-facing rear seats, which could be folded down to make a durable cargo surface. Available for use with the side-facing rear seats was a folding table with integrated magnetic checkers board. Magnets under the plastic checkers pieces would keep them from sliding on the board while the vehicle was in motion.

Behind a rear fender well was a hidden, lockable compartment, not visible when the rear seat back was in the upright position.

[[General Motors|GM]], [[Chrysler]] and [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] would adopt a similar configuration by the end of the 1960s. An advanced version of this was the [[3-way tailgate]] which permitted opening the door sideways with the window up.

The '''Ford Mainline''' is an [[automobile]] which was produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in the United States in the models years 1952 to 1956.&lt;ref&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975, Revised 4th Edition, pages 389-397&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced as the base trim level of the [[1952 Ford]] range below the [[Ford Customline|Customline]] and [[Ford Crestline|Crestline]] models.&lt;ref name="autogenerated390"&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975, Revised 4th Edition, page 390&lt;/ref&gt; The Mainline retained its position in the redesigned [[1955 Ford]] range &lt;ref&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975, Revised 4th Edition, page 393&lt;/ref&gt; but was dropped for the [[1957 Ford|1957 model year]] when the [[Ford Custom]] became the new base model.&lt;ref&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975, Revised 4th Edition, page 397&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mainline was offered in 2-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]], 4-door sedan, 2-door [[coupe]] and 2-door [[station wagon]] body styles.&lt;ref&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975, Revised 4th Edition, pages 390-395&lt;/ref&gt; The station wagon was marketed as the Mainline Ranch Wagon &lt;ref name="autogenerated390"/&gt; until it lost its Mainline tag for the 1955 model year when all Ford wagons were moved to their own series.&lt;ref&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975, Revised 4th Edition, page 394&lt;/ref&gt; Mainlines were available with both [[Straight-six engine|inline six-cylinder]] and [[V8 engine|V8]] engines.&lt;ref&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975, Revised 4th Edition, pages 390-397&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australian Ford Mainline Utility==
In [[Australia]] the Mainline name was applied to a locally developed 2-door [[coupé utility]] version of the Ford Customline sedan from 1952.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091016041917/http://www.shannons.com.au/auctions/lot/?id=GGCK868UO81210DW 1957 Ford Mainline Utility at shannons.com.au] As archived at www.webcitation.org on 18 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Mainline utilized an imported station wagon chassis &lt;ref&gt;Norm Darwin, The History of Ford in Australia, 1986, page 127&lt;/ref&gt; with a large X-member from the [[1952 Ford|Ford Sunliner]] convertible added  for additional load carrying strength.&lt;ref&gt;Norm Darwin, The History of Ford in Australia, 1986, page136&lt;/ref&gt; It sold alongside the Australian built Customline sedan, with both given yearly updates until production ceased in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Norm Darwin, The History of Ford in Australia, 1986, pages126-137&lt;/ref&gt;  The coupe utility slot in Ford Australia's lineup was filled by [[Ford XK Falcon|the first Ford Falcon utility]] the following year. Comment: Ford also sold a utility version of the English Zephyr 6 in the fifties and it was this ute which was closer in size and price to the first Falcon ute.  The Mainline like the Customline was a more expensive premium product in the Australian market.    The Mainline Utility was powered by an Australian produced version of the [[Ford Flathead engine|Ford side-valve V8]] engine &lt;ref&gt;Norm Darwin, The History of Ford in Australia, 1986, page127&lt;/ref&gt; until the introduction of the [[Ford Y-block engine|OHV V8]] in the redesigned 1955 series.&lt;ref&gt;Norm Darwin, The History of Ford in Australia, 1986, page131&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ford Corcel''' ("stallion" in Portuguese) is a car which was sold by [[Ford do Brasil]] in Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Venezuela. It was also assembled in Venezuela (along with the [[Ford Del Rey|Del Rey]]).&lt;ref name="WC84"&gt;{{Cite book | title = World Cars 1984 | publisher = L'Editrice dell'Automobile LEA/Herald Books | location = Pelham, NY | page = 404 | year = 1984 | isbn = 0-910714-16-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The French-influenced styling of the Corcel was unique to Brazil until late 1977. From this year, the redesigned Corcel II (as it was originally sold) bore a strong resemblance to the European [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] and [[Ford Cortina]] of same era, but its Renault underpinnings remained the same. The Corcel was eventually replaced by the [[Ford Del Rey|Del Rey]], which was originally introduced as the sedan/coupe version of the Corcel.

==Origins==
The Corcel's origins lay in the [[Renault 12]]. [[Willys-Overland]]'s Brazilian operations included manufacturing the [[Renault Dauphine#Manufacture|Renault Dauphine]] as the Willys Dauphine/Gordini/1093/Teimoso. Plans were underway to replace this outmoded range with a new car based on the upcoming [[Renault 12]], internally referred to as "Project M". When Willys do Brasil was bought by [[Ford do Brasil]] in 1967, Ford inherited the project, meaning that the Corcel was actually presented nearly two years before the Renault 12.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OwEAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=Ford%20Corcel&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q=Ford%20Corcel&amp;f=false ''Popular Science''], January 1970, page 100&lt;/ref&gt;

The first year of production of the Brazilian Ford Corcel was 1968, when it debuted as a four-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] at [[São Paulo]].&lt;ref name="AR74"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Automobil Revue '74 | editor1-last = Braunschweig | editor1-first = Robert | language = German, French | publisher = Hallwag | page = 311 | location = Berne, Switzerland | volume = 69 | date = March 14, 1974 |issn=0005-1314|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally equipped with the {{convert|1289|cc|L|1|abbr=on|disp=flip}} {{Convert |68|hp|kW|0| abbr = on}} water-cooled [[OHV|overhead-valve]] [[Renault Cléon engine|"Cléon" engine]] picked directly from the Renault 12, albeit with a slightly lower compression ratio of 8:1 to allow it to run on 70 octane gasoline.&lt;ref name= WC72&gt;{{Cite book | title = World Cars 1972 | publisher = L'Editrice dell'Automobile LEA/Herald Books | location = Bronxville, NY | pages = 266–67 | year = 1972 | isbn = 0-910714-04-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[coupé]] was added in 1969 to target the second-car market, quickly becoming the fastest-selling version, followed by a three-door station wagon version called "'''Belina'''" in March 1970.&lt;ref name= "Best2"&gt;{{cite web | last = Castaings | first = Francis | title = Carros do passado: O cavalo Brasileiro (2) |trans-title=Nostalgic Cars: The Brazilian Horse (2) | language = Portuguese | url = http://bestcars.uol.com.br/classicos/corcel-2.htm | publisher = Best Cars | accessdate = 2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early Corcels had severe quality issues and sales suffered accordingly, but after Ford do Brasil received a new head (Joseph W. O'Neill) in 1970 the decision was made to ameliorate the situation.&lt;ref name="Best1"&gt;{{cite web | last = Castaings | first = Francis | title = Carros do Passado: O cavalo brasileiro |trans-title=Nostalgic Cars: The Brazilian Horse (1) | language = Portuguese | url = http://bestcars.uol.com.br/classicos/corcel-1.htm | publisher = Best Cars Web Site | accessdate = 2012-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Brazil's first automotive recall, 65,000 owners were contacted and free repairs were made available; the Corcel once again became Ford's biggest selling model in 1971.&lt;ref name="Best2"/&gt; In 1971 two new models appeared, with the L (for "''Luxo''") and the more powerful GT version added. The GT benefitted from a twin-barrel carburettor ("1300-C") and offered {{convert|80|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and could reach {{convert|141|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} rather than the {{convert|135|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} of the regular versions.&lt;ref&gt;''World Cars 1972'', p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Each passing year running styling changes were made, borrowing several details from the [[Ford Maverick (North America)|Ford Maverick]], and becoming more and more like a [[pony car]] in appearance. The GT was updated in the form of new decals every year, and eventually also got a larger, more powerful engine.

The facelifted Corcel I (sometimes called the "Mark 1½") arrived in 1973 and had a more aggressive look compared to the more conservative 1968 version. Some of the L and all GT versions were also equipped with a new, bored out 1.4-litre (1372&amp;nbsp;cc) version of the existing engine. Claimed power for the regular Corcel was {{Convert|75|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} (SAE gross), with {{Convert|85|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} on tap at 5400&amp;nbsp;rpm from the "XP" engine used in the GT, with its double-barrel [[carburettor]].&lt;ref name="AR74-2"&gt;''Automobil Revue '74'', p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; For SAE net, these figures became {{Convert|72|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|77|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=WC76&gt;{{Cite book | title = World Cars 1976 | publisher = L'Editrice dell'Automobile LEA/Herald Books | location = Bronxville, NY | pages = 252–253 | year = 1976 | isbn = 0-910714-08-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Facelift 1975 ===
[[File:1975–1977 Ford Belina.jpg|thumb|left|Ford Belina wagon (1975-1977)]]

In 1975 a minor facelift occurred, in which the grille and headlight surrounds were subtly changed and the Ford logo moved from the grille onto the leading edge of the bonnet, along with the existing "F&amp;nbsp;O&amp;nbsp;R&amp;nbsp;D" script. The taillights were now single-piece units. Also new for 1975 was the luxurious "LDO" version, available as a coupé or estate.&lt;ref name="Best3"&gt;{{cite web | last = Castaings | first = Francis | title = Carros do Passado: O cavalo brasileiro |trans-title=Nostalgic Cars: The Brazilian Horse (3) | language = Portuguese | url = http://bestcars.uol.com.br/classicos/corcel-3.htm | publisher = Best Cars Web Site | accessdate = 2012-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the locally developed 1.4 gradually replaced the old 1.3 throughout the lineup.&lt;ref name="WC77"&gt;{{Cite book | title = World Cars 1977 | publisher = The Automobile Club of Italy/Herald Books | location = Pelham, NY | page = 254 | year = 1977 | isbn = 0-910714-09-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was very easy to modify for greater power and some dealers had the option to install an unofficial small tuning kit that would improve the engine's horsepower to 95 (SAE Gross). Note that all of these power outputs were achieved using the low quality, low octane petrol available in South America at the time.

The Corcel GT was moderately successful in Brazilian Tarumã, Interlagos and beach rally street car championships during the 1970s, thanks to its front-wheel-drive stability and low weight (920&amp;nbsp;kg), which allowed a high [[power-to-weight ratio]]. It would not be faster than the V-8 [[Ford Maverick (North America)|Maverick]] and [[Chevrolet Opala]], but it would beat everything else in the Brazilian market, including four- and six-cylinder Mavericks and some Dodge Chargers that partook of the events. These competitions uncovered that the front drive [[universal joint]] was prone to break under heavy stress, so in 1976 the Corcel line switched to [[constant-velocity joint]]s.

In 1977, for the 1978 model year, Ford launched the '''Corcel II'''. The second generation had a completely remade design and straight lines as opposed to the pony car style of the original Corcel. These changes were also applied to the Belina, while the four-door version was dropped in response to lack of consumer interest. The resulting two-door sedan was of a [[fastback]] style, with long and heavy doors.&lt;ref name="Best3"/&gt; Originally equipped with the same 1.4-litre four as the first Corcel, the engine was now rated at {{convert |54|PS|kW|0| abbr = on}} DIN for the base, Luxo, and LDO versions. The somewhat sporting GT received {{convert|57|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, courtesy of a twin-barrel [[Solex]] carburettor.&lt;ref name= "WC78"&gt;{{Cite book | title = World Cars 1978 | publisher = The Automobile Club of Italy/Herald Books | editor-last = Lösch | editor-first = Annamaria | location = Pelham, NY | page = 318 | year = 1978 | isbn = 0-910714-10-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Corcel II was also used for an [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] [[Group 1 (racing)|Group 1]] one-marque championship in Brazil, in the years of 1979 to 1983.&lt;ref name="WC84"/&gt;

The [[Ford Del Rey]] was introduced in 1981, with a more upright roofline and available four-door bodywork. The Del Rey also had a reworked, more square front design. A station wagon version of the Del Rey (called the Ford Scala until 1986) differed from the Belina only in trim and in the front design. The traditional Ford name Victoria was to be used on this version but was dropped at the last minute. The Ford Corcel II also provided the basis for a [[Pickup truck|pick-up]] version called the [[Ford Pampa]] in 1982, although this used the shorter front doors of the four-door Ford Del Rey since there was no need to access the back seat. The Pampa would eventually also be available with four-wheel drive.

[[File:Ford Belina vermelho.jpg|thumb|left|Ford Belina (wagon)]]
As of 1982, the engine was a [[Ford CHT engine|CHT]], an improved version of the [[Renault Cléon engine|"Cléon" engine]] used in the first Corcel of 1968. It had already been bored and stroked to 1555&amp;nbsp;cc years earlier, but with a redesigned [[cylinder head]], a rotating valve design and many other peripheral improvements it received a new name and a new lease on life. On 30 October 1981, Venezuelan assembly of the Corcel II commenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = 1er Corcel II Venezolano | trans-title = First Venezuelan Corcel II | language = es | type = Period Photo | publisher = Ford Motor Company | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161005195241/https://www.flickr.com/photos/44231626@N00/24470706655/ | date = 1981-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Ford Motor de Venezuela produced 2244 Corcel IIs and 2439 Corcel Ghias (all two-door sedans), although by then, it was concentrating on production of the [[Europe]]an-sourced [[Ford Sierra]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PkIdAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Ford+Corcel+II%22+%22Venezuela%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Ford+Corcel+II%22+ ''World Motor Vehicle Data''], American Automobile Manufacturers Association, 1988, page 376&lt;/ref&gt;    

===Facelift===
All had a slight face lift for the 1985 model year. The Corcel II became known again simply as the Corcel. The interior was now the same for all four models. Externally, the Corcel and the Del Rey differed at the rear; the Corcel received [[fastback]]-style bodywork while the Del Rey was of a more traditional [[sedan (car)|sedan]] design. The Belina and the Scala, however, had by now lost nearly all of their interior/exterior differences and became near identical: only a few details, such as the taillamps, differentiated these two models. Between 1985 and 1987 the Belina was made available with the same four-wheel-drive system used in the Pampa. This system seemed to have questionable reliability; ''Quatro Rodas'' magazine did a long-term test of a Belina 4x4 (50,000&amp;nbsp;km) in which breakdowns were very frequent - the resulting bad reputation led to Belina 4x4 production ending after only a few model years, while the Pampa 4x4 continued to be available.

1986 was the last year for the Corcel. The Belina was also discontinued in 1986, but its name was from then on applied to what had been the Scala (a name that had never really caught on) as the "Del Rey Belina". In 1989, as a result of the [[Autolatina]] [[joint-venture]], the higher output [[Volkswagen]] [[AP-1800]] engine replaced the 1.6 litre unit in all models of the Del Rey and Belina, and was made available in all models of the Pampa except for the ones with four-wheel drive.

[[File:Ford Corcel II - rear.JPG|thumb|left|rear view of Corcel II, showing fastback rear styling]]
The Del Rey and the "new" Belina were discontinued in 1991, being replaced by the [[Ford Versailles (Brazil)|Ford Versailles]] and [[Ford Royale]] respectively ([[Volkswagen Passat#Mark 2 (B2 platform)|Passat B2 version]] fascia). The Pampa continued to be sold on until 1997, with Ford introducing the smaller, [[Ford Fiesta|Fiesta]]-based [[Ford Courier]] a year later.

The '''Ford Five Hundred''' is a [[Full-size car|full-size automobile]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/ford/five-hundred/2005/features-specs.html?sub=sedan |title=2005 Ford Five Hundred SE Sedan 3.0L V6 6-speed Automatic Features and Specs |publisher=Edmunds.com |date=2010-03-10 |accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was manufactured and marketed by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] from 2005 to 2007.  Deriving its nameplate from the &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;500" suffix used by Ford on the Custom 500, [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Fairlane 500]] and [[Ford Galaxie|Galaxie 500]] model ranges from the 1950s to 1970s, the Five Hundred was the larger of two model lines intended to replace the [[Ford Taurus (fourth generation)|Ford Taurus]] (the [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]] being the smaller vehicle).  Within the Ford model line, the Five Hundred was slotted between the Fusion and [[Ford Crown Victoria|Crown Victoria]].  

Marking the debut of the Ford D3 platform, the Five Hundred marked several firsts for [[full-size Ford]] vehicles, introducing front-wheel drive, all-wheel drive (as an option), unibody construction, and the first generation sold without a V8 engine (since the Ford Model A).  Along with the first completely new full-size chassis since 1979, the 2005 Five Hundred introduced two distinct full-size model lines to Ford (for the first time since the 1978 discontinuation of the Custom 500).  

The Five Hundred was produced exclusively as a four-door sedan, with the role of the Ford Taurus station wagon adopted by the [[Ford Freestyle]] (marketed as a CUV by Ford).  The Five Hundred was marketed by Lincoln-Mercury under the revived [[Mercury Montego]] nameplate, slotted between the [[Mercury Milan]] and [[Mercury Grand Marquis]].  For the 2008 model year, for a mid-cycle revision, the Five Hundred was re-christened as the Ford Taurus; the Freestyle became the Taurus X, with the Mercury Montego renamed the Mercury Sable.  Outside of North America and South Korea, the Five Hundred name remained in use through 2009.   

The Five Hundred was assembled by Ford at its [[Chicago Assembly]] facility ([[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]) alongside the Freestyle and Montego.  Excluding export sales, 241,402 Ford Five Hundreds were produced.

== Background ==
[[File:Prodigy sm.jpg|thumb|left|2000 [[Ford Prodigy]] diesel-electric concept, which partly influenced the body design of the Five Hundred/Montego]]As part of the 1999 acquisition of [[Volvo Cars]] and its addition to [[Premier Automotive Group]], Ford Motor Company expanded on its [[vehicle safety technology]] capabilities and began development of a D186 Taurus replacement.&lt;ref name="Volvostruc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.web2carz.com/1967/2005/Ford/Five-Hundred/reviews/overview |title=Ford's Magic New Number |publisher=Larry Edsall, Web2cars |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120005556/http://www.web2carz.com/1967/2005/Ford/Five-Hundred/reviews/overview |archive-date=2008-11-20 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://europe.autonews.com/node/334356/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the [[Ford Prodigy]] concept car was shown.  A 72MPG diesel-electric hybrid designed as part of the [[Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles]], the Prodigy would introduce much of the exterior styling of the Five Hundred; it was also the first Ford to use the horizontal "three-bar" grille (which made its production debut on the 2006 Ford Fusion).

The Ford Five Hundred entered production on July 12, 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 2005|publisher=Ward's Communications, Inc|year=2005|page=112|editor=Binder, Alan K}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Chicago Assembly]] (the previous assembly site of the [[Ford Taurus (fourth generation)|Ford Taurus]]), and became available to the public in September 2004.

=== Total Vehicle Geometry ===
The Ford Five Hundred/Mercury Montego were engineered with a quality control system named Total Vehicle Geometry (TVG).&lt;ref name="montegointro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2004/02/07/179649.html|title=2005 Mercury Montego Introduced|publisher=The Auto Channel, February 7, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Designed by Volvo, TVG is heavily computer-based, allowing for designers, engineers, and suppliers access for all data and results related to prototypes at all stages of the design process.&lt;ref name="montegointro" /&gt;  With improved participation and access, fit and finish increased on prototype parts, decreasing the time needed for preliminary production vehicles, so called ''pilot'' vehicles.&lt;ref name="montegointro" /&gt;

=== Chassis ===
The Ford Five Hundred is based on the [[Ford D3 platform]], shared with the [[Mercury Montego]] and [[Ford Taurus X|Ford Freestyle]].  An evolution of the Volvo P2 platform (used in the [[Volvo S80#First generation|Volvo S80]]), the platform marked the shift to front-wheel drive in full-size Ford sedans; an electro-hydraulic [[Haldex]] all-wheel drive system (based on that used on the Volvo S80 and XC90) was optional in all versions of the Ford Five Hundred or Mercury Montego.&lt;ref name="montegointro" /&gt;

Along with Haldex AWD, several Volvo design features were incorporated into the structure of the Five Hundred, including a modified version of [[Side Impact Protection System]] (SIPS) from Volvo, channeling impact forces around the passenger compartment; the front frame rails were redesigned to better absorb impact forces.&lt;ref name="montegointro" /&gt;  Alongside standard dual front airbags, the Five Hundred was available with both side airbags and curtain airbags as an option.&lt;ref name="montegointro" /&gt;

For the first time in a full-size Ford sedan, the Ford Five Hundred featured independent suspension for both front and rear axles, with [[MacPherson strut]] front suspension and a [[Multi-link suspension|multi-link rear axle]] with coilover shocks; both axles were fitted with stabilizer bars.&lt;ref name="montegointro" /&gt;  As with the Ford Crown Victoria, the Five Hundred was configured with four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes (12.5-inch front, 13-inch rear).&lt;ref name="montegointro" /&gt;

The Ford Five Hundred/Mercury Montego were powered by a single engine, shared with the Ford Taurus: a 203&amp;nbsp;hp 3.0L [[Ford Duratec engine#30|Duratec]] V6, paired with a 6-speed Aisin automatic transmission (for front-wheel drive versions) or a ZF CVT (for AWD).

=== Body ===
A distinguishing feature of the Ford Five Hundred is its tall exterior height; at 61.5 inches tall, it was over 5 inches taller than the Ford Taurus sold alongside it.  A key feature driving the use of the tall body design was the upward movement of the [[H-point]] (hip point).  As with the [[Ford Focus (first generation)|first-generation Ford Focus]], the seats of the Five Hundred were positioned relatively high from the floor, providing an upright seating position and improved visibility, access, and egress.  In addition, the rear seat was positioned higher than the front seats.  The Ford Five Hundred was the first full-size Ford sedan to feature a folding rear seat to supplement the 21 cubic foot trunk (larger than the Lincoln Town Car).  With the option of a folding front passenger seat, a Five Hundred was able to carry objects up to ten feet long inside the vehicle.

While visibility was one factor behind the higher seating position, safety was another as well.  Derived from the Volvo [[Side Impact Protection System]] (SIPS), a [[Hydroforming|hydroformed]] cross-car steel beam underneath the front seats was welded between the B-pillars (directly below an identical beam above the B-pillars).&lt;ref name="montegointro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Volvostruc2" /&gt;

George Bucher, Ford's chief designer said "it was a challenge to sculpt a Ford-styled body around a Volvo chassis, and added that designers used what he calls plainer surfaces with taut lines to give the car a modern look without losing its passenger-car proportions."&lt;ref name="Volvostruc2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cars.twincities.com/reviews/ford/five-hundred/2006|title=2006 Ford Five Hundred|publisher=Larry Edsall, Twincities.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trim ===
Three trim lines were offered: ''SE'', ''SEL'', and ''Limited''. An [[all wheel drive]] system was available across the range. Base prices start at [[USD|US$]]22,795 for a front-wheel drive ''SE'' and range to US$28,495 for an all-wheel drive ''Limited''.   Interiors on SEL and Limited trim levels featured a new hydrographic system for applying wood appliqués.&lt;ref name="hydro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/ford_five-hundred_2005|title=2005 Ford Five Hundred - Review|date=January 4, 2004|publisher=The Car Connection|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''SE'' - Included: Cloth upholstery, power driver's seat, keyless entry, power accessory delay, power trunk release, power mirrors, power locks, power windows with automatic driver's side window, 17" painted alloy rims, an AM/FM stereo with single-CD player, body color mirrors and handles, and air conditioning.
*''SEL'' - Added: heated mirrors, fog lamps, security alarm, automatic headlamps, automatic temp control, message center with compass, an AM/FM stereo with 6-disc in dash CD player with MP3 capability and steering wheel audio controls, power front seats, and an auto-dimming rear view mirror. 
*''Limited'' - Added: leather seats, heated seats, memory driver's seat and mirrors, an analog clock, an Audiophile sound system with a subwoofer and an AM/FM stereo with 6-disc in dash CD player and MP3 capability, chrome mirrors, and a trunk cargo net.

=== Revisions ===
During its production run, the Ford Five Hundred saw relatively few changes.

For 2006, a new navigation radio made by Pioneer (featuring [[Sirius Satellite Radio]]) became an option; traction control was now changed to an option on front-wheel drive models (from standard).  A mid-year running change removed the exterior doorside trim molding on all trim levels in favor of a small sill molding at the bottom edge of the door.

The 2007 Five Hundred remained unchanged, with the SE model discontinued.  All versions built after September 4, 2006 have side airbags as standard, along with curtain airbags (marketed as the ''Safety Canopy'').  The powertrain warranty was revised to 5 years / {{convert|60000|mi|km|sing=on}}.  A new Chrome Package became available, with 18-inch eight-spoke alloy wheels and a chrome trim mesh grille.

== Discontinuation ==
{{wikinewsart|Ford Taurus to be revived}}

[[File:Auto Show 032.jpg|thumb|2008 Ford Five Hundred concept.  Upon direction of Ford CEO [[Alan Mulally]], this was renamed the Ford Taurus before its production]]

The Five Hundred ended production on April 12, 2007, as did the Mercury Montego and Ford Freestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 2008|publisher=Ward's Communications, Inc|year=2008|page=115|editor=Binder, Alan K}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the [[North American International Auto Show#2007|2007 North American International Auto Show]], Ford introduced a mid-cycle 2008 update of the Five Hundred and Montego; the new sedans had front and rear fascia styling, new interiors, and new powertrains with a 263hp 3.5L V6 and a new 6-speed automatic transmission.  

Although the changes were positively received, Ford CEO [[Alan Mulally]] chose to rename all three D3 platform cars, with the Five Hundred and Montego becoming the fifth-generation Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable; the similarly updated Ford Freestyle continued as the Ford Taurus X.  Although the Taurus had been out of retail markets since 2006 (the Sable, since 2005), Mullaly cited the larger brand familiarity of the Taurus/Sable nameplates as the reason for the renaming of the two D3 sedans.  

For the 2010 model year, the Ford Taurus underwent a complete redesign.  Although retaining the D3 chassis, the exterior and interior was completely changed, to add more aggressive styling.&lt;ref name="Macho"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/30/automobiles/30DESIGN.html?_r=0|title=Designer’s Goal Was a Buff Bull|journal=The New York Times | first = Phil | last = Patton | date = August 28, 2009|quote=As he set out to restyle the (fifth generation Ford Taurus, a facelifted Five Hundred) for 2010, Earl Lucas, the car’s chief exterior designer, had a mission: to make the high-set sedan more macho and muscular.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became the final generation Taurus for North America. As the Mercury brand was being phased out in 2010, 2009 marked the final year of the Sable nameplate.

[[File:2004-2006 Mercury Montego.jpg|right|thumb|Mercury Montego]]
[[File:05-07 Ford Freestyle SE.jpg|right|thumb|Ford Freestyle SE]]
Alongside the Ford Five Hundred, several versions of the D3 platform were marketed by Ford Motor Company, with all variants produced in the same Chicago assembly facility.

=== Mercury Montego ===
The Mercury division sold the Ford Five Hundred as the Mercury Montego, slotted in between the Grand Marquis and the Milan (replacing the Sable).  For the first time since 1979, Mercury sold a completely new full-size car (and two full-size Mercury sedans for the first time since 1974).  While largely distinguished from the Five Hundred by its standard HID headlights and LED taillights (the largest set of LED taillights ever introduced on a Ford vehicle at the time),&lt;ref name="montegointro" /&gt; the Montego also differs from the Five Hundred in its monochomatic exterior, satin aluminum trim, and two-tone interior with black-toned wood trim.&lt;ref name="montegointro" /&gt;

As with the Five Hundred, the Montego was produced in front and all-wheel drive configurations, sharing the same powertrains.  In contrast, Mercury sold the Montego in two trim levels (Luxury and Premier).

=== Ford Freestyle ===
In its development as one of the vehicles to replace the Ford Taurus, the model lineup of the Five Hundred/Montego was reduced to the four-door sedan exclusively.  While not deleted, the role of the Taurus/Sable station wagon would change as it was repackaged as a functionally similar [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover SUV]], replacing the long-running third-row jumpseat with a forward-facing folding third row.

Slotted in between the [[Ford Explorer]] and [[Ford Expedition]] in its exterior footprint, the Ford Freestyle was fitted solely with a 3.0-liter [[V6 engine]] and a [[continuously variable transmission]] (CVT). In its exterior design, the Freestyle borrowed elements from several vehicles, including the Explorer and Escape.

In place of the luxury sedan interior of the Five Hundred/Montego, the Freestyle was designed with a model-specific interior.

While the Freestyle would serve as the basis for the [[Mercury Meta One]] concept vehicle, no Mercury version was ever produced beyond the prototype stage.

==Reception==
During its production, the Ford Five Hundred would attract a high degree of attention by automotive industry critics over its controversial styling.  Intended as "guilt-free luxury"&lt;ref name="guilt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1005540_preview-2005-ford-five-hundred|title=2004 Detroit Auto Show Coverage: 2005 Ford Five Hundred|publisher=The Car Connection, (1/4/2004)}}&lt;/ref&gt;, several reviewers have noted its close resemblance to Volkswagen and Audi sedans, (along with the lack of brand differentiation between the Ford Five Hundred and Mercury Montego).''&lt;ref name="NYT16"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/04/business/yourmoney/04ford.html?pagewanted=2|title=A Designer Lets Loose in the ’Year of the Car’|author=Danny Hakim|date=January 4, 2004|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT09"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/31/automobiles/31auto.html|title=2005 Ford Five Hundred: Mature Audiences Suggested|publisher=The New York Times, Christopher Jenson, October 31, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DULL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20041002/news_lz1d2ford.html|title=Ford Five Hundred called roomy inside, dull outside|publisher=Automotive News, Richard Truett, October 2, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412080451/http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20041002/news_lz1d2ford.html|archivedate=April 12, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;''    Others criticized its conservative exterior styling, likely to only appeal to older buyers.&lt;ref name="NYT09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DULL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boring"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.vwvortex.com/showthread.php?1726075-This-Guy-Must-Hate-Ford&amp;p=17588653&amp;viewfull=1|title=Are Ford designs boring?|publisher=The Detroit News, 12/19/04, Daniel Howes|quote=Is the Five Hundred boring?

While the Five Hundred would attract attention for its high interior volume, design functionality, value, and large number of safety features, along with its styling, many reviewers criticized the performance of the 3.0L V6 engine and CVT transmission (in comparison to other vehicles).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110720073658/http://autos.nytimes.com/2006/Ford/Fusion/245/10005/278058/researchReviews.aspx "Car Review: The New York Times"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.cars.com/go/crp/research.jsp?aff=pe&amp;revid=50622&amp;makeid=14&amp;modelid=7655&amp;year=2007&amp;revlogtype=20&amp;section=reviews|title=Ford Five Hundred Expert Review|author=Mays, Kelsey|date=2006-11-27|work=Cars.com|accessdate=2007-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lfpress.ca/cgi-bin/publish.cgi?p=140394&amp;x=articles&amp;s=wheels|title=New siblings put Ford back in car game|author=Dear, Clare|date=2006-05-26|work=London Free Press|accessdate=2007-02-17|archive-url=https://archive.today/20060810110311/http://lfpress.ca/cgi-bin/publish.cgi?p=140394&amp;x=articles&amp;s=wheels|archive-date=2006-08-10|url-status=dead}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT06"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/30/automobiles/autoreviews/30AUTO.html|title=Much Ado About Another Do-Over|publisher=The New York Times, Christopher Jenson, August 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Ford designer J Mays said "I don't think the Five Hundred or Freestyle was one of my brighter moments in Ford, but designing a car is not a solo effort and a lot of people have input on the kind of product they want. I've been at the company 13 years and I've been through five CEOs. Some of those CEOs have had more conservative tastes than others."&lt;ref name="finest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20120924/OEM03/309249999/a-new-heyday-for-j-mays|title=A new heyday for J Mays|publisher=Automotive News, Dejan Jovanovic, September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mays later conceded of the Five Hundred's styling: “It’s just lacking in the emotional appeal that we should have put into it. We were being good team players, and we did our best to wrap what was a best-in-class package with sheetmetal, and we ended up with a car, I think, that compromised itself in terms of style. But we will never make that mistake again. In fact, we haven’t made a mistake like that since we did it. I think of all the cars I’ve designed in my career, I regret not pushing harder on that car.”&lt;ref name="story"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autofieldguide.com/articles/j-mays-and-the-importance-of-the-story|title=J Mays and The Importance Of The Story|publisher=Automotive Design &amp; Production, Gary S.

The '''Ford Telstar''' is an [[automobile]] that was sold by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in Asia, [[Australasia]] and Africa, comparable in size to the European [[Ford Sierra]] and the North American [[Ford Tempo]]. It was progressively replaced by the [[Ford Mondeo]]. It was named after the [[Telstar]] satellite.

Like the smaller [[Ford Laser]], the Telstar was based on a model produced by [[Mazda]] in Japan. It shared its [[automobile platform|platform]] with the [[Mazda Capella]]/626, the differences being confined to some styling, engine sizes, and specification. The first model was launched in Japan in 1982. The Australian launch occurred in 1983, replacing the [[Ford Cortina]]. Unlike the Cortina, the Telstar was usually only available as a [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]] or five-door [[hatchback]] (known as the TX5). However, after 1988, a Telstar version of the 626 wagon was sold in [[Japan]] and [[New Zealand]].

In [[Taiwan]], it was assembled using [[knock-down kit|complete knock-down kits]] from 1983 via the local joint venture [[Ford Lio Ho]] in [[left-hand drive]].&lt;ref name = "Ford Lio Ho, plant Information"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.ford.com/plant_display.cfm?plant_id=129 |title=Plant Information |publisher=[[Ford Motor Company]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090918121234/http://media.ford.com/plant_display.cfm?plant_id=129 | archive-date = 18 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=l5YSAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Ford+Telstar%22 |title=Japanese Motor Business |publisher=[[Economist Intelligence Unit]] |year=1994 |page=56 |quote=Ford's Taiwanese affiliate, Ford Lio Ho, has been involved in the alliance.

Ford introduced the AR series Telstar sedan and hatchback to the Japanese market in October 1982—a rebadged and lightly restyled version of the then new [[front-wheel drive]], [[Mazda 626#GC|Mazda 626 (GC)]]—both manufactured at Mazda's [[Hōfu]] production line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gover |first=Paul |date=2 November 1982 |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/130826387 |title=Dual replacement |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |page=12 |access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/carfamilytree?ReadForm&amp;ID=AB38CE858E1B0FCDCA257125001A149F |title=Ford Telstar (AR Telstar) |work=GoAuto |access-date=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/carfamilytree?ReadForm&amp;ID=5BAD55E3A8C2FC1CCA257125001A13F6 |title=Mazda 626 (GC) |work=GoAuto |access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The updated styling relative to the Mazda was performed by [[Ford Australia]].&lt;ref name="Car of the Year: Highs &amp; Lows"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wheelsmag.com.au/car-of-the-year/1501/car-of-the-year-highs-lows/ |title=Car of the Year: Highs &amp; Lows |work=[[Wheels (magazine)|Wheels]] |date=20 January 2015 |access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This restyling effort made up part of the {{AUD|150&amp;nbsp;million}} Ford Australia spent on the Telstar, including setting up local production facilities.&lt;ref name="Telstar should keep Ford on top"&gt;{{cite news |last=de Fraga |first=Christopher |date=14 June 1983 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gi5VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=npQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5279%2C6011618 |title=Telstar should keep Ford on top |work=[[The Age]] |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[drag coefficient]] of {{cd|0.36}} was achieved for the AR hatchback.&lt;ref name="Telstar has looks but needs better suspension"&gt;{{cite news |last=de Fraga |first=Christopher |date=13 September 1983 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lxhVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XZQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4718,5996558 |title=Telstar has looks but needs better suspension |work=[[The Age]] |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A facelifted model (the AS) arrived to Australia in September 1985.&lt;ref name="GoAuto Telstar"/&gt; This comprised minor restyling to the front and rear, a comprehensively updated interior, improved suspension, revised trim and more features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/carfamilytree?ReadForm&amp;ID=E7297D2438CFA0B3CA257125001A13F1 |title=Ford Telstar (AS Telstar) |work=GoAuto |access-date=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Front [[turn signals]] were relocated from the headlamps to the bumper, with side repeaters added to the wrap-around sections of the front bumper.&lt;ref name="1985 Telstar Range"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/185636225 |title=1985 Telstar Range |newspaper=Victor Harbour Times |date=18 October 1985 |page=11 |access-date=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taillamps for the sedan were restyled, and all models received new [[hubcap]]s or [[alloy wheel|alloys]].&lt;ref name="1985 Telstar Range"/&gt; GL was now fitted with a left-hand side [[wing mirror]], with Ghia models gaining electric mirror operation.&lt;ref name="1985 Telstar Range"/&gt; The AS update also benefited from [[window film|tinted]] side and rear glass for the GL sedan.&lt;ref name="1985 Telstar Range"/&gt; Analogue instrumentation was now standard across the range,&lt;ref name="1985 Telstar Range"/&gt; dispensing with the digital setup used previously by the TX5 Ghia.&lt;ref name="Telstar comes in two body shapes"/&gt; The new [[center console (automobile)|centre console]] housed audio equipment, a storage tray, gear lever and, on Ghia models, [[power window]] switches.&lt;ref name="1985 Telstar Range"/&gt; Telstar GL and the base TX5 offered a more basic [[hand brake]] console integrating an ashtray for rear passengers.&lt;ref name="1985 Telstar Range"/&gt; Ghia models featured an armrest console with acrylic "smoked glass" lid to provide extra storage.&lt;ref name="1985 Telstar Range"/&gt; Compared to the AR series, console storage space for Ghia models was increased, as was [[glove compartment]] capacity across all trims.&lt;ref name="1985 Telstar Range"/&gt; The seats were also revised—the work of Ford Australia—and a modification that only applied to the Ford-badged cars.&lt;ref name="Telstar no longer a pacesetter but still gives good value"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gover |first=Paul |date=1 October 1985 |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/132367967 |title=Telstar no longer a pacesetter but still gives good value |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |page=11 |access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other interior changes included those made to the stalk-mounted switchgear, and a new digital clock in the centre of the dashboard benefitting from a glare-prevention hood.&lt;ref name="Telstar no longer a pacesetter but still gives good value"/&gt; The clock was previously located awkwardly ahead of the gear lever.&lt;ref name="Telstar has looks but needs better suspension"/&gt;

Suspension changes for the AS series included uprated rear springs and reduction in rear anti-roll bar diameter.&lt;ref name="1985 Telstar Range"/&gt; Improvements were also made to the TX5 Ghia's adjustable suspension.&lt;ref name="1985 Telstar Range"/&gt; In terms of braking, Ghias were now fitted with four-wheel [[disc brake]]s; Telstar GL and TX5 retained front discs and rear [[drum brake|drums]].&lt;ref name="1985 Telstar Range"/&gt; Ventilated front disc brakes and semi-metallic pads were now fitted across the range to provide, in conjunction with the brake cooling ducts in the front valance, increased brake cooling capacity and reduced [[brake fade]] and squeal.&lt;ref name="1985 Telstar Range"/&gt;

In 1985, Ford sold 20,982 Telstars in Australia—the eighth best selling nameplate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gover |first=Paul |date=18 February 1986 |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/118206001 |title=Ford tops new-car sales again |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |page=15 |access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[New Zealand]], the Telstar, like the Laser, was assembled locally from 1983 (replacing the highly successful Cortina range) at Ford's original Seaview plant near Lower Hutt and later at the Ford/Mazda joint venture plant in [[Wiri]], [[Auckland]], called Vehicle Assemblers of New Zealand (VANZ).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.co.uk/search?num=30&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=bks&amp;ei=jcpVW8LzLsGvkwWTy7bgCQ&amp;q=%22Within+VANZ%2C+these+are+generally+referred+to+as+the+Laser%2C+Telstar+and+Falcon%22&amp;oq=%22Within+VANZ%2C+these+are+generally+referred+to+as+the+Laser%2C+Telstar+and+Falcon%22&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...134034.197418.0.198797.4.4.0.0.0.0.128.394.2j2.4.0....0...1c.1j2.64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.uwSGvW36_5c ''Transactions of the Institution of Engineers, Australia: Mechanical engineering''], Volumes 15-16, Institution of Engineers, Australia, 1989, page 163&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanically identical European specification Mazda 626 and [[Mazda 323]] were initially assembled separately by Motor Holdings in [[Otahuhu]] but later joined the Telstar and Laser at VANZ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S4HmAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Telstar |title=Plant Guide: A Pocket Reference on Ford Motor Company Worldwide Plants |publisher=Manufacturing Public Affairs Ford Automotive Operations |year=1996 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched in July, 1983.&lt;ref name=whp20&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Wheels (magazine)|Wheels]] | ref = Wh0684 | title = Time for Kiwi Sierras | first = Donn | last = Anderson | page = 20 | date = June 1984 | publisher = Murray Publishers | location = Sydney, Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first generation Telstar was available in New Zealand in both sedan and TX5 hatchback forms, using Mazda 1.6- and 2.0-litre four cylinder engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Mastrostefano |editor1-first=Raffaele |year=1985 |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |language=Italian |location=[[Milan]] |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |page=424 |isbn=88-7212-012-8 |ref=TAM85}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the absence of a [[station wagon]] version, in a market where there was strong demand for such vehicles, prompted [[Ford New Zealand]] to introduce a locally assembled [[Ford Sierra#New Zealand|Sierra]] wagon in 1984.&lt;ref name="My Unintentional COAL"&gt;{{cite web |last=McPherson |first=Scott |date=19 December 2014 |url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/my-curbside-classic/my-unintentional-coal-ii-1989-ford-sierra-2-9i-ghia-4x4-tales-of-sierras-past-and-how-a-17-year-dream-came-true/ |title=My Unintentional COAL: 1989 Ford Sierra 2.9i Ghia 4×4 – Tales Of Sierras Past And How A 17-Year Dream Came True! |publisher=Curbside Classics |access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Telstar sedans in Australia were discontinued in October 1989 due to the expense of importing them from Japan, solved by switching to the locally assembled [[Ford Corsair#UA|Ford Corsair]]—a rebadged and facelifted [[Nissan Pintara#U12|Nissan Pintara (U12)]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3c4xAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22ford+corsair%22+australia&amp;dq=%22ford+corsair%22+australia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiv8PCcgv7LAhVMthQKHa8BDF4Q6AEILDAD ''The Bulletin''], Volumes 114-115, 1993, page 70&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/carfamilytree?ReadForm&amp;ID=5127105143D77BD1CA257125001A1361 |title=Ford Corsair |work=GoAuto |access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kenwright |first=Joe |date=1 May 2005 |url=http://www.motoring.com.au/day-of-the-clones-pti-2005-7447/ |title=Day of the Clones PtI (2005–) |work=Motoring | access-date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Button plan]], Ford and Nissan were to share models.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.co.uk/search?num=30&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=bks&amp;ei=t2L0W8OHN8KWsAWlnbLQDw&amp;q=%22ford+corsair%22++%22button+plan%22&amp;oq=%22ford+corsair%22++%22button+plan%22&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...0.0.0.10921.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c..64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.364zbBCf14U ''Business Review Weekly: BRW''], Volume 12, Issues 29-34, page 44&lt;/ref&gt; 

The two were instead sold side-by-side in the Ford range until the third generation Telstar was introduced in 1992.&lt;ref name="GoAuto AV"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/carfamilytree?ReadForm&amp;ID=754DACB06C881978CA257125001A13A1 |title=Ford Telstar (AX Telstar) |work=GoAuto |access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1990 and 1992, the Telstar (AV series) was only available as the Japanese-built, high-performance TX5 hatchback in Australia.&lt;ref name="GoAuto AV"/&gt; However, the Corsair proved less popular than the Telstar had been, losing sales dramatically during 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CcQTAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=ford+corsair+australia&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=corsair++ ''International Motor Business''], Volumes 149-152, Economist Intelligence Unit, 1992, page 68-80&lt;/ref&gt; 

In New Zealand, by contrast, the range remained unchanged, although it was later complemented by the [[Ford Sierra|Sierra]], this time imported from Belgium in small volumes as premium models, rather than assembled locally. Neither the Corsair nor the Pintara were sold in New Zealand, but a similar mode, the [[Nissan Bluebird#U12|Nissan Bluebird]], was offered in the local market.

In Malaysia, the Telstar continued to be assembled by Amim Holdings after a brief hiatus, reaching the market in March 1988. It was offered as a 1.8-litre five-speed manual Ghia sedan or 2.0-litre automatic TX5 hatchback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sulaiman |first=Raja |date=13 March 1988 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&amp;dat=19880313&amp;id=wFlPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EJADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5759,3285405 |title=Telstar with more class |work=[[New Straits Times]] |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1990, a facelifted model was shown, with a new, smaller grille, modified taillights and a new 12-valve engine replacing the previous 2.0-litre.

Following the introduction of the [[Mazda G platform#GE|GE platform]] Mazda 626, Ford introduced its Telstar version to Japan in October 1991 at Japanese Ford dealerships called ''[[Mazda#marques|Autorama]]''. In Japan the GE-based Telstar was available in a range of sedan models with all four cylinder and V6 engine options and a TX5 hatchback range featuring only the V6 engines. The [[Mazda G platform#GV|GV platform]] Telstar wagon also continued alongside the sedan and hatchback. All variants were available in a large variety of trim levels, with many offering high levels of equipment in comparison to other markets. All were replaced by the [[Mazda G platform#GF|GF platform]] based Telstar in 1997.

[[File:1993 Ford Telstar (AX) GLX sedan (2015-07-16) 02.jpg|thumb|left|Ford Telstar (AX) GLX sedan]]

The AX series came to Australia in December 1992. Then followed the decision by [[Nissan]] to end [[Nissan Pintara]] manufacturing in Australia during 1992, whereby Ford's rebadged version, the Corsair was also discontinued. This left the Telstar as the Ford's sole offering in the mid-size segment of the market.

This model was voted as ''[[Wheels magazine|Wheels]]'' magazine's [[Car of the Year]] for 1992. Trim levels were LX, GLX, Ghia and GT. The GT model was also available as a [[special edition]] between 1991 and 1992. Four-wheel steering was offered in the top-of-the-range Telstar. A facelifted AY model appeared in August 1994. The Telstar was replaced in Australia by the Mondeo in 1995.

New Zealand, like Australia received the AX Telstar in 1992, followed by the AY in late 1994. NZ versions were offered in GLi, GLEi, Ghia sedan and TX5i, TX5 XRi hatchback forms, using 1.8 &amp; 2.0-litre four cylinder and 2.5-litre V6 engines. The wagon version of the previous generation Telstar continued in local production along with the previous generation sedan offered as an entry-level model called the Telstar Orion. Both models retained the earlier 2.0-litre SOHC four cylinder engine. All Telstar models were assembled alongside a similar lineup of Mazda 626 models (except for the Ford-only Orion) at the Ford-Mazda joint venture Vehicle Assemblers of New Zealand (VANZ) plant in Wiri, South Auckland.

When the first [[Ford Mondeo|Mondeos]] were offered abroad, Ford New Zealand offered the four cylinder AY sedan in two trim levels: Telstar Contour and Telstar Mystique (named after the respective US Ford and [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] versions of the Mondeo) as a replacement for the GLi and GLEi respectively. Also in the AY lineup was a Telstar Eurosport V6 sedan (replacing the V6 GLEi) and upgraded TX5i and TX5 XRi hatchback models.

A limited edition V6 sedan with tuned suspension and unique trim, known as the Telstar Radisich after the New Zealand racing driver [[Paul Radisich]] was also sold locally. This was released in two runs of 100 cars each, firstly in 1994 (based on the AX GLEi) and again in 1996 (based closely on the AY Eurosport).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Telstar Radisich|url=https://feather.wordpress.com/2013/09/13/ford-telstar-radisich/|date=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable features of the model are 16" ROH Astron alloy wheels, the 'aero' body kit (similar to the TX5 XRi) and Radisich insignia decals.

Local assembly of the Telstar ceased along with all other Ford and Mazda models in 1997 when the VANZ Auckland plant closed. It was replaced in all forms by the Belgian-built [[Ford Mondeo|Mondeo]] range. The Telstar was always a popular seller for Ford New Zealand.

In South Africa, the Telstar replaced the Sierra in 1993, being assembled by [[Samcor]] alongside the Mazda 626.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Reuvid |editor1-first=Jonathan | date =1995 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPwxAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Telstar |title=Doing Business in South Africa |publisher=[[Kogan Page]] |page=270 |isbn=9780749413477}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in New Zealand, a Telstar Contour and Telstar Mystique were offered. In 1998, the Telstar was replaced by the Mondeo, which was later fully imported.

In Malaysia, the third generation Telstar arrived in August 1992.

The last Telstar, based on the [[Mazda G platform#GF|GF platform]], was released in 1997 but only available in Japan as Ford was now marketing the Mondeo in the Asian-Pacific region. It was only available as a sedan and wagon, with no liftback version available.

The Telstar was dropped by Ford of Japan in 1999 as the company sought to differentiate itself from Mazda by concentrating on European and American Ford models. Telstars were briefly available with Mazda's four-wheel steering.

The '''Ford Laser''' is a [[compact car]], originally a [[subcompact car]] in the first three generations, which was sold by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in Asia, Oceania, and parts of South America, and Africa. It has generally been available as a sedan or hatchback, although convertible, wagon and pick-up versions have also been available in different markets. The sedan, and briefly station wagon, versions were badged '''Ford Meteor''' in Australia between 1981 and 1987. The Ford Meteor name was also used in South Africa.

The Ford Laser was a restyled version of the [[Mazda Familia|Familia/323]] models produced by [[Mazda]] in Japan from 1980 onwards. Ford had acquired a 25% stake in Mazda in 1979.

Platform and assembly-line sharing with the locally produced [[Mazda Familia]] in Japan allowed the Laser in that market to be offered with a plethora of engine, paint and trim configurations not available anywhere else in the world. This was most notably evident during the 1980s with multiple turbocharged variants, unique bodyshells such as the cabriolet, and full-time 4WD models all available years before their debuts in other markets (and in some cases, never making it offshore at all). Along with the Japanese produced [[Ford Telstar]] and [[Ford Festiva]], the Laser was sold at special ''Autorama'' dealerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=-Nm2AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Phase I: Japan's distribution system and options for improving U.S. access |publisher=[[United States International Trade Commission]] |date=June 1990 |volume=332 |issue=283 |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia and New Zealand, where Ford was seen as a local brand, the locally assembled Laser outsold its Mazda twin, the 323, especially in Australia, where the 323 was imported.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5OoxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mJIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3080%2C4077082 Australia Welcomes The 'new' Migrants], ''[[The Age]]'', June 16, 1986, page 43&lt;/ref&gt; According to research carried out by [[Ford Australia]] in 1984, a third of Laser buyers were unaware that the Ford model was based on the Mazda 323.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=de Fraga |first=Christopher |date=1 June 1984 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jhoRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5JQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2509,159472 |title=Family tree bears fruit |newspaper=[[The Age]] |page=18 |access-date=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in neighbouring Asian markets, such as Singapore, [[Malaysia]] and Hong Kong, as well as Japan itself, the reverse was the case, although pooling resources with Mazda allowed Ford to maintain a foothold in the region. This was also the case in South America, South Africa, and the [[Caribbean]], where the Laser was also sold, in many cases being locally assembled.

=== {{anchor|KA|KB}} Laser (KA/KB) ===
The KA Laser (Australian model code), built under license from Mazda, was introduced in March 1981, replacing the rear-wheel-drive Escort in Australia. The range was available as a hatchback, in both three- and five-door varieties, as well as a four-door sedan badged Ford Meteor. Originally sold only with the 1.3-litre engine, the smaller 1.1-litre engine was never available in Australia. Later, 1.5-litre versions were added, eventually even a turbocharged version. In January 1983, the Laser underwent a facelift to become the KB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Mastrostefano |editor1-first=Raffaele |year=1985 |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |language=Italian |location=[[Milan]] |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |page=371 |isbn=88-7212-012-8 |ref=TAM85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Light changes were made to the rear, while the front was redesigned in a more modern style, aligning it with Ford's corporate look of the era.

In Japan this is referred to as the "BE" Laser, which was identical to the Australian KB series. The BE model code relates to the BD model code used for the corresponding Familia/323. The first Lasers went on sale in Japan in late 1982. Fuel-injection and a [[Mazda E engine#E5T|115 PS turbocharged model]] were added in July 1983; these variants were never offered for sale outside Japan.

Aside from being built in Australia and Japan, Lasers were also assembled in New Zealand at Ford's Wiri plant in Auckland, replacing the Mk2 Escort. In New Zealand, the Laser was sold as both a hatchback and sedan, the Meteor name not being used in that market, and was later joined by the Mazda 323 at the renamed Vehicle Assemblers of New Zealand (VANZ) plant in [[Wiri]], [[Auckland]] in a joint venture between [[Ford New Zealand]] and Mazda. 323s initially had been assembled at the Motor Industries International plant in Otahuhu, subsequently taken over by Mazda New Zealand. New Zealand-built Ford Laser hatchbacks were available with the 1.1-litre (base and Ritz), 1.3-litre (GL), and 1.5-litre (Sport) engines, while the Laser sedan (base, L, Ghia) was available with the 1.1-, 1.3 and 1.5-litre engines respectively, with the Ghia having an automatic transmission option.&lt;ref&gt;''[[#TAM85|Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985]]'', p. 424&lt;/ref&gt;

The Laser was also sold in some countries in [[Latin America]], including [[Argentina]], where the local model was identical to the KA version sold in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifhp97/5053482790/|title=1981 Ford Laser (Argentina)|date=October 4, 2010|via=Flickr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mexico, however, the first-generation Laser had a front end similar to the North American [[Mazda Familia#BD|Mazda GLC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/aussiefordadverts/11991427676/|title=1981 Ford KA Laser Brochure - Mexico|date=January 17, 2014|via=Flickr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it was sold in [[right hand drive]] markets in the [[Caribbean]] such as [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]], where it was locally assembled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.tt/lifestyle/2013-09-07/charles-mcenearney-and-ford-94-year-partnership Charles McEnearney and Ford A 94-year partnership], ''[[Trinidad Guardian]]'', September 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Assembly of the Laser also occurred in [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]] (in [[right hand drive]]) and in [[left hand drive]] for markets like [[Taiwan]] and the [[Philippines]]. In Taiwan, it was assembled using [[knock-down kit|complete knock-down kits]] from 1981 via the local joint venture [[Ford Lio Ho]].&lt;ref name = "Ford Lio Ho, plant Information"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.ford.com/plant_display.cfm?plant_id=129 |title=Plant Information |publisher=[[Ford Motor Company]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918121234/http://media.ford.com/plant_display.cfm?plant_id=129 |archive-date=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=l5YSAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Ford+Telstar%22 |title=Japanese Motor Business |publisher=[[Economist Intelligence Unit]] |year=1994 |page=56 |quote=Ford's Taiwanese affiliate, Ford Lio Ho, has been involved in the alliance.

The Laser was also introduced in [[Zimbabwe]] in 1981, the first Ford model to be sold in the country for fourteen years, after the imposition of sanctions on the then [[Rhodesia]] after its [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xYsqAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Ford+Laser%22+%22Zimbabwe%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Ford+Laser%22++ ''Automotive News''], Issues 4883-4895, 1981, page 116&lt;/ref&gt; It was assembled at the state-owned Willowvale Motor Industries plant, in [[Harare]], alongside the Mazda 323.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt;

The Meteor's front styling and grille differed from the corresponding Laser.&lt;ref name="The Canberra Times, 1982-08-31"/&gt; The Meteor styling was based on the Japanese market [[Mazda Familia#BD|Mazda Familia (BD)]] sedan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/Mazda_201607 |title=Mazda Familia (BD) 1300 and 1500 saloon (Japanese brochure) |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Mazda]] |year=1981 |access-date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lighting changes included the replacement of the Laser's amber front [[turn signals]] with clear lenses, plus the fitment of larger, flush [[headlamp]]s over the Laser's smaller lights that were "sunken" into an enclosure.&lt;ref name="Ford Laser, Meteor and Telstar Reviews and Road Tests"/&gt; The Meteor grille had more of an "[[eggcrate]]" pattern than the plain black slats of the Laser.&lt;ref name="Ford Laser, Meteor and Telstar Reviews and Road Tests"/&gt; Suspension was [[Independent suspension|fully independent]] with [[coil spring]]s.&lt;ref name="The Canberra Times, 1982-08-31"/&gt;

Trim levels in Australia comprised the entry-level GL and upmarket Ghia, both available with an optional "S" pack that added full instrumentation and upgraded tyres.&lt;ref name="The Canberra Times, 1982-08-31"/&gt; Steel wheels with bright metal trim rings differentiated the GL from the Ghia with its alloy wheels and deep side protection mouldings.&lt;ref name="The Canberra Times, 1982-08-31"/&gt;

The mid-term facelifted model of May 1983, coded GB, brought the range closer together, though Meteors continued as a separate and slightly more premium line.

=== Japan ===
January 1985 saw the advent of the BF series Laser in Japan. This was the Laser's first major redesign. For the first time a diesel version was offered in Japan, as well as a factory two-door cabriolet, a DOHC 16-valve Sport version, and a potent [[Mazda B engine#B6T|140 PS DOHC turbo]] model with full-time 4WD drivetrain (identical to the contemporary Mazda Familia BFMR). This added up to an extremely convoluted Japanese product line, which was later streamlined in 1987 with a mid-life model refresh (KE series in other markets). This refresh dropped E-series engines in favour of all-new B-series equivalents, poorer-selling variants were discontinued, and minor changes were made to exterior styling and interior trim.

===Asia===
The Laser was also sold in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, and other markets. Trim and speicifications vary somewhat between the countries. In Indonesia, this Laser was available (in Ghia trim only) beginning in late 1985 with the 1296&amp;nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|68|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}, a five-speed manual transmission, and five-door hatchback or four-door saloon bodywork.&lt;ref name=MM1085&gt;{{cite magazine | magazine = Mobil &amp; Motor | language = Indonesian | title = Baru: Ford Laser Ghia | trans-title = New: Ford Laser Ghia | page = 28 | volume = XV | number = 10 | date = 1985-11-11 | publisher = PT Inscore Indonesia | ref = mm85 | editor-last = Susanto | editor-first = Tias | issn = 0047-7591 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, a non-emissions scrubbed Laser TX-3 with the fuel injected B6 engine became available.

===Australia and New Zealand===
For Australia, the range was known as the KC Laser and GC Meteor, launched in October 1985. All bodystyles were carried over, with the addition of a station wagon (badged as "Meteor", like the sedan) from 1986. A new "TX3" variant, which was at the top of the "Laser" models in specification level and designated "KC2", replaced the "Sport" variant from the KB series. Unlike the Sport, the TX3 was only available as a three-door (the Taiwanese TX3 was available in a five-door version only). The "L" and "GL" models were no longer available as a three-door. A notable change was the introduction of engines capable of running on 91&amp;nbsp;RON unleaded petrol (this became mandatory in Australia from 1986).

[[File:1987 Ford Meteor (GC) GL station wagon (2015-06-27) 02.jpg|thumb|Ford Meteor (GC) GL wagon]]

The ''E5'' 1.5-litre SOHC carburettored engine that was optional on GL, and standard on Ghia in the KB series was replaced with the new ''B6'' 1.6-litre I4 SOHC. For the first time, electronic fuel injection was available as an option on Ghia models, and was standard on TX3 models. Buyers who ordered automatic transmission with this engine received an electronically controlled four-speed unit, which was quite advanced for a small car in 1985. The ''B3'' I4 SOHC 1.3-litre engine was standard on the "L" (hatchback only, the wagon had a 1.6-litre engine). The 1.6-litre engine was standard on GL, Ghia and TX3, though some early GL models were equipped with a 1.5-litre SOHC carburettored.

The KC/KE Laser wagon was also assembled in New Zealand, alongside its Mazda 323 equivalent, until Ford closed their VANZ assembly plant at [[Wiri]], [[Auckland]] in 1996.

* Laser L
* Laser GL
* Laser Ghia
* Laser TX3
* Meteor L (wagon only)
* Meteor GL
* Meteor Ghia

=== North America === 
A version of the KC Laser, the [[Mercury Tracer]], was marketed in the US and Canada, available as a hatchback and wagon only. The Tracer hatchback shared its bodyshell with its Laser counterpart, but the wagon was a distinct design based on the Laser hatchback, rather than the sedan, as was the case with the Meteor wagon. US versions of the Tracer were built in Mexico, whereas for the Canadian market, Ford opted to import the Mercury Tracer from [[Taiwan]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Feenstra |first1=Robert C |last2=Hamilton |first2=Gary G |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4lEKRJSIVIEC |title=Emergent Economies, Divergent Paths: Economic Organization and International Trade in South Korea and Taiwan |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page=311 |isbn=9781139447232}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Bermuda]], however, the KE Laser was sold locally in right hand drive badged as a Ford.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2tZkAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22ford+laser%22+%22bermuda%22&amp;dq=%22ford+laser%22+%22bermuda%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7iq7Q94vRAhXKeFAKHfs8DS0Q6AEIIDAB ''The Bermudian''], Volume 58, 1988, page xcix&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1987, Ford introduced a facelift of the KC series, the KE. There were a number of notable changes with the introduction of the KE. The "Meteor" name was dropped from the sedan and wagon body styles, meaning they were now badged as "Laser", like the hatchback variants. The TX3 was also now available with a turbocharged engine and all-wheel-drive (AWD) as options. The TX3 Turbo with AWD is now very rare and highly sought after. The AWD was fully imported from Japan, while all other models in the Laser range were manufactured locally in the Sydney suburb of Homebush.

The KE is easy to distinguish from the earlier KC, by different grilles, headlights, tail lights, body-side mouldings, bonnet, front guards, and on some models, wheels. The dashboard and instrument cluster received new graphics, and the interior was available in slightly different colour shades to the KC. In mid-1989, in preparation for a new ADR (Australian Design Rule) to come into effect in 1990, all models were fitted with a high-mount rear stop lamp as standard. When the redesigned KF Laser was introduced in March 1990, the wagon continued in a sole GL specification, with minor upgrades until September 1994, when Australian production of the Laser ceased.

The "L" is quite rare, as it was primarily aimed at the budget or fleet buyer and available as a five-door hatchback and station wagon. It had silver-painted 13-inch steel wheels, with no centre caps, a large analogue clock in the instrument cluster, no passenger-side [[rear-view mirror]], vinyl interior trim, no body side mouldings, no rear windscreen wiper, and the folding rear seat was only one-piece. The stereo was also AM-only and had no cassette player. Air conditioning was not available. The only engine on offer was the 1.3-litre engine, with four-speed manual transmission (no automatic was available). The "L" wagon had the same level of trim, except the 1.3-litre engine was replaced with the 1.6-litre unit, but still with four-speed transmission (automatic was not available on either the hatchback or wagon).

The "GL" was the most popular model. It featured the same silver-painted 13" steel wheels as the "L" but with satin chrome half-width centre caps (only covering the centre of the wheel), a digital clock on the top of the dashboard, cloth interior trim, grey body side mouldings, a rear windscreen wiper, grey tailgate and beaver panel garnishes and 50/50 split-fold rear seat. The stereo was an analogue-tuned AM/FM unit with a basic cassette player. Air conditioning was optional as a dealer-fit accessory. Power was provided by a 1.6-litre engine, with 4-speed manual transmission (5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic was optional). Sedan and wagon came standard with five-speed transmission.

The Ghia was the luxury model. It had black 14-inch steel wheels with full-size plastic wheel covers, power steering, body-coloured rear-view mirrors and bumpers, velour interior trim, tachometer, centre console with Ghia emblem, lockable glovebox, driver's seat with lumbar support and height adjust, storage drawer underneath the front passenger seat, full-size interior door trims, vanity mirror in passenger sunvisor, ticket holder in driver's sunvisor, felt interior headlining and sunvisors, rear headrests, additional warning lights in the instrument cluster, central locking with illuminated driver's door lock barrel, remote exterior mirrors, front door map pockets, front seatback pockets, additional reading lamps, chrome insert strips in the body side mouldings and bumpers, red tailgate garnish and orange beaver panel garnish. Air conditioning and power windows were optional. The stereo was a digitally tuned AM/FM unit, which featured a cassette player with Dolby enhanced sound. The 1.6-litre engine was fitted as standard, with EFI optional (standard on wagon), with either 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic transmission (EFI automatic was 4-speed).

[[File:1987-1990 Ford Laser (KE) TX3 3-door hatchback 01.jpg|thumb|Ford Laser (KE) TX3 3-door]]

The TX3 was the Laser flagship. It came standard with 14-inch satin-chrome alloy wheels, sports cloth interior trim, red insert strips in the body side mouldings and bumpers, black tailgate and beaver panel garnishes, semi-bucket seats with adjustable seat height, back and lumbar support, auto fade interior lamps, and all other Ghia appointings. EFI and A/C was standard, and automatic transmission was not available. The TX3 also had a unique front fascia with quad headlights and the parker lamps incorporated into the indicator lenses (L/GL/Ghia had the parkers inside the main headlight unit) and two-tone paint.

Halfway through KE production, Ford introduced two limited edition versions, called "Redline", and "Livewire". The Redline was based on the GL hatch, while the Livewire was based on the GL sedan and hatch. The Redline featured the TX3's alloy wheels, two-tone paint and red inserts in the body-side mouldings and bumpers, air conditioning, and a tachometer. The Livewire featured yellow inserts in the body side mouldings and bumpers, a body coloured grille, air conditioning, and a tachometer. Both models had 5-speed manual transmission (as opposed to the standard 4-speed) as standard, with 3-speed automatic transmission as an option.

===South Africa===
The Laser was introduced in South Africa in 1986, as a hatchback, with the sedan version being sold as the Meteor. Replacing the [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]], it was produced alongside the Mazda 323 by [[Samcor]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YUVPAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Samcor+Laser+Meteor&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Laser+Meteor ''Financial Mail''], Volume 104, Issues 5-9, page 221&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the 1.3&amp;nbsp;L carb, 1.6&amp;nbsp;L carb and 1.6&amp;nbsp;L EFi engines, South African models of the Laser and Meteor also gained the Mazda ''[[Mazda F engine#FE-DOHC|FE-DOHC]]'' EFi 16-valve engine with {{convert|146|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|136|lbft|N·m|0|abbr=on}} from 1991 to 1993. The KC/KE Laser and Meteor remained in production in South Africa until 1995, when the Escort was reintroduced.

However, Ford introduced an entry-level model called the Tonic and Tracer, a rebadged version of the locally manufactured BF series Mazda 323 hatchback, which was sold until 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carmag.co.za/news_post/ford-mazda-zoom-apart/ Ford, Mazda Zoom Apart], ''CAR magazine'', September 1st 2002&lt;/ref&gt; From 1989, [[Ford CVH engine|Ford's CVH engines]] (1.4 and 1.6) were used, with fuel injection available for the 1600 Sport model. These were later in turn replaced by Mazda's B3 and B6 engines.

The third generation BG series of 1989 to 1994 went on to be the most popular Laser sold in Japan, with the new "coupé" (liftback) version an instant success. Again, a [[Mazda B engine#BPT|DOHC turbo model]] with full-time 4WD was offered as a companion car to the Mazda Familia GT-X, now producing {{convert|180|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} from an increased displacement of 1.8&amp;nbsp;litres.

===Australia===
In Australia, this model was released in March 1990 as the KF series and updated in October 1991 with the KH facelift. Local production of the Laser in Australia ceased in 4 September 1994 when Ford closed its plant at [[Homebush, New South Wales]], and imported the new KJ model from Japan;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoweb.com.au/cms/A_104206/title_Ford-Commemorates-80-Years-on-the-Line/newsarticle.html |title=Ford Commemorates 80 Years on the Line |work=AutoWeb |date=24 March 2005 |access-date=22 July 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324184817/http://www.autoweb.com.au/cms/A_104206/title_Ford-Commemorates-80-Years-on-the-Line/newsarticle.html |archivedate=24 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the KH Laser continued in production at Ford's assembly plant in [[Wiri]], [[Auckland]], until the end of 1996 when the factory closed. The extended production model in New Zealand was sold only in five-door hatchback form as either the '''Laser Encore''' or '''Laser Esprit''', as a cheaper alternative to the newer KJ Laser imported from Japan. The Encore was the cheaper of the two, available only with a five-speed manual transmission, while the Esprit was slightly higher specification and was available with both the five-speed and also a four-speed automatic. Both featured red pinstriping around the body and many received dealer-fit accessories such as alloy wheels to boost appeal.

===Other markets===
This generation of Laser was also sold in [[Cyprus]] and [[Malta]]. This generation was the basis of later [[Ford Escort (North America)|Escort]] models sold in North America from 1990 for the 1991 model year, which is not to be confused with the model of the same name sold in Europe. The Escort name was retained for the new model due to both strong brand equity on the Escort name as well as [[Chrysler]] already using the Laser name for the [[Plymouth Laser]]. The Escort wagon seen in North America during this generation was unique to that continent and was not part of the Laser ranges elsewhere.

===Japan===
The fourth generation model was known as the BHA series in Japan. All sporting models were discontinued with the release of this model in the wake of poor sales and financial returns as Mazda scaled back operations and sought to rearrange market focus. Only the sedan and three-door hatchback were sold in Japan, the hatch being based on the Mazda Familia Neo.

===Australia===
The Japanese built KJ Laser in Australia released in October 1994 represented a major change in design; looking very different from the previous KH model. The three-door hatchback was known as the Laser Lynx and the five-door as the Laser Liata. The new KJ Laser was introduced in 1994 with variants, facelifts (KL of December 1996 and KM of December 1997) and engine driveline improvements continuing up until the last of the KM series were released in 1998. The KJ Laser was the first Laser manufactured wholly in Japan, following Ford Australia's decision to close their Homebush plant. However, the KJ was disappointing in sales numbers mainly because of the smaller [[Ford Festiva|Festiva]] and other cheaper South Korean models from Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo to which many conservative buyers flocked.

===New Zealand===
With the introduction of the KJ Laser in 1994, Ford New Zealand found itself in a unique position, offering three different generations of the Laser as new vehicles at once at its dealerships—the new KJ Laser imported from Japan, the locally assembled previous-generation KH Laser as a five-door hatchback, and the older-shape KE Laser station wagon. This continued until 1996 when Ford NZ closed its [[Wiri]], [[Auckland]] factory.

The second update KM Laser was not sold in New Zealand. The KL Laser, now replaced in Australia, continued to be sold alongside the European Ford Escort in New Zealand during 1997 but was discontinued locally at the end of the year, the Escort hatchback and sedan replacing it for just 16 months between January 1998 and May 1999 when the new KN Laser was introduced.

===Taiwan===
In [[Taiwan]], [[Ford Lio Ho Motor]] assembled the Laser sedan branded as the '''Ford Liata''';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmCPiqCNa0c |title=Ford Liata television commercial |location=Taiwan |publisher=[[Ford Lio Ho Motor]] |year=c. 1994 |access-date=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Lynx three-door version was rebranded as the '''Ford Aztec'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKQ39IlB6gg |title=Ford Aztec television commercial |location=Taiwan |publisher=[[Ford Lio Ho Motor]] |year=1995 |access-date=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Liata five-door version was not available in Taiwan, although the Mazda 323 was sold as a rebadged version of the Laser sedan only.

===Latin America===
In Latin America, this generation of Laser was assembled in [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]], alongside its Mazda 323 counterpart, known as the Mazda Allegro.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8pxaAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22ford+laser%22+colombia&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22ford+laser%22+ ''Business Venezuela''], Issues 203-212, Venezuelan-American Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 1998, page 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifth generation "BJ" series models were renamed "Laser Lidea" in Japan in December 1998, but popularity waned even further than the previous model. Japanese production ceased at the end of 2002, to be replaced by the imported [[Ford Focus (International)|Ford Focus]], which was already sold there since 2000.

Released in Australia in May 1999, the KN Laser was the last new shape of Laser to be introduced. The model range was almost completely identical to the Mazda 323 on which it was based, which was the first time since the KE Laser. In February 2001, the KN received a minor facelift and became the KQ Laser. The big news with the KQ Laser was the addition of a 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine for the new top-spec "SR2", which was also the first sports-oriented Laser variant in almost five years, since the unpopular Laser Lynx was discontinued in 1996. A new "SR" level of trim, which sat below SR2 was also introduced at this time. The KQ can be distinguished from the earlier KN, with a new grille with chrome moulding, new headlights, revised tail lights, different exterior colours, and slightly revised interiors.

[[File:2001 Ford Laser (KQ) LXi hatchback (2015-06-18) 02.jpg|thumb|right|2001–2002 Ford Laser (KQ) LXi hatchback (Australia)]]

In March 2002, due to falling sales, Ford made one last attempt to restore the Laser's popularity to its former glory, by announcing minor upgrades to the SR2, and added three new exterior colours to the range, being "Goldrush", "Red Revenge", and "Electric Blue". Three engines were available, a 1.6-litre that was fitted to the LXi, a 1.8-litre that was fitted to the GLXi &amp; SR, and a 2.0-litre that was exclusive to the SR2.

[[File:2002 Ford Laser XRi (New Zealand).jpg|thumb|right|2002 Ford Laser XRi (New Zealand)]]

Despite Laser having a good reputation with buyers in the marketplace, and many attempts from Ford to reignite interest in the model, it still failed to sell in reasonable numbers. In September 2002, Ford decided to discontinue the Laser in Australia, replacing it with the European-sourced Focus. However, the Laser continued in New Zealand until mid-2003, when it was also replaced by the facelifted Focus.

===Ford Tierra===
[[File:Ford Tierra Aero 008.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Ford Tierra Aero front]]
[[File:Ford Tierra Aero 007.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Ford Tierra Aero rear]]
In Taiwan, [[Ford Lio Ho Motor]] renamed the KN/KQ Laser sedan as Ford Tierra while the Laser hatchback was renamed Ford Life, and both was sold as rebadged versions of the pre-facelift Mazda 323 BJ generation without any exterior redesigns. The KQ facelift design was directed by [[Ford Lio Ho Motor]] and was based on the Australian KN Laser as the rear fenders are different from the Mazda-derived Ford Tierras. A facelift of the Tierra arrived in the early-to-mid 2000s, distinguished by its completely new front fenders, new hood, a new grille with chrome moulding, new headlights, revised tail lights, new trunk lid, different exterior colours, and slightly revised interiors. When the facelift for the Tierra was introduced, the pre-facelift model sold alongside it, renamed as Ford Activa and acting as a cheaper alternative. The Activa was sold in both sedan and hatchback forms and a wider variety of colour choices was also available while the Tierra facelift was only offered in sedan form and was offered in a variety of trim levels. The KQ Tierra was sold originally as the Tierra LS and the Tierra RS with a slight performance tuning and body kit. In 2005, the RS was replaced by the Tierra Aero which was a slightly tuned down version of the RS, and later in 2007, the Tierra GT was introduced and later the Tierra XT with a redesigned body kit before the model was replaced by the [[Ford Focus (second generation, Europe)|second generation European Ford Focus]].

===Ford Lynx===
The Laser was replaced in the Philippines and Malaysia by the Lynx in 1999.

Philippine variants were two; GSi and Ghia, both came with 1.6 L gasoline engine. Transmission choice were a 5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] or 4-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]], available in both trims. During 2002, the Lynx receives a facelift in the Philippines; featuring bigger headlamps, taillamps, trunk gate and front fascia. The Ghia was added with an electronic sun visor and Beige color tone interior. The lower version of the GSi variant, the 1.3 L LSi, all manual features, steel wheel with hubcaps, and a manual transmission.

And in late 2003, a minor facelift was released; featuring new taillamps, front fascia, front and rear bumper. Also new was the latest version of the Lynx the sporty "RS", which is the top-of-the-line model. It is only offered with a 2.0 L engine, 5-speed manual, black interior with silver accents. It has 7-spoke RS wheels, a mesh grille with RS variant, front chin and rear bumper lip, side skirt and a rear spoiler. Available colors were Red Metallic and Black Metallic.

In Malaysia, only one trim level was originally offered; the 1.6 L Ghia. This has front discs and rear drum brakes. Transmission choice were a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic. In 2002, the Lynx received a facelift; featuring redesigned front and rear ends, new style of alloy wheels, and new interior designs. Also installed an electronic sun visor and beige color tone interior. A minor facelift took place in late 2003 and at the same time, the sporty "RS" trim was released. This came only with a 2.0 L engine, with black designed headlamps, RS body kits, and 7-spoke RS wheels.

[[File:Ford Laser Lynx.JPG|thumb|right|2004 Ford Laser Lynx RS]]
The Laser was replaced in most markets around the world by the European-sourced [[Ford Focus (International)|Focus]], designated as one of Ford's "world cars". The Mazda 323 replacement, the [[Mazda3]], was also based on the same platform as the Focus, continuing the tradition of both companies having products in this market segment around the world sharing common componentry. However, these too were eventually replaced by the Focus in 2004 to 2007 respectively.

The '''Ford Verona''' and '''Volkswagen Apollo''' are a pair of [[Compact car|small family car]]s that were manufactured in Brazil by [[Autolatina]], a [[joint venture]] between Brazilian subsidiaries of [[Ford do Brasil|Ford]] and [[Volkswagen do Brasil|Volkswagen]]. The Verona was produced from 1989 to 1992 and from 1993 to 1996, initially as a direct replacement for the ageing [[Ford Del Rey]].&lt;ref name="um"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestcars.uol.com.br/cpassado3/ford-escort-brasil-5.htm|title=Um companheiro e tanto|last=Samahá|first=Fabrício|date=2011-05-07|publisher=Best Cars Web Site |language=Portuguese |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company spent [[Dollar|US$]]100 million developing and producing the car, which is heavily based on the second generation [[Ford Orion]], and competed mainly with the [[Opel Ascona|Chevrolet Monza]] in the local market. The first generation had the characteristic of being a two-door sedan with a unique rear end, and the only derivation of the fourth generation [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] with this body style, and was also rebadged as the Volkswagen Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;Piquini, Marco (1995). "The motor industries of South America and Mexico: poised for growth." ''Economist Intelligence Unit'', p.126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Autolatina ceased production of the Verona/Apollo in 1992, after only three years of the original release, but still produced locally the third generation Orion a year after and keeping the Verona nameplate, until it was replaced by the sixth generation Ford Escort saloon in 1996.&lt;ref name="um" /&gt;

The first generation Verona was released in November 1989, as Ford's Brazilian subsidiary wanted a stronger competitor for the [[large family car|mid-size segment]] leader at the time, the Chevrolet Monza, despite being based from a lower segment car. Although heavily based in the second generation of the [[Europe]]an Ford Orion,&lt;ref name="qrnov89"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quatrorodas.abril.com.br/acervodigital/home.aspx?edicao=352&amp;pg=52|title=A nova arma da Ford| pages=52–57 |last=Bartolomais Jr.|first=Luiz|date=November 1989|publisher=Quatro Rodas |language=Portuguese |accessdate=2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has a unique body style, being a two-door sedan with a higher rear design and horizontal tail lights.&lt;ref name="um" /&gt; The two cars are also mechanically different, and while the Orion was only available in the four-door body style, the Verona was only available with two doors. It lacked some features available in the Orion, for example the folding rear seats, to reduce production costs.&lt;ref name="um" /&gt;

In 1986, [[Argentina|Argentine]] and Brazilian subsidiaries of Volkswagen and Ford formed the Autolatina joint venture, leading to a series of [[badge engineering|badge engineered cars]].&lt;ref&gt;Nosé Junior, Amadeu (2005). ''Marketing internacional: uma estratégia empresarial.'', p. 99.'''&lt;/ref&gt; The Verona was the first model to be rebranded during the alliance and its sibling was the Volkswagen Apollo, released in 1990. The alliance also allowed Ford to have access to more powerful engines, better suited to the segment it would compete, since one of the most common complaints in the Ford Del Rey it would replace was its poor performance.&lt;ref name="dois"&gt;[http://quatrorodas.abril.com.br/acervodigital/ Quatro Rodas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915125238/http://quatrorodas.abril.com.br/acervodigital/ |date=2012-09-15 }} (October 1986), p.108.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Project code name|Code named]] ''Nevada'', the Verona development cost US$70,000,000 to Ford do Brasil, and aimed to create a competitive car for the midsize segment without excessive spending, due to the bad financial situation of the subsidiary at the time. Another US$30,000,000 were used to update the São Bernardo do Campo assembly line, where the car was produced. It was considered to build a four-door Ford Orion in Brazil, but two-door sedans were more suitable to local demand, which led to the creation of the Verona.&lt;ref name="dois" /&gt; The final name was chosen in computer, among other 21 options, including ''Stallion'', ''Novara'' and the proper project code name ''Nevada''.&lt;ref name="qrnov89" /&gt;

LX and GLX were the two trim lines available for the Verona, the first one carried by a 1.6 L [[Ford CHT engine|CHT]] engine and the last by a 1.8 L Volkswagen AP engine, both with ethanol and petrol variants.&lt;ref name="qrnov89" /&gt; Base model was the LX and could be equipped with green glasses, rear window defroster, AM/FM stereo and power mirrors, while the GLX was the upscale trim level and could be equipped with fog lights, aluminum wheels, lumbar support adjustment, [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] radio/cassette player with code to inhibit theft and power mirrors. Air conditioning and sunroof were also optional features in the GLX trim.&lt;ref name="um" /&gt; Unlike its Apollo twin, the Verona dashboard was identical to the Ford Escort one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quatrorodas.abril.com.br/acervodigital/ Quatro Rodas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915125238/http://quatrorodas.abril.com.br/acervodigital/ |date=2012-09-15 }} (July 1990) , p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The last model year offered 14 pol aluminum wheels as an optional feature. That same year, the Verona was discontinued in the South American market.

In a 1989 road test conducted by a Brazilian magazine, the Verona 1.8 L managed to go from 0 to 100&amp;nbsp;km/h in 11,72 seconds and reached a maximum speed of 168.3&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;ref name="qrdec89"&gt;[http://quatrorodas.abril.com.br/acervodigital/ Quatro Rodas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915125238/http://quatrorodas.abril.com.br/acervodigital/ |date=2012-09-15 }} (December 1989), p. 50-56.&lt;/ref&gt; In this same road test, dynamometer measurements determined that ethanol engines produced 105 PS, while Ford would publicize this engine as it only produced 99 PS. This was done to avoid a higher tax on the circulation of goods (ICM) for ethanol engines for cars with power above 100 PS.&lt;ref name="qrdec89" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://legisweb.com.br/legislacao/?legislacao=13298 Convênio ICM nº 44 de 27/09/1985 (Federal)].

===Volkswagen Apollo===
[[File:Apollo guilherme.jpg|thumb|left|VW Apollo front fascia.]] 
The Apollo was essentially a re-branded Ford Verona sold from 1990 to 1992. More expensive and marketed as a sportier model, it was only available with the 1.8 L AP engine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quatrorodas.abril.com.br/acervodigital/ Quatro Rodas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915125238/http://quatrorodas.abril.com.br/acervodigital/ |date=2012-09-15 }} (June 1990), p. 32-37.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with the Verona, it has only minor differences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.club-escort.com.ar/historiadelfordescort.html Club Escort - Historia del Ford Escort]. Retrieved 2012-09-27.&lt;/ref&gt; These are shorter gear ratios, stiffer shock absorbers, different dashboard with orange lighting (unlike the Verona, the Apollo do not share its dashboard with the Escort ), smoked tail lights very seemed to the ones from the Ford Sapphire, chrome-less rear window frames, fixed-height front seats, painted mirrors (GLS trim) and airfoil. During the first model years, its front turn signals had clear lenses while the Verona had orange lenses.&lt;ref name="seis"&gt;[http://quatrorodas.abril.com.br/acervodigital/ Quatro Rodas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915125238/http://quatrorodas.abril.com.br/acervodigital/ |date=2012-09-15 }} (June 1992), p. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt;  Trim levels were GL (base model) and GLS.

A recurrent complaint from Apollo owners was the usage of steel rod-operated gear shift instead of the commonly used cable-operated gear shift. Both Verona and Apollo had cambering issues as well, partially due to rear suspension's project that was not adequately designed for a saloon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordhp.com.br/veiculosford/escort.htm Ford HP - Escort].

The Verona discontinued in 1992 was relaunched in late 1993, this time sharing its body style with the third generation Ford Orion and only available as a four-door sedan.

Three trims were offered, a base (LX), an intermediate (GLX) with power steering, power windows and locks and also an upscale (Ghia), the first two with the 1.8 L AP engine and the Ghia with the 2.0 L AP. The 1.6 L CHT engine was discontinued.&lt;ref name="last"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestcars.uol.com.br/guia/escort2-1.htm|title=Médios que cabem no bolso|last=Polo Jr.|first=Alberto|publisher=Best Cars Web Site |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the 1.8 L gained [[electronic fuel injection]], the LX version was renamed GL and the Ghia gained a new digital electronic fuel injection from FIC (standing for Ford Indústria e Comércio - ''Ford Industry and Trade'', the brand's division of electronic components), replacing the old analog Bosch LE Jetronic fuel injection.&lt;ref name="um" /&gt; That same year, a new version was added to the line, the sportier 2.0i S, available with Recaro seats, air conditioning, cassette player and disc brakes in four wheels.&lt;ref name="last" /&gt;

In 1996, the Verona was facelifted, with a new hood and the oval grille. Production also shifted from São Bernardo do Campo to [[General Pacheco|Pacheco]], [[Argentina]], where it was marketed as Ford Orion. That same year, the sixth generation of the Ford Escort went on sale and the Verona nameplate was dropped and replaced by the Escort Sedan.&lt;ref name="last" /&gt;

In a 1993 road test, the Verona went from 0-100 in 11.1&amp;nbsp;s and reached maximum velocity of 186.6&amp;nbsp;km/h. Drag coefficient was 0.31.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quatrorodas.abril.com.br/acervodigital/ Quatro Rodas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915125238/http://quatrorodas.abril.com.br/acervodigital/ |date=2012-09-15 }} (October 1993), p. 36-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ford Ikon''' is a [[subcompact car]] produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] since the end of 1999. It has been initially introduced as the sedan version of the [[Ford Fiesta]] hatchback car. It spawned over two generations, the first being based on the [[Ford Fiesta#Mk4|fourth generation of the Ford Fiesta]] and bearing a similar front end design.

The second generation was derived from the [[Ford Fiesta#Mk5|fifth generation of the Ford Fiesta]] into two different sedan models, produced in India and in Brazil, but the Ford Ikon nameplate has only been used for these in South Africa and in Mexico respectively.

Also in Mexico, the nameplate is used for a redesigned hatchback version of the fifth generation of the Ford Fiesta, the [[Ford Figo]], which is imported from India.

The first generation of the Ford Ikon was launched in November 1999, in the Indian capital of [[New Delhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India prepares for Ford icon|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/533708.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=14 December 2013|date=23 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on the fourth generation of the [[Ford Fiesta]] hatchback, being the four-door sedan version of the latter. Reportedly, it was designed specifically for the Indian market, after the company's officials recognised that a more tailored car could be more successful than the global models in that market. It has been produced at Ford's factory located in [[Chennai]] [[India]]

In was also marketed in South America and in China, where it was known as the Ford Fiesta Sedan. At the beginning of 2001, it also began assembly in South Africa and in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ikon assembly in Mexico, South Africa|url=http://hindu.com/2001/02/23/stories/0623000a.htm|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=14 December 2013|date=22 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, it was assembled starting from 2003, at the [[Changan Ford]] factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=zh:改出个性--试驾05年款蒙迪欧、嘉年华|url=http://www.iautos.cn/news/newscontent.asp?newsid=39953|publisher=iautos.cn|accessdate=15 December 2013|language=Chinese|date=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this market, it featured a four-speed automatic transmission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=嘉年华--Fiesta|url=http://www.ford.com.cn/showroom/fiesta/capability/biansu.asp|publisher=Ford Motor China|accessdate=15 December 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040129131939/http://www.ford.com.cn/Showroom/fiesta/capability/biansu.asp|archivedate=29 January 2004|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other features such as ABS with electronic brake force distribution, CD player and changer, electric mirrors, remote central locking, anti-theft alarm and front airbags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=嘉年华--Fiesta|url=http://www.ford.com.cn/showroom/fiesta/capability/dongli.asp|publisher=Ford Motor China|accessdate=15 December 2013|language=Chinese|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040204092433/http://www.ford.com.cn/showroom/fiesta/price/price.asp|archivedate=4 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was powered by a 1.3-litre petrol engine, with a single overhead camshaft and electronic fuel injection, that was capable of generating {{convert|70|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="flair"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Ikon 1.3 Flair|url=http://www.bhagatgroup.com/ikon_models.htm|publisher=Bhagat Group|accessdate=14 December 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821182145/http://www.bhagatgroup.com/ikon_models.htm|archivedate=21 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional 1.6-litre petrol,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford India launches new variant of Ikon|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2002-09-02/news/27339795_1_new-variant-ford-ikon-ford-india|publisher=The Economic Times|accessdate=15 December 2013|date=2 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1.8-litre diesel variants were launched at the end of 2002 and during 2003 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford India launches Ikon NXT|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2003-01-08/news/27522003_1_diesel-version-randy-shockley-variants|publisher=The Economic Times|accessdate=15 December 2013|date=8 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The better equipped version Flair featured power steering, electric windows, air conditioning, central locking, tachometer and side impact beams.&lt;ref name="flair"/&gt;

===Facelift===
In November 2008, it was facelifted and received a new diesel engine, from the [[Ford Duratorq engine|Duratorq]] engine family, featuring common-rail injection. It complemented the 1.3-litre petrol unit, and was able to deliver {{convert|68|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|160|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} of torque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Design Cues are Key Improvements to New Ford Ikon|url=http://www.india.ford.com/servlet/ContentServer?cid=1178857515147&amp;pagename=FIPL%2FDFYArticle%2FFord-Standalone&amp;pageid=1178851252772&amp;site=FIPL&amp;c=DFYArticle|publisher=Ford India|accessdate=14 December 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217193808/http://www.india.ford.com/servlet/ContentServer?cid=1178857515147&amp;pagename=FIPL%2FDFYArticle%2FFord-Standalone&amp;pageid=1178851252772&amp;site=FIPL&amp;c=DFYArticle|archivedate=17 December 2008|date=5 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the features of this model, there were a CD/MP3 player, redesigned seat covers, rear spoiler, alloy wheels, remote controlled central locking, a new instrument cluster with LCD odometer display, internally adjustable door mirrors. At the exterior it featured new redesigned headlamps, clear tail lamps and no moldings on the doors. The boot had a capacity of {{convert|400|l|cuft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Ford Ikon TDCi brochure!|url=http://www.team-bhp.com/forum/indian-car-scene/48440-new-ford-ikon-tdci-brochure.html|publisher=Team-BHP|accessdate=14 December 2013|date=3 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was retired from production in early 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford India stops production of Ikon|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-04-07/news/29392445_1_rocam-diesel-variant-tdci|publisher=The Economic Times|accessdate=14 December 2013|date=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the launch of the sixth generation of the Ford Fiesta in India. The [[Ford Fiesta#India|Ford Fiesta Classic]] (the fifth generation Fiesta in saloon form, sold in India since 2005) effectively took the place of the Ikon in the market.
{{Clear}}

==Second generation (2007–2015)==
The following fifth generation of the [[Ford Fiesta]] spawned into two models with a sedan body style, one in [[India]] and one in [[Brazil]]. They were both marketed under the Ford Fiesta nameplate in their countries of origin, but in some particular markets they were exported as the new Ford Ikon (namely in South Africa and in Mexico). Furthermore, a redesigned hatchback version of the same generation of the Ford Fiesta, produced in India and marketed as the [[Ford Figo]], is also exported as the Ford Ikon in Mexico.

===South Africa===

In India, the new generation Ford Fiesta was launched in October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Ford Hosts Debut Of Ford Fiesta In India|url=http://www.nextcar.com.au/n.ford.fiesta.2006.india.05oct.html|publisher=Next Car Pty Ltd|accessdate=14 December 2013|date=26 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model was available only as a sedan and featured a different exterior design than the model released in Europe, but had a relatively similar interior.

This same model was released in [[South Africa]] as the new '''Ford Ikon''' in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Ikon|url=http://www.ford.co.za/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=FMCSA/DFYArticle/Standalone&amp;cid=1178826340840&amp;c=DFYArticle&amp;pid=1131539229817&amp;qid=1178821534153|publisher=Ford South Africa|accessdate=14 December 2013|date=13 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924014523/http://www.ford.co.za/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=FMCSA%2FDFYArticle%2FStandalone&amp;cid=1178826340840&amp;c=DFYArticle&amp;pid=1131539229817&amp;qid=1178821534153|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was powered by either a 1.4-litre or a 1.6-litre petrol engine, both with double overhead camshaft and four valves per cylinder, or by a 1.4-litre common-rail turbodiesel engine. All three engines were coupled to a five-speed manual gearbox.

The car was facelifted in June 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford India Launches New Fiesta with Appeal, Performance And Improved Safety|url=http://www.india.ford.com/servlet/ContentServer?cid=1178852665764&amp;pagename=FIPL%2FDFYArticle%2FFord-Standalone&amp;pageid=1178851252772&amp;site=FIPL&amp;c=DFYArticle|publisher=Ford India|accessdate=14 December 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918073844/http://www.india.ford.com/servlet/ContentServer?cid=1178852665764&amp;pagename=FIPL%2FDFYArticle%2FFord-Standalone&amp;pageid=1178851252772&amp;site=FIPL&amp;c=DFYArticle|archivedate=18 September 2008|date=19 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the modification being adopted in South Africa in February 2009.

In Brazil, the sedan version of the fifth generation Ford Fiesta was introduced in September 2004, being also marketed throughout the rest of [[Latin America]] (including Mexico).  This model featured the same front end design as the model released in Europe. Unlike other countries the Ikon was marketed in South America as the Fiesta Sedan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Ford acerta no novo Fiesta Sedan|url=http://bestcars.uol.com.br/artigos2/fiesta.htm|publisher=Best Cars Web Site|accessdate=14 December 2013|date=1 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was facelifted in January 2007, and again in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Fiesta 2010 se actualiza en América del Sur|url=http://noticias.autocosmos.com.mx/2010/04/26/ford-fiesta-2010-se-actualiza-en-america-del-sur|publisher=Autocosmos.com|accessdate=14 December 2013|date=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a redesigned version of the fifth generation of the Ford Fiesta. The sedan version was subsequently retired from the range in Mexico in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford deja de comercializar los modelos Ikon Sedán y Ecosport|url=http://noticias.autocosmos.com.mx/2012/02/18/ford-deja-de-comercializar-los-modelos-ikon-sedan-y-ecosport|publisher=Autocosmos.com|accessdate=14 December 2013|date=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sedan model was powered by a 1.6-litre petrol engine with a single overhead camshaft, coupled to a five-speed manual transmission, that had a maximum power output of {{convert|95|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

The '''Ford EXP''' is a [[Sport compact|sports compact]] coupe that was produced and sold by Ford Motor Company in North America from the 1982 to 1988 model years. The first two-seat Ford since the 1957 Thunderbird, the EXP made its debut at the 1981 [[Chicago Auto Show]]. Sharing the dashboard, wheelbase, suspension, and powertrain with the [[Ford Escort (North America)|Ford Escort]], the EXP was longer, lower, and more aerodynamic than its five-seat counterpart.

In line with the first-generation Escort, the EXP was produced in a version from 1982 to 1985, undergoing a facelift during the 1985 model year. The model was dropped after the 1988 model year. Although not intended to replace the EXP (as it was originally designed to become the 1989 Ford Mustang), the 1989 [[Ford Probe]] would become the next front-wheel drive sports coupe sold by Ford. After the EXP, the next two-seat Ford marketed in North America would be the [[Ford Thunderbird (eleventh generation)|2002 Ford Thunderbird]]. Then in 1998, the Escort of the time was marketed as a ZX2, a nod to the EXP and the XR2 from the 1980s. Although EXPs were sports cars, it was common to remove the rear carpeting to put in rear seats as the floor pans are identical between the 3-door Escorts, Escort GTs, and EXPs, however the lower roof line makes rear seating uncomfortable.

From 1982 to 1983, the EXP was sold by Lincoln-Mercury dealers as the '''Mercury LN7'''. The LN7 was distinguished largely by its "bubbleback" hatch, large bumper strips across the doors, "black-out" tail lights, and more slits in the nose clip than those of an EXP. The vehicle, however, was dropped after failing to meet sales expectations.

== Development ==
By 1980, Ford Motor Company had entered a period of major transition. Following the termination of [[Lee Iacocca|Lee Iaccoca]] (to become CEO of Chrysler), chairman [[Henry Ford II]] retired and Ford's chief stylist, [[Eugene Bordinat]], stepped down as well.

During the late 1970s, there had been a push by automobile manufacturers around the world to make small, fuel efficient cars; this was initiated by the [[OPEC]] oil embargo of October 17, 1973&amp;ndash;1974. This embargo included a 70% increase in oil prices, causing long lines at gasoline filling stations, and skyrocketing prices for gasoline. People wanted, demanded more miles for their gasoline dollars. By the end of the decade, this led auto manufacturers from the United States, Japan, and West Germany to rethink the adage that "bigger is better".

The world would respond with smaller cars. A second energy crisis and a renewed recession followed in 1979-1982. Ford studied a two-seater commuter car called the Super Gnat. It was to have a three-cylinder engine with a wheelbase of just 78&amp;nbsp;inches. In addition, Ford built the Mustang RSX concept car, exploring a slightly smaller two-seat derivative of the Mustang.

Although Lee Iacocca was fired from the company, the most important part of his career at Ford was the Ford Mustang. In 1964, the Mustang was developed by adapting the underpinnings and powertrain of the mainstream [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]] economy car and repackaging it as the sporty Mustang.  During the 1970s, the same product engineering was used in the development of the Ford Granada, Ford Thunderbird/Mercury Cougar, and the entire Lincoln product line.

To replace the aging [[Ford Pinto]], the company began development on the Ford Escort in the late 1970s. While originally intended to be a "world car", the North American version shared little aside from its engine, suspension, and its name in the final design.

The basis for developing the Escort into the EXP stemmed from company marketing research. Ford felt that the growing number of one- and two-person households, combined with the lifestyle of the younger target audience who desired a small sporty car, led them to the conclusion that Americans wanted a "lively little car that is dependable, efficient, and good-looking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.fordexp.com/content/default.asp?artid=85| website= fordexp.com| title= Fords Other Two Seaters | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060319174336/http://www.fordexp.com/content/default.asp?artid=85| archivedate= March 19, 2006| url-status= dead| accessdate= September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, if a potential customer wanted the extra room for four or five passengers, they would buy an Escort, Mustang, or Fairmont. Much like a European [[grand tourer|gran turismo]], the EXP would be a personal vehicle for two people with a cargo area in back for emergency transport of anything or anyone else.

As the Falcon became the Mustang and the Maverick became the Granada, Ford restyled the Escort from the beltline up and turned the rear seats into cargo space. The distinguishing feature between the vehicles would be an all-new rear hatchback and front headlights. Mercury received a similar variant of the Lynx named the LN7.

Comparing the EXP to the original [[Ford Thunderbird|Thunderbird]], Ford Division, general manager Louis E. Latalf said, "we're introducing another two-seater with the same flair, but the EXP will be a very affordable, very fuel efficient car matched to the lifestyles of the eighties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.fordexp.com/content/default.asp?artid=85| website= fordexp.com| title= '82 Ford EXP | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120713032719/http://www.fordexp.com/sections/history.asp?yrMk=82E| archivedate= July 13, 2012| url-status= dead| accessdate= September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford EXP and Mercury LN7 development took place in Ford's St Thomas plant in Ontario, the plant that produced the majority of EXPs and LN7s and all of the EXPs and LN7s for the 1982 and 1983 models. Here LN7s and EXPs were continually experimented on and further engineered as more technologies became available. But the plant only produced EXPs from February 16, 1981 to August 5, 1983 and LN7s from February 16, 1981 to June 30, 1983 ending the 1983 model year for both cars leaving the American plants to produce all the 1984 to 1988 EXPs.

===Name origin===
According to an article published in ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' (March 1981), the letters EXP were supposed to stand for ''Erika Project Personal'', where project cars are designated ''X''. The "Erika" came from the code-name from the European Escort.

But it is more likely the abbreviations "EXP" and "LN7" are just different variations on the models they're derivative of: "Escort" and "Lynx".

==1980–1981 EXP sales model==
The EXP was coming but Ford hadn't marketed it yet or decided what some of its details and options would be. A few EXPs were built just for conceptual design and advertisement. These extremely rare EXPs shared the body style of the EXPs and LN7s to come in 1982 but featured many things that would be available in every EXP or LN7. They were all painted in vibrant colors with black painted across the entire car under the door bumper-lines and had a round silver badge where Ford's blue oval would find itself in 1982. These models particularly stood out as they had dual vents towards the front of the hood instead of the vents to be later seen on the front bumper clips, lacked bumper strips on the doors, and the rear taillights were completely red where all the EXPs produced had black around the reverse lights. An SS package and "bubblebacks" -like that of the LN7 and 2nd gen. EXPs- were optional along with black paint around the door windows later seen on 2nd gen. EXPs, aluminum oval-spoke wheels and "1.6L" badges on the front fenders. At least 10 were made in Canada and were all featured in a rare catalog featuring only those cars and people with them. No sightings have been recorded since.

The first non-concept or prototype EXP (white with red interior) and LN7 (green with grey interior) both rolled off the line on February 16, 1981. The first EXP was driven off the line by Canadian Premier William Davis.

Ford expected to make/sell 200,000 EXPs and 70,000 LN7s in the first model year (1982) but their production numbers only met half that expectation. It is presumed they didn't meet the predicted sales figures either.

The EXP's uni-body rode on the Escort's 94.2inch (2393&amp;nbsp;mm) wheelbase, with front-wheel drive, and four-wheel [[independent suspension]] from 1970s European Fords. At 50 inches tall and 14 feet long, the EXP was longer, lower, and sportier than the North American Escort. The EXP's wheelbase is also close to the "foxbody" Mustang of the same era differing by less than an inch in length.

Performance wasn't the car's strong suit, however, since the EXP weighed about 200 pounds more than a typical 1980s Escort but carried the same small 1.6&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Ford CVH engine|CVH]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]] engine rated at 70&amp;nbsp;hp (52&amp;nbsp;kW) and a standard 4-speed [[Ford IB transmission|MTX-I]] manual transaxle. The engine was specifically developed for the North American market of fuel efficiency while the European models of these engines spun faster and made more power. Originally there were to be two available engine options; 1.3-liter CVH and a 1.6-liter CVH, however the choice was made to only use the larger version. Europe ended up with all the CVH variants while North America only saw the 1.6 and later 1.9-liter CVH engines. Also the suspension is that of European Fords from the 1970s, sharing nearly every part with modifications for FWD applications of North American Escorts. Nevertheless, the March 1981 issue of ''[[Car and Driver]]'' reported that their EXP with a [[manual transmission]] reached 44 MPG on the highway, a figure comparable to modern hybrid cars.

Both the Ford EXP and the Mercury LN7 had a sharply sloped windshield, wheel arches with prominent lips, and wide body side moldings not far below the top of the wheel well. The biggest difference was the rear fascia. The EXP was a [[notchback]] with a lift-up hatch, while the LN7 used a big "bubbleback" backlite. The EXP's minimalist grille consisted merely of twin horizontal slats on the sloped front panel (the LN7 had ten). The "bubbleback" appearance was used on the larger Mustang-derived sports coupe for Mercury called the [[Mercury Capri#Second Generation (1979–1986)|Capri]]. These appearances made the coefficient of drag low for both the EXP (0.37) and LN7 (0.36) and also helped fuel efficiency.

Priced considerably higher than the Escort, the EXP carried an ample list of standard equipment. It included [[Hydraulic brake|power brakes]], full instrumentation, full carpeting, map lighting (non-sunroof), electric back window defroster, power hatchback release, a digital clock, a cargo area security shade, and rims that are noticeably wider than those of Escorts. Models with a manual transmission had a sport-tuned exhaust. Automatic models had a wide-open throttle cutout switch for the optional air conditioning compressor clutch. Other options include floor vents and power steering or air conditioning and manual steering, AM/FM radio, cruise control, roof luggage rack, rear window wiper, various seat styles and fabrics, removable sunroof, right hand mirror, TRX tires and suspension, child seat, and a very wide variety of colors inside and out with many various pinstripes and other painted decals.

As the full 1982 model year began, Ford offered an optional (at no extra cost) 4.05:1 final drive for better performance. Later came a [[close-ratio]] transmission with 3.59:1 final drive ratio intended for the same purpose. Ford also offered an 8"(203&amp;nbsp;mm) rear brake drum set over the 7"(180&amp;nbsp;mm) rear brake drums of other EXPs and Escorts. As the years went on many different rim options became available but the color choices became more limited.

Finally, in March 1982, an 80&amp;nbsp;hp (59&amp;nbsp;[[watt|kW]]) version of the CVH engine became available (High Output option H.O.). It had higher (9.0:1) compression, a dual-inlet air cleaner, lower-restriction exhaust, a bifurcated four-into-two-into-one exhaust manifold, larger carburetor venturis (a 32mm primary and a 34mm secondary compared to the 32mm of both venturis in the non-HO engine), and a higher-lift (0.289&amp;nbsp;mm) camshaft.&lt;ref name=DCR1&gt;{{cite magazine | magazine = [[Autoweek]] | last = Ross | first = Daniel Charles | page = 26 | date = 1982-05-03 | title = Ford's new butterfly | issn = 0192-9674 | volume = 32 | number = 18 | publisher = Crain Press Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, in the last week of September 1982, in co-operation with Bosch, Ford Canada assembled the first electronic multi-port fuel-injected (EFI) 1.6&amp;nbsp;L for the EXP GT giving it the distinction of being the first model Ford offered with that option for the U.S. market. Although EFI with the EEC IV was an add on to the existing 80&amp;nbsp;hp H.O. ''[[Ford CVH engine|CVH]]'' engine, it produced 88&amp;nbsp;hp (65.5&amp;nbsp;[[watt|kW]]) and 94&amp;nbsp;lb/ft of torque in a 9.5:1 compression ratio, naturally aspirated configuration giving it an affinity for higher octane fuel.&lt;ref name="Build Date T1 tower  9 24 02"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kolberer |first1=Alan |title=Owner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mercury LN7===
The Mercury division of Ford Motor Company marketed the EXP as the Mercury LN7, much as the [[Mercury Lynx]] was derived from the Ford Escort.  While sharing a common powertrain with the EXP, the LN7 differed slightly in its styling.  As with the [[Mercury Capri]], the LN7 was styled with a convex-curved "bubbleback" backlite.  In addition, the taillights were tinted black and the grille had slightly different styling having 10 grille slats compared to the 2 of the EXP.

The LN7 sold far under sales projections and was discontinued after the 1983 model year after approximately 40,000 were sold; compared to the rest of the Lincoln-Mercury model line, a two-seat compact sports coupe was relatively out of place.

===TR Performance Package===
The biggest option for 1982 with both EXPs &amp; LN7s was the TR package, this would be available in 1982-1985 models. 

The TR package featured special Michelin TRX tires of a special metric size of 365mm which is between 14in &amp; 15in diameter wheels. These tires performed "well", made only by Michelin with an extremely soft rubber compound with a tread pattern like that of drive tires on garden tractors. All these factors made for sticky cornering but they turn to dust under hard braking and wear fast. Only one vendor sells the correct diameter as of today and the supply is very limited, they haven't been made since the 1990s so the ones for sale are all NOS that are now over 25 years old making them unsafe for road use even if stored correctly. As such the vendor says explicitly "NOT for road use" and "No warranty or guarantee" making them good for car shows but any speeds over 25mph almost ensure they'll explode, even perfectly stored TRX tires are typically found with severe rotting/checking. Due to the nature of the TRX wheels they can't be resized to 14in standards either making the TRX wheels near useless.

The other TR equipment pieces were:
Stiffer valving for the struts (Turbo models had red Konis)
Higher rate front springs (160 lb/in vs standard 120 lb/in)
Larger front swaybar (26mm vs standard 24mm, Turbo models are 27mm)
Stiffer suspension bushings
Higher rate progressive rear springs (320-548 lb/in vs standard 195 lb/in continuous rate)

===EXP Turbo Coupe===
[[File:1984 Ford EXP Turbo (Prototype).png|thumb|]] By 1984, Ford was trying hard to conquer the youth market, especially the affluent young motorist with offerings such as the Mustang SVO, Thunderbird Turbo Coupe, and the new EXP Turbo Coupe also built by Ford's Special Vehicle Operations (SVO). It shared most of the parts the McLaren ASC EXP came with; turbo, Koni shocks, stiffer springs, lower ride height, improved brakes, and TRX Michelin tires.

In the car's initial development there was a plan for adding fuel injection and a turbo charger to increase power significantly, but there wasn't enough time to get it into the first 2 production years. The [[turbocharged]] 1.6 L ''[[Ford CVH engine|CVH]]'' engine, available for the Escort and EXP, featured a high-lift camshaft and EEC-IV electronic controls. With an 8:1 compression ratio and boost pressure up to 8 psi, torque was increased to 120&amp;nbsp;lb/ft and power raised to 120&amp;nbsp;hp (89.5&amp;nbsp;kW), a gain of some 35 percent over the naturally aspirated models.

All these improvements allowed for a 0-60mph time of 9 seconds and 1/4mi time of 16.9s at 82mph which unimpressive today was good for the era. The 1983 EFI or HO 5-speed EXPs would only conquer 0-60mph in 14s and 1/4mi in 20s at 70mph (all depending on the options and model year).
But not even the 86-88 EXPs with the 1.9L EFI HO motor could touch the Turbo model with a 1/4mi time of 17.5s at 77mph.

The Turbo Coupe had a unique front air dam and rear decklid spoiler, with a taped "Turbo" badge on the rear bumper. It also had two-tone paint with a black lower section, a unique C-pillar appliqué featuring the EXP lettering, black wheel flares, and black rocker panel moldings.

Its only optional features were AC (Air Conditioning) and removable sunroof.
Its transition from 1984 into 1985 included the change from the 3-spoke (round-spoke) steering wheel to the 2-spoke (square-spoke) steering wheel, the softer 2-piece shift knob and vinyl boot to the 1-piece shift knob and square rubber boot, and the addition of the (at the time) newly federal-mandated 3rd brake light built into the spoiler (which would be seen on all EXPs from 1986 forward).

By the mid-1980s, two-seat compact sports coupes were in vogue.  By 1985, the EXP found competition in the [[Honda CR-X]], [[Pontiac Fiero]], and [[Toyota MR2]]. While the latter two were mid-engine, rear-wheel drive vehicles, all were similar to the EXP in deriving a number of powertrain and chassis components from other production vehicles. After four years of production, the first-generation EXP was discontinued during the 1985 model year. Originally marketed towards buyers that valued fuel efficiency over high performance, the Ford EXP had begun to struggle against newer vehicles. Build quality and refinement were also inferior to its Japanese competitors.

In 1985, a group of Ford assembly employees took an EXP off the line and upgraded it with parts from the updated 1985½ Ford Escort. The one-off "prototype" built by the factory workers was presented to Ford CEO [[Donald Petersen]], who liked it and approved it for production, as a "1985½" model.

Officially renamed the ''Ford Escort EXP'', the second-generation EXP abandoned the controversial front headlights and widely flared fenders in favor of a version of the bodywork from the standard Ford Escort, sharing its flush-mounted headlamps and amber turn signal lenses. The Escort EXP was given a model-specific front bumper with an integrated air dam; along with the Escort GT, the EXP was produced with its own grille, distinguished by a single slot below the Ford emblem. The rear bodywork remained largely the same; with the exception of the Mercury LN7 "bubble hatch" becoming standard; the grey rear taillamp lenses introduced in 1985 were retained. To match the lowered front bumpers, the rear bumpers were redesigned.

Along with the exterior, the interior of the EXP was redesigned to match the rest of the Ford Escort line.

=== Luxury Coupe (1985.5-1988) ===
The Ford Escort EXP Luxury Coupe was equipped with low-back cloth/vinyl (or all-vinyl) seats (from the standard Ford Escort), AM/FM stereo radio, overhead console, left remote mirror (standard), with a tachometer and trip odometer.  From the 1985½ introduction to the end of 1986, the Luxury Coupe came with a 1.9L [[Ford CVH engine|CVH]] inline-4 with a 2-barrel carburetor, making 90&amp;nbsp;hp. For 1987 and 1988, the 1.9L engine was equipped with [[fuel injection|throttle-body fuel injection]], termed CFI (Central Fuel Injection) by Ford, while still making 90&amp;nbsp;hp.

=== Sport Coupe (1986-1988) ===
Introduced for 1986, the Ford Escort EXP Sport Coupe was produced through 1988. Externally distinguished by 15-inch alloy wheels, dual electric mirrors, and fog lamps, the Sport Coupe was fitted with components from the Ford Escort GT, including suspension and brake upgrades and sport bucket seats.  Fitted with a center console, the Sport Coupe was equipped with a systems monitor (with LEDs as warning indicators for headlights, taillights, and fuel level).  The Sport Coupe was fitted with a 106&amp;nbsp;hp version of the 1.9L CVH engine, equipped with multiport fuel injection. For 1987, the output was increased to 115&amp;nbsp;hp.

==Discontinuation==
From its 1982 introduction, sales of the EXP were never as strong as Ford marketing executives had intended. After the introduction of competitive 2-seat vehicles (such as the Pontiac Fiero and Honda CRX), buyers shifted towards higher-performance vehicles. During the 1980s, insurance rates on 2-seat cars were rising over those of cars with back seats, creating a separate deterrent for buyers.

Within Ford, the development of the Ford Mustang played a separate part in the demise of the EXP. In 1982, Ford commenced work on the [[Ford Mustang (fourth generation)|fourth-generation Mustang]]; beginning work on a "design of tomorrow", the goal was to shift the Mustang from rear-wheel drive to front-wheel drive, increasing fuel efficiency; in place of the Fox platform, the Mustang was to become a counterpart of the Mazda MX-6. At the time, General Motors was considering a similar redesign of the [[Chevrolet Camaro]] and [[Pontiac Firebird]] by 1990.

By the mid-1980s, as the public learned of the planned front-wheel drive Mustang, it spawned a negative reaction from buyers and dealers, leading Ford to reconsider the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1987-1988-1989-1990-1991-1992-1993-ford-mustang1.htm|title=Ford Mustang Survives Probe|date=|website=auto.HowStuffWorks.com|publisher=HowStuffWorks|accessdate=2009-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as the front-wheel drive car was significantly far along in the development cycle, Ford chose to bring it to production, renaming it [[Ford Probe]] (after a series of aerodynamically advanced Ford concept cars).  As Ford could not afford the market overlap of producing three compact sports coupes (alongside the Ford Festiva, Ford Escort, and Ford Tempo two-doors), the company chose to discontinue the Escort EXP, as it was the slowest-selling nameplate.

In October 1988, after over 225,000 Ford (Escort) EXPs were produced, the final Ford Escort EXP rolled off the assembly line.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:1982 Ford EXP Convertible Number 2 of 8.jpg|thumb|1982 Ford EXP Convertible Number 2]]

===EXP / LN7 convertibles===
Ford was experimenting with the EXP's potential with the newly released EXPs and LN7s of 1982. A select few of each were turned into convertible models. These models are very rare as Ford did not sell any more than the estimated 28 LN7s and recorded 8 EXPs that were produced, not to mention what kind of costs were involved in converting these cars. The 8 EXPs were converted by Dynamic Conversions in Hillsdale, Michigan. The 28 LN7s were converted by Andy Hotten's crew in Ford's St Thomas factory where most EXPs and LN7s were built. Very few of these convertible models are reported to be around today.

===EXP EV===
Further experimentation from Ford with their EXPs resulted in producing four all-electric EXPs. These selected 1982 EXPs are powered by 39HP GE (General Electric) electric motors and Soleq parts all built together by Electric Vehicle Associates (EVA) out of Cleveland, OH. EVA used their technology from the Escorts they made ([[EVcort#History|"EVcorts"]]). Production of both vehicles were limited as the costs to convert these two cars was far beyond the cars' original values. Its original range is estimated between 20 and 60 miles with a top speed of {{convert|60|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. This idea didn't meet expectations either as these EXPs were lacking both sport and practicality. It's unsure if EVA went on to convert EXPs and Escorts at their own expense.

Many other EXPs would be subject to electric propulsion, but not on Ford's dime. It was a popular competition in colleges, tech schools, and universities to convert smaller cars like EXPs to electric power and then compete against other schools with them. Involved in these competitions were the cars' general performance, endurance, and efficiency.

===EXP ASC/McLaren===
In 1982 [[American Sunroof Company|American Sunroof Company (ASC)]] and McLaren supposedly equipped two EXPs with sunroofs, true notchbacks, ground effects, and charged aspiration. ASC (American Sunroof Corporation) did the cosmetic modifications and McLaren made the performance modifications. One has the following modifications: a supercharger, turbocharger, tighter steering, 1 inch shorter ride height, [[Recaro]] racing seats, TRX suspension, [[KONI Group|KONI]] shocks, twin fuel pumps, fuel injection, machined uprights (for wheel clearance), enhanced power steering, and portion-valved brakes. This EXP ASC McLaren makes 120HP and 137&amp;nbsp;ft/lb of torque. Ford already had their own removable sunroofs optional for all EXPs &amp; LN7s but later (1984-1985) added their own ground effects, "bubblebacks", and spoilers to save money and turbocharged EXPs themselves to make the same amount of power. The other EXP has yet to be spotted.

== Promotional EXPs and LN7s ==
===LN7 Scoundrel 500===
As part of a [[Weinstock's]] promotion a select batch of Mercury LN7s were built with all black interior, purple exterior, and gold pinstripes along the body and within the black bump strips. These LN7s had every available factory option and could only be won by sweepstakes entries (not open to Weinstock's or Ford employees). Along with being awarded an LN7, winners were granted a $1000 gift certificate from Weinstock's. If a winner had already ordered an LN7 they could be refunded in full and their ordered LN7 became the Scoundrel Edition car if they so chose. It's assumed that only 500 of these LN7s were ever made.

===LN7 Budweiser King===
Another promotional sweepstakes event involved some rare LN7 replicas of the Budweiser Race Team's LN7 funny-car in 1982. Grand prize of the drawing was a normal LN7 (provided by Ford Motor Company) painted to perfectly match the real drag strip car, only one model is known to exist and its whereabouts are unknown. First prizes were tickets to two NHRA national events. Second prizes were four go-cart replicas of the Budweiser funny car, eight others were won at select NHRA events. It is unknown how many were made but they were all built by Ford Motor Company with 3hp motors powering them up to 15mph.

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ford LN7 Sweepstakes |url=https://www.ford.com/ |website=Ford Motor Company |publisher=Ford Motor Company |accessdate=April 1, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==GN34==
At least one first-generation EXP was modified as an early "test mule" for the [[Ford SHO V6 engine|3.0 L SHO V6 engine]] co-developed between Ford and [[Yamaha Motor Corporation|Yamaha]] and was part of Ford's GN34 program to develop a mid-engine sports car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McTaggart|first1=Bryan|title=A Stalled Experiment: The Ford GN34 Program|url=https://bangshift.com/general-news/car-features/stalled-experiment-ford-gn34-program/|website=BangShift|accessdate=6 March 2018|date=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some were made RWD with the Yamaha V6 on display in the rear bubble hatch while others were AWD models with the V6 under the hatch as well. Some V6s were punched from 3.0 to 3.2 to 3.4 to 3.6 liters all mated to a ZF-5 transmissions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

It is unknown how many EXP-based test mules were built; later prototypes were custom-built designs.  The GN34 mid-engine sports car was shelved in the late 1980s, with the Ford-Yamaha V6 engine leading to the introduction of the [[Ford Taurus SHO]] sports sedan.

== Motorsport ==

===PPG CART Indy Car Series Pace Car===

===1981 LN7===
One rare Mercury LN7 was also converted specifically for the 1981 PPG CART Indy Car World Series. It featured a dramatic front chin spoiler, brake-cooling ducts just ahead of the rear wheels, 14" Apache-5 aluminum wheels, clear headlight and foglight covers (for aero-speed purposes) and a wrap-around rear spoiler all provided by ASC (American Sunroof Company) and Ford. 

The power plant was an early turbocharged version of the 1.6L CVH built by Jack Roush and Ford's SVO, featuring a reworked version of the Motorcraft 2150 2-barrel carburetor, TRW cold-forged pistons for 8.5:1 compression, magna-fluxed &amp; polished factory connecting rods, ported head with 3-angle valve seats milled down .06", stock camshaft &amp; lifters, European 1.6L CVH head gasket, a turbocharger adding just 8psi (but capable of providing 15psi with race fuel), custom 6qt baffled oil pan, and water-alcohol-injection all adding up to 7,000RPMs (electronically limited) of 180 horsepower (no dyno results were recorded above 8psi of boost). 

The transmission is a factory Escort/Lynx/EXP/LN7 4-speed manual transmission blue-printed with extreme care and tight tolerances at an aircraft level allowing it to handle both the 180 horsepower, 7,000RPMs of input, and top speeds around 125mph.

Suspension also had to be heavily modified to handle 125mph and quick handling of turns. Doing so required a thicker sway-bar, lower ride height, increased spring rate by 15%, Koni shocks all around, and redesigned, fully adjustable rear suspension.

Interior is near factory specifications with the addition multiple warning lights and boost gauge, full roll cage, fuel cell, fire-countermeasures, and ASC/McLaren sport seats with 4-point harnesses.

Outside of the "1982 CART Indy World Series News Media Guide" very few photos of the car exist but it is currently on display in the Roush Racing Museum with the 1982 EXP PPG Pace Car among a few of Ford's GN34 specimens. &lt;ref&gt;1982 CART Indy World Series News Media Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

===1982 EXP===
One rare Ford EXP is one converted specifically serve as a CART Series PPG Indy Car World Series Pace Car in 1982. This car wears a tapered front clip and unique hatch and body-integrated spoiler, both reminiscent of a past EXP prototype. It also is widened at each of the four quarter panels of the car believed to allow room for a Ford-Yamaha SHO V6 in the front or possibly in the rear like the aforementioned GN34 EXP experiment. It is also possible to be host to another 1.6L CVH built and turbocharged by Jack Roush and Ford's SVO. 

Very few photos of the car exist but it is currently on display in the Roush Racing Museum with the 1981 LN7 PPG Pace Car among a few of Ford's GN34 specimens.

===SCCA EXP/LN7===
Ford provided 3 EXP/LN7 cars for [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] competition racing in 1981–1983.

One car was made with PBS. What was previously an LN7 was transformed into a competition race car through fiberglass body parts, racing suspension, and a PBS 2.0L (Ford 1.6L) CVH mated with a 5-speed transmission. 
A second car was made into a competition rally car by Blume Power Inc. for driver "Dick Turner" rumored to be RWD and hosting a V8 under the hood.
The third car was another circuit car like the PBS LN7 but little is known about this racer.

The '''Ford Elite''' is a [[personal luxury car]] produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and marketed in North American from February 1974 to 1976, with the name '''Gran Torino Elite''' used in the first year. Based on the [[Ford Torino|Torino]], the [[mid-size car|mid-size]] two-door [[coupe]] was intended to be a less expensive [[Ford Thunderbird|Thunderbird]] alternative to compete with the increasingly popular intermediate personal luxury class of vehicles such as the [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]], [[Pontiac Grand Prix]], [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]], [[Buick Regal]], [[Dodge Charger]] and [[Chrysler Cordoba]]. It was essentially the concurrent [[Mercury_Cougar#Third_generation_.281974.E2.80.931976.29|Mercury Cougar XR-7]] with a mild front end restyling to resemble the Thunderbird, different taillamps with a center reflector, unique twin opera windows and large color-keyed vinyl moldings placed higher on the bodysides. The interiors were identical save for upholstery styles and minor trim. 

Introduced February 18th, 1974 as the Gran Torino Elite, it was initially the top of the line model of the Torino series. Although advertised separately, it was titled and registered as a Gran Torino.  For 1975 and 1976, the Gran Torino prefix was dropped and Elite became a stand-alone model nameplate. Early pre-production publicity photos for the 1974 model show the use of ''Gran Torino XL'' nameplates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fordimages.com/perl/options.pl?imageID=70508&amp;ckon=click|title=1974 Ford Grand Torino XL|website=fordimages.com|access-date=September 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Elite name was dropped after 1976 because the Ford mid-size range was restructured for the 1977 model year. The Thunderbird was dramatically reduced in size and price for 1977 by moving the nameplate to the Torino-based [[Ford LTD II|LTD II]] platform which replaced the Torino. In effect, the Elite continued restyled and marketed under the more-recognized Thunderbird name, and the previous full-sized Thunderbird was discontinued.

The Elite name was also used in Mexico. The [[Ford Fairmont]] was introduced in Mexico in late 1977 as a 1978 model, replacing the Ford Maverick that was produced there locally. The Futura coupe with its distinctive Thunderbird-styled roofline was never offered in Mexico. Instead there was an uplevel 2-door sedan called the '''Fairmont Elite'''. It was distinguished from other Fairmonts by its higher level of equipment and vinyl roof. It used the four headlight grille from the Fairmont Futura along with Mercury Zephyr taillamps and rear quarter window louvers. For 1981, the Fairmont Elite switched to the Mercury Zephyr grille.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/hugo90/4188189293|title=Ford Fairmont Elite|access-date=September 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For 1982, the Fairmont Elite was renamed '''Ford Elite II''', which was now offered in two- and four-door sedans. It continued to use the body of the Fairmont with the front end of the North American 1982
Ford Granada and matching rear bumper. The rear continued to use Mercury Zephyr taillamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/118029649@N03/sets/72157642809889655|title=Ford Elite II|access-date=September 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 1983 to 1985, a version of the North American Fox platform [[Ford LTD (Americas)#Fourth|Ford LTD]] was manufactured in Venezuela and marketed as the '''Ford Granada Elite''' in uplevel trim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifhp97/34997702801|title=1983 Ford Granada Elite|access-date=September 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ford Fairmont''' is a [[compact car]] that was produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] for the US and Canada markets for the 1978 to 1983 [[model years]].&lt;ref name="catalog2"/&gt; The debut of the Fairmont and its '''Mercury Zephyr''' counterpart marked the launch of the long-running [[Ford Fox platform]] that would underpin twelve additional models and stay in production until 1993. Offered in a variety of body styles, the Fairmont succeeded the [[Ford Maverick (North America)|Ford Maverick]], and was replaced by the front-wheel drive [[Ford Tempo]] for the 1984 model year.

==Background and development==
In April 1973 the American [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] released its comprehensive list of fuel economy results.&lt;ref name="leffingwellbook"/&gt;{{rp|150}}&lt;ref name="epa1"/&gt; In October of the same year the [[1973 oil crisis]] started. At the time Ford's North American product line included the subcompact [[Ford Pinto|Pinto]] and [[Ford Mustang (second generation)|Mustang II]], and the compact Maverick, but replacements for all of these models would soon be needed. At the same time Ford of England's [[Ford Cortina|Cortina]] line was in need of refreshing, as was the [[Ford Taunus|Taunus]] model built by Ford of Germany.&lt;ref name="leffingwellbook"/&gt;{{rp|151}}

Changes were also happening at Ford's executive level, as William O. Bourke, ex-chairman of Ford of Europe and one-time managing director of Ford of Australia, was made executive vice president of North American Operations and Robert Alexander, previously with Ford of Europe as vice president in charge of car development, moved to same position in the States.&lt;ref name="magnantebook"/&gt;{{rp|112}}

Hal Sperlich was vice-president of Product Planning and Research at Ford.&lt;ref name="sperlich"/&gt; A proponent of downsizing, Sperlich conceived of a "World Car" that could be sold in both Europe and North America as a solution to the needs of the various divisions.&lt;ref name="leffingwellbook"/&gt;{{rp|150, 151}}

In December 1973 Ford President Lee Iacocca formally approved development of the Fox platform.&lt;ref name="farrbook"/&gt;{{rp|96}} The name of the platform was borrowed from the [[Audi 80]], sold in the US and Australia as the Audi Fox.&lt;ref name="henshawbook"/&gt;{{rp|257}} Ford's European executives, many now back in the States, considered the 80 their class-leading subcompact competitor and made it the baseline reference for the new platform.&lt;ref name="magnante1001"/&gt;{{rp|165, 166}}

Although the Fairmont would be the first Fox-based car to reach the market, development was guided by an anticipated sport coupe to be based on the new platform.&lt;ref name="farrbook"/&gt;{{rp|99}}

Development started in early 1973 on both a short-wheel base version to replace the Pinto/Cortina/Taunus lines and a long-wheelbase version that would become the Fairmont.&lt;ref name="leffingwellbook"/&gt;{{rp|151}} By 1974 the difficulties faced in meeting the conflicting regulatory requirements in different markets and differing production methods used by the various divisions had killed the world car idea.&lt;ref name="stonebook"/&gt;{{rp|12}} In 1975 North American Automobile Operations took over development of the Fox platform from Sperlich's Product Planning and Research group.

The first running Fox/Fairmont prototype was a modified Cortina with a MacPherson strut and torsion bar front suspension.&lt;ref name="leffingwellbook"/&gt;{{rp|151}}

A Fairmont Futura coupe built on 15 November 1977 at the Mahwah, New Jersey factory was the one-hundred millionth vehicle produced by Ford.&lt;ref name="100mil"/&gt;

A 1980 Fairmont station wagon converted to an electric vehicle by Electric Vehicles Associates Inc. and renamed the ''EVA Current Fare Wagon'' was evaluated by the US Department of Energy from March 1980 to November 1981.&lt;ref name="elec1"/&gt;

==Model overview==
The Ford Fairmont was launched in August 1977 as a 1978 model.&lt;ref name="stuarts" /&gt; The name was first used by Ford in 1965 for the [[Ford Fairmont (Australia)|Australian Fairmont]], an upscale trim level model of the [[Ford Falcon (XP)]], and had also been used in the South African market in 1969.

===Chassis specifications===
The Fairmont is based on the rear-wheel drive Ford Fox platform, using steel [[Vehicle frame#Unibody|unibody]] construction.  The independent front suspension comprised lower lateral arms, [[MacPherson strut]]s, and [[coil springs|helical-wound coil springs]]. In what Ford called a ''modified'' or ''hybrid'' MacPherson strut system, the coil springs were mounted separately from the struts rather than concentrically, being located between the lower arm and front cross-member. A front anti-roll bar was standard equipment. The rear suspension used a [[Beam axle|solid axle]] suspended on coil springs and vertically mounted dampers. The axle was located by four links; two lower trailing arms and two sharply angled upper control arms.

The Fairmont has power-assisted brakes, with 10.0 inch vented front discs and 9.0 x 1.8 inch rear drums.  Standard wheels and tires were 14x5.0 and DR78-14 respectively.&lt;ref name="CDsep77" /&gt;{{rp|32, 33}}  Steering was by a [[Rack and pinion#Steering|rack and pinion]] system with 3.2 turns lock-to-lock.

===Powertrain===
For its entire production run, the standard engine for the Fairmont was a {{convert|140|cuin|L|abbr=on}} inline-4 (shared with the Pinto).  Initially producing 88&amp;nbsp;hp, following several revisions, output rose to 90&amp;nbsp;hp to 1983.  The 2.3L engine was initially paired with a 3-speed manual (replaced by a 4-speed in 1979), with a 3-speed automatic offered as an option.  For 1980 only,&lt;ref name="RT82" /&gt; a 120&amp;nbsp;hp turbocharged version of the 2.3L engine (shared with the Mustang Cobra) was available in Fairmont sedans and coupes.  Examples with the turbocharged engine were distinguished by a center-mounted hood "power bulge".

As an option, a {{convert|200|cuin|L|abbr=on}} inline-6 (shared with the Maverick and [[Ford Granada (North America)|Granada]]) was offered from 1978 to 1983 model years.  While offering less horsepower than the 2.3L inline-4, the 3.3L inline-6 produced significantly more torque.  For 1978, the standard transmission was a 3-speed manual (replaced by a 4-speed for 1979); a 3-speed automatic was offered as an option.

For 1978 to 1981 model years, the Fairmont was offered with two different Windsor V8 engines (shared with mid-size and full-size Ford vehicles).  For 1978 and 1979, a 139&amp;nbsp;hp {{convert|302|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 was offered, replaced by a 115&amp;nbsp;hp {{convert|255|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 for 1980 and 1981.  Both engines were paired exclusively with a 3-speed automatic transmission.

===Body design===
The Fairmont debuted for 1978 with three body configurations; a two-door sedan, a four-door sedan, and a five-door station wagon.  Late in the 1978 model year, a two-door coupe was introduced; named ''Futura'', the name revived the sporty trim level used for the 1960s Ford Falcon.

The Fairmont Futura was developed from a Fairmont-based Thunderbird design proposal from March 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Soaring Spirit: Thirty-five Years of the Ford Thunderbird|last=Katz|first=John F.|publisher=Automotive Quarterly, Inc.|year=1989|isbn=978-0915038671|location=Kutztown, Pennsylvania|pages=[https://archive.org/details/soaringspiritthi00katz/page/44 44]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/soaringspiritthi00katz/page/44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Futura was a two-door coupe distinguished by a model-specific roofline that featured a wrapover B-pillar similar to the [[Ford Thunderbird (seventh generation)|1977–1979 Ford Thunderbird]] but without opera windows. The rear fascia was also given its own wrap-around taillamp design. To further differentiate the Futura from the standard Fairmont, the coupe was fitted with the 4-headlight fascia from the Zephyr, and a cross-hatched grille was used in place of the standard eggcrate grille. For the 1980 model year Ford expanded the Futura nameplate to include a four-door sedan and added a Futura station wagon for 1981.

For 1981, the exterior trim was revised with the addition of a slim molding strip along the side exterior panels; convenience equipment was also increased.  For 1982, several model revisions were made.  Ford moved the Fairmont station wagon to the [[Ford Granada (North America)|Granada]] model line and the Futura trim became the sole trim,&lt;ref name="PMsep81" /&gt; expanding it to the two-door sedan for the first time.  Effectively, this standardized the four-headlight front fascia (of the Futura coupe and Mercury Zephyr).

For 1983, Ford introduced an "S" model of the Fairmont Futura as a base trim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1983_Ford/1983%20Ford%20Fairmont%20Futura%20Brochure/image8.html|title=1983 Ford Fairmont Futura Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sold only as a sedan and only with the 2.3L engine, the radio and right-hand mirror of the Futura S became options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1983_Ford/1983%20Ford%20Fairmont%20Futura%20Brochure/image12.html|title=1983 Ford Fairmont Futura Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discontinuation==

During the early 1980s, Ford undertook a major revision of its product ranges.  As Ford expanded its use of front-wheel drive vehicles into the compact and mid-size segment, the use of the rear-wheel drive Fox platform shifted away from [[family car]]s.  After the 1983 model year, the Fairmont and Zephyr ended production.  Released in 1983 (as early 1984 models), the front-wheel-drive Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz succeeded the Fairmont and Zephyr.

As Ford returned the Ford Blue Oval emblem to North American vehicles in 1983, the Fairmont was the sole model line to use "FORD" badging (as it was in the final year of its model cycle); the Thunderbird (which has its own emblem) never used it on the grille.

==Mercury Zephyr==
{{Hatnote|"Mercury Zephyr" redirects here. Not to be confused with [[Lincoln-Zephyr]], [[Ford Zephyr]], or [[Lincoln MKZ|Lincoln Zephyr]].}}
From the 1978 to 1983 model years, the '''Mercury Zephyr''' served as the Mercury counterpart of the Ford Fairmont, as a replacement for the Maverick-based [[Mercury Comet|Comet]]. The third vehicle to use the nameplate within Ford Motor Company, the Mercury Zephyr shares its nameplate with the 1936–1940 [[Lincoln-Zephyr]] and the 1950–1972 [[Ford Zephyr]] (produced by [[Ford of Britain]]). Within the Mercury line, the Zephyr was slotted between the Bobcat (replaced for 1981 by the [[Ford Escort (North America)|Lynx]]) and the [[Mercury Monarch|Monarch]] (replaced for 1981 by the [[Mercury Cougar|Cougar]]).

Alongside the Fairmont, the Zephyr was produced as two-door and four-door sedans, a five-door station wagon, and a two-door coupe (the Zephyr Z-7). Externally, the Zephyr shared design elements from Mercury vehicles of the early 1980s (including the Lynx, [[Mercury Capri|Capri]], Cougar, and [[Mercury Marquis|Marquis]]), including a waterfall-style grille, horizontally-ribbed taillamps, and (non-functional) front fender vents. At its launch, the Zephyr was distinguished by four headlights (shared only with the Fairmont Futura); for 1980, the headlight configuration was standardized for both the Fairmont and Zephyr.

Initially offered in standard, ES (a successor to the ESS trim of the Monarch), and Ghia trims, for 1981, both were replaced by GS trim (the equivalent of Futura on non-coupe Fairmonts). In line with other Mercury vehicles, a Villager woodgrained station wagon was produced.

At the beginning of the 1980s, the Zephyr was gradually phased out of the Mercury model line. Mercury shifted both the 4.2-liter V8 engine and the station wagon to the Cougar for the 1982 model year. As Mercury transitioned its model line to front-wheel drive, the Zephyr was replaced by the [[Mercury Topaz]], introduced as an early 1984 model.

Following its use by Mercury, the Zephyr name was used by Lincoln a second time, for the 2006 Lincoln Zephyr. For 2007, the Zephyr was renamed the [[Lincoln MKZ]] as part of the use of "MK" nameplates by Lincoln.

==Variants==

===Ford Durango===
[[File:Ford Durango Side.jpg|thumb|1981 Ford Durango]]
{{main|Ford Durango}}

The [[Ford Durango]] was produced by a joint venture between Ford and National Coach Corporation in 1981. Based heavily on the Fairmont Futura coupe, the Durango was a two-door, two-seat car-based pickup truck that was intended as a possible replacement for the 1977–1979 [[Ford Ranchero]] as well as a competitor to the downsized Chevrolet El Camino/GMC Caballero. Approximately 200 are estimated to have been produced.

===European Sport Option===
The ''European Sport Option'' was an appearance and suspension package offered in 1978 through 1980. It is abbreviated "ES Option" or "ESO". Exterior changes included a black grille, black cowl grille, deluxe bumpers, black window frames, black exterior mirrors, black C-pillar ventilation louvers, bright belt moldings and turbine wheel covers. The interior featured black carpeting, a black three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel, black instrument panel with gray engine-turned trim and black or chamois-colored seats. The running gear was modified with stiffer springs, re-valved shocks, and a rear anti-roll bar. The ESO mounted DR78-14 radial tires on 5.5 inch wheels, one half inch wider than stock.&lt;ref name="CDsep77"/&gt;{{rp|32}}&lt;ref name="MTjun78"/&gt;{{rp|33}}

===Police and Taxicab packages===
In 1978 Ford also made available specially prepared Fairmonts suitable for use as police cars and taxicabs. Initially the only engines offered for these applications were the 200 cubic inch inline six or the 302 V8.&lt;ref name="police"/&gt; Ford's product literature lists the following special features for both packages:

* Automatic transmission with first-gear lockout
* Externally-mounted transmission oil cooler
* Power brakes
* Heavy-duty body construction with extra reinforcements
* Heavy-duty suspension package (Police or Taxi), including higher-rate springs, hardened spindles, special shocks and struts
* Cooling package with high fin-density radiator
* Heavy-duty 14 x 5.5 inch wheels

In later years the naturally-aspirated 2.3L inline four engine became available as well.

A few turbo four-door automatic sedans were used for testing by the California Highway Patrol.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Other markets==
[[File:Ford Fairmont Wagon -- Front.jpg|thumb|Ford Fairmont Squire (Mexico)]]
[[File:Ford Fairmont Wagon -- Rear.jpg|thumb|Ford Fairmont Squire (Mexico)]]

===Mexico===
The Ford Fairmont was introduced in Mexico in late 1977 as a 1978 model, replacing the Ford Maverick that was produced there locally. The Mexican Fairmont was available exclusively with the 5.0 L engine (302) with manual and three-speed automatic transmissions. It was offered as a two- or four-door sedan and a wagon. The Futura coupe with its distinctive Thunderbird-style roofline was never offered in Mexico. Instead there was an uplevel two-door sedan called the '''Fairmont Elite'''. It was distinguished from other Fairmonts by its higher level of equipment and vinyl roof. It used the four headlight grille from the Fairmont Futura along with the Mercury Zephyr's taillamps and rear quarter window louvers.
For 1981, all versions of the Fairmont got four headlights. The regular Fairmont continued to use the Futura grille while the Fairmont Elite used the Mercury Zephyr grille.&lt;ref name="flickr1"/&gt;

For 1982 the Fairmont Elite was renamed the '''Ford Elite II''', and was offered in both two- and four-door sedans. The Elite II used the entire front end and matching rear bumper from the 1982 North American Ford Granada. The base Fairmont adapted the Mercury Zephyr grille used on the previous Elite.&lt;ref name="flickr2"/&gt;

For 1983, the Fairmont received a new 3.8 L [[Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)|Essex]] V6 engine which was sold in addition to the existing V8. This was the last year of the Fairmont as it was replaced later by the Ford Topaz which was a hybrid assembly of the Mercury Topaz with a Ford Tempo front end.

===Venezuela===
A version of the Fairmont was manufactured in Venezuela where it was sold as the Ford Zephyr.&lt;ref name="flickr3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="flickr4"/&gt; The Ford Futura was also sold as an individual model without Fairmont badging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinterest.com/pin/567453621788771648/|title=1981 Ford Futura (Venezuela)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=December 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Clear}}

==Reception==
Contemporary reviews were generally favorable, with many commenting on the "European" feel of the car and comparing it to the [[Volvo 200 series]].&lt;ref name="CDsep77"/&gt;{{rp|27}}&lt;ref name="MTjun78" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RTjan78" /&gt;

The 1978 Fairmont has been called the "most efficient Ford family (sedan) ever built from a space-per-weight perspective."&lt;ref name="magnantebook" /&gt;{{rp|112}}

==Motorsports==
In 1978 [[Bob Glidden]] campaigned an NHRA Pro Stock Futura powered by a [[Ford 335 engine|Cleveland V8]]. The car won its debut race on 8 July 1978 at the Edgewater Winston Championship Series, where it also set a national record. Additional wins followed at the NHRA Grandnational, U.S. Nationals, Fall Nationals, World Finals and Beech Bend WCS. Glidden won his third national championship title with the car. The Futura was retired at the end of the 1978 season.&lt;ref name="magnantebook"/&gt;

The '''Ford Custom''' is an [[automobile]] which was produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in the United States, Canada and Australia in certain years from 1949 to 1981.

==Custom and Custom 300 (1957-1959)==
The Custom name returned for the 1957 model year along with a new Custom 300 series,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1957_Ford/1957_Ford_Full_Line_Brochure/1957%20Ford%20Brochure-02.html&lt;/ref&gt; these two models sitting below the [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Fairlane]] and Fairlane 500.&lt;ref name="John Gunnell 1975, page 397"&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975, Revised 4th Edition, page 397&lt;/ref&gt; The base Custom was the bottom-rung model, whose primary customers were fleet buyers. The Custom 300 was a step up and intended for value-conscious customers. The Custom and Custom 300 generally replaced the fleet-oriented Mainline and mid-range [[Customline]], respectively, from 1956.

The Custom 300 became the base model for 1958,&lt;ref&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975, Revised 4th Edition, page 399&lt;/ref&gt; but was dropped from the range for 1960.&lt;ref&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975, Revised 4th Edition, page 403&lt;/ref&gt;

==Custom and Custom 500 (1964-1981)==
[[File:1968 Ford Custom 500 390 four-door sedan, f left.jpg|thumb|right|1968 Custom 500 sedan]]
[[File:1968 Ford Custom 500 390 four-door sedan, r left.jpg|thumb|right|1968 Custom 500 sedan]]
From 1960 to 1963, the "Custom" and number-affixated variant nameplates were absent from the lineup, replaced by either Fairlane or base Galaxie models.  Base 1963 Fords were badged "[[Ford 300]]."

The Custom nameplate reappeared in 1964, once again on the economy line of models. As in 1957 and 1958, the Custom range consisted of two series: a base Custom range and a slightly better-trimmed Custom 500 series.&lt;ref&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975, Revised 4th Edition, page 413&lt;/ref&gt; Most Customs were sold to police and taxi fleets during the 1960s - although anyone who wanted basic, no-frills transportation in a full-sized car could purchase one - while the Custom 500 was marketed toward budget-conscious buyers who wanted a low-cost automobile but not a stripped model. Generally, the Custom 500 models were differentiated from their less-expensive stablemates by chrome fender trim, roof drip moldings, carpeting (although by the late 1960s, even base Customs had carpeting), upgraded cloth-and-vinyl upholstery, and minor convenience items.

Most Customs and Custom 500s were fitted either with a base inline six-cylinder engine or a small-block V8 engine (289 cid in the early years, up to 351 by the mid- to late-1970s&lt;ref name=Odin&gt;Odin, L.C. ''A concise guide to the Ford and Mercury full-size automobile production 1969-1978''. Belvedere Publishing, 2016. ASIN: B01HE91Y4K.&lt;/ref&gt;), although the full range of V8 engines, up to the 425-horsepower 427 V8, and transmissions (from overdrive and 4-speed manual to SelectShift automatic) were available for law enforcement and performance-oriented customers who wanted the lightest car possible. As late as 1972, a powertrain combination of a six-cylinder engine and three-speed manual transmission was standard on the Custom and Custom 500 range; all V8-powered Customs had SelectShift made standard for the 1972 model year.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt; Six cylinder engines and manual transmissions were dropped in 1973 due to the added weight of newly mandated 5 MPH numpers; all full-sized Fords from 1973 onward, including the Custom 500, had a V8 engine (351 cubic inches at its smallest) and SelectShift transmission standard.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;

The Custom was dropped after the 1972 model year,&lt;ref&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975, Revised 4th Edition, page 440&lt;/ref&gt; while the Custom 500 continued. For 1975, all full-size Fords were consolidated around the LTD nameplate, but the Custom 500 was brought back a few months into the model year. From 1976 onward it was only available in the US for fleet customers.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt; The Custom 500 continued to be sold to retail customers in Canada and the nameplace was used there through 1981. In the United States, the Custom 500 was replaced on the new downsized Panther vehicles by the [[Ford LTD (Americas)|LTD "S."]]

The companion station wagon series sold with Custom and Custom 500 trim was the [[Ford Ranch Wagon|Ranch Wagon]].&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt; Like the coupe and sedan models, these cars were intended for fleet buyers.

===1979–1981 (Canada only)===
The 1979 Custom 500 for the Canadian market was completely redesigned with the advent of the [[Ford LTD (Americas)#Panther-platform .281979.E2.80.931982.29|Panther platform]], and had the base-model 1979 Ford LTD front end (with single rectangular headlights and inboard parking lights on a grille distinct from the upper-trimmed LTD Landau/Crown Victoria). The standard powertrain in 1979 was a {{convert|302|cuin|L|0|abbr=on}} V8 with SelectShift transmission, while a {{convert|351|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford Windsor engine#351W|Windsor]] V8 was optional. For 1980, to meet [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy|CAFE]] standards, a {{convert|255|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 was made standard, with the 302 and 351 V8 engines optional.

===Production===
Approximately 7,850,000 full-size Fords and Mercurys were sold over 1969-78.&lt;ref name="kowalke1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kowalke|first=Ron|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975|year=1997|publisher=Krause publications|isbn=0-87341-521-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/standardcatalogo00beve}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flammang, James 1999"&gt;Flammang, James ''Standard Catalog of American Cars 1976–1999 3rd Edition'' (Iola, WI: Krause Publications, Inc 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it the tenth best selling [[automobile platform]] in history.

==Ford Custom in film==
Marion Crane, played by [[Janet Leigh]], traded a black 1956 Ford for a white 1957 Ford Custom in the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film 
[[Psycho (1960 film)|''Psycho'']]. The final shot in the film depicts the car being removed from a swamp, where it was submerged after Crane’s murder. 

A Ford Custom 500 was used as the family car in ''[[The Wonder Years]]'' from mid-Season 3 onwards

A brown 1971 Custom 500 4-door sedan with a blue interior, equipped with a 429 Police Interceptor/Cobra Jet engine and black steel wheels with [[Cooper Tire Wide Runner]] Polyglas tires, appeared in the 1973 [[Burt Reynolds]] film ''[[White Lightning (1973 film)|White Lightning]]'' and is perhaps the most famous Custom 500 ever. Unusually, scenes of the movie depict the cars (several were wrecked during filming, including the barge jumping scene) with either a manual or automatic transmissions.

==Australian production==
The Ford Custom Fordor was produced in [[Australia]] from September 1949,&lt;ref name=Darwin&gt;Norm Darwin, The History of Ford in Australia, 1986, page 125&lt;/ref&gt; and Australian content on the locally produced Custom had reached 80% by 1950.&lt;ref name=Darwin/&gt; A [[coupe utility]] variant was also offered by Ford Australia, initially as the Ford Coupe Utility,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/Australia-2/Ford/1949-Ford-Coupe-Utility-Brochure 1949 ''Ford Coupe Utility Foldout'', www.oldcarbrochures.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215071543/http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/Australia-2/Ford/1949-Ford-Coupe-Utility-Brochure |date=2015-02-15 }} Retrieved on 15 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and later as the Ford De Luxe Coupe Utility.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifhp97/4468489191/in/gallery-50415738@N04-72157625616233265/ ''1951 Ford DeLuxe Coupe Utility (Aus)'' (advertisement), www.flickr.com] Retrieved on 15 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1959 model North American Custom 300 was also produced by [[Ford Australia]] from September 1959.&lt;ref name=RestoredCars&gt;The Australian 1959-60 Ford Fairlane, Restored Cars, No 84 (July 1990), pages 4-6&lt;/ref&gt; Offered only as a four-door sedan and only with a {{convert|332|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine, it was given a mild makeover in late 1960 which included the grille design from the 1959 [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Ford Meteor (Canada)|Meteor]].&lt;ref name=RestoredCars/&gt; The facelifted model continued in production through to 1962.&lt;ref name=RestoredCars/&gt;

The '''Ford Del Rio''' is a [[full-size car|full-size]], six-passenger&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1957_Ford/1957_Ford_Full_Line_Brochure/1957%20Ford%20Brochure-05.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1957_Ford/1957_Ford_Full_Line_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[station wagon]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1946"&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975|publisher=krause publications|isbn=0-87341-027-0|editor=Gunnell, John A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in the United States for model years 1957 and 1958. The model was also marketed under the name '''Del Rio Ranch Wagon'''.

==Description==
The impetus for the creation of the Del Rio was Ford’s desire to remain in the two-door sport wagon market started by the [[Chevrolet Nomad]] and [[Pontiac Safari]] and the decision to discontinue the company’s original attempt at a sport wagon, the premium [[Ford Parklane|Parklane]], which failed to entice buyers during 1956, its only year in production. Four-way power seats were available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1958_Ford/1958_Ford_Wagons_Brochure/1958%20Ford%20Wagon%20Brochure-17.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1958_Ford/1958_Ford_Wagons_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Nomad was Chevrolet’s most expensive model, offering a premium vehicle with a show car-inspired body style, the Del Rio was strictly based on an existing product, the utilitarian two-door Ranch Wagon, Ford’s least expensive station wagon, as part of the Custom 300 series.&lt;ref name="flory2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Flory, Jr.|first=J. "Kelly"|title=American Cars, 1946-1959 Every Model Every Year|year=2008|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers|isbn=978-0-7864-3229-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the basic body, buyers of the Del Rio were offered a unique two-tone paint scheme (optional), better quality interior and exterior brightwork (including gold [[anodized aluminum]] accents) and a higher grade [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] upholstery. Del Rio buyers also had their choice of either Ford’s “Mileage Maker” 144&amp;nbsp;hp six or its [[Ford Thunderbird (first generation)#1957|“Thunderbird”]] 215&amp;nbsp;hp, 312 cubic inch (5.1 litre) displacement [[Ford Y-block engine#312|Y-Block]] V-8.  The Del Rio was equipped with 11-inch front drum brakes.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1958"/&gt;

Like all other Ford station wagons at that time, the Del Rio used a two-piece tailgate – a feature that dealers emphasized was an advantage over GM’s steeply raked rear gate and self-storing window, which were known for water leaks in heavy rains.

While the Ford sold more Del Rios in 1957 (46,105) than Chevrolet did with its Nomad in its three years of production, Ford terminated the Del Rio program at the end of the 1958 model year after selling only 12,687 of its "sport wagons".

Ford didn't entirely abandon the concept of a two-door station wagon, and used a smaller version with the all-new [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]] in 1960, offered in multiple bodystyles, including a two-door station wagon.

The original '''Ford Pampa''' is a [[coupe utility]] manufactured by [[Ford do Brasil]] between 1982 and 1997. It was derived from the [[Ford Corcel]] and [[Ford Del Rey]], and was the best-selling coupe utility in Brazil for several years.

The Ford Pampa was replaced by the [[Ford Fiesta|Fiesta]]-based [[Ford Courier]] in the small pickup market of South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Ford Courier F1: Pickups come in small packages too | publisher =Ford Motor Company | date =1998-01-07 | url =http://media.ford.com/newsroom/release_display.cfm?release=606 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The launch==
In 1982, Ford do Brasil launched the pickup based on the Ford Corcel II. It was the second such vehicle in the segment, then after the Fiat Fiorino (known at the time as the City), pickup derived from the [[Fiat 147]]. The name Pampa alludes to a horse that has the body all threshed. The Pampa had the comfort of a car in the cabin, but the robustness of a utility vehicle with a more superior load capacity than its smaller competitor. It had the front of a Corcel II and a loading bay inspired by the much larger US-style [[Ford F-Series fifth generation|F-100]] pickup of the time. The difference between the Fiat pickup and the Ford is that the former used the same independent back suspension of Fiat 147, whereas the Ford had a rigid rear axle and adopted semielliptical springs in place of coil springs, more suitable for carrying heavy loads. Due to its success, other brands soon followed suit in launching their own derivatives, Volkswagen with the [[Volkswagen Saveiro|Saveiro]] (appearing in the same year, it was derived from the [[Volkswagen Gol]] hatchback) and Chevrolet with [[Chevrolet Chevy 500|Chevy 500]] (derived from the Chevette) in 1983.

==Technical specifications==
Using the same 1.6-liter engine and a four- or five-speed manual gearbox from the Corcel, came with the differential of Corcel 1:4 to better use to advantage the force of the engine. It also had the front suspension of the Corcel, with stiffer springs and shock absorbers to support bigger loads. Thus, the Pampa was perfect for the transport of loads up to {{Convert|620|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}.  With regard to the Corcel, the [[wheelbase]] was also increased. The fuel tank in the Pampa was soon moved to behind the cabin, and its doors were made smaller - identical to the ones of the four-door Ford Del Rey.  With the 1.6 engine, the Pampa developed {{Convert|66|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, perfect for the transport of the most varied loads and {{Convert|69|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with the model which ran on alcohol. The Pampa pickup had very good general performance. Its maximum speed was of {{Convert|100|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and its fuel tank had a 76-liter capacity. The Pampa’s options included a digital clock, air conditioning, adjustable head restraints, radio, and inertia reel seat belts. Many of these items were found in the luxurious Del Rey.

==1984-model revisions==
Revisions for the 1984 model year included the Pampa receiving the CHT engine which was more powerful and economical. The 1.6-liter CHT engine developed {{Convert|75|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in alcohol form and the petrol version {{Convert|73|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, giving the Pampa a maximum speed of {{Convert|160|or|156|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, respectively. Also for the 1984 model year, a 4x4 version was launched, which would be only Brazilian pickup derived from a two-wheel drive car to be offered with four-wheel drive. Externally, the 4x4 Pampa had few differences compared with the 4x2 version; the 4x4 had squared-off grating in the grille, off-road tires, free-wheeling wheel hubs, and over-riders on the bumpers.

==1986-model revisions==
In 1986, L and GL models were introduced and Pampa models received the front from the 4x4 version. For the 1987 model year, the Pampa got the new front from the Del the Rey and the Ghia version was added to the range with the luxury equipment of the Del Rey Ghia, including electric windows. However, air conditioning was only an optional extra. For the Pampa in 1989, the larger VW AP-1800 engine became available for the L, GL, and Ghia versions, although the 1.6-liter CHT engine remained in the L and GL 4x4 versions. For 1991, the S version arrived, with the same 1.8-liter motor as the Gol GTS and Escort XR3. This was more powerful and quicker, enabling a top speed of {{Convert|106|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Standard equipment included side rubbing strakes, a dipping rear view mirror, optional hydraulic power-assisted steering, alloy wheels, front spoiler with integral fog lights and items which were standard on the Ghia version.

==1992-model revisions and final production==
In 1992, the Pampa received another new front, identical to the Del Rey, which had been discontinued in 1991. In 1994, it received an electronically controlled carburettor (2E CE) in the 1.8-liter versions, following the alterations to the VW AP-1800 unit. In 1995, the Ghia and 1.6 L GL 4x4 were discontinued, leaving the 1.6- and 1.8-liter L, 1.8-liter GL, and 1.8-liter S. For the 1997 model year, the 1.8-liter engines were equipped with single-point electronic fuel injection. By the end of production in 1997, in excess of 350,000 units had been sold. The replacement, the Ford Courier, never achieved the same sales success.

The '''Ford Excursion''' is a [[Pickup truck#Heavy Duty pickup trucks|heavy duty]] ([[Truck classification#Class 2|Class 2]]), [[Sport utility vehicle#Extended-length SUV|extended-length sport utility vehicle]] that was produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]].  The longest and heaviest SUV ever to enter mass production, the Excursion was marketed as a direct competitor of the 2500-series (&lt;big&gt;¾&lt;/big&gt;-ton) [[Chevrolet Suburban#Ninth generation (2000–2006)|Chevrolet Suburban/GMC Yukon XL]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=November 1999|editor-last=McCosh|editor-first=Dan|title=Big, bigger, biggest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RsHqYbQ6maEC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=Ford+Excursion+is+the+biggest+sport-utility+on+the+planet|journal=Popular Science|volume=255|issue=5|page=48|accessdate=2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Introduced for the 2000 model year, a single generation was produced through the 2005 model year (a short 2006 production run was made for Mexico).     

Derived from the [[Ford Super Duty|F-250 Super Duty]] pickup truck, the Ford Excursion was marketed primarily in North America; a limited number were sold for export.  Following the discontinuation of the Excursion, Ford introduced the extended-length [[Ford Expedition#Expedition EL/Max|Ford Expedition EL/MAX]]; while matching the Chevrolet Suburban in terms of size, the Expedition EL/MAX shifted its chassis commonality from the Super Duty to the F-150.  As of current production, Ford has not produced another SUV derived from the Super Duty model line.  

Throughout its production, the Ford Excursion was assembled at the [[Kentucky Truck Plant]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] alongside Super Duty pickup trucks; the final example was produced on September 30, 2005.

==Origin==
For 1978, Ford introduced the second-generation [[Ford Bronco#Second generation (1978–1979)|Ford Bronco]].  To compete directly against the [[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|Chevrolet K5 Blazer/GMC Jimmy]] and [[Dodge Ramcharger]], the Bronco became a full-size SUV, adopting the chassis and powertrain of the F-100 pickup truck (lowering its production costs); continuing the most popular design of its predecessor, the second-generation Bronco was produced strictly as a three-door wagon (with a lift-off hardtop).      

After the 1975 discontinuation of the [[International Harvester Travelall]], the Suburban became the sole full-size SUV produced in a four-door bodystyle (far larger than the [[Jeep Wagoneer (SJ)|Jeep Wagoneer]]).  During the 1980s and early 1990s, four-door Broncos were developed; in place of production vehicles, a limited number of license-built conversions (mating a Bronco body with F-Series crew cabs) were sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-american/curbside-classic-ford-classic-350-centurion-vehicles-creates-a-frankenstein-suburban-fighter/|title=Curbside Classic: Ford Classic 350 – Centurion Vehicles Creates A Frankenstein Suburban Fighter|last=Snitkoff|first=Edward|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160228070650/http://news.boldride.com/2015/11/ford-bronco-rare-centurion-classic/94489/|title=This is the 4-Door Ford Bronco You Didn’t Know Existed|date=2016-02-28|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ford produced its first four-door SUV for 1991, as the [[Ford Explorer#First generation (1991–1994)|Ford Explorer]] replaced the [[Ford Bronco II|Bronco II]]; both model lines were derived from the compact [[Ford Ranger (Americas)|Ranger]] pickup truck.     

For 1997, the Ford Bronco was replaced by the [[Ford Expedition]]; coinciding with changing segment demands, the Expedition was offered solely as a five-door wagon.  While changing its body configuration, the Expedition retained model commonality with the F-Series with its Bronco predecessor.  Sized between the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] and Suburban, the Expedition was fitted with three-row seating (offered by the Suburban).        

For 1999, Ford expanded the F-Series model range, with the F-250 and F-350 becoming the Super Duty series.  Intended for work usage and towing, Super Duty F-Series trucks received a heavier-duty chassis and suspension along with a distinct body design.  To compete against the 2500-series Suburban, Ford began development of a heavy-duty SUV derived from the F-250 Super Duty pickup truck.     

==Design overview==

===Chassis===
The Ford Excursion was produced sharing the platform architecture of the [[Ford Super Duty|F-250 Super Duty]] pickup truck. Sharing quite a bit of its chassis components and dimensions with the F-250 Super Cab, 8' Bed. The Excursion shares a common width, wheelbase, and front/rear track width with its F-250 counterpart. Other shared assemblies include the front and most of the rear suspension (the leaf springs and front spring hanger bracket were specific to the Excursion), along with the steering gear. From where the front sway bar mounts to the frame, back,is specific to the Excursion. And from this point back the frame is a little taller and much wider than its F-250 cousin.  The rear axle for all Excursions was a [[Sterling 10.5 axle]]. The [[four wheel drive]] models were equipped with a NV273 [[transfer case]] and [[Dana 50]] front axle. Gear ratios of 3:73 and 4:30 were offered.

During the development of the chassis, Ford learned that its initial design caused smaller vehicles (such as a [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|Ford Taurus]]) to become severely overridden in a head-on collision. In the test, the tire of the Excursion drove up to the windshield of the Taurus (reducing the chance of survival for its driver).&lt;ref name="bradsher"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/highmightydan00brad|url-access=registration|title=High and mighty: the dangerous rise of the SUV|last=Bradsher|first=Keith|publisher=PublicAffairs|year=2004|isbn=978-1-58648-203-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/highmightydan00brad/page/199 199]|accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a response, Ford modified the chassis to include an under-bumper "blocker beam"; the device was initially tested by the French transportation ministry in 1971.&lt;ref name="bradsher" /&gt; For the rear of the chassis, Ford chose to include a trailer hitch as standard equipment in production to reduce underriding in rear-end collisions by smaller vehicles.

==== Powertrain ====
During its entire production, the Excursion was offered with both gasoline and diesel engines.  The standard engine was a 5.4L Triton V8 with a 6.8L V10 offered as an option.  At its launch, the optional diesel engine was the Navistar-produced 7.3L Powerstroke V8; a 6.0L V8 was introduced during 2003, retaining the Powerstroke name.

All four engines were paired with an automatic transmission.  The 4-speed 4R100 automatic was fitted to the 5.4., 6.8, and 7.3L engines, with a 5-speed 5R110W automatic fitted to the 6.0L engine.  

Though using the &lt;big&gt;¾&lt;/big&gt;-ton chassis of the F-250, the Excursion was rated with a [[Gross vehicle weight rating|GVWR]] of {{convert|8900|lb|abbr=on}} when equipped with gasoline engines and {{convert|9200|lb|abbr=on}} with equipped with diesel engines.  As its GVWR was above {{convert|8500|lb|abbr=on|}}, the Excursion was exempt from EPA fuel economy ratings; reviewers cited fuel economy in the range of 12-15mpg with the V10 gasoline engine.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/vehicles/new/reviews/2000/lweitzman_ford_excursion_2000.html |title=The Ford Excursion, It doesn't get any Bigger |first=Larry |last=Weitzman |publisher=Theautochannel.com|year=2000 |accessdate=2012-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While its GVWR exempted it from emissions standards applied to light-duty vehicles, Ford designed the powertrains of the Excursion to meet [[United States vehicle emission standards#Phase 1: 1994–1999|low-emissions vehicle]] (LEV) status.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.klik.com.my/item/story/479106/ford-excursion-makes-a-grand-debut|title=Ford Excursion makes a grand debut {{!}} KLiK|website=www.klik.com.my|access-date=2020-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Body design===
While the Ford Expedition shared design influences from the popular Ford Explorer, the Excursion adopted a high degree of commonality from its F-250 Super Duty counterpart.  With the exception of its eggcrate grille (styled similar to the Ford Expedition and the third-generation Explorer), the front bodywork and two front doors are shared entirely with the Super Duty pickups, the rear doors are very similar to the Super Duty Crew Cab doors, but have more of a curve on the back side edge, thus being specific to the Excursion.  Styled similar to the Bronco (with flush-mounted glass), the Excursion is fitted with a third-row seat and rear cargo area behind the second-row door; dependent on configuration, the vehicle could accommodate to nine passengers.  In place of a conventional liftgate, the cargo door was configured as a 3-way design, pairing an upper liftgate with two lower dutch doors (similar to the 1992-2005 [[Chevrolet Astro]]); the taillamps were sourced from the E-Series van. 

During its production, the Excursion saw few major changes to its interior or exterior.  For 2002, the instrument panel was updated, receiving a digital odometer.  For 2005, the eggcrate grille was replaced by the three-bar grille used on Super Duty trucks.

Coinciding with its design commonality with the Ford Super Duty crew cab, the Excursion is among one of the only mass-produced SUVs ever produced with four full-length passenger doors (along with the Expedition MAX and Lincoln Navigator L, the Chevrolet Suburban and its GMC and Cadillac counterparts, and the [[International Harvester Travelall|International Travelall]]).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Trim ===
The Excursion adopted the trim nomenclature adopted across Ford light trucks in North America. The base trim was XL (marketed nearly exclusively for fleet sales), XLT (standard trim in retail markets), and Limited (highest trim line). Following its use across many Ford light trucks, an Eddie Bauer trim package was introduced for the Excursion for 2003 (differing from the Limited primarily in appearance). 

'''XLT''': Included three rows of seating, leather-wrapped steering wheel with speed control, a security system, keyless entry, {{convert|16|inch|abbr=on|cm}} chrome steel rims or optional alloy rims, trailer towing, and an AM/FM radio with cassette and single-disc CD player with six premium speakers, and air conditioning.

'''Limited''': Included same features as XLT, but adds a power driver's seat, rear audio controls, illuminated running boards, {{convert|16|in|abbr=on|cm}} alloy rims, front-speed sensitive windshield wipers, five power points, ten cupholders, heated front seats, leather seats, and an optional rear entertainment system with DVD player.

==Reception==
For its 2000 model year launch, the Ford Excursion was described by [[Popular Science]] as the "biggest sport utility on the planet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=RsHqYbQ6maEC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=Ford+Excursion+is+the+biggest+sport-utility+on+the+planet |title=Big, bigger, biggest |journal=Popular Science |date=November 1999 |volume=255 |issue=5 |page=48 |accessdate=2012-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  2000 would be the most successful model year for the Excursion, with nearly 69,000 examples sold.  After largely meeting sales projections at its launch&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;, demand for the model line was affected by the [[2000s energy crisis|energy crisis of the 2000s]].  While able to produce 70,000 examples yearly&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;, sales from 2001 onward struggled to reach half of that capacity, becoming the lowest-selling SUV sold by Ford or Lincoln-Mercury.      

The large size of the Excursion led to it being dubbed the ''Ford Valdez'' by [[Sierra Club|The Sierra Club]] in 1999 (in reference to the [[Exxon Valdez]] supertanker).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sdearthtimes.com/et0399/et0399s4.html|title=ET 3/99: Ford's new gas-guzzling SUV wins the "Exxon Valdez" award from the Sierra Club|website=www.sdearthtimes.com|access-date=2020-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, [[TIME Magazine]] selected it as one of the ''Fifty Worst Cars of All Time''.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1658545_1658544_1658538,00.html|title=The 50 Worst Cars of All Time - TIME|date=2007-09-07|work=Time|access-date=2020-03-07|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==

===F-250 Tropivan===
From 1998 to 2012, a second-party SUV conversion of the Ford F-250 was sold in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Avaliação NA – F-250 Tropivan |url= https://www.noticiasautomotivas.com.br/avaliacao-na-f-250-tropivan/ |website=Notícias Automotivas |language=pt-BR |date=13 December 2010 |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar in design and layout to the Excursion, the F-250 Tropivan differed primarily in its being a second-party conversion (similar to the Centurion Classic). In contrast to the Excursion, two different wheelbases of the model were produced.

As with all Super Duty trucks in Brazil, the Tropivan had a different engine selection throughout its production run that included a 4.2&amp;nbsp;L Essex gasoline V6 and two diesels: a 3.9&amp;nbsp;L Cummins B-series and the 4.2&amp;nbsp;L straight-6 MWM Sprint 6.07TCA.

===Aftermarket===
During and since its production, the Excursion has become a basis for several types of aftermarket vehicles.  As a result of its body commonality with the Super Duty model range, the bodywork of the Excursion led to aftermarket conversions of Ford medium-duty truck chassis (Ford F-650 and F-750) to SUVs; to accommodate the longer wheelbase, the body typically is fitted with an extra set of doors.  At the other end of the size scale, the [[Hennessey Performance Engineering#VelociRaptor SUV|Hennessey VelociRaptor SUV]] was created by mating the rear bodywork of the Excursion with the bodywork of the first-generation [[Ford Raptor]] (a practice similar to the creation of the 1990s Centurion Classic C350).  Other conversions involve fitting 2000-2005 Excursions with the front fascias of 2006-2016 Super Duty pickup trucks (as the Excursion shares its chassis with the F-250).   

The Excursion also served as a basis for stretch limousines; coinciding with its heavier-duty chassis, many examples were stretched (unofficially) longer than the 120-inch limit imposed by Ford on the Lincoln Town Car sedan.

The '''Ford Explorer Sport Trac''' (also shortened to '''Ford Sport Trac''') is a [[pickup truck]] which was manufactured and marketed by [[Ford Motor Company]] for the North American market. The first mid-size pickup truck produced by Ford, the Sport Trac was marketed from the 2001 to the 2010 model years (skipping the 2006 model year). Sized between the Ranger (whose crew cab variants were sold outside of North America) and the F-150, the Sport Trac largely competed against crew-cab variants of the [[Chevrolet Colorado|Chevrolet Colorado/GMC Canyon]], [[Dodge Dakota]], [[Nissan Frontier]], and [[Toyota Tacoma]].      

Produced over two generations, the Ford Explorer Sport Trac shared its chassis and much of its body from the [[Ford Explorer]] SUV (with the pickup truck bed designed specifically for the model line). All production was sourced from the [[Louisville Assembly Plant]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] (taking the place of the Ford Ranger). 

As Ford developed the fifth-generation Ford Explorer SUV for the 2011 model year, the Sport Trac was phased out of the model line, with production ending in October 2010.  Closely matching the Sport Trac in size, the [[Ford Ranger (fourth generation)|fourth-generation Ford Ranger]] serves the same market function in its SuperCrew four-door crew cab configuration.

Introduced in February 2000 as an early 2001 model, the Ford Explorer Sport Trac was introduced. While marketed as a variant of the Ford Explorer SUV model line, the Sport Trac was functionally a crew-cab mid-size pickup truck. Slotted in between the Ford Ranger SuperCab (crew-cab Ford Rangers were never marketed in North America) and the F-150 SuperCrew, the Sport Trac became the first mid-size pickup truck produced by Ford. In terms of layout, the Sport Trac was followed by the [[Chevrolet Avalanche]] and [[Honda Ridgeline]], both crew cab pickup truck derived from SUVs. 

=== Chassis ===
The Ford Explorer Sport Trac shares the Ford UN105 platform with the second-generation Ford Explorer. To accommodate for the addition of a pickup bed, the wheelbase of the Explorer Sport Trac was lengthened from 111.6 inches to 125.9 inches (matching the Ford Ranger SuperCab). As with the Ford Explorer and Ford Explorer Sport, rear-wheel drive was standard, with [[ControlTrac]] four-wheel drive as an optional powertrain configuration. A 210 hp SOHC 4.0L V6 was the sole engine offering. A five-speed manual transmission was standard, with a five-speed automatic transmission available as an option. 

During the 2001 model year, the 4.0L V6 underwent revisions, shifting from an alloy intake manifold to a composite design; the oil filler cap switched locations from the driver side to the passenger side of the engine. For 2002, the chassis was given four-wheel disc brakes (replacing rear drum brakes) with the rear discs being the largest offered on a solid rear axle Explorer (11.83" vs 11.2"). The fuel tank was also enlarged from 20 gallons to 22 gallons.      

=== Body ===
Built on a lengthened Ford Explorer chassis, the Sport Trac was constructed using parts from three Ford vehicles, with the addition of model-specific pickup truck bed. Sharing the front fascia and fenders with the two-door Explorer Sport, the four-door cab was constructed from the four-door Ford Explorer (with modified rear doors). Designed specifically for the Sport Trac, the 50-inch long&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://runbidsell.com/resources/ford-explorer-sport-trac-dimensions/|title= Ford Explorer Sport Trac Dimensions}}&lt;/ref&gt; pickup bed was constructed entirely of plastic composite material; the tailgate was shared with the Ford F-150 SuperCrew. To add additional load space for the shortened pickup bed, Ford offered a metal load extender to be used with the tailgate. Another option included a removable hard plastic tonneau cover for the pickup bed.   

Sharing its interior with the two-door and four-door Explorer (which shared much of its dashboard with the Ranger), the Sport Trac retained the fold-down rear seats of the four-door Explorer to expand storage space. A full rubber floor was standard (as in base-trim pickup trucks), with berber-style carpet floor mats. The Sport Trac was configured with a power-retractable "Breezeway" rear window (a feature last used by Ford on the 1965 Mercury line) in place of a sliding rear window.   

During 2002, several changes were made to the exterior badging, with "Explorer" removed from the doors and "Sport Trac" (on the tailgate) changed to chrome, from red/white plastic. In another revision, the B-pillars were changed from black to body-color. For 2004, the gray bumpers and side skirts were darkened in color; a new option offered body-color bumpers and side skirts.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Trim ===
In line with the second-generation Ford Explorer four-door, beginning in 2002, the Ford Explorer Sport Trac was offered in a XLS trim level (steel wheels, cloth seats) and an XLT trim level (alloy wheels), and 2003, an XLT Premium trim level (leather seats)
* XLS - Included: cloth upholstery, styled-steel rims, air conditioning, an AM/FM stereo with single-CD player and four speakers (60W), power doors and windows with auto drivers side window, and a tachometer.
* XLT - Added: automatic transmission, alloy rims, an AM/FM premium stereo with single-CD and cassette players and four premium speakers (80W), keyless entry, speed control, leather-wrapped steering wheel, and power mirrors. Leather seats are an option.
* XLT Premium - Added: Power driver's seat, rear audio controls with headphone jacks, automatic headlamps, fog lamps, overhead console, and tow hooks (4x4 models only).

In 2006, Ford released the second-generation Ford Explorer Sport Trac. After skipping the 2006 model year, the new design was released as for the 2007 model year. Adopting many updates of the 2006 redesign of the Ford Explorer/Mercury Mountaineer, the Sport Trac received a redesigned frame and the introduction of several safety features, including [[Electronic stability control|stability control]] and [[active rollover protection]] (named AdvanceTrac and Roll Stability Control by Ford, respectively). 

=== Chassis ===
The second-generation Ford Explorer Sport Trac shares the Ford U251 chassis with the fourth-generation Ford Explorer. As part of the redesign, the wheelbase was stretched to 130.5 inches (4.6 inches longer than the previous generation). In a break from its predecessor, the 2007 Sport Trac adopted the four-wheel independent suspension of the Ford Explorer; with the exception of the Honda Ridgeline and [[Hummer H1]], the Sport Trac became the first pickup truck with such a suspension layout. 

As a standard engine, the second-generation Sport Trac retained the 4.0L V6 of its predecessor. For the first time the Sport Trac offered a V8 engine option, the 292 hp 4.6L [[Ford Modular engine#3-valve|24-valve Modular]] V8 used in the F-150 pickups.  The five-speed manual transmission was discontinued, with the 5R55W five-speed automatic becoming standard equipment with the 4.0L V6 and the 4.6 2V V8; in 2009 the [[6R80]] 6 speed automatic replaced the 5 speed behind the V8.

=== Body ===
Again derived from a lengthened Ford Explorer, the second-generation Sport Trac was fitted with a plastic composite pickup truck bed. As the two-door Ford Explorer Sport was discontinued in 2003, the second-generation Sport Trac adopted the front fascia of the four-door Explorer. In a minor styling shift, while the large front fender flares were withdrawn, the rear ones continued, styled similar to the F-150 FlareSide pickup bed.

Largely sharing its rear doors with the Ford Explorer (with a lack of a rear wheel cutout in the lower corners, due to the longer wheelbase), the Sport Trac retained a [[Hofmeister kink]] in the rear quarter windows. As with its precedecessor, the Sport Trac retained the power-retractable "breezeway" rear window.  

For 2008, the Adrenalin appearance package (see below) was added, along with the addition of [[Ford SYNC|SYNC]] as an [[Infotainment|infotainment media system]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Trim ===
In contrast to the Explorer SUV, the second-generation Sport Trac was offered with only two trim levels, both common to the Explorer. On the Sport Trac, the XLT (mid-range on the Explorer) served as the standard trim level, with the Limited serving as the upgraded trim level. Along with the standardization of many optional features of the XLT, the monochromatic Limited replaces the chrome grille and black lower body trim of the XLT with a body-color grille and trim. 

During the development of the second-generation Sport Trac, [[Special Vehicle Team|Ford SVT]] developed the ''Sport Trac Adrenalin.'' Powered by a supercharged version of the 4.6L V8 (producing 390 hp), the Adrenalin was intended as a 2007 successor for the F-150 Lightning pickup truck. As part of [[The Way Forward]], the Sport Trac Adrenalin project was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motortrend.com/future/concept_cars/112_0606_ford_adrenalin_explorer_sport_trac_svt Ford Adrenalin &amp; Explorer Sport Trac SVT - Future Vehicle - Motor Trend&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  For 2008, the Adrenalin became part of the Sport Trac model line as an option package. While the SVT-supercharged V8 was not included, many design elements of the model were included, including its blacked-out headlights, black grille, model-specific bumpers, model-specific front fenders (distinguished by side vents), monochromatic interior trim, integrated running boards, and 20-inch alloy wheels.

*XLT - Included: cloth upholstery, power driver's seat, power mirrors, power locks, power windows with automatic driver's side window, four spoke steering wheel, overhead console, illuminated entry, air conditioning, 16" alloy rims, security alarm, and an AM/FM radio with a single-CD player with MP3 capability. 
*Limited - Added: leather-wrapped steering wheel with shift knob, 18" alloy rims, fog lamps, automatic headlamps, body color bumpers and mirrors, and a floor console.

The '''Ford Country Sedan''' is a [[full-size car|full-size]] [[station wagon]] that was built by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] from 1952 until 1974.

It was based on the Ford full-size car line available in each year.  The Country Sedan was the mid-trim station wagon in the Ford range. Unlike the [[Ford Country Squire|Country Squire]], the Country Sedan featured plain body sides. As a full-size wagon, it could carry up to 9 passengers, if so equipped.

The Country Sedan was based on the [[Ford Customline|Customline]] from 1952 to 1954. Beginning in 1955, Ford spun their station wagons into their own series and the Country Sedan continued to represent the mid-trim level station wagon. During the 1960s and 1970s, the Country Sedan was approximate to the [[Ford Galaxie|Galaxie]] and later the [[Ford Galaxie|Galaxie 500]] in trim elements. For 1972, 1973 and 1974 the model was marketed as the Galaxie 500 Country Sedan and from 1975 it was rebranded [[Ford LTD (North America)|LTD]] wagon. By this time the trim level was identical to the [[Ford Country Squire|Country Squire]] apart from the absence of simulated wood exterior paneling.

==Rear gate advances==

(''Originally from [[Ford Country Squire]]'')

Prior to 1961, all Ford wagons utilized a two-piece tailgate assembly that required the operator to lift the rear window and lock it into place via a mechanical support, and then drop the tail gate down to fully access the rear compartment.

For the 1961 model year, Ford incorporated a tailgate assembly that featured a self-storing window that could either be rolled down into the gate via crank on the outside of the gate, or by an electrical motor actuated by the key or an interior switch.  A safety lockout measure required that the rear window had to be fully retracted into the gate before it could be lowered.

With the introduction of the 1966 models, all Ford wagons introduced the '''Magic Door Gate''' which allowed the tailgate on the vehicle to function as a traditional tailgate that could be lowered, or a door that swung outward for easier access to the seating area. The Magic Door Gate was made possible through a use of a traditional stationary hinge on the right, and a combination of hinges along the doors left side, which carried the weight of the gate as it swung outward when used as a door.

General Motors, Chrysler, AMC, and [[Toyota Crown#Third (S50 Model: 1967 to 1971)|Toyota]] would adopt a similar configuration by the end of the 1960s.

}}The '''Ford LTD Crown Victoria''' is a line of [[full-size car]]s that was manufactured and marketed by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] for North America.  Introduced as the flagship of the [[Ford LTD (Americas)|Ford LTD]] model range for the 1980 model year, a single generation was produced through the 1991 model year.  Throughout its production, the LTD Crown Victoria was marketed as the Ford counterpart of the [[Mercury Grand Marquis]].  The model line was offered as a two-door and a four-door sedan, alongside the woodgrained [[Ford Country Squire|Ford LTD Country Squire]] station wagon (an LTD Crown Victoria station wagon without wood trim was also offered).

For 1983, as part of a revision within all three Ford divisions, the LTD and LTD Crown Victoria became separate model ranges, with the latter becoming the sole full-size Ford sedan range.

For 1992, the model line underwent an extensive redesign.  Ending the use of the LTD prefix, the sedan became the [[Ford Crown Victoria]]; the Country Squire wagon was discontinued in favor of other styles of family vehicles.  From 1979 to 1985, the LTD Crown Victoria was produced by [[St. Louis Assembly Plant|St. Louis Assembly]] in [[Hazelwood, Missouri]].  In 1985, Ford shifted production to [[St. Thomas Assembly]] in [[Southwold, Ontario]], where Ford and Mercury full-size vehicles were assembled until 2011.

==Overview==
For 1980, Ford reintroduced the ''Crown Victoria'' nameplate as a luxury trim package for the all-new [[Ford LTD (Americas)#Panther-platform (1979–1982)|Ford LTD]], taking the place of the LTD Landau.  Taking its name from the [[Ford Fairlane Crown Victoria Skyliner|Ford Fairlane Crown Victoria]] of 1955-1956, the LTD Crown Victoria borrowed a distinctive styling feature from its Fairlane counterpart: a [[Targa top|targa-style]] band across the roof atop the B-pillars.  For the Fairlane, the band was bright chrome; to modernize its appearance, the LTD Crown Victoria adopted a band of brushed aluminum.

In the [[Landaulet (car)|landaulet]]-style of the [[Lincoln Town Car]], the LTD Crown Victoria was fitted with a half-length padded [[vinyl roof]], with the brushed-aluminum band covering the B-pillars (in place of the "coach lamps" of the Mercury Grand Marquis).  In the style of the original 1965 Ford LTD, the LTD Crown Victoria featured a "crested" hood ornament. The first time Ford used the "victoria" as a naming convention was in 1932 on the [[1932 Ford#1932|Ford Victoria]] and the [[Lincoln K-series#1932|Lincoln Victoria]] 2-door coupes.

As with the previous-generation LTD, the LTD Crown Victoria directly competed against the [[Chevrolet Caprice#Third generation (1977–1990)|Chevrolet Caprice]] and the [[Pontiac Bonneville#Sixth generation (1977–1981)|Pontiac Bonneville]] (both downsized for 1977).  Originally slated for replacement by the [[Ford Taurus (first generation)|Ford Taurus]] in the early 1980s, the model line saw relatively little change throughout its production.  As the decade progressed, concerns over fuel economy eased, which allowed further development of full-size cars.  For 1988 and 1990, the LTD Crown Victoria saw a number of revisions and updates. In early 1991, the redesigned Ford Crown Victoria was introduced as a replacement, which marked the end of the Ford LTD nameplate in North America.

=== Chassis ===
[[File:Ford LTD Crown Victoria Coupé rear.jpg|thumb|1987 Ford LTD Crown Victoria coupe|left]]
The Ford LTD Crown Victoria uses the rear-wheel drive [[Ford Panther platform]] architecture.  As part of a major downsizing over the 1973-1978 LTD Brougham/Landau, the LTD Crown Victoria shed 18 inches of length and nearly 1000 pounds of curb weight. Although much smaller than its predecessor, the LTD Crown Victoria would carry over the basic suspension design of its predecessor, with a [[Beam axle|live rear axle]] suspension and [[Double wishbone suspension|double wishbone]] [[Independent suspension|independent front suspension]].  Brakes were of a vented disc/rear drum configuration.

When introduced in 1980, the LTD Crown Victoria was produced with the two smallest-displacement engines previously available on the LTD, the 4.9&amp;nbsp;L (marketed by Ford as "5.0") and 5.8&amp;nbsp;L Windsor V8s. In the interest of fuel economy and [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy|CAFE]] regulations, the [[Ford 385 engine|460 V8]] was shifted to truck use while the [[Ford 335 engine#400|400 V8]] was discontinued altogether.

In 1981, Ford would take steps to further increase the fuel economy of its full-size cars.  From the Lincoln Continental/Mark VI, all Panther-platform cars received the 4-speed [[Ford AOD transmission|AOD]] overdrive automatic transmission, replacing all previous 3-speed automatics. The engine line was revised: the 5.8&amp;nbsp;L V8 was restricted exclusively to fleet (police) sales, with a {{convert|120|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 4.2&amp;nbsp;L version of the 4.9&amp;nbsp;L V8 becoming the new base engine. The 4.9&amp;nbsp;L V8 saw major changes, with the carburetor replaced by throttle-body "electronic central fuel injection". In contrast to competitors from General Motors and Chrysler, the LTD Crown Victoria was sold exclusively with a V8 engine.

As the LTD Crown Victoria became a stand-alone model line for the 1983 model year, the 4.2&amp;nbsp;L V8 was discontinued altogether, leaving the 5.0 V8 the only engine available on all models (with a 5.8 carburetor V8 engine also available, but only on fleet-usage models, particularly police cars). For 1986, the throttle-body fuel injection system (which turned out to have driveability issues) was replaced by a multi-port "Sequential-Fire" fuel-injection system with a redesigned air intake; the system was based on an [[On-Board Diagnostics#OBD-I|OBD-1]] compliant [[Ford EEC|Ford EEC-IV]] computer.

At the end of its production in 1991, the LTD Crown Victoria was produced with the 5.0&amp;nbsp;L V8. Although a (rare) option on the Mercury Grand Marquis, sales of the 5.8-liter V8 (with a Ford 7200 variable-venturi carburetor) was restricted to fleets, with most sold as part of the Ford police package. 1991 Panther-platform cars with the 5.8 were the very last American cars sold with a carbureted engine.

=== Body ===
[[File:Ford LTD Crown Victoria -- 02-29-2012.JPG|thumb|left|1988–1990 LTD Crown Victoria sedan]]When introduced in 1980, the Ford LTD Crown Victoria was produced in both two-door and four-door sedan body configurations.  As with the standard-trim LTD, the LTD Crown Victoria was produced with quad-headlight front bodywork. Similar to the 1979 [[Ford Mustang (third generation)|Ford Mustang]], the car had the 4 eyed quad headlight arrangement in the front facia. This was one of the final classical "eyed" cars to ever be manufactured. For 1983, the exterior was given a minor update, with a redesigned "eggcrate" grille; the taillamps saw a minor update because the LTD script was removed from them. For 1980, the coupe assumed the role of full-sized coupe when the [[Ford Thunderbird (eighth generation)|Thunderbird]] was downsized and shared the chassis with the smaller Mustang.

For the 1988 model year, the LTD Crown Victoria saw a revision to the exterior and interior.  In a move to modernize the exterior and improve its aerodynamics, the edges of the front and rear fenders were rounded off.  The design of the bumpers was updated to better integrate the corners into the fenders (it retained the 4 eyed quad headlight arrangement). The design of the trunklid was changed to fit wraparound taillamp clusters while the front turn signals and parking lamps were integrated into a single cluster with the quad headlamps.  The grille was redesigned from an eggcrate style to a waterfall style (a design distinct from that used by Mercury) with the Ford Blue Oval centered.  The interior was updated with new front and rear seats.  In 1987, Ford sold 5,527 two-door sedans (compared to 105,789 four-door sedans&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of American Cars, 2006 edition&lt;/ref&gt;); due to declining sales of the body style, the two-door was not included in the facelift, making the 1979-87 coupe a minor collector's item.

In 1990, the interior again saw major changes as the dashboard of the LTD Crown Victoria was redesigned.  Nearly identical to that of the Grand Marquis, the new interior features a driver-side airbag as standard equipment.  To streamline production costs and increase its appeal after 11 years, the standard equipment list of the LTD Crown Victoria added many previously optional features, including air conditioning, which was made standard in 1987, power windows, locks, tilt steering, and automatic headlights (AutoLamp). For 1991, the LTD Crown Victoria saw a minor exterior change, as the parking light lenses were changed in color from amber to clear.

=== Trim ===
[[File:1990 Ford LTD Crown Victoria Wagon front 4.28.18.jpg|alt=|thumb|1990 Ford LTD Crown Victoria station wagon. Lack of a hood ornament and woodgrain trim means this is the fleet-sales "S" model.]]
From 1980 to 1982, the LTD Crown Victoria existed as a trim package within the LTD range.  As Ford made the LTD Crown Victoria a stand-alone model line, it inherited the same trim lineup from the full-size Ford LTD.

As a base model restricted for fleets and police sales, the LTD Crown Victoria "S" was available, coming with either V8 engine.  Distinguished by its vinyl roof delete, steel wheels and bright wheel covers, and lack of chrome roof band (a non-padded vinyl roof was an option), the S model was equipped with very few features, such as a vinyl bench seat, hood ornament delete, manual windows and locks, and AM radio (upgraded radios at extra cost). While mostly sold to fleets (particularly police and taxi sales), the LTD Crown Victoria S was also sold to the general public, as  station wagon version was also available in this trim level (the only LTD Crown Victoria variant in this trim level available to the general public).

The standard LTD Crown Victoria was intended for retail markets, coming with the 5.0L V8 engine as standard.  In addition to the landau-style vinyl padded roof with targa-style trim and wire wheel covers, the model featured full carpeting, reclining cloth bench seat, and AM/FM radio.

Above the standard LTD Crown Victoria, Ford offered an Interior Luxury Package and in 1986, the option package became the LTD Crown Victoria LX.  Featuring split-bench cloth seats, the option included upgraded interior carpet, additional sound insulation and power-operated features, and upgraded stereo systems.&lt;ref name="FordBuyGuide"&gt;1987 Ford Buyer's Guide&lt;/ref&gt;  On the exterior of the LX, the option was distinguished by cornering lamps, two-tone paint, and aluminum alloy wheels.

== Variants ==

=== Station wagon ===
{{see also|Ford Country Squire}}
[[File:Ford LTD Country Squire -- 05-23-2012 front.JPG|thumb|1991 Ford LTD Country Squire]]
From 1979 to 1991, a station wagon was produced alongside the four-door sedan as part of the full-size car line.  Trimmed nearly identically to the top-trim LTD Landau (subsequently LTD Crown Victoria and Crown Victoria LX), the wood-paneled [[Ford Country Squire|Country Squire]] consisted of the majority of sales; an LTD Crown Victoria wagon without the wood sides was available in deluxe as well as in base "S" trim.

As with its predecessor, the station wagon came equipped with a dual-hinged tailgate; it opened both downwards like the tailgate of a pickup truck or swung open to the side.  Also standard were a roof rack and dual side-facing jump seats in the cargo area, expanding seating capacity to eight (except in "S" trim, which lacked these accessories).  As the demand for family vehicles in the late 1980s and early 1990s had shifted from large station wagons to minivans, full-size vans, and (later) to sport-utility vehicles, sales of the big Ford station wagon rapidly declined; only 3,865 were sold through 1991.  For the 1992 model year redesign of the Crown Victoria, the station wagon was dropped from the model lineup.

=== Fleet use ===
[[File:1990 Ford Crown Victoria.jpg|thumb|1990 Ford LTD Crown Victoria [[police car]]]]In use primarily restricted for the police, taxi and other fleet markets, the LTD Crown Victoria S was sold to fleets throughout its production.  Internally referred as ''P72'', the LTD Crown Victoria S was trimmed separately from a standard LTD Crown Victoria, deleting many convenience features.  Mechanically, the P72 was the only version available with the 5.8L V8 after 1980 in the United States.

The '''Ford LTD''' (pronounced ''el-tee-dee'') is a range of automobiles manufactured by Ford Motor Company for the 1965 to 1986 model years.  Introduced as the highest trim level of the [[full-size Ford]] model range, the LTD introduced options and features normally reserved for more luxurious [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln]] and [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] models.  The largest vehicle produced by Ford in North America for most of its production, the LTD was joined by the intermediate [[Ford LTD II]] from 1977 to 1979; the LTD II served as the replacement for the [[Ford Torino|Torino/Gran Torino]] range.  At various times throughout its production, the LTD range included two- and four-door pillared and hardtop sedans, a two-door convertible, and the [[Ford Country Squire|Country Squire]] five-door [[Woodie (car body style)|woodgrain station wagon]].

For the 1979 model year, the LTD was [[Downsize (automobile)|downsized]], becoming externally smaller than the LTD II, and for 1983, it became a mid-size car. The [[Ford Granada (North America)|Ford Granada]] was discontinued, with the LTD nameplate moving to a restyled version of that car; the full-size LTD then became [[Ford LTD Crown Victoria|LTD Crown Victoria]].  The mid-size LTD was replaced by the 1986 [[Ford Taurus (first generation)|Ford Taurus]], as Ford continued its shift towards front-wheel drive vehicles.

Outside of North America, the 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 was manufactured in South America into the 1980s and marketed as the Ford LTD.

==Etymology==
The LTD designation has been speculated by some to be an abbreviation of "Luxury Trim Decor" and by others as a "Limited" trim designation for the [[Ford Galaxie|Galaxie]]. There is evidence in early 1970s Australian LTD sales brochures, that "Lincoln Type Design" was adapted by Ford's Australian marketing, as the meaning of the LTD nameplate to play up Lincoln-like exclusitivity and design influence of its Falcon-based LTD luxury car, since actual Lincoln models were not sold in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aus-ford-uk.co.uk/html/ltd.html|title=Australian Ford Register – Ford LTD|access-date=15 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gumtree.com.au/ford-ltd.html|title=Australian Ford LTD Review and Specs|access-date=15 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no evidence of "Lincoln Type Design" nor any other meaning ever being used in brochures or advertising copy of North American sales literature. The original ''Car Life'' review at the time the first Galaxie 500 LTD was released suggests that "LTD" stood for nothing and was ambiguous in meaning.

The Ford Galaxie 500 LTD was introduced in August 1964 at the start of the 1965 model year and prompted the [[Chevrolet Caprice]] at midyear 1965, the [[AMC Ambassador]] "DPL" in 1966, the [[Plymouth Fury]] "VIP," and the similar [[Dodge Monaco]]. These upscale models had features found primarily on luxury models from these same manufacturers, namely Cadillac, Lincoln and Imperial, but were sold at much lower retail prices. These cars commonly came equipped with options like power windows, a power driver's seat, power brakes, power steering, air conditioning, and a full or half-[[vinyl roof|vinyl top]] (called a [[landau (car)|landau]] or [[brougham (carriage)|brougham]] interchangeably across different models by the same manufacturers).  Other upgrades were interiors made of better materials and more powerful engines.  Most of these upper trim models were usually [[hardtop]]s as opposed to [[Pillar (car)|pillared bodies]].

In 1966, the LTD series became completely separate from the Galaxie 500, which continued as the mid-line offering (the performance-oriented Galaxie 500 XL shared top billing with the LTD). The Twin Comfort Lounge Seat (a split bench seat) was a new option.

The 1967 LTD two-door hardtop got a new formal roofline, keeping up with the competition.  All models received the 1967 federally-mandated safety features, including a large, soft "crash pad" in the center of the steering wheel, non-protruding instrument panel knobs, a dual-circuit brake master cylinder, four-way hazard flashers, and front outboard shoulder belt mounting points.

The 1968 model year would be transitional for the LTD and all full-size Fords. Though the body and frame of the 1965–1967 models were carryovers, the 1968 model featured horizontal hidden headlights and a more formal roofline. It was the last model with the 119" wheelbase. The standard LTD interior was downgraded a bit in luxury compared to past versions, but a new "Brougham" option package effectively brought the interior trim up to previous standards of luxury.  In a major change for the 1968 model year, Ford added sedan model names to the separate model series for some of its full-size station wagons; the wood-grained Country Squire became the "LTD Country Squire." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1969_Ford/1969_Ford_Wagons_Brochure/1969%20Ford%20Wagons%2004.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-02-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205130155/http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1969_Ford/1969_Ford_Wagons_Brochure/1969%20Ford%20Wagons%2004.html |archivedate=2018-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This generation was introduced with covered headlights on the top level LTD coupe, sedan and station wagon, which were deployed using a vacuum canister system that kept the doors down when a vacuum condition existed in the lines, provided by the engine when it was running. If a loss of vacuum occurred, the doors would retract up so that the headlights were visible if the system should fail. 1968s also included side marker lights and reflectors, and the parking lights now illuminated with the headlights.  Front outboard shoulder belts were fitted to cars built effective January 1, 1968.  The large soft hub in the steering wheel gave way to a more conventional design, and an energy-absorbing steering column was introduced as part of the 1968 safety package.

A limousine version of the car was also considered, with the extra length at the C-pillar and the rear doors. At least one example was built, by Lehmann-Peterson.

For the 1969 model year, the LTD was given a major redesign.  Based on a largely carryover chassis, the wheelbase of all full-size Ford sedans now stretched to 121 inches.

=== Timeline ===
{{plainlist}}

'''1969''':Ford LTD is given a redesign on a longer (121-inch) wheelbase chassis; the hidden headlights and formal roofline introduced in 1967 are retained.  An all-new body features a split grille with a horizontal center divider (shared with XLs and Country Squires).&lt;ref name=Odin&gt;Odin, L.C. ''A concise guide to the Ford and Mercury full-size automobile production 1969–1978''. Belvedere Publishing, 2016. ASIN: B01HE91Y4K.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1970:''' The split grille was discontinued; while its Mercury Marquis counterpart continues its Lincoln-style fascia, Ford redesigned the front end of the LTD with a three-segment grille with a prominent center section&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt; (a toned down version of the [[Ford Thunderbird (fifth generation)]]).  All LTDs got a new Federally-mandated locking steering column and wheel, with the ignition switch located on the right side of the column.
*'''1971:''' The LTD was given a styling update.  In the rear, the long-running Ford styling tradition ended as the twin round or square "jet exhaust" taillights were replaced by horizontal taillights on all full-size Fords.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;  In between the two tail lamps was a center "third" brakelight; on the Galaxie 500, this space was an alloy trim panel while Custom 500s had body-color trim.  In front, the LTD lost its hidden headlamps to Lincoln-Mercury, but got a new front end treatment with a tall center grille section and "LTD" spelled out in block letters on the hood.

With the discontinuation of the XL series, the convertible was moved to the LTD line.  These were produced with bucket seats and center consoles; the console was similar to the console in the XLs and Mercury Marauders of 1969–1970, with a "stirrup" style shift handle.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;

A customized 1971 LTD is featured prominently in the 1973 American film White Lightning. It is the car driven by the film’s lead character, portrayed by Burt Reynolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070915/goofs|title=White Lightning (1973)|via=www.imdb.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180513145605/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070915/goofs|archivedate=2018-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''1972:''' 1972 models were virtually the same as the 1971s, although the bumper now stretched across the lower section of the grille.  A new rear bumper integrated the taillights; also in the rear, the design of the trunklid was squared off.  Due to decreased demand in the segment, 1972 was the final model year for the LTD convertible.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;
*'''1973:''' In 1972, in order to comply with federal regulations, the LTD was given a major redesign for 1973.  The requirements for 5-mph front bumpers had taken effect, with larger rear bumpers to be added in 1973.  While the redesign slightly decreased the weight of the LTD, it still was far in excess of two tons, making agility and fuel economy both key weak points.  The new styling was bulkier, making the car look significantly larger and heavier than previous models.  Four-door models (sharing rooflines with Mercury) were given thin B-pillars for roof reinforcement and branded as "pillared hardtops" (frameless door glass remained on all Ford LTD models).&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;  The 460 engine became an option for the first time.
*'''1974:''' Five-mph bumpers added to the rear.  Mostly carryover from the 1973 model year.  Mid-year, a non-woodgrain LTD wagon became available.  A new Federal law required seat belts to be buckled before the starter would operate; public protests prompted the government to relax this requirement.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;  Subsequent models got a simple "Fasten Seat Belt" warning light and buzzer for 1975, and owners were now permitted to disable the starter interlock on their 1974s.
*'''1975:''' Following the discontinuation of the  Galaxie series after 1974, Ford sought to fill its place by expanding the LTD trim lineup.  Above the Custom 500 was the standard LTD, the LTD Brougham, and newly introduced for 1975, the LTD Landau.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;   In an effort to comply with pending rollover standards (as well as to differentiate it from the Mercury Marquis), the two-door was converted from a hardtop to a coupe with wide B-pillars and a tall, narrow "opera window" (Chevrolet did the same thing in 1973 with the Caprice Coupe).&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt; More or less the Ford counterpart to the  [[Mercury Grand Marquis]], the LTD Landau featured rear [[fender skirts]] and various decor packages for additional luxury; it was distinguished by the return of hidden headlamps (exclusive to its trim level).  Hidden headlamps were also shared with the LTD Country Squire wagon.  The 429 engine was replaced by the 460 V8 sourced from Lincoln-Mercury for 1975.  A catalytic converter now required the use of unleaded fuel, and the gas gauge and fuel filler sported warnings to this effect.         
*'''1976:''' Four-wheel disc brakes and [[8-track tape|8-track]] were optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---October/1976-Ford-LTD-Brochure/1976-Ford-LTD-08 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027130825/http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---October/1976-Ford-LTD-Brochure/1976-Ford-LTD-08 |archivedate=2016-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Last year for LTD Brougham trim level.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;
*'''1977:'''  Since the LTD Brougham had been discontinued, the LTD Landau received the former Brougham interior as the base offering. Optional interiors, including the LTD Landau Luxury Group, were still available.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;
*'''1978:''' Final year for 121-inch wheelbase LTD, as it is replaced by the downsized Panther-platform generation LTD for 1979.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;
{{endplainlist}}

Approximately 7,850,000 full-size Fords and Mercurys were sold over the 1969–1978 period.&lt;ref name="kowalke1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kowalke|first=Ron|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975|year=1997|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=0-87341-521-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/standardcatalogo00beve}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flammang, James 1999"&gt;Flammang, James ''Standard Catalog of American Cars 1976–1999 3rd Edition'' (Iola, WI: Krause Publications, Inc. 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it the second best selling Ford [[automobile platform]]  after the [[Ford Model T]].&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;

===Mechanical Details===
For the first time since the 1940s, the full-size Ford line was powered exclusively by [[V8 engine]]s. The base engine was the 302 cid V8. The next largest engine was Ford's 351 CID V8, the most common choice. Still larger was Ford's 400 CID V8. Topping the range was the 429 cid V8, which was replaced by the 460 CID V8 for 1974.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt; The [[full-size Ford|full-sized Fords]] remained strong sellers each year during this period, due to their high comfort, powerful engines, good build quality and reasonable cost.

===LTD II===
{{main article|Ford LTD II}}
When Ford updated its mid-size product line for 1977, they took on the LTD name as well.  To differentiate them from the full-size product lineup, the mid-size cars were called the LTD II in an attempt to appeal to buyers as a downsized alternative to the full-sized LTD which had competition from GM's newly downsized full-sized cars. The LTD II was based on the Ford Torino and served as a restyled replacement for it. The LTD II styling was also adapted to update the final generation of the Ford Ranchero.  The LTD II was discontinued after 1979 without being replaced, as the new Panther-platform LTD was nearly a foot shorter than an LTD II and the Granada became Ford's mid-size product line with its 1981 redesign.

For the 1977 model year, General Motors downsized its full-size car lines closely within the exterior size of many intermediates.  At the time, Ford marketers took a cynical view that such a radically smaller "full-size car" would turn off buyers; advertisements for LTD and Mercury Marquis touted the "road-hugging weight" of the larger cars and compared their larger dimensions side by side with GM flagship sedan [[Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham]].  For owners who would still prefer a downsized big car, Ford offered the "Trim Size [[Ford LTD II|LTD II]]," which was simply a refreshed [[Ford Torino|Torino]] with stacked quad rectangular headlights and LTD-like styling at the rear.

Ford was taken by surprise when the downsized GM cars proved to be an enormous sales success and along with the advent of [[CAFE]] regulations, they were forced to follow suit. Production of the 1979 models began July 31, 1978 at [[Louisville Assembly Plant|Louisville Assembly]], with [[Atlanta Assembly]], [[Los Angeles Assembly]], and [[Oakville Assembly]] following suit in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 1979 |editor=Stark, Harry A. |publisher=Ward's Communications |year=1979 |page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[Chrysler R platform]], the [[Ford Panther platform]] was completely new from the ground up.  The LTD and Marquis lost nearly 15 inches in length and some 400 pounds of curb weight without a significant loss of interior space over the old 1969-vintage platform. Like GM's "downsized" 1977 big cars, the new 1979 LTD featured a trimmer body profile, more nimble handling due to its smaller size, and better fuel economy.  Big-block engines were gone and the small-block 302 V8 became standard, with the 351 Windsor V8 optional. However, due to CAFE requirements, the 351 became a police-only option in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gunnell, John |title=Standard Catalog of Ford |publisher=Krause Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 1981, to further improve fuel economy (while avoiding diesel or 6-cylinder engines), Ford introduced a [[Ford Windsor engine#255|{{convert|255|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] variant of the Windsor V8. The 255 proved an unpopular choice; at 115&amp;nbsp;hp, its output was ill-suited for the LTD's size and the engine was dropped after 1982. Most LTDs of this era were fitted with a Motorcraft 7200VV two-barrel variable venturi carburetor; a conventional carburetor was available with the police option high-output 351.

In Canada, the [[Ford Custom 500|Custom 500]] continued as the base model through 1981.  Low-end cars were identifiable by single rectangular headlamps, while the higher models received duals. For 1980, the LTD S was added as a lower-priced model and the Crown Victoria replaced the Landau on a permanent basis; it had a landau roof with a brushed aluminum band, a stylistic element shared with the [[Ford Thunderbird (seventh generation)|1977–1979 Thunderbird]] and ultimately traced back to the [[1955 Ford]] from whence the Crown Victoria name originated. Mercury's contemporary Grand Marquis was equivalently optioned.

In 1982, the LTD got a new grille with the revived Ford blue oval emblem and throttle body fuel injection became available. For 1983, as part of a major product shift, the LTD and [[Ford LTD Crown Victoria|LTD Crown Victoria]] were split into separate product lines.  The LTD was downsized to the Fox platform (along with the Mercury Marquis) to replace the Granada, while the full-size LTD Crown Victoria became a stand-alone model (as did the Mercury Grand Marquis).    {{Clear}}

For model year 1983, Ford introduced the LTD and Mercury Marquis as [[badge engineering|rebadged]] variants of the second generation [[Ford Granada (North America)|Ford Granada]] and [[Mercury Cougar]] (sedan and wagon), all using the [[Ford Fox platform|Fox platform]]. The full-size cars retained only the [[Ford LTD Crown Victoria|LTD Crown Victoria]] and [[Mercury Grand Marquis|Grand Marquis]] nameplates; Lincoln followed suit, with the Town Car becoming its sole full-size vehicle in 1983.  

As with the Granada, the LTD was available in a four-door sedan and five-door station wagon body styles; no two-door version was produced. At its launch, the LTD/Marquis shared a common engine with the Fairmont and Granada; a 2.3&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Ford Pinto engine#2.3 OHC|Lima]]'' four-cylinder, a 3.3&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Ford Straight-6 engine#200|Thriftpower Six]]'' inline-six, and a ''[[Ford Windsor engine#302|5.0L Windsor]]'' V8 (upgraded to fuel injection). Inherited from the Granada was a 3.8 L ''[[Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)|Essex]]'' V6; after 1984, the V6 replaced the inline-six entirely. For 1984, the V6 gained fuel injection in United States versions (Canadian-market versions remained carbureted until 1986). A rare option, seen only in 1982–1984, was an [[Autogas|LPG (propane)]]-powered version of the four-cylinder engine; it was largely discontinued due to poor sales and lack of propane fueling infrastructure.

The LTD became the third-best-selling car in the U.S. in 1983–1984.  Following the success of the Chrysler K-Cars and the General Motors X-body cars which popularized the use of front-wheel drive in the mid-size segment; the LTD/Marquis was ultimately superseded by the Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable model year 1986, with Ford marketing both the LTD/Marquis and the [[First-generation Ford Taurus|Ford Taurus]] for the 1986 model year. The last LTD rolled off the Atlanta, Georgia assembly line on December 13, 1985 and off the Chicago, Illinois assembly line on January 3, 1986.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===LTD LX===
From the mid-1984 model year and throughout the 1985 model year, Ford had a performance version of the LTD marketed as the ''LTD LX''.  It came standard with the high output 5.0L [[fuel injection#Throttle body injection|CFI]] V8 engine, four-speed [[automatic transmission]] with overdrive, 600&amp;nbsp;lb-in front and 270&amp;nbsp;lb-in rear coil springs, front and rear sway bars, 10 inch front disc and 10 inch rear drum brakes, and a 3.27:1 rear gear ratio with a Traction-Lok differential.  The LX model was the only LTD to have a tachometer in the instrument cluster. The center console and floor-mounted shifter re-appeared, having last been available in the full-size 1972 model year.  Police Package editions were also produced alongside the LX.  Notable for its bigger sway bars and brakes, it also included bench seats with an automatic trunk opener located underneath the steering wheel. They were a factory option and most were equipped with light bars and police accessories, although some came without.  Mercury's sister car to the LX, the Marquis LTS, was available only in Canada and only in the 1985 model year, with only 134 produced that year.

[[File:1975 Ford LTD Landau BR.jpg|thumb|Ford LTD Brazil, 1975]]
The LTD was built locally in Brazil between 1967 and 1983, based on the 1966 [[Ford Galaxie|Galaxie]] platform. A stretch limousine version was assembled locally as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amcar.fvn.no/brochures/ford/76fords/76fords.html 1976 Ford Full-Line Factory Sales Brochure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802091435/http://amcar.fvn.no/brochures/ford/76fords/76fords.html |date=2009-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venezuela==
The LTD was introduced to the Venezuelan market in 1966, aiming to compete with Chrysler's New Yorker, with the LTD performing much better than its rivals. Over 85,000 LTDs were assembled in the Ford plant of Valencia, Venezuela, some for export to Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru.

Versions of the Fox-body 1983–1986 North American LTD manufactured in Venezuela continued the use of the Granada name complete with uplevel Elite badged versions.  There was also a Ford Cougar equivalent to the North American Mercury Marquis. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifhp97/34997702801|title=1983 Ford Granada Elite (Venezuela)|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifhp97/35089033676/|title=1983 Ford Cougar Brougham (Venezuela)|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ford Model B''' is an upscale [[touring car]] (with polished wood and brass trim) that was introduced in 1904 by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. It was built at the [[Ford Piquette Avenue Plant]].  It was Ford's first car to use the [[Front-engine, rear-wheel drive layout|front-engine layout]], with a large 24&amp;nbsp;hp 4-cylinder engine positioned at the front behind a conventional radiator. The smaller [[Ford Model A (1903-1904)|Model A]]-derived [[Ford Model C|Model C]] positioned its flat 2-cylinder motor under the seat.

Priced at $2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kimes|first=Beverly|title=standard catalog of American Cars 1805-1942|year=1996|publisher=Krause publications|isbn=0-87341-428-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|2000|1904|r=-3}} today), the Model B was a high end car. Produced for three years, sales were predictably slower than the Model C which was priced at 1/3 the cost. The Model B was replaced by the derivative [[Ford Model K|Model K]] in 1906.

The '''[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]''' [[Automobile|car]] was thoroughly updated in '''1941''', in preparation for a time of unpredictability surrounding [[World War II]]. The 1941 design would continue in an aborted 1942 model year and would be restarted in 1946 and produced until 1948 when the more modern [[1949 Ford]]s were ready.  During the initial year of this car, it evolved considerably.  The front fenders came in three pieces, the theory being that small damages could be replaced easily.  During the year, it evolved into two pieces with the lower front and back sections being joined.  The hood risers changed, the early ones being the same as 1940 Fords, changing during the year to the better later version.  The 1941 Convertible had no rear side windows, the only side windows being in the doors; in 1942, quarter windows were added so the rear occupants could see out.
Five different coil/distributor arrangements were used during 1941, causing confusion for mechanics. Other variations were: two different positions for the generator, and three for the cooling fan — front of the crankshaft, front of the generator (rare) and on a bracket.  This is thought to be the first Ford to offer an oil filter.  The two interior heaters were a "Southwind" gasoline burner, which had the advantage of keeping one warm in winter at drive-in movies (provided a small electric fuel pump was used), and a more ordinary hot-water type.  Both had window defrosters.  It had an excellent radio, which could consume the battery in about two hours. Electric windshield wipers were available in addition to the vacuum-powered wipers.  Three different convertible power top mechanisms (vacuum, electric screw, and hydraulic) and two different header bar latching systems were used.  Rear suspensions sometimes had a sway bar, most did not.  It had excellent brakes and among the best handling of ordinary cars of the time. It served a transitional role in Ford’s lineup.

The two previous Ford car lines, Standard and De Luxe, had blossomed into three, Special, De Luxe, and Super De Luxe. Ford vehicles had been V8-only since 1935, but dealer requests for an "economy" engine option prompted the introduction of a six cylinder unit. The entry-level 136&amp;nbsp;CID (2.2&amp;nbsp;L) [[V8 engine|V8]] was switched in favor of a new 226&amp;nbsp;[[Cubic inch displacement|CID]] (3.7&amp;nbsp;L) [[Ford Straight-6 engine|L-head]] [[straight-6]], the first Ford six since the 1906 [[Ford Model K|Model K]].  The popular 221&amp;nbsp;CID (3.6&amp;nbsp;L) V8 remained as the top-line engine and was standard in De Luxe models.  Both engines were rated at 90&amp;nbsp;hp. The 239 CID engine, introduced in 1939 for Mercury and trucks, was continued in the Mercury models.  The chassis was longer, with a 114-in (2.9-m) wheelbase.

The "ignition key" for these cars was actually used to operate a bolt lock which, on one end, unlocked the steering column (a feature destined to return, mandated, decades later), and on the other end unblocked the ignition switch, allowing it to be operated.  Starting the car was then accomplished by pressing a [[Push-button|pushbutton]] on the dashboard, another feature destined to return with the advent of "[[smart key]]s".

Although starting [[Crank (mechanism)#Using a hand|cranks]] had been replaced by [[electric starter]]s for decades, Ford cars included a manual starting feature until 1948 as an [[antidote]] to dead-battery syndrome. The wheel-[[lug wrench]] served as a handle (also for the [[Jack (device)#Mechanical jack|jack]]) and the jack shaft with [[Bayonet mount|bayonet]]-coupling pins could be inserted through a small hole in the grille to engage a bayonet socket on the forward end of the engine [[crankshaft]].  A quick-and-easy twist of the handle was sufficient to start the [[Ford flathead engine|flat head V8]], and the bayonet coupling was self-disengaging for safety.

==1941==
[[File:1941 ford super deluxe.png|left|thumb|1941 Ford Super Deluxe Convertible Coupe]]
Fords for 1941 were much more modern with a wide body that nearly covered the [[running board]]s. The front and rear fenders were still pronounced, but were now integrated more into the body and the headlights were pushed all the way up and out over the front wheels. The 1941 grille was a three-part affair with a tall center section bookended by twin kidneys low on the fenders and vertical bars all around. The 1941 was a bigger car with a 194.3-in (4.935-m) overall length and a width increased to 73.12-in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1941-1948 Ford Super DeLuxe |url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1941-1948-ford-super-deluxe1.htm |accessdate=10 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1941%20Ford/1941%20Ford%20Deluxe%20Foldout/image3.html&lt;/ref&gt; Body styles included two-door and four-door sedans, a sedan coupe, a business coupe, and convertible coupe, sedan delivery wagon, and woody station wagon. The Super Deluxe had several amenities of higher quality over the base models, including more chrome, leather seats, and a wood-grain dashboard.&lt;ref&gt;https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1941-1948-ford-super-deluxe2.html&lt;/ref&gt; The pickup truck continued with the 1940 standard Ford styling. Production of the 1941 models was disrupted by a sudden labor strike in April 1941; Henry Ford, having resisted unionization well after the rest of the American automobile industry accepted it, finally gave in and signed a contract with the [[UAW]].

==1942==
[[File:1942 Ford Super Deluxe.JPG|right|thumb|250px|1942 Ford Super Deluxe Tudor Sedan]]
The 1942 model year lasted only four months before the government ordered a halt to civilian automobile production starting on February 10, 1942. Changes were made to the car besides a three-part "electric shaver" grille &amp;mdash; and the parking lights were moved from the top of the fenders to between the grill and headlights.  Tail lights were enlarged and moved from vertical to horizontal. The frame was lowered and softer springs were used to improve the ride. The dashboard was changed, moving the radio from the top of the dash to low down, and the linear speedometer and clock were replaced with round ones.  The radio had an optional floor button so the driver could change preselected stations without using hands. War rationing required auto makers to black out their chrome trim - Ford used silver paint - and a special four-door model was produced with no chrome at all for military use.  The pickup received new styling, as well, with heavy vertical bars, and truck production lasted through March 3.

The 1942-style Ford cars certainly continued to be produced as military staff cars from March 1942 through summer 1945. These would have been registered as 1942, 1943, 1944, and 1945 models. Additionally, a large number of 1942 (and a few 1941) cars held in dealer stocks by government edict, to be doled out to essential users during the conflict, were Fords. Some states titled cars by the year of sale, so it is possible to find 1943, 1944, and 1945 models by virtue of their registrations and titles.

==1946==

[[File:'46 Ford Pickup (Auto classique Salaberry-De-Valleyfield '11).JPG|thumb|left|A 1946 Ford pickup.]]
Following the official surrender of Japan in September 1945, civilian car production slowly resumed. The 1946 Ford was identical to the 1942 model under the skin, though a heavy new grille with horizontal bars and red accents refreshed the styling. The hood was widened by adding a center strip. One notable change was to use the 239 CID engine which since 1939 had been used in Mercurys and trucks, and capable of 100&amp;nbsp;hp (75&amp;nbsp;kW) for the first time.  With steel in short supply, Ford produced a distinctive "Sportsman" convertible with wood side panels, supplied from the [[Ford Iron Mountain Plant]]. The convertible had an electric top instead of manual one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1946_Ford/1946_Ford_Brochure/1946%20Ford-15.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1946_Ford/1946_Ford_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1985 film ''[[Back to the Future]]'' and its sequel ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'', the car which [[Biff Tannen]] owns in 1955 was a black 1946 Ford Super De Luxe convertible. In BTTF 1, during the skateboard chase scene, note carefully the park lights: some shots are a 1946 model year, some are a 1947 model year. Looking at the "top boot" area shape, it appears the '47 is a real convertible and the '46 manure car is the removed top coupe.  During production, a black 1946 Ford Super De Luxe coupe had the top cut off to resemble a convertible. In BTTF 2, some trim is different suggesting a possible third car.  After the film, the car was kept by Universal and displayed in their back lot tour. The 1946 car is now in a private collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=theAFICIONAUTO |title=1946 Ford Coupe - BIFF'S BACK TO THE FUTURE FORD |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EZWiwSzMMY&amp;a |website=YouTube |accessdate=2019-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1947==
[[File:1947 Ford V8 76 Super De Luxe Convertible Club Coupe UWU575.jpg|thumb|right|A 1947 Ford convertible]]
The 1947 Ford line was similar to the short 1946.  Visual differences included the removal of the red accents from the grill and the two small lights located just above it. Ford began titling 1947s in February 1947. For the first few weeks, the 1947 model was identical to the 1946. Ford then restyled the body slightly first by moving the parking lights from above the grill to below each headlight. Exterior moldings were changed from grooved to a smooth design. A new hood ornament with a blue plastic insert was installed. A new hubcap design became available in March. The interior dash color was changed from red accent to gold.  By September, the roof-mounted antenna was moved to the cowl. Horns were moved to in front of the radiator from the engine compartment.  The final 1947 models were titled in November.

In the 1984 film ''[[The Karate Kid]]'', [[Kensuke Miyagi|Mr Miyagi]] gives Daniel Larusso a cream-colored 1947 Ford Super DeLuxe convertible&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Morrison |first1=Mac |title=Ralph Macchio Talks The Karate Kid’s ’47 Ford and Cobra Kai Season Two {{!}} Automobile Magazine |url=https://www.automobilemag.com/news/ralph-macchio-karate-kid-cobra-kai-interview-47-ford-convertible/ |website=Automobile |publisher=Automobile Magazine |accessdate=1 December 2019 |language=en |date=24 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a birthday gift. The car was actually a gift to [[Ralph Macchio]] from the film's producer. To this day, Macchio still owns the car.

==1948==
[[File:SC06 1948 Ford Woody.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A 1948 Ford [[Woodie (car body style)|woodie]] station wagon, the last of the all-wood bodied wagons]]
The final year for the old-style Ford was 1948, with an all-new model launched partway through the year.  The wood-sided Sportsman convertible, supplied by the [[Ford Iron Mountain Plant]], ended the year with just 28 built, and the all-wood bodies on the [[Woodie (car body style)|woody station wagons]] were replaced with steel for the 1949 season.  The old car-based trucks were replaced by the [[Ford F-Series|F-Series]] this year. With Ford in financial chaos during this period, sales fell well behind Chevrolet--Ford output for 1948 was 430,198 vehicles, only about 62% of Chevrolet's output, and Plymouth came close to knocking Ford from second place with an output of 412,540 vehicles.

==Australian production==
[[File:1946 Ford V8 Coupe Utility.JPG|thumb|[[Australian]]-built 1946 Ford V8 Coupe Utility]]
The 1941 Ford was also produced in Australia by [[Ford Australia]] in V8 sedan and V8 [[coupé utility]] models.&lt;ref name="Norm Darwin 1986, page 73"/&gt; Revised 1942 models followed, although only 138 examples were produced.&lt;ref&gt;Larry O'Toole, The Good Old Aussie Ute, 2000, page 57&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian production recommenced in 1946 with V8 Sedan, Coupe Utility and [[Panel van (Australia)|Panel Van]] models released&lt;ref&gt;Norm Darwin, The History of Ford in Australia, 1986, page 118&lt;/ref&gt; and minor updates followed in 1947 and 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Larry O'Toole, The Good Old Aussie Ute, 2000, pages 59 to 60&lt;/ref&gt; The Panel Van was discontinued in 1948 and the Sedan and Coupe Utility were replaced by the 1949 models in September 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Norm Darwin, The History of Ford in Australia, 1986, page 125&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] line''' of [[Automobile|cars]] was again refreshed for '''1952''', although remaining similar to the all-new [[1949 Ford]]s. This time, curved one-piece windshield glass joined a new "Mileage Maker" [[straight-6]] engine with 101&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref name="Flory Jr. 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Flory Jr.|first=J.

This design would continue through the 1954 model year, with an updated design offered in [[1955 Ford|1955]].

The model lines were again reshuffled, with the base model now called "[[Ford Mainline|Mainline]]" and mid-level called "[[Ford Customline|Customline]]".  The top "[[Ford Crestline|Crestline]]" included the "Sunliner" [[Convertible (car)|convertible]], and the "Victoria" [[hardtop]], a tradition going back to 1932 with the [[1932 Ford#1932|Ford Victoria]] 2-door coupe. The [[station wagon]] continued with the "Country Squire".  Inside was a "flight-style" control panel and new pedals suspended from below the dashboard. A voltmeter, gas gauge, temp. gauge, and oil pressure were standard.&lt;ref name="Flory Jr. 2008"/&gt; The clock and radio were in the center of the dash.  The grille sported a single center "bullet" surrounded by a chrome ring as well as "jet intake" corner markers. New trunk hinges were used that would not crush the contents of the trunk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1952_Ford/1952_Ford_Brochure/1952%20Ford-03.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1952_Ford/1952_Ford_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brake and clutch pedal were now suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1952_Ford/1952_Ford_Brochure/1952%20Ford-07.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1952_Ford/1952_Ford_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wheelbase was {{convert|115|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Flory Jr. 2008" /&gt;

1953 was Ford's 50th anniversary.&lt;ref name="Flory Jr. 2008" /&gt; The big news for 1953 was the availability of power-assisted brakes and steering, which had previously been limited to the [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] and [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]] lines.  The center grill bullet lost its ring and was now flanked by vertical black stripes, while the corner markers were plain rectangular lights rather than the circular "intakes".  All 1953 Fords featured commemorative steering wheels marking the company's 50th anniversary. Mechanical changes included two-inch wider tread, and a k-bar frame with five cross-members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Ford/1953_Ford/1953-Ford-Folder/1953-Ford-Folder-02-03 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227211030/http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Ford/1953_Ford/1953-Ford-Folder/1953-Ford-Folder-02-03 |archive-date=2015-02-27 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[William Clay Ford Sr.|William Clay Ford]] paced the [[Indianapolis 500]] in a Sunliner convertible with a dummy [[Continental tire]] kit (Coronado kit).&lt;ref name="Flory Jr. 2008"/&gt;  This was also the last year for real wood trim on the Country Squire wagon.

The long-lived flathead [[V8 engine]] was replaced for 1954 by a 239 cubic inch [[overhead valve]] ''[[Ford Y-block engine|Y-block]]'' unit, marking the end of an era.  This engine produced 130&amp;nbsp;hp (97&amp;nbsp;kW) with a two-barrel [[carburetor]]. An impressive 160&amp;nbsp;hp (119&amp;nbsp;kW) 256 CI version with a Holley four-barrel was available in the official-use-only law enforcement model.

==Australian production==
The 1952 Ford was also produced by [[Ford Australia]] from October 1952 to 1955. A four-door sedan was offered as the V8 Customline and a two-door [[coupe utility]] was marketed as the [[Ford Mainline|V8 Mainline Utility]]. Along with the general improvements for all 1952 Fords, the Australian-assembled model also got increased ground clearance to better cope with Australian road conditions.&lt;ref name=PLG1&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Portland Guardian | location = Portland, Victoria, Australia | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article64432858 | page =  | date = 1952-10-06 | title = New Ford V8 on display | volume = 109 | number = 90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Utility was developed by Ford Australia using the chassis of the US Ford two-door convertible. Both models were updated in 1953 and 1954 along the lines of the US Fords and were powered by a {{convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} iteration of the 3.9 litre [[Ford Flathead engine|Flathead]] [[V8 engine|V8]] which went into Australian production in 1952.&lt;ref name=PLG1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norm Darwin, The History of Ford in Australia, 1986, pages 126-131&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian 1954s (arriving in June 1954) retained the flathead V8 rather than the new overhead-valve unit used in the United States, but received some visual alterations mostly consisting of additional chrome. The bumpers were deeper, wraparound units, while the taillights were redesigned, a full length chrome strip was fitted along the side, and an airplane-shaped bonnet ornament was fitted. The interior was now available in either Vynex or leather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18425317 |title=Face Lift for 1954 Ford |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=28 June 1954 |volume = 124 | number = 36,354 | accessdate=13 January 2015 |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''1955 Ford''' is an [[automobile]] which was produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in the [[United States]] for the 1955 model year and, in revised form, for the 1956 model year.  A new design would be offered in [[1957 Ford|1957]].

==1955==
The American Ford line of [[Automobile|car]]s gained a new body for 1955 to keep up with surging [[Chevrolet]], although it remained similar to the [[1952 Ford]] underneath. The ''[[Ford Straight-6 engine|Mileage Maker]]'' [[Straight-six engine|I6]] was bumped up to 223&amp;nbsp;CID (3.7&amp;nbsp;L) for 120&amp;nbsp;hp (89&amp;nbsp;kW) and the new-for-1954 ''[[Ford Y-block engine|Y-block]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] was now offered in two sizes:  Standard Fords used a 272&amp;nbsp;CID (4.5&amp;nbsp;L) version with 162&amp;nbsp;hp (121&amp;nbsp;kW) with 2-barrel carburetor and single exhaust or 182&amp;nbsp;hp with 4-barrel carburetor and dual exhaust, but the large 292&amp;nbsp;CID (4.8&amp;nbsp;L) unit from the [[Ford Thunderbird (first generation)|Thunderbird]] was also offered, boasting 193&amp;nbsp;hp (144&amp;nbsp;kW).

Apart from the engine changes, customers were sure to notice the new [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Fairlane]], which replaced the Crestline as the top trim level, while a new [[Ford Crown Victoria|Crown Victoria]]-style featured a chrome "basket handle" across the familiar (and continued) "[[Victoria (carriage)|Victoria]]" hardtop roof, which originally appeared on the [[Mercury XM-800]] concept car. This use of a styling feature to visually separate the front of the passenger compartment from the rear reappeared on the 1977-1979 [[Ford Thunderbird (seventh generation)|Ford Thunderbird]], the [[Ford Fairmont]] Futura and [[Mercury Zephyr]] Z-7 coupes.  The company now marketed three different rooflines on its two-door models; the tall two-pillar Mainline, [[Ford Customline|Customline]], and Fairlane sedans, pillarless hardtop Fairlane Victoria and the chrome-pillar Fairlane Crown Victoria. The Fairlane Crown Victoria was also offered with a transparent "skylighted" top.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1955_Ford/1955_Ford_Brochure/dirindex.html 1955 Ford brochure, page 4, www.oldcarbrochures.com] Retrieved 24 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; New brakes were used {{convert|11|in|mm|adj=on}} drums.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1955"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1955_Ford/1955_Ford_Foldout/1955%20Ford%20Foldout-05.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1955_Ford/1955_Ford_Foldout |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Fords had a new frame, but still with five cross members.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1955"/&gt;

The Fords introduced for 1955 also featured the panoramic windshields found on [[Oldsmobile]]s, [[Buick]]s and [[Cadillac]]s the previous year.
With this panoramic windshield the A-pillars have a vertical angle.
this gives the driver more panoramic visibility.

For the first time, Ford offered [[seat belts]] as a dealer option (not factory installed, with instructions provided by a Service Bulletin).&lt;ref&gt;[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1955-1956-ford-fairlane-crown-victoria4.htm 1955-1956 Ford Fairlane Crown Victoria] Retrieved from auto.howstuffworks.com&lt;/ref&gt; Also new for 1955 was Ford's first factory installed [[air conditioning|air conditioner]]. This “Select Aire” option featured an integrated heater core and evaporator coil unit within the dash and cold air discharge vents located on top of the dash &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.ebay.com/Classic-Car-Air-Conditioning-of-the-1950-apos-s_W0QQugidZ10000000001544296 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080829225608/http://reviews.ebay.com/Classic-Car-Air-Conditioning-of-the-1950-apos-s_W0QQugidZ10000000001544296 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-08-29 |title=Classic Car Air Conditioning of the 1950s! |publisher=eBay.com |df= }} Retrieved from reviews.ebay.com on 16&amp;nbsp;February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; on either side of the radio speaker. The "Select Aire" design was carried over to the 1956 models &lt;ref&gt;[http://storm.oldcarmanualproject.com/ford/fairlane/1956/56Ffl-16-17.jpg Ford’s new Select Aire Conditioner –1956 Ford Fairlane sales brochure, page 17] Retrieved from storm.oldcarmanualproject.com on 16&amp;nbsp;February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; with slightly different cold air vents in the same location as on the 1955 models. The condenser was mounted in front of the radiator as in later cars.

The 1955 Fords were marketed under separate names for each of the three trim levels: [[Ford Mainline]], [[Ford Customline]] and [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Ford Fairlane]]. Station wagons were offered as a separate series for the first time for 1955.&lt;ref name=gunnell&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975, revised 4th edition.Krause Publications, Iola, WI, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p 395}} The [[Ford Ranch Wagon|Ranch Wagon]] and Custom Ranch Wagon were 2 door wagons while the Country Sedan and [[Ford Country Squire|Country Squire]] models were 4 door wagons, the latter featuring wooden appliqué side mouldings.&lt;ref name=gunnell/&gt;{{rp|pp 394–395}} A [[sedan delivery]] variant was marketed as the [[Ford Courier]].

The eggcrate grille featured on the 1955 cars was widened into a series of rectangles for 1956, but this subtle exterior change was nothing compared to Ford's adoption of a 12-volt electrical system, with a six volt system optional. The [[Ford Crown Victoria Skyliner|Crown Victoria Skyliner]]'s sales were plummeting with just 603 made, and it would be replaced by a convertible the next year.  A new addition at midyear was the "Town Victoria" 4-door hardtop model which, along with the new [[Ford Customline|Customline Victoria]] 2-door hardtop, were meant to compete with the [[Chevrolet Bel Air]] and [[Plymouth Belvedere]]. The Parklane, a Fairlane trimmed Tudor station wagon, was added to compete with the [[Chevrolet Nomad]]. There were new convenience options, such as  a new air-conditioner system, a new heater, and a nine-tube signal-seeking radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Ford/1956-Ford/1956-Ford-Folder/1956-Ford-Foldout-03 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227222526/http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Ford/1956-Ford/1956-Ford-Folder/1956-Ford-Foldout-03 |archive-date=2015-02-27 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of gauges, instrument cluster warning lights for oil pressure and [[ammeter]] were standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1956%20Ford/1956_Ford_Owners_Manual/1956%20Ford%20Owners%20Manual-10.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1956 Ford/1956_Ford_Owners_Manual |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victoria hardtop coupes now adopted the lower, sleeker roofline used by both 1955 and 1956 Crown Victoria,  sans the wide chrome roof trim.

The [[Lifeguard (automobile safety)|Lifeguard]] safety package — consisting of seat belts, a padded dashboard, safety door locks,  a deep-dish steering wheel, and a breakaway rearview mirror — was introduced.&lt;ref name="Flory Jr. 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Flory Jr.|first=J.

The 1955 Ford was also produced by [[Ford Australia]] which offered it as a [[V8 engine|V8]] Customline 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] and as a V8 Mainline 2-door [[coupe utility]].&lt;ref name=ndarwin&gt;Norm Darwin, The History of Ford in Australia, Eddie Ford Publications, Newstead Vic 1986&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp 131–132}} The latter body style was developed in Australia utilising an imported convertible chassis strengthened for load carrying.&lt;ref name=ndarwin/&gt;{{rp|p 136}} A limited number of Customline wagons was also built.&lt;ref name=ndarwin/&gt;{{rp|p 137}}

The 1955 model was the first Australian Ford to receive the new overhead-valve "Y-block" V8 engine, and went on sale at the end of July 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article103937044 |title=Many changes in 1955 Ford |newspaper=[[The Western Herald, Bourke|Western Herald]] |location=Bourke, NSW |date=29 July 1955 |accessdate=13 January 2015 |page=14 | volume =  | number =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian Customlines and Mainlines received the 1956 US Ford facelift and then further makeovers in 1957 and 1958 with the final series utilizing the grille from 1955 [[Meteor (automobile)|Meteor]] of [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=ndarwin/&gt;{{rp|pp 131–132}} The 1957s, introduced in September 1957, were also available with the Fordomatic automatic transmission, and local parts content had been increased to 80&amp;nbsp;percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ford will be 85% Australian | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article132135512?searchTerm=ford%201957&amp;searchLimits= | newspaper = The Cumberland Argus | publisher = Cumberland Newspapers, Ltd. | date = 11 September 1957 | accessdate = 27 December 2015 | location = Parramatta, NSW | page = 16 | number = 3899 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''mainstream [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] line''' of [[Automobile|car]]s grew substantially larger for '''1957''', a model which lasted through 1959.  The [[Ford Crown Victoria|Crown Victoria]] with its flashy chrome "basket handle" was no more, and the [[acrylic glass]]-roofed [[Ford Crown Victoria Skyliner|Crown Victoria Skyliner]] was replaced by a new model, the retracting-roof hardtop [[Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner|Skyliner]].

The new chassis allowed the floor to be placed much lower, which in turn led to a lower and longer look overall. The major component of this chassis was a [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]] whose pinion gear was exceptionally low relative to the axleshafts, lower than in conventional [[hypoid]] differentials.

==1957==
The 1957 models retained a single-headlight front end like their predecessors, but were unmistakable with their long flanks and [[Car tailfin|tailfin]]s.  A plethora of trim lines was introduced, starting with the base "Custom", "Custom 300", "Fairlane", and top-line "Fairlane 500".  The two Custom lines used a 116&amp;nbsp;in (2946&amp;nbsp;mm) wheelbase, while the Fairlanes had 118&amp;nbsp;in (2997&amp;nbsp;mm) between the wheels.  A new car/[[pickup truck]] hybrid based on the short-wheelbase chassis was also introduced, the [[Ford Ranchero|Ranchero]].

The 223&amp;nbsp;CID (3.7&amp;nbsp;L) ''[[Ford Straight-6 engine|OHV]]'' [[Straight-6]] continued, now with 144&amp;nbsp;hp (107&amp;nbsp;kW).  The [[V8 engine|V8]] lineup included a 272&amp;nbsp;CID (4.5&amp;nbsp;L) ''[[Ford Y-block engine|Y-block]]'' making 190&amp;nbsp;hp (142&amp;nbsp;kW), a 292&amp;nbsp;CID (4.8&amp;nbsp;L) ''[[Ford Y-block engine|Thunderbird]]'' version making 212&amp;nbsp;hp (158&amp;nbsp;kW), a 312 cubic inch V8 making 245 HP and a [[supercharged]] 312&amp;nbsp;CID (5.1&amp;nbsp;L) ''[[Ford Y-block engine|Thunderbird Special]]'' making {{Convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, and designated "Police Interceptor" on the glove box.  Two dual 4 barrel versions of the naturally aspirated (non-supercharged) 312 cubic inch V8 rated at 270 and 285 HP  were  available. The 270 HP version had the same cam as all the other V-8's but had vibration dampers on the valve springs. The 285 HP engine had a racing cam and was only available to NASCAR and possibly other racers.  This option was dubbed "E code" and was available in all body types. It came standard with the deep-dish steering wheel. The radio had a transistorized audio output stage for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1957_Ford/1957_Ford_Full_Line_Brochure/1957%20Ford%20Brochure-07.html&lt;/ref&gt; There were lights for the generator and oil instead of gauges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1957_Ford/1957_Ford_Full_Line_Brochure/1957%20Ford%20Brochure-07.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1957_Ford/1957_Ford_Full_Line_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controls became reccesed for more safety (the [[Lifeguard (automobile safety)|Lifeguard]] safety package was still available)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1957_Ford/1957_Ford_Fairlane_Brochure/1957%20Ford%20Fairlane-16-17.html | title = Directory Index: Ford/1957_Ford/1957_Ford_Fairlane_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new frame was used for the 1957 Fords. It moved to perimeter rails out, so that they would fully envelope the passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1957_Ford/1957_Ford_Fairlane_Brochure/1957%20Ford%20Fairlane-18-19.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1957_Ford/1957_Ford_Fairlane_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey of 1957 Ford owners in the March, 1957 issue of [[Popular Mechanics]], only 6.2% of owners ordered seat belts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IOEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Popular Mechanics|publisher=Hearst Magazines|date=March 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This model was very successful, being the best selling car in America, overtaking arch rival Chevrolet for the first time since 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Markus|first1=Frank|title=Six Decades of Best Selling Cars|url=http://www.motortrend.ca/en/news/six-decades-of-best-selling-cars/|website=Motor Trend|publisher=Motor Trend|accessdate=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The line was freshened with a simulated hood scoop and dual-headlight front clip for 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flory, Jr.|first=J.

Engines were also updated, with the 272&amp;nbsp;CID dropped, the 292&amp;nbsp;CID making 205&amp;nbsp;hp (153&amp;nbsp;kW), and a new-generation 332&amp;nbsp;CID (5.4&amp;nbsp;L) ''[[Ford FE engine|FE]]'' V8 rated at 240 HP in 2 barrel form and 265 HP in 4 barrel "Interceptor" form.  The new 352 cubic inch V8, also dubbed "Interceptor" and rated at 300&amp;nbsp;hp (224&amp;nbsp;kW) made its debut.  Galaxie production was started in [[Lorain, Ohio]] at Ford's [[Lorain Assembly]] plant for 1958 and continued through 1959 with 102,869 Galaxies produced there. Air suspension became optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1958_Ford/1958%20Ford%20Fairlane%20Brochure/1958%20Ford%20Fairlane-12.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1958_Ford/1958 Ford Fairlane Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convertible version of Ford Fairlane 500, Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner (also called Skyliner Retractable Convertible), had been sold for three years - 1957, 1958, and 1959. It was the most expensive vehicle offered by Ford. The 1958 Skyliner sold for $3,163 while the standard convertible sold for $2,650 and the sedan went for $2,055. A total of 14,713 units were produced in 1958. Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner weighed 4,609-pounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z9167/Ford-Fairlane-500-Skyliner.aspx 1958 Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==1959==
The top-line spot for 1959 was the new '''[[Ford Galaxie|Galaxie]]''', positioned above the continued Fairlane 500. The Custom line was dropped, with Custom 300 the lowest rung on the ladder, and all 1959 Fords used the long 118&amp;nbsp;in (2997&amp;nbsp;mm) wheelbase. New for safety was fully padded armrests and rear door locks that were child proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1959_Ford/1959_Ford_Brochure_1/1959%20Ford-10.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1959_Ford/1959_Ford_Brochure_1 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; American prices ranged from the mid-1,000 to the low 3,000s.

This version was also assembled in Australia, beginning in late 1959. Local models were the luxurious Fairlane 500, the lower-priced Custom 300 (both sedans), as well as the [[Ford Ranch Wagon|Ranch Wagon]].&lt;ref name=Cumberland&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131620424 |title=Sedan, Ranch Wagon |newspaper=[[Cumberland Argus|The Cumberland Argus]] |location=Parramatta, NSW |date=30 September 1959 |accessdate=18 January 2015 |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian models were powered by the {{convert|332|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} "Thunderbird" engine, producing 204&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref name=Cumberland/&gt; For 1960, the range was updated with the grille and trim from the 1959 Canadian [[Meteor (car)|Meteor]].&lt;ref&gt;Norm Darwin, The History of Ford in Australia, 1986, page 136&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ford Model K''' is an upscale [[automobile]] that was produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. It was introduced in 1906 and replaced the earlier [[Ford Model B (1904)|Model B]]. It was built at the [[Ford Piquette Avenue Plant]]. The model K was aimed at the top end of the market and featured an [[inline-6]] (the only Ford six until [[1941 Ford|1941]]) giving 40&amp;nbsp;hp (30&amp;nbsp;kW). The wheelbase was 120 in (2896&amp;nbsp;mm) and could be ordered either as a touring or roadster model.

Contrary to popular folklore, the Model K was a good seller for Ford Motor Company.  In 1906, the first year it was offered, the Model K produced over 85 percent of Ford Motor Company's new car profit (1906 Ford Motor Company internal audit records).  

[[File:1907 Ford Model K 6-40 Roadster.jpg|thumb|1907 Ford Model K 6-40 Roadster]]
In 1907, the second sales year of the Model K, almost 500 examples were sold, making it the best-selling six-cylinder model in the world.

As period journals reported, Ford Motor Company went in another direction, moving to one chassis, a mid-priced car, the [[Model T]], leaving the multi-line business model used by most auto makers of the period.  However, sales and profits from the Model K helped Ford Motor Company become the largest automaker in number of sales in 1907, and along with the Model N, was the only Ford model sold through three model years (1906–1908) prior to the advent of the Model T.

The '''Ford Ranchero''' is a [[coupe utility]] that was produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] between 1957 and 1979. Unlike a [[pickup truck]], the Ranchero was adapted from a two-door [[station wagon]] platform that integrated the cab and cargo bed into the body. A total of 508,355 units were produced during the model's production run.&lt;ref name="dc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dearbornclassics.com/ranchero.html |title=Ford Ranchero History and Production Figures |publisher=Dearborn Classics |accessdate=2009-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over its lifespan it was variously derived from full-sized, compact, and intermediate automobiles sold by Ford for the [[North American]] market.

During the 1970s, the Ranchero name was used in the [[South Africa]]n market for a rebadged [[Ford_Falcon_(Australia)#Falcon_utility|Australian Ford&amp;nbsp;Falcon&amp;nbsp;utility]]. Shipped from Australia in [[complete knock down]] (CKD) form, these vehicles were assembled in South Africa at Ford's plant in [[Port Elizabeth]].&lt;ref name=moby302&gt;[http://www.moby302.co.za/cars/1972_xa/ranchero.html 1972 Ranchero Bakkie - Australian XA Falcon Ute] Retrieved on 8 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Argentina]], a utility version of the [[Ford Falcon (Argentina)|locally produced Ford Falcon]] was also called Ranchero.&lt;ref name="Todo Falcon 1973"&gt;{{cite web|title=FORD FALCON 1973|url=http://todofalcon.com.ar/falcon73.htm|publisher=Todo Falcon|accessdate=16 October 2011|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Ranchero sold well enough to spawn a competitor from [[General Motors]] in 1959, the [[Chevrolet El Camino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chevrolet El Camino|url=http://www.oldride.com/library/chevrolet_el_camino.html|publisher=OldRide.com|accessdate=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first [[Ford Model T]] and [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Model A]] pickup trucks were created from roadsters by placing a pickup box behind the body of a car. In 1934, [[Ford Australia]]'s designer Lew Bandt modified a [[coupe]] with a smoothly integrated loadbed that could be used like a car to drive to church or to deliver pigs to market. This created the [[coupe utility]] which remains a popular body style known as the "ute" in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/dimensions/dimensions_future/Transcripts/s779287.htm |title=The First Ute Broadcast 06/02/2003 |publisher=Abc.net.au |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, pickup trucks evolved into a heavier duty form with cabs and beds that were quite distinct from passenger automobiles. The Ranchero was the first postwar American vehicle of its type adapted from a popular sedan from the factory. It combined the sleek looks of a sedan with the utility of a light-duty pickup truck.

Introduced in December 1956, three months after the traditional September model year start-up, the Ranchero was based on the standard and new-for-1957 full-sized [[1957 Ford|Ford]] platform, specifically the short-wheelbase [[Ford Custom|Custom]] sedan, two-door [[Ford Ranch Wagon|Ranch Wagon]] [[station wagon]], and utilitarian [[Ford Courier|Courier]] [[sedan delivery]]. Essentially a Courier with an open, reinforced bed, its own unique rear window and integrated cab and cargo box, the Ranchero was initially offered in two trim levels, and throughout the model run, was built on the corresponding automobile assembly line, but sold as a truck through Ford's truck division. An extremely basic standard model was marketed to traditional pickup truck buyers such as farmers, and the Custom  picked up most of the options and accessories available on the [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Fairlane]] line, including stainless steel bodyside mouldings and two-tone paint. Upscale models were badged both as a Fairlane and Ranchero, with a stylized representation of a [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|Longhorn]] as the symbol for the model located on the tailgate. Indeed, print advertising of the time played on the theme of the [[American Southwest]] that the Spanish model name and Longhorn symbol were meant to evoke, showing artistic representations of the vehicle being used in ranching and outdoor activities, proclaiming it as "More Than A Car!  More Than A Truck!"  The Ranchero was a hit with both the automotive press and the buying public, filling an untapped market niche for vehicles with the utility of a light pickup and the ease of operation and riding characteristics of a car. In fact, the Ranchero had a marginally higher cargo capacity by about 50 lb (23&amp;nbsp;kg) than the half-ton [[Ford F-Series|F-Series]] pickup. Both standard and Custom could be ordered with any engine available for Ford cars, all the way up to the {{convert|312|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} "Thunderbird Special". In Canada, the Ranchero was also available in the [[Meteor (car)|Meteor]] line-up.  Seat belts and padded instrument panels were optional.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1957"/&gt;

In 1960, the Ranchero became much smaller, based on Ford's compact [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Falcon]], specifically the two-door sedan delivery variant. The popularity of small, economical cars like the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] perpetuated a shift in thinking among the three largest American manufacturers; 1959 had the introduction of the 1960 Falcon along with the 1960 [[Chevrolet Corvair]] and [[Plymouth Valiant]]. A pickup version of the [[Volkswagen Type 2|Volkswagen Bus]] and [[Chevrolet Greenbrier|a van based on the Chevrolet Corvair]] were offered, as well. The economic recession of the late 1950s also certainly played a role. Ford believed the market wanted a more practical vehicle, one much smaller, lighter, and cheaper than a full-sized [[pickup truck]], and indeed the Ranchero sold well in this incarnation. Now marketed in print as the "Falcon Ranchero", the new vehicle's standard powerplant was an economical {{convert|144|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[straight-6]].  In 1961, the {{convert|170|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} straight-6 was offered, and in 1963, the optional {{convert|260|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 was offered in addition to the 144 and 170.  The two-speed [[Ford-O-Matic]] [[automatic transmission]] (offered between 1960 and 1963) or three-speed C4 [[Cruise-O-Matic]] could be ordered as could a three-speed [[manual transmission]]. The Ranchero had an 800-lb load capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford_Ranchero/1961_Ford_Ranchero_Foldout/1961%20Ford%20Ranchero%20Foldout-04.html |title=Directory Index: Ford_Ranchero/1961_Ford_Ranchero_Foldout |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three almost entirely different coupé utility bodies were available for this generation of Falcon: the Australian Falcon Ute differed in having a shorter rear overhang than North American models, a cargo box that extended farther forward than the rear window, and shorter doors, while the Argentinian version also shared the sedan's overall length and short "four-door" doors, adding higher and more squared-off cargo box sides.

The Ranchero evolved along with the Falcon in 1964, becoming just a little larger along with its parent and using the same basic body style for 1964 and 1965. In 1965, the {{convert|289|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 replaced the discontinued 260 and an [[Alternator (automotive)|alternator]] replaced the [[Electrical generator#Vehicle-mounted generators|generator]] in all Ford cars.

The 1966 version was a one-year model, when Falcon and Fairlane were redeveloped on the same basic platform, one which did not include the sedan delivery, as 1965 marked the final year of sedan delivery production.  Instead, the 1966 Ranchero used Falcon front sheet metal, trim, and interior accents on a modified station wagon platform although Rancheros made late in the '66 model year had the same front clip as the Fairlane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://momentcar.com/images/ford-ranchero-1966-7.jpg 1966 Ford Ranchero with Fairlane front clip] Retrieved from momentcar.com 7/23/2017&lt;/ref&gt;  Engines available were the {{convert|170|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} I6, {{convert|200|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} I6, and two- and four-barrel versions of the {{convert|289|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8. Transmissions choices ranged from the C4 three-speed automatic to the three-speed column-shifted manual. The 1966 model was marketed simply as the Ford Ranchero,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5wbD4Nq1b?url=http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=400190413370&amp;viewitem= 1966 Ford Ranchero brochure] Retrieved from www.webcitation.org on 19 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and did not carry Falcon badges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westcoastfalcons.com/scff/histriv/fordfact13.htm 1966 FORD FALCON PRODUCTION FIGURES] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202101703/http://westcoastfalcons.com/scff/histriv/fordfact13.htm |date=2010-12-02 }} Retrieved from www.westcoastfalcons.com on 19 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Seat belts were standard.&lt;ref name="gunnell1993"/&gt;

The 1967 Ranchero, based on the post-'66 Falcon/Fairlane chassis, used the basic 1966 Ranchero body with Fairlane trim, front sheet metal, and interior treatments instead of Falcon. It was marketed as the Fairlane Ranchero.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/autohistorian/4892430707/ 1967 Ford Fairlane Ranchero advertisement] Retrieved from www.flickr.com on 19 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

This was a well-received and unique one-year vehicle, with clean, straight lines, dual stacked headlamps, and plenty of power; the Ranchero had entered the [[muscle car]] arena in 1967.  Engine options started with a {{convert|200|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} straight-6 and went up to a {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford FE engine|FE-series]] V8 giving {{convert|315|bhp|kW|1|abbr=on}} and backed by an optional [[Ford C6 transmission|C6]] automatic, the new-for-1966 heavy duty variant of the C4. The '67 also had the largest expansion of trim levels since the vehicle's introduction 10 years prior. Supplementing the base model were the new Ranchero 500, 500/XL, and GT. The GT-A, Ford's label for '66 and '67 automatic transmission-equipped GTs given to both the Fairlane and Mustang, did not apply to the Ranchero.

What did apply to all American cars in 1967 was the use of a dual-circuit braking system with a dual-chambered [[master cylinder]].  Increased awareness of passenger safety resulted in such innovations as safety-padded windshield pillars and an unusual 1967-only safety pad which protruded from the center of the three-spoked steering wheel to a point just beyond the rim of the steering wheel.  It was designed to minimize abdominal injuries in the event of a collision.

In 1968, the Fairlane line was supplemented by the new [[Ford Torino|Torino]], and the Ranchero followed suit, becoming the largest model since the full-sized 1959. Overall, the new Ranchero was not only bigger, but also more angular than before with its more horizontal grille and horizontal headlamps; Ford and other automakers were making a switch back to horizontal quad headlamps. The interior was all new, as well, sharing the Torino/Fairlane's distinctive four-pod instrument cluster. Though the four round pods gave the illusion of an engine-turned dash, viewed from left to right, they instead featured warning lights for coolant temperature (both cold and hot) and the left turn signal indicator in the left pod with the speedometer in the second pod directly in front of the driver. Warning lights for the charging system and oil pressure, as well as the right turn signal indicator, were located third from the left. In upscale models, this pod was supplanted by a tachometer. An optional clock filled the fourth pod; a decorative "clock delete" panel otherwise filled the space. A seat belt warning light was a new feature, too, lighting briefly in the far left pod whenever the engine was started. The model line also featured wraparound front [[Automotive lighting|side marker lamps]] which doubled as parking lights and rear side reflectors, newly mandated by [[FMVSS 108|US law]] for the 1968 model year.

[[File:Ford Scrambler (Ranchero Concept) 1969.jpg|left|thumb|1969 Ford Scrambler (Ranchero Concept)]] 
Three trim levels were offered, beginning with the sparsely trimmed base Ranchero, the Ranchero 500 trimmed like the corresponding Fairlane 500, and the top-of-the line Ranchero GT with its Torino GT trim.  Engine choices began with the 250 cubic inch I6 and ran to several V8 choices, including the standard 289 with two-barrel carburetor, and the FE-based 390. The powerful {{convert|428|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford FE engine#428 Cobra Jet|Cobra Jet]], another FE derivative and the largest engine offered in the Ranchero to date, was a mid-1968 option.  The 1968 model marked the final year of production of the 289; a {{convert|302|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with two-barrel carburetor became the standard V8 in 1969.  Two new upmarket engine choices were available, the [[351 Windsor]] with two- and four-barrel carburetion.  The FMX automatic was available with both, which was a variant of the old Cruise-o-Matic and was offered exclusively with either 351.

Like the Torino/Fairlane, the Ranchero could be had with virtually all of the same options as its cousins, including air conditioning, bucket seats, center console, AM/FM radio, optional wheels, front power disc brakes, hood scoop (standard on GT), and even a vinyl top.  Changes across the 1969 model line were slight and included a flatter three-piece grille less the horizontal crossbar and Ford crest, relocation of GT grille badging from the crest to the lower right corner of the grille as viewed from the front, a change from black-faced instruments with white numerals to brushed aluminum with black numerals and a slimmer, two-spoke steering wheel pad similar to those across the Ford product line, unlike the wheel with its broader "safety pad" and separate horn ring used in the 1968 intermediates and compacts.  While the pad may have changed, the horn ring did not.  The only change unique to the Ranchero was the relocation of the "Ranchero" script from the rear quarter panels to the front fenders.

A little-known and extremely rare offering in 1969 was the Rio Grande. Available on special order, this was essentially a GT in the so-called "Grabber" colors of "Wimbledon White", "Poppy Red" or "Calypso Coral", partially blacked-out hood with scoop, side stripes, bed rails, vinyl top, and unique "Ford Ranchero Rio Grande" wheel centers. As a result, Rancheros so equipped received Ford's "Special Performance Vehicle" identification on the data plate regardless of engine choice. These vehicles may be identified by the aforementioned designation, as well as a blank space where the trim code would normally be found. Production figures are unclear, but may have been around 900 total units.

At the Detroit motor show in 1969  was shown a concept car Ford Scrambler, some elements of which were used in the next models of Ford Ranchero.

While Chevrolet's [[Chevrolet El Camino|El Camino]] used the same body from 1968 to 1972, 1970 had a complete restyle for the Ranchero, which had started with a boxy body style. Both the Torino and Ranchero featured a shallow-pointed grille and front end with smooth, somewhat more curvaceous lines influenced by [[coke bottle styling]].  A fourth trim option was made available in 1970.  The Ranchero Squire was an upmarket trim package which featured a woodgrain applique similar to that found on the [[Ford Country Squire|Country Squire]] station wagon.  Like in previous years, all Torino trim and engine options could be ordered, including all-new Ram-Air 429 Cobra Jet or Super Cobra Jet engines (7&amp;nbsp;L) with the new "shaker" hood scoop, so named because it was directly mounted to the carburetor and shook with the engine at idle. Also available was a stylish grille that featured hide-away headlamps, as well as an optional hood with an oversized scoop which was standard on Torino GTs. The 1971 is distinguished by a grille divided by a center section.

A minor but nevertheless important variation debuted with the 1970 model.  Prior to 1970, no Ranchero had any interior badging identifying it as such.  With the 1970 model came a "Ranchero" or "Ranchero GT" badge on the glove compartment rather than Fairlane or Torino badging.

In 1972, a radical change occurred in the Torino and Ranchero lines. The sleek, pointy look of the previous year's model was replaced with a larger, heavier design. Most prominent was a wide semioval grille reminiscent of a jet intake and a new body-on-frame design. Three models were still available; the now-standard 500, the new Squire with [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] "paneling" along the flanks, and the sporty GT. Engine choices remained basically the same beginning with the 250 cubic-inch six-cylinder and a selection of V8s that ranged from the standard 302 to Cleveland and Windsor series 351s, plus the new-for-1972 400. The 385-series V8 (the 429 for 1972-73; the 460 for 1974-76) was still available. However, all suffered from lower compression ratios to better meet new emissions standards. The {{convert|351|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford Cleveland engine|Cleveland]] could still be obtained in tuned 4-V Cobra Jet form through 1974. A four-speed manual transmission was available on Cobra Jet-powered GT models.

The 1973 Ranchero had a redesigned front end to meet new federal standards for front impact protection. Aside from slight cosmetic differences, the Ranchero remained basically the same until the Torino's final year, 1976.

With the Torino ending production after 1976, the 1977 Ranchero was restyled in line with the [[Ford LTD II]] mid-sized car line which replaced the Torino using the same platform. The same three models available since 1968 were still offered and the Ranchero could be ordered in quite luxurious form. Engines fitted went up to the {{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}.
Production ceased in 1979 with, among the traditional choices, a commemorative "1979½" model. Although the LTD II-based Ranchero was not produced for many model years, this body style with stacked rectangular headlamps is among the most popular among collectors. This generation of Ranchero is often customized by swapping onto it any front end clip from a 1972–1976 [[Mercury Montego]], 1974–1979 [[Mercury Cougar]] or 1977–1979 [[Ford Thunderbird (seventh generation)|Ford Thunderbird]] which all have interchangeable front end parts that easily bolt into place.

Cars were getting smaller and increasing government restrictions, and requirements on a car-based pickup truck made such a vehicle less and less attractive from a manufacturing standpoint. Meanwhile, purpose-designed light trucks had to meet much less stringent requirements for emissions and fuel economy. Ford saw the way the market was going and decided small light trucks were the wave of the future, beginning with the [[Mazda]]-built [[Ford Courier|Courier]] pickup. This vehicle would be a "stepping stone" during which time Ford would develop their homegrown replacement, the  [[Ford Ranger|Ranger]].

==Argentine Ranchero==
From 1973 to 1991, [[Ford Motor Company of Argentina|Ford Motor Argentina]] developed and sold a utility version of [[Ford Falcon (Argentina)|its own Ford Falcon]] called the Ford Ranchero. Unlike the American version, it was based on the four-door sedan model, keeping the front part "as is", and knocking down the rear half to make it a light pick-up. The truck was presented in two versions, the light one with a maximum load capacity of 465 kg (1025 lb) and the heavy one with a capacity of 565 kg (1245 lb), both with 14-inch wheels and having the latter front disc brake. The first generation sold very well, and in 1974, exports began to [[Cuba]]. Later that year, it became the best-selling car in Argentina, with a total of 110,382 sold between 1973 and 1978.&lt;ref name="Todo Falcon 1973"/&gt; Production of the second-generation model lasted from 1978 to 1982, and production of the third generation lasted from 1982 to 1987. In 1987, the fourth and final generation was released and in 1988 a [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] model was added to the lineup for the first time, but it was discontinued as of 1989. Production of the fourth-generation Argentine Ranchero ended in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FORD MOTOR ARGENTINA S.A.|url=http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/f/ford_ranchero.htm|publisher=Coche Argentino|accessdate=16 October 2011|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present day==
Rancheros are reasonably collectible, though they are nowadays often overlooked in favor of the later-arriving [[Chevrolet El Camino]], which stayed in production eight more years. Miniatures, apart from hand-cast resin kits from cottage-industry makers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.motorcityresincasters.com/72ranchero.htm|title=72' Ranchero Trans-Kit|author=Motor City Resin Casters}}&lt;/ref&gt; are rare.  Several [[Revell]] offerings of the 1957 model in both 1/32 and 1/25 scale have been offered over the years, as has a kit of the 1961 Ranchero by [[Ertl Company|AMT/Ertl]].  A well-detailed promotional model of 1959 intended for distribution by dealers was offered both with and without interior trim, windows, and [[friction drive]] by AMT/Ertl's predecessor, SMP; resin castings of this model's body are offered by the aforementioned cottage industries, as well.  [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]] produced a 1961 Ford Ranchero for the 2018 line.  [[Johnny Lightning]] makes a 1964 model, [[Hot Wheels]] made an adult collectible '57 in a limited run.  In 2009 [[Hot Wheels]] produced a '72 Ford Ranchero that is still in production today.  [[Hot Wheels]] also introduced (in 2011) the '65 Ford Ranchero that has a hard tonneau cover on the bed, and an opening in the hood that reveals the engine beneath.  [[Racing Champions]] made a 1/64 scale 1957 Ranchero and AMT/Ertl currently produces a diecast '57 which doubles as a bank.  AMT was responsible for other early dealer promotional models, too, including those of the aforementioned El Camino.  [[Tonka]] produced a resin toy version of the 1968-69 model in roughly 1/24 scale as part of an auto transporter set; the front end of that toy arguably resembles the 1969 model more closely. In 2019, Greenlight Collectibles introduced 1972 and 1976 Ranchero models in 1/64 scale. The 1979 Ranchero was made as a 1/18 scale resin model by BOS (Best Of Show) Models.

The idea of a car-based pickup remains an attractive one and is an illustration of how favorable treatment for light trucks over cars by United States regulations skews the marketplace. Many Ranchero and El Camino owners, indeed, stopped buying new vehicles when those models were discontinued. [[Aftermarket (automotive)|Aftermarket]] conversions of the [[Ford Fairmont|Fairmont Futura]] and [[Mercury Zephyr|Mercury Zephyr Z7]] sport coupes to a Ranchero-like "[[Ford Durango|Durango]]" pickup were sold in select Ford dealers in the early- to mid-1980s. Recently, interest in producing such vehicles again has grown, including those like the [[Subaru Baja]], essentially an [[Subaru Outback|Outback]] station wagon with a stubby pickup bed instead of an enclosed cargo area. The Baja, like the Ranchero, is titled in most American states and Canadian provinces as a commercial vehicle. Until the late-2000s, the North American market tended to lean towards compact and midsized crew-cab four-door pickups such as the [[Ford Explorer Sport Trac]] and [[Chevrolet Colorado]]. However, with the compact pickups having grown towards midsized and encroaching on base models of more profitable full-sized pickups, some manufacturers such as Ford and [[Ram Trucks]] have discontinued even their compact and midsized offerings; Ford discontinued the [[Ford Ranger (Americas)|American Ranger]] in 2012 and originally opted not to sell its [[Ford Ranger (T6)|global replacement]] in North America due to being too close in size and price to the base model [[Ford F-Series|Ford F-150]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/trucks/1010_2012_ford_ranger_first_look/viewall.html MotorTrend.com ''First Look: 2012 Ford Ranger - 90 Percent of an F-150, 100 Percent Not Coming Here''] - Benson Kong, 15 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; though did eventually introduce it for the 2019 model year.&lt;ref name="2019 Ranger"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/ranger/2019/2019-ford-ranger-first-look-review/|title=2019 Ford Ranger First Look: Welcome Home|date=January 14, 2018|work=Motor Trend|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, Ford produced a right-hand drive car-based "pickup", with the [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|FG X Falcon Ute]] available in style-side or tray-back form. Production of Falcon sedans and utilities ceased in Australia in 2016.

The '''Ford 300''' is an automobile which was built in the USA by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] for the model year 1963 only.  It was the base trim level of the [[full-size]] 1963 Ford line below the [[Ford Galaxie|Galaxie]], Galaxie 500 &amp; Galaxie 500XL.&lt;ref&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975, Revised 4th Edition, page 410&lt;/ref&gt; It featured almost no chrome trim or luxury equipment and could be compared to the [[Chevrolet Biscayne]] in trim level.

Ford 300s were often used by police and taxi fleets, and had a base price of more than $100 less than comparable models in the base Galaxie series. However, private customers could also purchase one if low price and economy, with the convenience of a full-sized automobile were the prime objectives.

The car was identified by a "Ford 300" badge on each front fender just behind the wheel wells and "F-O-R-D" in small block letters on the trunk lid. The series was available only as a 2- or 4-door pillared sedan.

An interesting part of this car's history concerns the availability of the big-block FE-series V-8 engines, including the 425-hp 427 cubic inch unit.  Combined with manual transmission, these cars were often used as drag racers due to their light weight.

A special '''Ford 300''' 2-door sedan model was known to be sold by Tasca Motors of [[Providence, Rhode Island]].  It featured extra chrome trim from the [[Ford Galaxie|Galaxie]] and XL models, and featured interesting two-tone paint combinations.

The Ford 300 was replaced in 1964, by the [[Ford Custom|Custom]] series.

}}The '''Ford Bronco''' is a model line of SUVs that were manufactured and marketed by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] from 1965 to 1996.  After the first generation of the Bronco was introduced as a competitor to compact SUVs (including the [[Jeep CJ-5]] and [[International Harvester Scout]]), the succeeding four generations of the Bronco were full-sized SUVs, competing against the [[Chevy K5 Blazer|Chevrolet K5 Blazer]] and [[Dodge Ramcharger]].  The first Bronco was assembled using its own chassis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ford Bronco, 1966–1977|last=Clarke|first=R. M.|publisher=Brooklands Books|year=1998|isbn=978-1-85520-474-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the full-sized Bronco was derived from the Ford F-Series (F-100, later F-150) pickup truck; all Broncos were produced with four-wheel drive powertrains.

The Ford Bronco was withdrawn from the Ford light-truck model line following declining demand for two-door SUVs.  For the 1997 model year, Ford replaced the Bronco with the [[Ford Expedition]], a four-door SUV based on the F-150 (the later [[Ford Excursion]] was based on the Ford F-250 Super Duty).

From 1965 to 1996, Broncos were produced at Ford's [[Michigan Assembly Plant|Michigan Truck Plant]] in [[Wayne, Michigan]].  In 2017, Ford announced the reintroduction of the Ford Bronco as a mid-sized SUV (derived from the [[Ford Ranger]]) as a 2021 model; manufacturing is to return to Michigan Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2017/01/ford_announces_return_of_range_1.html|title=Ford announces return of Ranger in 2019, Bronco in 2020 at Detroit auto show|work=MLive.com|access-date=March 15, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NewBronco"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tk6iShyuM3M Ford NAIAS 2017: Official Press Conference Livestream]{{dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea behind the Bronco began with Ford product manager [[Donald N. Frey]] in the early 1960s (who also conceived the [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Ford Mustang]]) and engineered by Ford engineer Paul G. Axelrad, with [[Lee Iacocca]] approving the final model for production in February 1964, after the first clay models were built in mid-1963.  Developed as an off-road vehicle (ORV), the Bronco was intended as a competitor for the [[Jeep CJ#CJ-5|Jeep CJ-5]] and [[International Harvester Scout]].  Today a compact SUV in terms of size, Ford marketing shows a very early example of promoting a civilian off-roader as a "Sports Utility" (the two-door pickup version).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://image.fourwheeler.com/f/101899557+w600+cr1/011-1966-bronco-specifications.jpg|title=Wayback Machine|date=January 3, 2018|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103170428/http://image.fourwheeler.com/f/101899557+w600+cr1/011-1966-bronco-specifications.jpg|archive-date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earlybroncosforsale.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/1966-brochures-page-04.jpg|title=1966 Ford Bronco brochure, page 4|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially selling well, following the introduction of the [[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|Chevrolet Blazer]], [[Jeep Cherokee (SJ)|Jeep Cherokee]], and [[International Harvester Scout#Scout II|International Scout II]] (from 1969 to 1974), demand shifted towards SUVs with better on-road capability, leading to a decline in demand for the Bronco.

=== Chassis ===
The first-generation Bronco is built upon a chassis developed specifically for the model range, shared with no other Ford or Lincoln-Mercury vehicle.  Built on a 92-inch wheelbase (sized between the CJ-5 and Scout; only an inch shorter than the later CJ-7), the Bronco used box-section body-on-frame construction.

To simplify production, all examples were sold with four-wheel drive; a shift-on the-fly [[Dana Holding Corporation|Dana]] 20 [[transfer case]] and [[locking hubs]] were standard.&lt;ref name="See production numbers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bronco.com/cms/early_bronco_history|title=History of the Early Ford Bronco (1966–1977)|last=Zuercher|first=Todd|publisher=bronco.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303214240/http://www.bronco.com/cms/early_bronco_history|archivedate=March 3, 2009|accessdate=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rear axle was a [[Ford 9-inch axle]], with [[Hotchkiss drive|Hotchkiss]] drive and leaf springs; the front axle was a [[Dana 30]], replaced by a [[Dana 44]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="See production numbers" /&gt;  In contrast to the Twin I-Beams of larger Ford trucks, the Bronco used radius arms to locate the coil-sprung front axle, along with a lateral track bar, allowing for a 34-foot turning circle, long wheel travel, and antidive geometry (useful for snowplowing).  A heavier-duty suspension system was an option, along with air front springs.&lt;ref name="See production numbers" /&gt;

==== Powertrain ====
At its August 1965 launch, the Bronco was offered with a 170-cubic-inch inline six.&lt;ref name="See production numbers" /&gt;  Derived from the Ford Falcon, the 105-hp engine  was modified with solid [[valve lifter]]s, a {{convert|6|USqt|L|0|adj=on}} [[oil pan]], heavy-duty fuel pump, oil-bath air cleaner, and [[carburetor]] with a float bowl compensated against tilting.  In March 1966, a 200-hp  289-cubic-inch V8 was introduced as an option.&lt;ref name="See production numbers" /&gt;  For the 1969 model year, the 289 V8 was enlarged to 302 cubic inches, remaining through the 1977 model year.  For 1973, a 200 cubic-inch inline six became the standard engine, offered through 1977.

To lower production costs, at its launch, the Bronco was offered solely with a three-speed, column-shifted manual transmission and floor-mounted transfer case shifter (with a floor-mounted transmission shifter later becoming a popular modification).&lt;ref name="See production numbers" /&gt;  In 1973, in response to buyer demand, a three-speed automatic transmission was offered as an option.&lt;ref name="See production numbers" /&gt;

=== Body design ===
In a central theme of the first-generation Bronco, styling was subordinated to simplicity and economy, so all glass was flat, bumpers were straight C-sections, and the left and right door skins were symmetrical (prior to the fitment of door-mounting hardware).

For 1966, three body configurations were offered, including a two-door wagon and half-cab pickup, and open-body roadster.&lt;ref name="See production numbers" /&gt;  At its $2,194 base price ($17,507 in 2018 dollars), the Bronco included few amenities as standard.  However, a large number of options were offered through both Ford and its dealers, including front bucket seats, a rear bench seat, a [[tachometer]], and a [[CB radio]], as well as functional items such as a tow bar, an auxiliary gas tank, a [[power take-off]], a snowplow, a winch, and a [[auger (drill)|posthole digger]].&lt;ref name="See production numbers" /&gt;   Aftermarket accessories included campers, [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] units, and the usual array of wheels, [[tire]]s, chassis, and engine parts for increased performance.

For 1967, Ford introduced the Sport option package for the Bronco wagon.  Consisting primarily of chrome exterior trim and wheelcovers, the Sport package was distinguished by red-painted FORD grille lettering.&lt;ref name="See production numbers" /&gt;  For 1970, the Bronco Sport became a freestanding model rather than an option package.&lt;ref name="See production numbers" /&gt;

To comply with federal regulations, the Bronco was fitted with backup lights and side marker lamps (in 1967 and 1968, respectively).  After struggling with sales, the open-body Bronco roadster was withdrawn after the 1968 model year.&lt;ref name="See production numbers" /&gt;

After 1972, the Bronco half-cab was withdrawn; along with its lower sales compared to the wagon, Ford had introduced the larger [[Ford Courier]] compact pickup.

In a minor revision, for 1977, the exterior-mounted fuel tank caps were replaced behind hinged doors (as on all other Ford trucks).&lt;ref name="See production numbers" /&gt;&lt;gallery mode="packed" caption="1966-1977 Ford Bronco body styles"&gt;

=== Trim ===
Inititally offered as a single trim level with a long option list, for 1967, Ford introduced the Sport option package for the Bronco wagon.  Consisting primarily of chrome exterior trim and wheelcovers, the Sport package was distinguished by red-painted FORD grille lettering.&lt;ref name="See production numbers" /&gt;  For 1970, the Bronco Sport became a freestanding model rather than an option package.&lt;ref name="See production numbers" /&gt;

For 1972, in line with the F-Series trucks, the Ranger trim became the top-of-the-line Bronco, offering body stripes, model-specific wheel covers, cloth seats, woodgrain door panels, and carpeted interior.&lt;ref name="See production numbers" /&gt;

In a 1975 interior revision, the Bronco Sport and Bronco Ranger adapted the two-spoke steering wheel from the F-Series.&lt;ref name="See production numbers" /&gt;

===Racing===
In 1965, race car builder Bill Stroppe assembled a team of Broncos for long-distance off-road competition. Partnering with [[Holman-Moody]], the Stroppe/Holman/Moody (SHM) Broncos competed in the [[Mint 400]], [[Baja 500]], and Mexican 1000 (later named the [[Baja 1000]]). In 1969, SHM again entered a team of six Broncos in the [[Baja 1000]]. In 1971, a "Baja Bronco" package was marketed through Ford dealers, featuring quick-ratio power steering, automatic transmission, fender flares covering [[Gates Corporation|Gates]] Commando tires, a [[Roll cage|roll bar]], reinforced bumpers, a padded [[steering wheel]], and distinctive red, white, blue, and black paint. Priced at US$5,566, versus the standard V8 Bronco price of $3,665, only 650 were sold over the next four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bajabronco.com/Briefing.shtml |title=Baja Bronco Briefing |first=Andrew |last=Norton |publisher=bajabronco.com |year=1999 |accessdate=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, a Bronco "[[funny car]]" built by Doug Nash for the quarter-mile [[dragstrip]] finished with a few low 8-second times, but it was sidelined by sanctioning organizations when pickups and aluminum frames were outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.draglist.com/artman2/publish/daily_stories/60s_Funny_Cars_Round_6_1486.shtml |last=Duke |first=Bill |last2=White |first2=Danny |title=60s Funny Cars: Round 6 |publisher=Drag Racing Stories |date=December 22, 2005 |accessdate=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 1978 model year, the second-generation Bronco was introduced; to better compete with the [[Chevrolet K5 Blazer]], [[Dodge Ramcharger]], and [[Jeep Cherokee (SJ)|Jeep Cherokee]], the Bronco entered the full-size SUV segment.&lt;ref name="paul"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectbronco.com/History/78_79_History/history_of_Bronco.htm|title=History of the Second-Generation 78–79 Ford Bronco|author=Paul|date=March 3, 2001|publisher=Project Bronco|accessdate=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In place of a model-specific chassis, the Bronco was adapted directly from the Ford F-Series, becoming a shortened version of the F-100 4x4.&lt;ref name="paul" /&gt;  Originally intended for a 1974 launch,&lt;ref name="paul" /&gt; the second-generation Bronco (named "Project Shorthorn" during its development) was postponed to 1978 in response to fuel economy concerns related to the 1973 fuel crisis; the second-generation Bronco was released for sale after development was nearly finalized on its 1980 successor.&lt;ref name="paul" /&gt;

In a notable break from a period of downsizing in the American automotive industry, the second-generation Bronco grew significantly in size, adding 12 inches of wheelbase, approximately 28 inches of length, 11 inches of width, and 4 inches of height; based on powertrain configuration, the Bronco gained 1,100 to 1,600 pounds of curb weight over its predecessor.

The second-generation Bronco marks the introduction of design commonality with the Ford F-Series and retained the lift-off hardtop bodystyle for the three-door wagon, though now fiberglass over the rear seat area only (and not a full length steel top), continued through the 1996 withdrawal of the model line.  In spite of its short production cycle (only two years), the second-generation Bronco proved successful, overtaking the Blazer and Ramcharger in sales for the first time; initial demand was so strong that customers waited several months to receive vehicles from dealers.&lt;ref name="paul" /&gt;

=== Chassis ===
The second-generation Bronco is based on the Ford F-100 pickup truck chassis ([[Ford F-Series sixth generation|1973–1979 sixth generation]]).  Approximately one foot shorter than the shortest F-100, the Bronco has a 104-inch wheelbase (12 inches longer than the previous Bronco).  The second-generation Bronco is still fitted exclusively with four-wheel drive;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/FMC%20Trucks-Vans/1978%20Trucks/1978%20Ford%20Bronco%20Brochure%20(Canadian)/image4.html|title=1978 Ford Bronco Brochure (Canadian)|last=Ristic-Petrovic|first=Dusan|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=September 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a part-time system was standard with a New Process 205 gear-driven transfer case with the option of permanent four-wheel drive and a New Process 203 chain-driven transfer case.

The second-generation Bronco is fitted with a coil-sprung [[Dana 44]] front axle and has a leaf-sprung [[Ford 9-inch axle]] in the rear (similar to the later 1st generation Broncos). The 1st and 2nd generation Broncos are the only versions designed with non-independent front suspension (solid front axle). In contrast all 3rd generation and later were fitted with the Ford/Dana twin traction beam  independent front suspension system.

Two different V8 engines were offered for the second-generation Bronco: the 5.8L 351M and the 6.6L 400.  While offering virtually the same horsepower output, the 400 produced a higher torque output over the 351M.  As the 460 V8 was restricted to rear-wheel drive F-Series trucks, it was not offered in the Bronco.

For 1979, Ford added emissions controls to its light-truck engines; the Bronco gained a [[catalytic converter]] (among other equipment) in both engine configurations.&lt;ref name="paul" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bronco.com/cms/big_bronco_history|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203112302/http://www.bronco.com/cms/big_bronco_history|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 3, 2009|title=History of the Big Bronco (Fullsize 1978–1996) {{!}} bronco.com|date=February 3, 2009|access-date=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Body ===
Replacing the multiple body configurations of the first generation, the second-generation Bronco was offered solely as a 3-door wagon with a lift-off rear hardtop.  During its development as Project Shorthorn, a central requirement by Ford was to adopt bodywork from the F-100 with minimal modification.&lt;ref name="paul" /&gt;  As with its chassis, the second-generation Bronco derives much of its body from the F-Series truck line, sharing the doors, front roofline and sheetmetal, and interior with the F-Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunne|first=Jim|date=September 1976|title=Detroit Report|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQEAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=1978+Ford+F100+Bronco|journal=Popular Science|page=32|accessdate=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retaining the wagon body from its predecessor, Ford designers shifted from a full length hardtop (as with the previous Bronco and on the [[Jeep CJ#CJ-7|Jeep CJ-7]]) to a lift-off hardtop from behind the B-pillars.  Designed by Dick Nesbitt, the configuration achieved higher commonality with the F-100 (sharing the doors and overhead roof stamping); attention was focused on minimizing leaks around the top seals (a problem related to the design of the K5 Blazer hardtop of the time).&lt;ref name="paul" /&gt;  In a configuration similar to the [[Ford Country Squire|Ford LTD Country Squire]], the glass of the rear window rolled down into the tailgate (via a dash-mounted switch or from using the key on the outside), allowing the tailgate to fold down.

Coinciding with its commonality with the F-100, the second-generation Bronco introduced features new to the model line for the first time, including air conditioning, radio, and tilt steering.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/FMC%20Trucks-Vans/1978%20Trucks/1978%20Ford%20Bronco%20Brochure%20(Canadian)/image5.html|title=1978 Ford Bronco Brochure (Canadian)|last=Ristic-Petrovic|first=Dusan|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=September 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While a two-seat interior remained standard, the 11-inch wider interior allowed for a three-passenger front bench seat; with a folding and removable rear seat, the Bronco became a six-passenger vehicle for the first time.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/FMC%20Trucks-Vans/1978%20Trucks/1978%20Ford%20Bronco%20Brochure%20(Canadian)/image3.html|title=1978 Ford Bronco Brochure (Canadian)|last=Ristic-Petrovic|first=Dusan|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=September 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

For 1979, the Bronco saw little change from 1978 models.  Along with the F-Series, rectangular headlamps (introduced on the Ranger trim for 1978) became standard on all Broncos.  In an interior revision, captain's chair front seats became an option.&lt;ref name="paul" /&gt;  &lt;gallery mode="packed" caption="1978-1979 Ford Bronco"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Trim ===
For the second-generation Bronco, the model line adopted the same trim nomenclature as the F-Series.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The Bronco Custom served as the standard-trim model with the Bronco Ranger XLT as the top-level trim.  For 1978, as with the F-Series trucks, Customs were fitted with round headlamps while Ranger XLTs had rectangular units, which became standard for all Broncos for 1979.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

During 1978 and 1979, alongside the Econoline, F-Series, and Courier, the Bronco was sold with a "Free-Wheelin{{'}}" cosmetic option package for both Custom and Ranger XLT trims.  Featuring tricolor striping and blacked-out exterior trim, the package featured revised exterior striping for 1979.&lt;ref name="paul" /&gt;{{clear}}

}}
Beginning production development in 1977&lt;ref name="paul" /&gt; (before its predecessor was released for sale) the 1980–1986 Bronco was designed to address many concerns that held the 1978–1979 Bronco out of production.  Nominally shorter and lighter, the 1980 Bronco was designed to adopt a more efficient powertrain while retaining its full-size dimensions.

In 1982, the [[Ford Bronco II]] made its debut; unrelated to the full-size Bronco, the Bronco II was a compact SUV based on a shortened Ranger pickup truck and sized similarly to the 1966–1977 Bronco.

=== Chassis ===
Again based on the Ford F-Series, the 1980–1986 Bronco is based upon the Ford F-150 ([[Ford F-Series seventh generation|1980–1986 seventh generation]]).  Although based on an all-new chassis, the Bronco retained its {{convert|104|in|mm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} wheelbase.  Both transfer cases were replaced with a New Process 208 version.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In front, the 1980–1986 Bronco is fitted with a [[Dana 44]] front axle with Ford TTB ([[Twin-Traction Beam|Twin Traction Beam]]) independent front suspension.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  As with the 1978–1979 Bronco, the rear axle is a leaf-sprung Ford 9-inch axle.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

For the first time since 1977, the Bronco came with an inline-six engine as standard; the 4.9L 300 I6 was available solely with a manual transmission.  The 400 V8 was discontinued, with the 351M taking its place and the 302 V8 making its return as the base-equipment V8.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The 351 Windsor made its debut in the Bronco as it replaced the 351M in 1982; gaining a 210&amp;nbsp;hp "high-output" version in 1984.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.telus.net/cbradley/Engine_Specifications.html|title=Ford Truck Engine Specifications|last=Bradley|first=Chris|year=2007|accessdate=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1985, the 5.0L V8 (302) saw its carburetor replaced by a multiport electronic fuel-injection system, rising to 190&amp;nbsp;hp (the standard 156&amp;nbsp;hp 5.8L V8 was discontinued for 1986).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Body ===
As with its 1978–1979 predecessor, the 1980–1986 Bronco shares much of its external sheetmetal with the F-Series pickup line, with the same parts from the doors forward.  Based on a design proposal originally used in the development of the previous-generation Bronco, the B-pillar of the roofline was modified slightly to produce an improved seal for the hardtop.&lt;ref name="paul" /&gt;  Prior to 1984, the hardtop included sliding window glass as an option.

For 1982, the Bronco saw a slight facelift as it adopted Ford's blue oval emblem, taking the place of "F-O-R-D" lettering on the hood,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bronco.com/cms/big_bronco_history|title=History of the Big Bronco|date=June 8, 2006|publisher=JohnV|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203112302/http://bronco.com/cms/big_bronco_history|archivedate=February 3, 2009|accessdate=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the bronco horse was removed from the fender emblems.

=== Trim ===
The 1980–1986 Bronco adopted the same trim levels as the Ford F-Series pickups. Following the introduction of the Ford Ranger compact pickup, the Bronco adopted Bronco (base, replacing Custom), Bronco XL, and Bronco XLT.

In 1985, Ford added an Eddie Bauer trim package for the Bronco.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Featuring a color-keyed two-tone exterior, the trim package featured an outdoors-themed interior.

For the 1987 model year, coinciding with the introduction of the [[Ford F-Series eighth generation|eighth-generation Ford F-Series]], the Bronco was given a similar update.  While the shortened F-100 platform introduced in 1978 saw changes, the 1987 Bronco was given a number of updates to both the exterior and interior.  As it shared its front sheetmetal with the F-150, in the interest of slightly better aerodynamics, the Bronco gained its reshaped front bumper, flatter front grille, reshaped hood, and composite headlamps.  A change separate from aerodynamic improvements was the adoption of rounded wheel openings in the fenders. The interior was given redesigned front seats, door panels, dashboard and controls (including a new steering wheel), and instrument panels. In the interest of safety, rear-wheel anti-lock brakes (ABS) became standard in 1986 with the 1987 model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Skiing|journal = Skiing Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3C5KPUnNdU4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA150|date=December 1986|page=154|issn = 0037-6264}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

For the first time, for 1987 the Bronco was available with push-button control for its four-wheel drive as an option starting at introduction in 1986.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The Bronco carried over the 4.9L inline-six, 5.0L V8, and 5.8L "HO" V8 from 1986.  In 1986, the inline-six was given fuel injection on '87 models, with the 5.8L HO gaining the configuration a year later.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  For 1987, two Mazda-produced 5-speed manual transmissions replaced the previous 4-speed (depending on engine); the C6 3-speed automatic was phased out in favor of the AOD 4-speed automatic and the heavier-duty E4OD 4-speed automatic (the latter becoming the sole automatic in 1991).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Special editions ===
To commemorate 25 years of production, Ford offered a Silver Anniversary Edition Bronco for the 1991 model year.  A cosmetic option package, the Silver Anniversary Edition featured Currant Red exterior paint (package exclusive) and a gray leather interior (the first time leather seating was available for a Bronco).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

For 1991 through 1992, the Nite option package featured a completely blacked-out exterior with contrasting graphics. Alongside the top-line Eddie Bauer trim, both special editions were available only with a V8 engine and automatic transmission.

Following the introduction of the [[Ford F-Series ninth generation|ninth-generation Ford F-150]], the Bronco saw a major design update for the 1992 model year.  It was based on the same basic F-Series chassis introduced in late 1977, and the Bronco also saw updates to the exterior and interior. In the interest of making the vehicle more aerodynamic, designers again used wraparound composite headlight units and a larger grille.  Although protruding from the body, the larger front bumper was given a rounded design.  The interior again saw updates to the dashboard and instrument panel, with the addition of leather front seats as an option for XLT and Eddie Bauer trims as well as optional remote keyless entry with an anti-theft alarm.&lt;ref&gt;1994 Brochure: http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/ford/95bronco/bilder/7.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safety changes ===
The redesign of the Bronco for 1992 would include the addition of a number of safety features, including front [[crumple zone]]s, three-point seatbelts for the rear seat, and a center-mounted rear brake light.  In 1993, as with the F-150, the 1994 Bronco received a standard driver-side airbag and reinforced internal door beams.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; One change resulting from the addition of the safety equipment was that the lift-off hardtop on the Bronco was no longer removable from a legal standpoint (as it contained rear-seat seatbelts and the center brake light); to discourage the practice (which was still physically possible), Ford removed all literature in the Bronco owner's manual explaining how to remove the hardtop.  To further discourage its removal, the bolts securing the hardtop in place were changed to [[Torx]] "tamper proof" bolts, requiring special tools, in place of standard hex-head bolts.

=== Special editions ===
[[File:Ford-Bronco.jpg|left|thumb|1995-1996 Ford Bronco Eddie Bauer]]
The monochrome Nite edition was again available, though 1992 was its last offering. Monochrome paint versions were reintroduced from 1993 (1994 model) to 1996, as the XLT Sport variant of the Bronco available in black, red, or white. Another variant of the XLT was a two-tone light teal green and white (charcoal gray interior); approximately 600 were produced each year.

As with its [[Ford Aerostar|Aerostar]], [[Ford Explorer|Explorer]], and F-150 counterparts, Ford continued sales of the Eddie Bauer outdoors-themed variant of the Bronco through 1996.  For 1994, the trim featured an overhead console, lighted sun visors, and a dimming rear-view mirror.  For 1995, a vented front bumper was added (it was added to the XLT for 1996).

Cosmetic exterior and interior changes included a sweeping front end and a new dashboard. Maroon and blue leather seats were first offered in 1991 (1992 model year) through the end of production. Power mirrors were again offered from 1991 launch, and from 1995, the Bronco became the first vehicle to incorporate turn signal lights in its side mirrors. All 1994–1996 Eddie Bauers have an overhead console. Some 1994–1996 XLTs and Eddie Bauers have lighted sun visors and a dimming rear-view mirror. From 1995–1996, Eddie Bauer models have a vented front bumper. For 1996, XLTs received the vented front bumper as well.

=== Engine changes ===
In 1994, the 300 engine was removed from the Bronco lineup. The 302 engine received a Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor system in 1994. The 351 followed with MAF in 1995 in California. 351s in the rest of the country received MAF in 1996 along with OBD2 on both the 302 and 351.

=== Discontinuation ===
In mid- to late 1996, Ford announced the discontinuation of the Bronco. The last model built rolled off the Wayne, Michigan assembly line on June 12. The final model was escorted by longtime Bronco enthusiast Jeff Trapp's 1970 halfcab during a drive-off ceremony.{{Relevance inline|date=August 2018}} The Bronco gained sudden popularity when an estimated 95 million TV viewers tuned in to watch the police slowly chase a white Ford Bronco carrying [[O. J. Simpson|O.J. Simpson]] down Los Angeles' [[Interstate 405 (California)|Interstate 405]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The O.J.

Simpson police chase. According to Mark Schirmer, a communications director for Ford utility vehicles, the model line was ended to make room for the automaker's newest additions to the lineup which were the large SUV family-style replacements, the [[Ford Expedition]] and the [[Ford Explorer]].&lt;ref name="Grisham"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/06/17/the-bronco-brand-after-oj/10257945/|title=For Ford's Bronco, O.J.

In 2020, the Bronco returns to the Ford light-truck product range as a 2021 model, following a 25-year hiatus.  Shifting its chassis underpinnings from the [[Ford F-Series|F-Series]] to the [[Ford Ranger (T6)|Ford Ranger]], the sixth-generation Bronco will become a mid-size SUV for the first time.

=== Background ===
The revival of the Ford Bronco came to light in 2016, during labor negotiations between Ford and the [[United Automobile Workers|UAW]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/auto/2016/09/30/trumps-attack-on-ford-reveals-return-ranger-and-bronco.html|title=Trump's Attack On Ford Reveals Return Of The Ranger And Bronco|date=September 30, 2016|language=en-US|access-date=October 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/new-ford-bronco-and-ranger-on-the-way-uaw-contract-seems-to-say-so/|title=New Ford Bronco and Ranger on the Way?

While the Ranger was expected to be a version of the global Ranger T6 adapted to North American use, specific details of the configuration of the revived Bronco were less certain.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/articles/will-ford-resurrect-the-bronco-as-a-genuine-wrangler-competitor/|title=Ford Will Resurrect the Bronco as a Genuine Wrangler Competitor|last=Parks|first=Seth|date=January 18, 2016|work=Ford Truck Enthusiats|publisher=Internet Brands, Inc|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Speculated as a Ford competitor to the [[Jeep Wrangler (JL)|Jeep Wrangler]],&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; the Bronco was expected to reach production by 2020.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  At the [[North American International Auto Show#2017|2017 North American International Auto Show]], Ford officially confirmed the return of the Ford Bronco for the 2021 model year.&lt;ref name="NewBronco" /&gt;  Later in 2017, Ford released a social media site dedicated to the launch of the 2021 Bronco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://social.ford.com/en_US/story/vehicle-type/suv/The-Ford-Bronco-is-Coming-Back.html|title=The Ford Bronco is Coming Back|last1=Quinell|first1=Cole|accessdate=October 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2021 Ford Bronco will be a mid-size SUV which will be offered in both two and four-door variants.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  Built alongside the Ford Ranger at [[Michigan Assembly Plant]] in [[Wayne, Michigan]] (home to the 1966-1996 Ford Bronco assembly), the Bronco is largely speculated to share a [[body-on-frame]] chassis with the Ford Ranger pickup and the Ford Everest mid-size SUV. It is likely that it will also share its powertrain with the Ranger.  During the announcement of its return, Ford chief technical officer Raj Nair stated that the 2021 Bronco will be designed as a distinct model line, rather than a version of the Everest adapted for the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carscoops.com/2017/01/ford-boss-raj-nair-says-new-bronco-will.html|title=Ford Boss Raj Nair Says New Bronco Will Be 'Completely Unique' From Everest, But Will Share Chassis|last1=Halas|first1=John|publisher=Carscoops|accessdate=January 14, 2017|date=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford showed a pre-production prototype to a group of dealers in March 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.autonews.com/sales/dealers-get-glimpse-bronco-prototype |title = Dealers get a glimpse of Bronco prototype|date = March 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bronco will debut in spring 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a29664051/new-ford-bronco-release-date/ |title = New Ford Bronco Officially Debuts in Spring 2020|date = November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Centurion Classic (1987-1996) ==
[[File:1989 Ford Centurion Classic 350 Lariat XLT 460 V8 front.jpg|thumb|A 1989 Centurion Classic; a Ford F-350 crew cab mated with rear bodywork of a Bronco|alt=]]
Although Ford would not produce a factory-built competitor for the [[Chevrolet Suburban]] until the introduction of the Expedition and Excursion, a four-door version of the fourth- and fifth-generation Bronco was produced as the '''Centurion Classic''', constructed by Centurion Vehicles, a converter specializing in Ford trucks based in [[White Pigeon, Michigan]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-american/curbside-classic-ford-classic-350-centurion-vehicles-creates-a-frankenstein-suburban-fighter/|title=Curbside Classic: Ford Classic 350 – Centurion Vehicles Creates A Frankenstein Suburban Fighter|website=Curbside Classic|language=en-US|access-date=April 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the construction of each Classic, Centurion would actually use two different Ford trucks: an F-Series crew-cab pickup and a Bronco.  The wheelbase was shortened from 168 inches to 140 inches (nine inches longer than the Suburban),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the Bronco rear quarter panels, hardtop, and tailgate were mated to the pickup bodywork.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.boldride.com/2015/11/ford-bronco-rare-centurion-classic/94489/|title=This is the 4-Door Ford Bronco You Didn't Know Existed|website=Boldride.com|language=en-US|access-date=April 16, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408051323/http://news.boldride.com/2015/11/ford-bronco-rare-centurion-classic/94489/|archivedate=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early models used fiberglass rear body panels, but later, these were made from steel.&lt;ref name="tbJohnston"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Trailer Boats | date =  | page = 82 | last = Johnston | first = Jeff | title = Centurion Classic 350/Ford 7.3 Diesel | url = http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j275/v_tess/Centurion%20Brochures/IMG480010.jpg }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the rear seat of the Bronco was retained, the Centurion Classic featured three-row seating for up to nine people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Two models of the Centurion Classic were produced: the C150 Classic (based on the Ford F-150 chassis; four-wheel drive was optional) and the C350 Classic (based on the Ford F-350 chassis; four-wheel drive was standard).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In contrast to the 3/4-ton Suburban 2500, the C350 Classic was based on a one-ton chassis.  The C150 was powered by the 5.0L and 5.8L V8 engines, with the C350 powered by the 7.3L diesel V8 and 7.5L gasoline V8 (the only Bronco variants to use these engines).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Centurion Classic was offered until the end of Bronco production in 1996; though the Bronco was directly replaced by the Expedition, the C150/C350 is closest in size to the [[Ford Excursion]] introduced for the 2000 model year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==2004 concept==
[[File:Ford bronco concept.jpg|thumb|right|Bronco concept at the 2004 [[New York Auto Show]]]]
At the [[North American International Auto Show#2004|2004 North American International Auto Show]], a Ford Bronco [[concept vehicle]] was unveiled.  Inspired by the first-generation (1966-1977) [https://www.houseofamericancars.com/2020-ford-bronco-the-legend-is-back/ Ford Bronco,] the 2004 concept adapted a short wheelbase, round headlamps, and squared-off roofline; the concept marked one of the first uses of a three-bar grille on Ford vehicles.  Using a minimalist exterior design, the Bronco design was unveiled alongside a [[Ford Shelby Cobra Concept|Shelby Cobra Concept]] at the same show.

Using the [[Ford CD2 platform]] of the [[Ford Escape]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raynal |first=Wes |title=New Leader? |journal=Autoweek |date=May 14, 2012 |volume=62 |issue=10 |pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GearHeads.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Ford Bronco|url=http://gearheads.org/the-2015-ford-bronco/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Bronco concept was powered by a 2.0L four-cylinder turbodiesel (from the [[Ford Mondeo (second generation)|Ford Mondeo]]) and a six-speed manual transmission.  Replacing [[Control Trac II|ControlTrac II]], an "Intelligent" 4-wheel drive system was intended for improved stability and fuel economy.

== Bronco R Prototype ==
At the 2020 Baja 1000 race, Ford introduced the Ford Bronco R prototype with the drive train of the new 2020 Bronco that has yet to be released with the thoughts of testing out the engine, transmission and four wheel drive system that will be used in the production model 2020 Bronco. The Baja 1000 proved to be the perfect test for the new off-road monster Ford is producing, with 1000 miles of some of the world's roughest terrain, this years race was also tougher after being delayed for 24 hours due to excessive rainfall in the days before the event. With the excessive rainfall, one of the Class one co-drivers Ford used in the race, referred to the race as the "Mud Bog 1000." 

While the Bronco R prototype model used for the Baja 1000 sported the heart of the upcoming production Bronco, Ford upfitted the Bronco R with a rugged off-road racing suspension as well as off-road wheels and 37 inch off-road tires.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.autoblog.com/2019/12/23/ford-bronco-r-prototype-baja-1000-failure-explained/|title=What went wrong with the Ford Bronco R prototype at the Baja 1000|website=Autoblog|language=en|access-date=2020-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bronco R vehicle also used a 70-gallon fuel tank during the race allowing the prototype to travel up to 315 miles of the course before stopping to fuel up.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; While this would have been a significant advantage the Bronco R team had, it was not taken advantage of. Since the Bronco R was a prototype, it was used partially as a way to test the powertrain of the production model and test how it held up to the elements of the race. The Bronco R team made a stop every 130 miles to swap drivers to have a set of fresh eyes as well as using the stop as a way to keep an eye on how the vehicle was holding up and making sure there were no repairs needed at the time. When it came to the engine of the Bronco R prototype, Ford kept it quiet on what the engine truly was. The only information that is known, is the engine represented the production models and was a twin-turbo EcoBoost Ford engine. When it came to the four-wheel drive system, the mud on the course of the Baja 1000 was no match for the Bronco R. While the drivers only had to use four-wheel drive low a handful of times to get out of some of the stickier mud, the Bronco R stopped multiple times along the course to tug other competitors out of the mud including a near 6,000 pound trophy truck. While the Bronco R's engine, transmission and four-wheel drive held up perfectly during the brutal race, many of the aftermarket suspension parts did not fair the same. Around mile 495 of the 1000 mile journey, the passenger side spindle, lower-control arm and CV joint had been destroyed. While the team was able to replace as many parts as possible on the course they were able to continue the race until around mile 580, when the engine fans began giving out. One engine fan had completely seized up while the other was not working at its full potential causing the Bronco R to overheat and needing to be towed about eight miles to the next filling station. After about 30 minutes of working on the Bronco R prototype to try to get it back on the course, the Ford team had to call it because they were not going to be able to get it back in the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ford-bronco-r-baja-1000/|title=Ford Bronco R: Tested, and bested, by Baja|last=Hall|first=Emme|website=Roadshow|language=en|access-date=2020-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The '''[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] line''' of [[Automobile|cars]] was updated in '''1937''' with one major change &amp;mdash; the introduction of an entry-level 136&amp;nbsp;CID (2.2&amp;nbsp;L) V8 in addition to the popular 221&amp;nbsp;CID (3.6&amp;nbsp;L) [[Flathead engine|flathead]] [[V8 engine|V8]].  The model was a refresh of its predecessor, the [[Ford Model 48|Model 48]] (itself based on the [[Ford Model B (1932)|Model 40A]]), and was the company's main product.  It was redesigned more thoroughly in [[1941 Ford|1941]]. At the start of production, it cost $850.  The Ford Line bore several model numbers during this period: For domestic 1937 production in the United States Ford Model Numbers for 85&amp;nbsp;hp V-8 equipped cars was Model 78 and  60&amp;nbsp;hp V-8 cars was Model 74. '''Models 81A and 82A''' in 1938, and '''Models 91A and 92A''' in 1939.

==1937==
[[File:1937 Ford Truck Jugtown NC.jpg|thumb|left|1937 Ford pickup with [[Ford flathead V8 engine|V8 engine]].]]
The 1937 Ford featured a more rounded look with fine horizontal bars in the convex front and hood-side grilles.  The front grille was V-shaped, rather than following the fenders into a pentagon shape, as on the 1936 model.  Faired-in headlights were a major modernization found on both the Standard and DeLuxe trim versions, though much of the rest of the design was shared between Ford's two lines. A larger water pump was used to help aid in cooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=H. Eugene|title=Chrysler, Ford, Durant, and Sloan|year=2003|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-7864-1611-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Slantback' sedans gained a rear trunk door, though space was limited, and 'Trunkback' versions continued gaining sales. The station wagon had seating for eight passengers. A 4-door "convertible sedan" with roll up windows was offered in small numbers in the DeLuxe series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1937_Ford/1937_Ford_V-8_Wagon_Folder/1937%20Ford%20V-8%20Wagon%20Folder-04.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1937_Ford/1937_Ford_V-8_Wagon_Folder |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1938==
The [[Recession of 1937–1938|1938 recession]] hurt sales, as did Ford's continuing of the 1937 cars, including most body panels.  1938 DeLuxe models were differentiated with a heart-shaped grille, though standard models retained the 1937 look.  The fading Slantback sedan design was cancelled for good. Only a V8 was offered, either a 60&amp;nbsp;hp V8 or an 85&amp;nbsp;hp V8.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1938"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1938_Ford/1938_Ford_Folder/1938%20Ford%20Folder-06.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1938_Ford/1938_Ford_Folder |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new dash was used, with recessed controls for safety.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1938"/&gt;

The 1938 trucks were finally updated, having continued with 1935 looks.  Changes included a vertical oval grille and substantial fenders and bumpers.

&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:17 03 303 little white house.jpg|1938 Ford on display at the [[Little White House]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==1939==
The Ford's look was again modernized for 1939 &amp;mdash; the Deluxe used a low pointed grille with heavier vertical slats, while the standard Ford had a higher grille with horizontal dividers.  The headlights (the example illustrated has been converted to '40 Ford sealed beam headlamps - '39s used bulb and reflector lamps, the last year for these) were moved farther apart, now sitting almost in front of the wheels.  The side grilles and louvers were removed in favor of chrome strips on Deluxe models.  The "alligator" hood opened deep from the top of the grille back, eliminating the side panels found on previous models.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:39Ford.jpg|left|thumb|180px|1939 model differences.]] --&gt;
The phaeton, club coupe, and convertible club coupe models were discontinued.  The engine was also revised for 1939 with downdraft [[carburetor]]s widening the torque band but leaving power unchanged at 85&amp;nbsp;hp (63&amp;nbsp;kW).  Hydraulic brakes were a major advancement across the Ford line.

Ford's upscale [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] line also bowed in 1939, filling the gap between the Deluxe Fords and the [[Lincoln-Zephyr]] line.

==1940==

| [[File:1940 Ford Standard Business Coupé (01A) front.jpg|thumb|160px|1940 Ford Standard Business Coupe]]
|}

A high flat-topped hood dominated the front look of the 1940 model, as the grille spread out to reach the fenders to differentiate the Deluxe line and the headlights were pushed wider still. The standard Ford inherited the grille of the 1939 model with blackout on each side of a heavy chrome center; heavier headlight surrounds serve as another major differentiator from the 1939. 1940 was the last year of the 1937 design and its smaller V8 engine, with a [[straight-six engine]] to be reintroduced the following year. Sealed-beam headlights were one of the few major advances for 1940, while a hydraulic top was new on the convertible.

==Legacy==

The 1937-1940 generation of Fords is one of the most popular automobiles for [[hot rod]]ding. Early [[stock car racing]] drivers also used Fords of this generation among other cars. This Ford also formed the basis for a style of [[dirt track racing]] car.

The '''Ford Aerostar''' is a range of passenger and cargo vans that was manufactured and marketed by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in the United States and Canada; a limited number were exported outside of North America.  The first [[minivan]] sold by Ford, the Aerostar was sold in a single generation from the 1986 to 1997 model years.  Introduced shortly before the Ford Taurus, the vehicle derived its nameplate from its slope-nosed "one-box" exterior (although over six feet tall, the body of the Aerostar retained a {{Cd|0.37|long=yes|link=car}},&lt;ref name="PM December 85"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=deMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=car+and+driver+magazine+ford+aerostar&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tu-OTeT-JOGS0QHnmtmwCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Age of Aerostar (Ford Advertisement)|date=December 1985|pages=6–7|accessdate=March 27, 2011|author=Ford Motor Company|work=[[Popular Mechanics (magazine)|Popular Mechanics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; besting the [[Lincoln Continental Mark VII|Lincoln Mark VII]]).

For the 1995 model year, the front-wheel drive [[Ford Windstar]] was introduced to replace the Aerostar; both minivans were sold concurrently through the 1997 model year.  In the Ford model line, the role of the Aerostar cargo van was left unfilled; the closest successor is the [[Ford Transit Connect]], introduced in 2010.

A total of 2,029,577 Aerostars were produced from 1985 to 1997. All production was sourced from the now-closed [[St. Louis Assembly Plant]] in [[Hazelwood, Missouri]].

==Development==

===Carousel: the garageable van===
{{main article|Ford Carousel}}
At Ford, development of a minivan began in the early 1970s, starting life as a companion model to the third-generation [[Ford E-Series#Third generation (1975–1991)|Ford Econoline/Club Wagon]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2010/03/1972-ford-carousel-the-chrysler-minivans-true-father/|title=1972 Ford Carousel: The Chrysler Minivan's True Father?|date=2010-03-31|website=The Truth About Cars|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vehiclevoice.com/2007/07/07/ford_carrousel_story_continues_1/|title=Ford Carrousel Story Continues - Dick Nesbitt, Designer|date=2007-07-07|website=VehicleVoice|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As its full-size van was slated to grow in size for its 1975 redesign, Ford explored the concept of a "garageable van", using a roofline with a height to easily fit through a typical garage door opening.  Additional objectives for the vehicle would include increased interior space over station wagons and more attractive styling over full-size vans.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;     

Dubbed the Ford Carousel, a prototype was tested from 1972 to 1974.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  To achieve its "garageable" status, its roofline was lowered approximately 12 inches in comparison to a standard-wheelbase Ford Club Wagon (placing its height close to that of the Ford Windstar/Freestar).  Along with restyled A-pillars and a completely new front fascia, the Carousel received a wagon-style roofline (with wraparound window glass); in a key indication of its future as family-oriented vehicle, the Carousel wore a rear tailgate with a drop-down rear window with simulated exterior woodgrain trim.  Inside, it was fitted with two rear bench seats with interior trim similar to the [[Ford Country Squire]] and [[Mercury Colony Park]].   

While the Ford Carousel received a positive response by many Ford executives for a potential 1976 introduction, it ultimately would not reach production.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  While financial constraints forced the company to divert funds towards critical projects (such as the [[Ford Fox platform|Fox platform]] and [[Ford Panther platform|Panther platform]]), the 1973 energy crisis played a major role as well (the prototype was fitted with a 460 V8, shared with full-size Ford vehicles and one-ton Ford trucks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vehiclevoice.com/2005/11/23/yarn_-_nobody_ever_talks_about/|title=Yarn - Nobody Ever Talks About Ford's Carrousel Concept|date=2005-11-23|website=VehicleVoice|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;).   

In 1978, Lee Iaccoca and Hal Sperlich both departed Ford and were hired by Chrysler; the [[Chrysler minivans (S)|Chrysler minivan]] project was approved by the end of 1979.  While adopting the basic "garageable van" concept of the Ford Carousel prototype, the resulting 1984 Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager were far different vehicles in terms of layout and engineering.

===Aerostar: all-new design===

During the early 1980s, as the [[Automotive industry in the United States|American automotive industry]] learned of the development of the Chrysler minivans, Ford commenced development of its own vehicle in response.  The energy crises of the late 1970s had made fuel economy a high priority of vehicle design; as such, producing the Ford Carousel (downsizing the Ford Club Wagon to a lower height) would not be a competitive option for Ford.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  

While using the 6-foot height of the Carousel as a starting point in concept, the 1980s Ford "garageable van" was a completely clean-sheet design.  In a major shift, the new design shifted mechanical commonality from full-size trucks and vans to the compact [[Ford Ranger (North America)|Ford Ranger]] in an effort to reduce weight.  In what would be a major break from the Chrysler and GM minivans, the Ford minivan received a distinct chassis (with model-specific front and rear suspension).&lt;ref name="PS February 85"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jQAAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=Ford+Aerostar+concept&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RaaNTZWSC-jf0gGC89GjCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ford%20Aerostar%20concept&amp;f=false|title=New-generation mini-vans|author=Stepler, Richard|date=February 1985|work=Popular Science|pages=74–76|accessdate=March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To further improve fuel economy, Ford added a number of lightweight materials for the body, using plastic bumpers, fuel tanks, liftgate doors, and hoods; aluminum was used for the driveshaft, axles, and wheels.&lt;ref name="PS February 85" /&gt;    

In 1984, the Ford Aerostar name was first used as Ford unveiled a concept vehicle previewing the final production minivan.&lt;ref name="PS April 84" /&gt;      

== Overview ==

=== Chassis ===
[[File:Ford Aerostar 3.0 XLT 1987 (18770912893).jpg|left|thumb|1987 Ford Aerostar XLT]]
As with its Chrysler and General Motors minivan counterparts, the chassis of the Ford Aerostar derived a number of suspension and powertrain components from existing vehicles to lower development costs.  Although it would become the first Ford truck to make use of a unibody chassis, the Aerostar shared most of its components with the Ford Ranger/Bronco II light trucks.  To reinforce the chassis for towing and overall rigidity, the dedicated platform (codenamed VN1, the first alphanumeric designation for a Ford platform) was designed with full-length integrated frame rails.  The addition provided the Aerostar with the same {{convert|5000|lb|kg}} tow rating as the [[Chevrolet Astro|Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari]], and 2½ times the capacity of the [[Chrysler minivans (S)|Chrysler minivans]].&lt;ref name="PS April 84" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dOMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=Ford+Aerostar+concept&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RaaNTZWSC-jf0gGC89GjCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Ford%20Aerostar%20concept&amp;f=false | title=Age of Aerostar |accessdate=March 26, 2011 | author=Ford Motor Company | date=February 1986 | work=Popular Mechanics | page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Internet Archive bookmobile (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Ford Aerostar rear]]
The front suspension consisted of unequal length A-arms through its entire production; for 1990, the lower A-arm was revised to accommodate the addition of all-wheel drive as an option.  The Aerostar differed from all other Ford light trucks in its rear suspension configuration as well.  To save space, the live rear axle was fitted with a three-link coil-sprung rear suspension (similar to the Panther-platform cars of the time)&lt;ref name="PS February 85" /&gt;.  During its production run, the Ford Aerostar was the only North American-market minivan sold with four-wheel coil-spring suspension (the planned launch of the [[Renault Espace]] by [[American Motors|AMC]] was stillborn).

While the planned four-cylinder diesel engine from the 1984 concept vehicle was dropped in the prototype phase,&lt;ref name="PS April 84" /&gt; the Aerostar was launched with two engines from the Ranger/Bronco II: a standard 2.3&amp;nbsp;L [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] (shared with the Mustang) and a carburetor equipped 2.8&amp;nbsp;L [[Ford Cologne V6 engine|Cologne V6]] (from Ford of Europe) for the first few months of production.  Shortly after the introduction, the 2.8L&amp;nbsp;V6 was replaced with the newly introduced electronic multi-port fuel injected 3.0&amp;nbsp;L [[Ford Vulcan engine|''Vulcan'']] V6 from the Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;5&lt;/ref&gt; adding 30&amp;nbsp;hp.  For 1988, the 2.3 L engine was discontinued; the Aerostar became the first minivan powered exclusively by V6 engines.  In 1990, coinciding with the introduction of the E4WD Aerostar, a 4.0&amp;nbsp;L version of the Cologne V6 was introduced; while standard with all-wheel drive versions, it became an option on rear-wheel drive XLT and Eddie Bauer trims as well.

Sharing its transmissions with the Ford light-truck line, the Aerostar was available with a five-speed manual until 1995 (nearly exclusively in cargo vans and XL trim); unlike the Chrysler minivans, the Aerostar was sold exclusively with overdrive automatic transmissions.  In 1997, the 4.0&amp;nbsp;L V6 became paired with the first five-speed automatic transmission fitted in a US-market minivan.

==== All-wheel drive (E-4WD) Aerostar (1990–1997) ====
For 1990, Ford introduced an electronically-controlled [[four-wheel drive]] system as an option for the Aerostar.  Called E-4WD ('''E'''lectronic '''4-W'''heel '''D'''rive), the system was specifically an all-wheel drive system.  Using a [[Dana Holding Corporation|Dana]] TC28 transfer case with a center differential (regulated by an electronically controlled electro-magnetic clutch), all four wheels were given traction at all times.  The system shifted traction to the front wheels as it detected rear wheel spin, with no driver input required.  As E-4WD was not intended for off-road driving, the Aerostar was not provided with specific low-range gearing.

Sold from 1990 to 1997, the E-4WD option was available with XLT and Eddie Bauer trims and was paired exclusively with the 4.0L V6 and automatic transmission.

=== Exterior ===
[[File:Ford Aerostar XLT.jpg|thumb|1989–1991 Aerostar XLT]]
Distinguished by its sloped-nosed design, the Ford Aerostar utilized a "one-box" design similar to the Renault Espace and the [[Ford Transit]]; in contrast to its European counterparts, the Aerostar had much shorter overhangs with the wheels placed at the corners.  In an effort to further improve its fuel efficiency and aerodynamics and lower its curb weight, several plastic body parts (bumpers, rear hatch) that were utilized in the 1984 concept car were adopted for production.

As a response to the Dodge Grand Caravan and Plymouth Grand Voyager, an (unnamed) extended-length version of the Ford Aerostar entered production for 1989.  Sharing the 119-inch wheelbase with the standard-length version, the extended-length Aerostar added 14 inches to the rear body.  During the 1990s, the extended-length Aerostar would become the most popular version of the vehicle.

While the Ford Aerostar would never see a full redesign over its 12-year production run, it would see a number of detail changes to bring it in line with other Ford trucks.  For 1988, the nameplate badging was changed, moving it from each fender to the tailgate; it was changed from chrome to silver in color.  In 1989, the chrome grille was replaced by a black-trim grille; the bracketed towing mirrors were replaced by integrated powered sideview mirrors.  In 1992, an extensive facelift redesigned the grille, bumpers, wheels, and replaced the sealed-beam headlights with replaceable-bulb composite units (the amber turn signal lenses were changed to clear-lens units).  As it was becoming a federal requirement, a [[CHMSL|center brake light]] was added for 1994.  As the Aerostar had been slated for discontinuation after the 1994 model year, few visible changes were made afterwards.  For 1997, the amber rear turn signal lenses were deleted; XLT models were given optional 14x6" seven-hole alloy wheels.

=== Interior ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}In contrast to its radical exterior design, the interior design of the Ford Aerostar adopted many industry-standard features. For example, the seven-passenger Aerostar was configured with the 2-2-3 seating layout popularized in both Chrysler and General Motors minivans.  Borrowing features from full-size conversion vans, XLT-trim versions were available with second-row bucket seats; another option allowed both rear bench seats to fold down to make a bed; both rows of rear seats were removable.

However, the interior also featured several European-influenced designs: the Aerostar was fitted with a floor-mounted shifter for both automatic and manual transmissions and was equipped with a handbrake (which would become a feature in all US-market Ford minivans); in a fashion similar to the [[Volkswagen Vanagon]], the second-row windows slid open. While cupholders were relegated to an optional armrest in the third-row seats, the Aerostar could be specified with up to six ashtrays and two cigar lighters; the interior may have been designed with a smoker in mind.

In 1992, coinciding with the exterior updates, the interior also saw a major upgrade. Along with the addition of a driver's side airbag and three-point seatbelts for all six outboard seats, the dashboard was redesigned with improved controls (many shared with the 1992 Econoline) and a new instrument panel. In 1993, integrated child safety seats were introduced as an option.

=== Trim ===
Along with a cargo van (distinguished by its available double rear doors and lack of side windows), the Aerostar passenger van (called the Wagon) came in two trim levels: base-trim ''XL'' and deluxe-trim ''XLT'' (in keeping with the Ford truck line).  Many features standard on the XLT were available as extra-cost options on the XL, such as power windows, mirrors, and locks, air conditioning, and privacy glass.

XLT-trim Wagons also included the following features as extra-cost options:
* Overhead trip computer with auto-dimming rearview mirror (featuring: Distance to Empty (English/Metric), Trip Mileage, Average Fuel Economy, Instant Fuel Economy, Average Speed (English/Metric), along with dual map lights)
* Rear climate control
* Second-row [[Bucket seat|Captain's chairs]] (quad seats)
* Fold-flat second and third-row bench seatbacks
* 8-speaker AM/FM stereo with cassette player
* Premium AM/FM/cassette sound system with 7-band equalizer and rear-seat headphone jacks
* Rear-wheel anti-lock brakes &lt;!-- What year was this added...this clarification is so this can be moved elsewhere. --&gt;
* Electronic four-wheel drive (see section)
* Two-tone paint
* 14" aluminum wheels

==== Eddie Bauer Wagon (1988–1996) ====
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
[[File:1989 Aerostar Eddie Bauer.JPG|thumb|alt=1989 Aerostar Eddie Bauer Wagon (standard-length)|1989 Ford Aerostar Eddie Bauer]]
Introduced during the 1988 model year, the Aerostar was one of the first Ford vehicles to feature the outdoors-themed [[Eddie Bauer]] brand as a trim package.  Marketed above the XLT, the Aerostar Eddie Bauer was the first minivan marketed towards luxury buyers (for 1988, the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country (1941-1988)|Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] was produced as a compact station wagon, not becoming a minivan until the 1990 model year).  

The Eddie Bauer trim combined the interior convenience features of the XLT trim with two-tone exterior paint (tan as the accent color on the rocker panels and wheel trim) and a tan outdoors-themed interior.  As on the XLT, cloth seating surfaces were standard; as part of the 1992 update, leather seats became an option.  A standard feature of the trim package (an option on the XLT) was a feature allowing the second and third row bench seats to fold flat into a large bed across the rear half of the interior.  However, a large number of Eddie Bauer Aerostars were ordered with the optional second-row bucket seats/captain's chairs.

Following the introduction of the extended-length wagon in 1989, the Eddie Bauer trim was available in both body configurations.  After 1989, the option package came with the 4.0L V6 standard, though buyers could choose between rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive powertrains.

After the 1996 model year, the Eddie Bauer trim was discontinued as the Aerostar trim line was consolidated to the cargo van and the Aerostar XLT.

==== Aerostar Sport (1992–1996) ====
[[File:'92-'97 Ford Aerostar Sport SWB.jpg|thumb|alt=Aerostar XL Wagon with Sport option package|1992–1996 Ford Aerostar XL Sport]]
In 1992, the Aerostar Sport was introduced as an option package available for any non-Eddie Bauer Aerostar Wagon. Similar to its Chevrolet Astro RS/GMC Safari CS and Dodge Caravan ES counterparts, the Aerostar Sport was largely a cosmetic upgrade. Distinguished by their silver-accented paint and "Sport" pinstriping, the Sport featured integrated running boards with a color-matched front air dam and color-matched rear [[Mudflap|mud flaps]].  On darker colors, the front grille and chrome was painted body color.

The trim version of an Aerostar Sport is most easily identified by its wheels: XL Sport Wagons, with full wheel covers; XLT Sport Wagons (less common), with aluminum wheels.

== Concept vehicles ==

=== Ford Aerostar (1984) ===
The Aerostar name was first revealed as a concept vehicle was shown in 1984,&lt;ref name="PS April 84"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sQAAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=Ford+Aerostar+concept&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=e7KLTbHQNYyI0QGD_KzlDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ford%20Aerostar%20concept&amp;f=false| title=Ford's aero van | accessdate=March 24, 2011 | author=Dunne, Jim | date=April 1984 | work=Popular Science | page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Ford predicting up to 40&amp;nbsp;mpg in production versions with four-cylinder diesel engines.&lt;ref name="PS April 84" /&gt;  With a {{Cd|0.37|long=yes|link=car}}, the Aerostar was one of the sleekest vehicles designed by Ford, besting the [[Ford Mustang SVO]] and the [[Lincoln Continental Mark VII]].

Ford engineers chose the front-engine layout for a variety of reasons. In terms of safety and engine access (in comparison to German and Japanese imports), the company found that potential buyers preferred the configuration over rear and mid-engine vehicles.&lt;ref name="PS April 84"/&gt;  Ford also chose a rear-wheel drive layout for the Aerostar; this provided it with a {{convert|5000|lb|kg}} tow rating, 2½ times the capacity of the Chrysler vans.&lt;ref name="PS April 84" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

In the change from concept to production, very little of the exterior design would change, except for the window glass, headlights, and grille.

=== HFX Aerostar Ghia (1987) ===
Introduced at the [[Frankfurt Auto Show#1987|1987 Frankfurt Auto Show]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.limerick.eu/media/belltable%2023.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222140551/http://www.limerick.eu/media/belltable%2023.pdf |archivedate=February 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the HFX (High Feature Experimental) Aerostar Ghia was a prototype of future minivan design. Two running prototypes were built from the collaboration of Ford and Ghia;&lt;ref name="translate.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;u=http://www.oldievan.de/html/ford_aerostar.html&amp;ei=WNA4T6yTDsTogAfjpIinCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ7gEwADgK&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DHFX%2Baerostar%2Bghia%26start%3D10%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DN%26biw%3D1675%26bih%3D824%26prmd%3Dimvnsb|title=Google Translate|publisher=|accessdate=January 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; both used the stock 3.0L Vulcan V6 and A4LD automatic transmission. The HFX concept borrowed some features used in other Ford vehicles, such as four-wheel air suspension and electronic climate control. From there, some of the technologies showcased in the HFX had never before been seen in a minivan; this included run-flat tires, adjustable pedals, power-sliding side doors, electric power steering, ABS, traction control, seatbelt pretensioners, and movable grille shutters.&lt;ref name="translate.google.com"/&gt; On the rear, an LCD display was installed for the use of displaying 12 pre-programmed warning messages.&lt;ref name="translate.google.com"/&gt;

The Aerostar was named ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Truck of the Year]] for 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motortrend.com/oftheyear/truck/truck_of_the_year_winners/index.html |title=Truck of the Year Winners |work=Motor Trend |publisher=Primedia, Inc |accessdate=May 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Ford Aerostar had proven successful in the minivan segment, by the end of the 1980s, Ford sought to gain a part of the significant market share held by the [[Chrysler minivans]].  In 1988, the company commenced design work on a successor to the Aerostar for a planned 1993 introduction.  To compete more directly against Chrysler, in its new minivan, Ford adopted the form factor of the long-wheelbase Chrysler minivans.  To further match Chrysler, what was to become the 1995 [[Ford Windstar]] adopted front-wheel drive sedan underpinnings, developed alongside the [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|1996 Ford Taurus]].  

As the Ford Windstar was being readied for a 1995 model-year introduction, 1994 was set to be the final year for the Aerostar. In a fashion similar to the planned replacement of the Fox-platform Ford Mustang with a Mazda-based coupe in the late 1980s, Ford received a negative reaction from its dealers and the public.  In response, Ford announced it would sell both the Aerostar and Windstar vans for the upcoming future.  

On March 17, 1997, Ford announced the discontinuation of the Ford Aerostar, alongside the [[Ford Aspire]], [[Ford Probe]], and [[Ford Thunderbird (tenth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]]/[[Mercury Cougar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.performanceprobe.com/text/info/history.htm |title=Probe History |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011207124340/http://www.performanceprobe.com/text/info/history.htm |archivedate=December 7, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The final vehicle rolled off the St. Louis assembly line on August 22, 1997; a total of 2,029,577 were produced over 12 years.&lt;ref name="bluesarthouse.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesarthouse.com/ford/plant.htm|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301031158/http://www.bluesarthouse.com/ford/plant.htm|archivedate=March 1, 2012|url-status=dead|accessdate=January 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alongside the production of the Ford Windstar, a primary factor leading to the cancellation of the Ford Aerostar was an impending requirement for the addition of dual airbags, which would have required a complete (and costly) redesign of the front dashboard and front crash structure.  

The Ford Windstar (and later Ford Freestar) was offered in a cargo van configuration, but the first direct successor to the Aerostar Van, in terms of size and capability, is the [[Ford Transit Connect]].  Imported into North America since 2010, the front-wheel drive Transit Connect is also offered in passenger configurations; a 2014 redesign led to the first seven-seat Ford minivan since 2007.

The Argentine '''Ford Falcon''' is a car built by [[Ford Motor Argentina|Ford Argentina]] from 1962 to 1991. Mechanically, it was based on the parent company's first generation [[Ford Falcon (North American)|Falcon]]. The Falcon retained the same elegant body style throughout its production, with several substantial facelifts taking place during its lifespan, giving it a more European flavour and bringing it into line with other more contemporary Fords. However, several decades later, it was apparent that it was a 1960s design wearing a 1980s grille.

The robust Ford Falcons became popular as black and yellow taxi cabs and white and blue police vehicles. They also had a less tasteful connotation, with the dark green painted Falcons used by paramilitary government forces like the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] death squads of the 1970s and the secret police of the military junta.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4838538.stm | publisher = BBC News | title = Argentina: Coming to terms with the past | date = 2006-03-24 | first = David | last = Schweimler }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSN0332251120070504 | title = Argentine death squad cars try for new image | last = Ortiz | first = Fiona | publisher = Reuters | date = 2007-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falcons are still raced in the [[Turismo Carretera]] stock car racing series.

==History==
[[File:Ford falcon ad argentina.jpg|thumb|left|1962 Falcon ad]]
The story of the Falcon in Argentina began in 1961 when Ford Motor Argentina imported two Falcons from the US to test.

===1962===
In 1962, local production began with [[complete knock down]] kits imported from the US assembled at the Ford factory in [[La Boca]]. Only a sedan was offered, with Standard and Deluxe trim levels, and a 170 cubic inch [[Ford Straight-6 engine|Ford inline-six engine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://todofalcon.com.ar/falcon62.htm Falcon 1962]&lt;/ref&gt; The official unveiling of the Falcon to the country took place in the theater "Gran Rex" in February 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.todofalcon.com.ar/historia.htm | publisher = Todo Falcon | title = Historia del Ford Falcon |trans-title=History of the Ford Falcon | language = Spanish | accessdate = 2012-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1963===
The first restyle of the Falcon came in 1963 and was produced until 1965. The Falcon now had a horizontal aluminum grill. New models included the Taxi model in 1964, and the more powerful '''Futura''' in 1965, with a vinyl roof and bucket seats. The first Futura left the production line on 4 December 1964.&lt;ref name="page9"&gt;[[#F91|''1961&amp;mdash;1991: Falcon'']], [http://todofalcon.com.ar/libro_09.htm p. 9]&lt;/ref&gt; A larger and more powerful 187 c.i. (3,064&amp;nbsp;cc) engine was added with the Futura, offering {{convert|116|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. More parts were manufactured locally.&lt;ref name="Falcon63"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://todofalcon.com.ar/falcon63.htm | title = Ford Falcon 1963 | publisher = Todo Falcon | language = Spanish | accessdate = 2012-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, the Falcon became the best seller in the Argentinian market for the first time, reaching an 11.6% share of the market.&lt;ref name="page9"/&gt;

===1966===
[[File:1 ford falco 60's si.jpg|thumb|right|1966-1969 period Ford Falcon]]
The second restyling of 1966 brought a more ornate grill, hood and side panel ornamentation. Most parts were now locally produced. In late 1967, the new Falcon '''Rural''' station wagon model began production, with its own Futura and Deluxe variants. Unlike the North American Falcon wagon, the Argentinian Falcon Rural sat on the same wheelbase as the sedans.&lt;ref name="page13"&gt;[[#F91|''1961&amp;mdash;1991: Falcon'']], [http://todofalcon.com.ar/libro_13.htm p. 13]&lt;/ref&gt; High compression engines producing more power were available from 1968, and in 1969 Ford introduced a higher performance 3.6-litre 132&amp;nbsp;hp engine that became available as an option (model 221XP), it employed a freer-breathing cylinder head and less restrictive exhaust system to boost power. A floor-mounted four-speed transmission became available for the first time.&lt;ref name="Falcon66"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://todofalcon.com.ar/falcon66.htm | title = Ford Falcon 1966 | publisher = Todo Falcon | language = Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970===
[[File:Ford falcon 66.jpg|thumb|right|1971 Ford Falcon]] 
The third restyling of 1970 began drifting away from the original design as quad headlights were introduced on Deluxe and Futura models, new front and rear bumpers with vertical nudge bars and disc brakes with 14-inch wheels and low-aspect red-striped radial tyres are now available as options. The 188 and 221 cid engines were now standard. The Futura Rural station wagon was discontinued, instead replaced by the similarly equipped Falcon Rural Deluxe.&lt;ref name="Falcon70"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://todofalcon.com.ar/falcon70.htm | title = Ford Falcon 1970 | publisher = Todo Falcon | language = Spanish | accessdate = 2012-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1973===
By 1973, its fourth restyling, it drifts even more away from the original design, as it gets a new redesigned dashboard with round instruments and tachometer on deluxe models, a new grill with several thick horizontal bars and quad headlights become squarer in design. A  sporting Falcon '''Sprint''' was introduced with new refreshing color schemes, painted stripes, 14-inch sports wheels and E70x14 red-striped [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] Wide-Tread tires were standard and a higher performance 166&amp;nbsp;bhp (124.5&amp;nbsp;kW) specially tuned 3.6-litre (221 cid) engine, on the interior it included additional gauges and leather-covered sports steering wheel and leatherette bucket seats of exclusive design. The Deluxe trim of the Rural station wagon was dropped. A pickup, called the [[Ford Ranchero#Argentine Ranchero|Ranchero]], was introduced with Standard and Deluxe external trim and a heavy-duty brake option.&lt;ref name="Falcon73"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://todofalcon.com.ar/falcon73.htm | title = Ford Falcon 1973 | publisher = Todo Falcon | language = Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1978===
[[File:Ford Falcon Sprint.jpg|thumb|215px|1978 Ford Falcon Sprint]] 
The fifth restyling of 1978 brought further cosmetic changes, with another new grill this time in plastic, Ford's new oval logo emblems, new updated door handles, improved cabin ventilation with exhaust vents on the C pillar, single large rectangular headlights, and 175/70 R14 radial tyres on sporting or deluxe models, amongst several other changes.&lt;ref name="Falcon78"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://todofalcon.com.ar/falcon78.htm | title = Ford Falcon 1978 | publisher = Todo Falcon | language = Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1982===
[[File:Ford Falcon Ghía.jpg|thumb|left|190px|1982 Ford Falcon Ghía]]
On its  sixth and last restyling, Ford tried to bring its design in line, as it is sold along its more modern "siblings", the Ford  [[Ford Taunus|Taunus]], [[Ford Sierra|Sierra]], and later the [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Escort]]. Changes include new bumpers with rubber strips and rubber end caps, new large rectangular taillights with amber turn signals, bronze-tinted glass replaced green, and a larger trunk by reconfiguring the trunk floor and repositioning the spare tyre, and other minor cosmetic changes. The Rural continued to use the original taillights. The Taxi and Sprint versions were dropped, and the Futura was changed into the '''Ghia'''. A 2.3-litre four-cylinder petrol engine was available, as was, as of 1988, a rare 2.4-litre diesel. The diesel, a {{convert|70|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} Italian-made [[List of VM Motori engines#HR492|VM HR492]], was installed by Borward Puntana, but as they were unable to provide engines at the pace needed by Ford, the project soon came to a halt. Most of the diesels built were Ranchero pickups.&lt;ref name="Falcon82"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://todofalcon.com.ar/falcon82.htm | title = Ford Falcon 1982 | publisher = Todo Falcon | language = Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pickup truck, capable of a {{convert|715|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} max load, continued to be available with the 3.3- and 3.6-litre sixes, as well as the new four.&lt;ref name="AK86"&gt;{{cite book | title = Auto Katalog 1986 | ref = AK86 | publisher = [[:de:Motor Presse Stuttgart|Vereinigte Motor-Verlage GmbH &amp; Co. KG]] | editor-last = Heitz | editor-first = Rudolf | location = Stuttgart | page = 24 | volume = 29 | language = German | date = 1985-08-01 | id = 81530/85001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2.3 offered {{convert|90|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while the smaller six has only {{convert|84|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}, albeit with a higher torque and at a more leisurely engine speed.&lt;ref name="AK862"&gt;[[#AK86|''Auto Katalog 1986'']], p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; The unpopular (due to fuel economy worse than that of the 3-litre six) four-cylinder was available only with a four-speed manual, rather than the three-speed manual of the sixes.&lt;ref name=TAM90&gt;{{Cite book | title = Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1990 | editor = Mastrostefano, Raffaele | publisher = Editoriale Domus S.p.A | year = 1990 | pages = 305–306 | language = Italian | location = Milano }}&lt;/ref&gt; The four-cylinder was shared with the Argentinian-built Taunus and Sierras. The larger 3.6, the only engine available to the Ghia, has {{convert|109|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} except in the high-performance Ghia SP, where {{convert|140|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} were on tap due to twin carburettors.&lt;ref name="AK862"/&gt; Introduced in 1982, there was also a low-compression version of the 3.6 with {{convert|103|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="AK83"&gt;{{cite book | title = Auto Katalog 1983 | editor-last = Heitz | editor-first = Rudolf | publisher = [[:de:Motor Presse Stuttgart|Vereinigte Motor-Verlage GmbH &amp; Co. KG]] | location = Stuttgart | page = 54 | volume = 26 | language = German | year = 1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, the new Max Econo version of the 188 cid/3-litre engine became available, with better fuel economy at the cost of performance. Chrome was removed in 1990, and the Falcon was finally discontinued after 1991.&lt;ref name="Falcon82"/&gt;

'''Zebra Three''' is a radio code name, more accurately known as a call sign, given by the fictional "Bay City, California" police department of the [[iconic]] 1970s television series ''[[Starsky &amp; Hutch]]'' to Robbery-Homicide Division [[detective]]s David Starsky and Kenneth "Hutch" Hutchinson; the BCPD was loosely based upon the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) . The "Zebra" part of their call sign refers to them being a geographic patrol unit assigned to a special detail; however, the LAPD normally does this with uniformed officers.  Several Los Angeles locations were used for "Bay City", and uniformed police officers were seen wearing "BCPD" shoulder patches. Fans of the show applied the code name as a [[nickname]] for the [[Ford]] [[Ford Torino|Gran Torino]] that Starsky owned; the general public picked up on it, and the car has been known since (incorrectly) as "Zebra Three", or more correctly the "Striped Tomato".

== Original 'Perfect Car' ==
Originally, the show's creator, [[William Blinn]], was to have Starsky drive a green and white high performance [[Chevrolet Camaro]] because he remembered one that he had previously owned.

When the production was being planned, the studio was unable to locate another green and white Chevrolet Camaro or order a 1975 Camaro from [[General Motors]], because of their lease contract with the [[Ford Motor Company]].

== 'Perfect Car' ==
When production started on the pilot, Ford Motor Company's studio-TV car loan program was the lease supplier for [[Spelling-Goldberg Productions]] that year. Producers looked at lease stock and chose two (one main, one backup) [[Ford_Windsor_engine#351|351 Windsor]] V8-powered "Bright Red" (code 2B) 2-door [[Ford Torino|Gran Torino]]s to portray Starsky's automobile.

The cars were equipped with chrome exterior rearview mirrors and protective black vinyl bodyside moldings, and the interiors were black with vinyl bench seats. On top of the factory paint the distinctive white "vector" stripe with bordering black pinstripe was applied. The Torinos had their rear ends lifted by air shocks and were equipped with "U.S." brand 5-slot aluminum wheels with larger rear tires plus a chrome tip on the exhaust pipe.

They also replaced the original 2.75 to 1 rear axle gearing (standard, along with automatic transmission, on 1975 and newer Torinos) with numerically higher gears for better acceleration during stunt driving scenes; this was done during all four seasons to the S-G Torinos. Engine sounds were dubbed into the show [[soundtrack]] since the Torinos were mechanically stock; emissions laws forbade modifying the engines or emissions systems of new cars.

When the pilot was successful, Spelling-Goldberg ordered two new 1975 Torinos for the first season. These cars were powered by [[Ford_335_engine#400|400 Modified]] V8s because extra power was going to be needed for additional stunt driving scenes; from the second to fourth seasons, three 1976 Torinos powered by [[Ford_385_engine#460|460 Lima]] V8s were used. Due to the success of the series, Ford produced 1,000 "limited edition" replicas of the ''Starsky and Hutch'' Torino from March to May 1976 at the [[Chicago]] assembly plant. Spelling-Goldberg leased one for a backup vehicle; it was known as "Unit 129". During the series' run, several 1974 to 1976 Gran Torinos were used as stunt cars to minimize damage, wear and tear on the main vehicles.

While Spelling-Goldberg was happy with the Torinos, the stars (specifically [[Paul Michael Glaser]], who played Dave Starsky) were not so pleased. In fact, when Aaron Spelling showed Glaser his character's car, which Spelling had dubbed as the "surprise" that he had outside, Glaser's reaction was more of disgust rather than pleasure. His initial reply was "it's red."  

When interviewed about the Torino, which became the ''[[de facto]]'' "third star", Glaser had no qualms about saying he did not like the car at all. He was quoted as saying "it was huge, it had no pickup, it couldn't handle," and in all of the scenes where he would lock the brakes to stop at a crime scene and bump the car off the curb, Glaser was purposely trying to break the Torino.

The '''Ford Galaxie''' is a [[Ford full-size|full-sized car]] that was built in the [[United States]] by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] for model years 1959 through to 1974. The name was used for the top models in Ford's full-size range from 1958 until 1961, in a marketing attempt to appeal to the excitement surrounding the [[Space Race]]. For 1962, all full-size Fords wore the Galaxie badge, with "500" and "500/XL" denoting the higher series. The Galaxie 500/LTD was introduced for 1965 followed by the Galaxie 500 7-Litre for 1966. The '''Galaxie 500''' prefix was dropped from the LTD in 1966, and from the XL in 1967;&lt;ref name=XL&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1967_Ford/1967_Ford_Full_Size_Brochure/1967%20Ford%20Full%20Size-08-09.html |title=1967 Ford Full-Size brochure |pages=8 &amp; 9 |publisher=oldcarbrochures |accessdate=2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the basic series structuring levels were maintained. The "regular" Galaxie 500 continued below the [[Ford LTD (North America)|LTD]] as Ford's mid-level full-size model from 1965 until its demise at the end of the 1974 model year.&lt;ref name = "Gunnell"&gt;{{cite book|first=John |last=Gunnell |title=Standard Catalogue of American Cars, 1946–1975 |edition=Revised 4th | year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |401–42}}

The Galaxie was the competitor to the high-volume full sized [[Chevrolet Impala]].&lt;ref name=Odin&gt;Odin, L.C. ''A concise guide to the Ford and Mercury full-size automobile production 1969-1978''. Belvedere Publishing, 2016. ASIN: B01HE91Y4K.&lt;/ref&gt;

The similarly named [[Ford Galaxy]] is a large car/minivan available in the European market. The vehicle's name is believed to be derived from the original Ford Galaxie.

Although a separate series from the Fairlane 500,&lt;ref name = "Gunnell" /&gt;{{rp |402}} 1959 Galaxie models carried both ''Fairlane 500'' and ''Galaxie'' badging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1959_Ford/1959_Fords_Mailer/1959%20Fords-01.html |title=The 59 Fords (sales brochure) |publisher=oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with the era, the 1959 Galaxie was a chrome and stainless steel-bedecked vehicle with optional two-tone paint. It was the very image of the ostentatious late-1950s American automobiles,  though somewhat tamer than its Chevrolet and Plymouth competitors. Ford advertised "safety anchorage" for the front seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1959_Ford/1959_Ford_Brochure_1/1959%20Ford-08.html |title=1959 Ford Brochure |page=8 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parking brake was now a pedal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1959_Ford/1959_Ford_Brochure_1/1959%20Ford-09.html |title=1959 Ford Brochure |page=9 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seat belts, a padded dashboard, and child-proof rear door locks were optional, while a deep-dished steering wheel and double-door locks were standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1959_Ford/1959_Ford_Brochure_1/1959%20Ford-10.html |title=1959 Ford brochure |page=10 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the models was the [[Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner|Skyliner]], moved upward from the Fairlane 500 model, and featuring a retractable [[hardtop]] that folded down into the trunk space. This feature, complicated and expensive, left very little trunk room when folded down. Power retractable hardtops have since been used by luxury manufacturers such as [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Lexus]], and [[Cadillac]], but in all these cases the vehicle was a two-seater, allowing a much smaller top mechanism than the Skyliner's. Not until 2006, when the [[Pontiac G6]] convertible, Peugeot 206 CC (in Europe) and [[Volkswagen Eos]] appeared, did another mass-market model with a rear seat appear in this category.

A fixture also was the previous year's 352 V8, still developing {{convert|300|hp}}.

;1960
[[File:1960 Ford Galaxie Sunliner.jpg|thumb|left|1960 Ford Galaxie Sunliner]]
The 1960 Galaxie introduced all-new design with less ornamentation. A new body style was the ''Starliner'', featuring a huge, curving rear observation window on a pillarless, hardtop bodyshell. The thin, sloping rear roof pillar featured three "star" emblems that served as the Galaxie signature badge for all 1960 - 62 models.   The formal roofed 2-door hardtop was not available this year, but the roofline was used for the Galaxie 2-door pillared sedan, complete with chromed window frames. It had been the most popular body style in the line for 1959, and sales dropped off sharply. Contrary to Ford's tradition of pie-plate round taillights, the 1960 featured "half-moon" lenses turned downward. The [[Pillar (car)|"A" pillar]] now swept forward instead of backward, making entering and exiting the car more convenient.

{{clear_left}}
;1961
[[File:1961 Ford Galaxie Sunliner red.jpg|thumb|left|1961 Ford Galaxie Sunliner]]
For 1961, the bodywork was redone again, although the underpinnings were the same as for 1960. This time, the tailfins were almost gone; the small blade-like fins capped smaller versions of 1959's "pie-plate" round taillamps once again. Performance was beginning to be a selling point, and the 1961 Galaxie offered a new 390&amp;nbsp;[[Cubic inch displacement|CID]] (6.4&amp;nbsp;L) version of Ford's [[Ford FE engine|FE series]] pushrod [[V8 engine|V8]], which was available with either a four-barrel [[carburetor]] or, for higher performance, three two-barrel carburetors. The latter was rated at 401&amp;nbsp;hp (298&amp;nbsp;kW) (gross). The 352 was downgraded in favor of the 390; it was equipped with a 2-barrel carburetor and single exhaust. The Starliner was again offered this year, and Ford promoted this model with luxury and power equipment, but it was dropped at the end of the year, as the re-introduced square-roof hardtop coupe, the Galaxie Club Victoria, took the bulk of sales.

;1962
[[File:Galaxie 500 AV.jpg|thumb|left|1962 Ford Galaxie 500 Club Victoria]]
[[File:Galaxie 500 AR.jpg|thumb|1962 Ford Galaxie 500 Club Victoria]]
For 1962, the Galaxie name was applied to all of Ford's full size models, as the [[Ford Fairlane (North American)|Fairlane]] name was moved to a new intermediate model and Custom was temporarily retired. New top-line '''Galaxie 500''' (two-door sedan and hardtop, four-door sedan and hardtop, and "Sunliner" convertible) models offered plusher interiors, more chrome trim outside, and a few additional luxury items over and above what was standard on the plainer Galaxie models. Base Galaxie models were available in two- and four-door sedans as well as the plain Ranch Wagon.  In an effort to stimulate midseason sales, Ford introduced a group of sporty cars along with a "Lively Ones" marketing campaign. These models featured the bucket seats and console that were popularized by the Chevrolet Corvair Monza, and included a Fairlane 500 Sports Coupe, and a Falcon Futura. The full-size line was available with new bucket-seats-and-console  "Lively One," the '''Galaxie 500/XL''' (two-door hardtop and convertible).  Ford stated in its sales literature that XL stood for "Xtra Lively."

The {{convert|223|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} "Mileage Maker" [[Straight-6|6-cylinder]] was the base engine. The {{convert|292|cid|l|1| abbr= on}} V8 was standard on the 500/XL. The XL had sportier trim inside and out. This model was Ford's response to Chevrolet's Super Sport option for the big [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]], which was introduced the previous year and saw a significant rise in sales for 1962. A {{convert|406|cid|l|0|abbr=on}} engine was available in single four-barrel or triple-carbureted "six-barrel" form. Tailfins were gone, giving the 1962 models a more rounded, softer rear end look. Taillights were set lower into the rear panel and were partially sunken into the newly sculpted rear bumper.  Outside, XL models got a thicker body side chrome spear, along with a new "Galaxie 500XL" emblem on each rear fender (including the convertible, where this badge replaced the "Sunliner" script).  An oval version of the Galaxie "star" emblem replaced Ford crests on the roof sail panels on hardtops.  Front fenders shapes were the same as 1961; a slightly modified flat-face grille featured a large "star"emblem in its center for all 500 and higher-priced Galaxie models.

The 1962 models were overweight by comparison to the Super Duty Pontiacs with their aluminum body panels and larger-displacement engines.&lt;ref name="K84"&gt;Kirschenbaum, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, late in the production run, Ford's Experimental Garage was ordered to reduce the weight of the Galaxie.&lt;ref name="K84"/&gt; It produced 11 "lightweight Galaxies", making use of fiberglass panels, as well as aluminum bumpers, fender aprons, and brackets;&lt;ref name="K84" /&gt; the result was a Galaxie weighing in at under {{convert|3400|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="K84"/&gt; The base 2-door Club Sedan was {{convert|3499|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; It was an improvement.&lt;ref name="K84"/&gt;

;1963
[[File:1963 Ford Galaxie sedan, fL.jpg|thumb|left|1963 Ford Galaxie 4-door sedan]]
The 1963 model was essentially unchanged save for some freshening and added trim; windshields were reshaped and a four-door hardtop 500/XL was added. A lower, [[fastback]] roofline was added mid-year to improve looks and make the big cars more competitive on the NASCAR tracks with less drag and reduced aerodynamic lift at high speed. This 1963½ model, the industry's first official "½ year" model,&lt;ref name="K85"&gt;Kirschenbaum, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; was called the "sports hardtop" or "fastback" (it shared this feature with the for 1963½ [[Ford Falcon (Americas)|Falcon]]).&lt;ref name="K85"/&gt; Galaxie buyers showed their preference as the new sports hardtop models handily outsold the "boxtop" square-roof models. The sports hardtop was available in both Galaxie 500, and Galaxie 500/XL trim. Mercury also received the new roofline (under the [[Mercury Marauder|Marauder]] badge) in Monterey, Montclair, and Park Lane models. This year, a no-frills big Ford, priced around $100.00 below the base Galaxie sedans. was offered, badged as the [[Ford 300 (1963)|Ford 300]]. It was offered for 1963 only, and was replaced by the Custom series in 1964.  The "Swing-away" steering wheel became optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1963_Ford/1963_Ford_Brochure_1/1963%20Ford%20Brochure-11.html |title=1963 Ford Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fairlane's newly enlarged "Challenger" V8 engine of {{convert|260|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} replaced the Y-block {{convert |292|cid|l|1|abbr= on}} as the entry level V8. Later in the year, the 260 was replaced with an enlarged version displacing 289 cubic inches.

At the beginning of the 1963 model run, the 292 Y-block V8 was replaced as the base V8 engine with the Fairlane's new small block 260. The 260 proved under-powered for the heavy full size Ford and was replaced midyear (coincident with the introduction of the 63 and 1/2 models) with the 289 V8.  The 289 was then the largest of the "small block series" that was first used (221 cubic inch version) in the 1962 [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Fairlane]].  The 260 was offered on the [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Falcon]] Sprint and later, in mid 1964, in the early version of the 1965 [[Ford Mustang|Mustang]]. By 1965 model introduction (in the fall of 1964), the 260 (which had disappointing performance in all versions including the Sprint and Mustang) was replaced by the 289 in all models. 

Ford continued to offer the FE series 352 in the 1963 full size, as well as 3 versions of the 390 V8 (regular, high performance, and police). Five different transmissions were offered for 1963. A 3-speed manual column shift was standard on all models except the 406 V8, which required the heavier duty Borg-Warner 4-speed manual. A three speed manual with overdrive was optional, but rarely ordered. The two-speed Ford-O-Matic was common with the 6-cylinder and small block V-8s, while the majority of big blocks (352 and 390) were ordered with the 3-speed Cruise-O-Matic automatic transmission. The availability of several different rear end ratios, along with 5 transmissions, and 8 different engines, led to a huge number of different driveline combinations for 1963. The most produced combination for the Galaxie and Galaxie 500 was the 352 V8, with Cruise-O-Matic and the 3.0 rear end ratio.  Ford's "Club," "Town," and "Victoria" monikers for body styles were retired in 1963, replaced by generic labels, "2-door","4-door", and "Hardtop."

Partway through this year and in limited quantities, a new 427 replaced the 406 for racing applications. It was intended to meet NHRA and [[NASCAR]] 7-liter maximum engine size rules.&lt;ref&gt;Kirschenbaum, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; This engine was rated at a {{convert|425|hp|kW|abbr= on}} ([[Horsepower|gross horsepower]])&lt;ref name="K85cap"&gt;Kirschenbaum, p. 85 caption.&lt;/ref&gt; with 2 x 4 barrel [[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] carburetors&lt;ref name="K85cap"/&gt; and a solid lifter camshaft. Ford also made available aluminum cylinder heads as a dealer option.

The 1963½ was still overweight, however.&lt;ref name="K85" /&gt; To be competitive in drag racing Ford produced 212{{citation needed | date=February 2010|reason=''Hot Rod'' counts "about 190" in all}} (around 170 from Ford Norfolk, about 20 from Ford Los Angeles)&lt;ref name="K86"&gt;Kirschenbaum, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; lightweight versions of the "R" code 427, in the Galaxie 500 Sport Special Tudor Fastback.&lt;ref name="K85"/&gt; Available only in Corinthian White with red vinyl interior,&lt;ref name="K85"/&gt; and with a list price of about US$4,200&lt;ref name="K87"&gt;Kirschenbaum, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; (when a base Ford 300 went for US$2,324, and XL Fastback was US$3,268),&lt;ref&gt;Flory, pp. 234–5.&lt;/ref&gt; these cars came stock with Borg-Warner T-10 four-speed,&lt;ref name = "K87" /&gt; 4.11:1 rear axle, heavy-duty suspension and brakes,&lt;ref name = "K85" /&gt; and were fitted with a fiberglass hood (a flat piece at first, late in 1963 the popular blister hood also used on the [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)#Thunderbolt|Thunderbolt]]),&lt;ref name="K85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="K89"&gt;Kirschenbaum, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; trunk, front fenders, and fender aprons,&lt;ref name="K85" /&gt; as well as aluminum bumpers and mounting brackets, transmission cases, and bellhousing. Hood springs, heater, trunk lining and mat, spare wheel and tire (and mounting bracket), trunk lid torsion bar, jack, lug wrench, one horn (of the stock two), armrests, rear ashtrays, courtesy lights, and dome light were removed to reduce weight.&lt;ref&gt;Kirschenbaum, pp. 85–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The first 20 cars had functional fiberglass doors, which shaved {{convert |25|lb|kg|abbr=on}};&lt;ref name="K85cap" /&gt; these were deleted because of Ford's concern for safety if used on the highway.{{citation needed |date= February 2010| reason=''Hot Rod'' doubts it}} The cars had all sound-deadening material removed, lightweight seats and floormats, and no options. They were not factory equipped with [[Cold air intake|cold-air induction]],&lt;ref name="K87"/&gt; as the Thunderbolt would be. In addition, they were built on the {{convert |45|lb|kg|0| abbr= on}}-lighter Ford 300 chassis, originally intended for a smaller-displacement V8.&lt;ref name = "K85" /&gt; In all, the 427s were {{convert |375|lb|kg|abbr=on}} lighter than before ({{convert|425|lb|kg|abbr=on}} with the fiberglass doors).&lt;ref name="K85"/&gt;

The first two lightweight Galaxies, using {{convert|289|cid|l|0|abbr=on}} bodies, were assembled at Wayne, Michigan, late in January 1963, to be tested at the 1963 [[NHRA Winternationals|Winternats]].&lt;ref name="K86" /&gt; They were delivered to Tasca Ford (East Providence, Rhode Island) and Bob Ford (Dearborn, Michigan).&lt;ref name = "K86"/&gt; Bill Lawton's Tasca Galaxie turned the best performance, with a 12.50 pass at {{convert|116.60|mph|km/h|2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="K86"/&gt; It was not enough against the 1963 [[Chevrolet Impala]] Z-11s in Limited Production/Stock, however.&lt;ref name="K89"/&gt; 

Three more were assembled from parts and tested at Ford's Experimental Garage in Dearborn.&lt;ref name="K86"/&gt; One of the next two, the last Winternationals test cars, was prepared by Bill Stroppe in Long Beach, California, for Les Ritchey; it was featured in the July 1963 issue of ''Hot Rod''.&lt;ref name="K86"/&gt; For all their efforts, Ford discovered the Galaxies were still too heavy, and the project was abandoned.&lt;ref name="K89" /&gt; Some of these cars competed in England, Australia and South Africa after being modified by Holman and Moody who fitted them with disc brakes and other circuit racing components. Jack Sears won the [[1963 British Saloon Car Championship]]  driving Galaxies and Cortinas and the racing Galaxies were also driven by Sir Jack Brabham, Graham Hill and other notable drivers of the period. The heavy Galaxies suffered from persistent brake failure that led to a number of crashes, and in late 1963 started using the 12-inch disc brakes from the Ford GT40 program. By this time the Lotus Cortinas were being developed and the big Galaxie became uncompetitive.

;1964
[[File:Ford Galaxie 500 Coupé 1964 Kingman Septembre 2012.jpg|thumb|left|1964 Ford Galaxie 500]]
Model year 1964 was the fourth and final year of this body style. Interior trim was altered, and the exterior featured a more sculpted look which was actually designed to make the car more aerodynamic for NASCAR. The formal-roof "boxtop" style was no longer available, all non-wagon models now featuring the "[[fastback]]" roof design that was the runaway best-seller in 1963.  The base 300 was replaced by a line of Custom and Custom 500 models. The 289 continued as the base V8 and was standard in the XL series. XL models got new thin-shell bucket seats with chrome trim. Federal regulations now required lap-style safety belts for both front outboard occupants.  The ignition switch was moved from the left side of the steering column, to the right, but otherwise the attractive instrument panel remained unchanged from '63.  The 1964 XL two-door hardtop became the best seller of any XL produced in any year.

The {{convert|427|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} engine was used in 50 lightweight fiberglass-equipped cars for drag racing. These competed in North America but were still too heavy and Ford introduced the lightweight Fairlane Thunderbolt.

The Ford Country Squire station wagon, while wearing "Country Squire" badging, was actually part of the Galaxie 500 line. Some Country Squires had "Galaxie 500" badging on the glovebox indicating the series name. These [[station wagon]]s featured the same trims as Galaxie 500s, and were a step up from the base-model Country Sedan.

The 1965 Galaxie was an all-new design, featuring vertically stacked dual headlights. The cars were taller and bulkier than the previous year's. The new top-of-the-line designation was the ''Galaxie 500 LTD'' and ''Galaxie 500 XL''. The LTD and the XL trim package were accessory upgrades from the base Galaxie model. Engine choices were the same as 1964, except for an all-new {{convert |240|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} six-cylinder engine replacing the 1950s-era 223 "Mileage-Maker" six and the 352 was now equipped with dual exhausts and a four-barrel carburetor.

Suspension on the 1965 models was redesigned. Replacing the former leaf-spring rear suspension was a new three-link system, with coil springs. Interiors featured a new instrument panel, as well as two-way key vehicle access: the introduction of two keys was for valet parking, where the rounded head key would only open the trunk or locked glove compartment, while the squared head key would only unlock the doors and the ignition.

A new model was introduced for 1966; the ''Galaxie 500 7 Litre'', fitted with a new engine, the 345&amp;nbsp;hp {{convert|428|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Thunderbird V8. This engine was also available on the [[Ford Thunderbird]] and the [[Mercury S-55]].  The [[police car|police versions]] received a 360&amp;nbsp;hp version of the 428 known as the 'Police Interceptor' as [[police car]]s. The 1966 body style was introduced in [[Brazil]] ([[Ford do Brasil]]) as a 1967 model; it had the same external dimensions throughout its lifetime until [[Brazil]]ian production ended in 1983. Safety regulations for 1966 required seat belts front and rear on all new cars sold domestically. The Galaxie 500 would be the #3-selling convertible in the U.S. in 1966, with 27,454 sold; it was beaten by the [[Ford Mustang (first generation)#1964–1966|Mustang]] (at 72,119, by more than 2:1) and by the [[Chevrolet Impala#Fourth generation (1965–1970)|Impala]] at 38,000.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p. 412&lt;/ref&gt; A parking brake light on the dashboard and an AM/FM radio was optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunnell |first=John |title=standard catalog of American Muscle Cars 1960–1972 |year=2006 |publisher=Krause Publications |isbn=0-89689-433-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1966 [[Ford LTD (North America)|LTD]] dropped the Galaxie name.&lt;ref name = "Gunnell" /&gt;{{rp |423}}

For 1967, the ''7 Litre'' model no longer carried the Galaxie name; it was to be the last year of it being separately identified. That identification was mainly trim such as horn ring and dashboard markings as well as the "Q" in the [[Vehicle Identification Number]]. The 7 Litre for 1967 was a trim and performance option on the '''Ford XL''', which was now a separate model as well.&lt;ref name=XL/&gt; Little else changed, except for trim and the styling; the same engines were available, from the 240 cu. inch six-cylinder to the 428 cu. inch V8. Modifications to the styling included adding a major bend in the center of the grille and making the model less "boxy" than the 1966 model.  An [[8-track tape]] cartridge player became an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1967_Ford/1967_Ford_Full_Line_Brochure/1967%20Ford%20Full%20Line-03.html |title=1967 Ford Full Lin brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back-up lights were standard.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures.com"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1967_Ford/1967_Ford_Full_Line_Brochure/1967%20Ford%20Full%20Line-16.html |title=1967 Ford Full Line brochure |page=16 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1967 all Fords featured a large, padded hub in the center of the plastic steering wheel, along with an energy-absorbing steering column (introduced late into the 1967 model year),&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures.com"/&gt; padded interior surfaces, recessed controls on the instrument panel, and front outboard shoulder belt anchors. Another safety related change was the introduction of the dual brake master cylinder used on all subsequent Galaxies (and other Ford models).

The 1968 model had a new grille with headlights arranged horizontally, although the body was essentially the same car from the windshield back. The 'long hood, short deck' style with a more upright roofline and a [[notchback]] rear was followed too, as was the new trend for concealed headlights on the ''XL'' and ''LTD''. One other change for 1968 was that the base V8 engine increased from 289 to {{convert|302|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}. Standard equipment included courtesy lights, a cigarette lighter, a suspended gas pedal, and padded front seat backs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1968_Ford/1968_Ford_Brochure/1968%20Ford-22.html |title=1968 Ford brochure |page=22 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1968 models featured additional safety features, including side marker lights and shoulder belts on cars built after December 1, 1967. The 1967 model's large steering wheel hub was replaced by a soft "bar" spoke that ran through the diameter of the wheel (and like the 1967 style, was used throughout the Ford Motor Company line). A plastic horn ring was also featured.

The 1969 model was built on a new platform with a {{Convert|121|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase. It was the end for the 427 and 428 engines, save for only the police package versions which continued to use the 360&amp;nbsp;hp 428 P Code 'Police Interceptor' as their top motor for 1969-70.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt; Replacing the FE series-based 427 and 428 engines was the new {{convert |429|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} "ThunderJet" that was introduced in the 1968 [[Ford Thunderbird]]; it was part of the new [[Ford 385 engine]] series. Power, at {{convert |360|hp|kW|abbr= on}} for the dual-exhaust 4-barrel version, was higher than the 428's {{convert|345|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and lower than the racing-bred 427's final rating of {{convert |390|hp|kW|abbr=on}}; there was also a single-exhaust 2-barrel version with {{convert|320|hp|kW|abbr=on}} available. The dashboard was built as a pod around the driver rather than traditionally extending across both sides. The ''XL'' and ''Galaxie 500 Sportsroof'' had rear sail panels to simulate a fastback roofline.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt; The rear trim panel below the tail lights was used to distinguish the different trim levels. The ''Country Squire'' was, perhaps, the pinnacle of design for that wagon with the concealed headlights.

[[File:1970FordXL.jpg|thumb|left|1970 Ford XL SportsRoof]]
Headrests were featured on 1969 model cars built after January 1, 1969.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt; It was not until 1968 that a station wagon was actually marketed under the ''Galaxie'' name. From 1955 to 1968 [[full-size Ford]] wagons were treated as a separate model series and were listed as ''Ranch Wagon'', ''Country Sedan'', and ''Country Squire''. For the 1969 model year a higher-trim ''Ranch Wagon'' was offered as the ''Custom 500 Ranch Wagon'', the ''Country Sedan'' the ''Galaxie Country Sedan'' and the ''Country Squire'' was marketed as the ''LTD Country Squire''.&lt;ref name = "Gunnell" /&gt;{{rp |394–429}}

Galaxies for model year 1970 received minor trim changes. A new ignition lock was located on the right side of the steering column. Model year 1970 was the last year for the XL,&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt; but Galaxie 500 hardtop coupes were also available in both formal-roof and SportsRoof body styles. The optional 4-speed manual transmission, which was available on the 429 the year prior, was dropped for 1970.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;

A complete redesign was offered for 1971. This included a horizontal wrap around front bumper with a massive vertical center section much in the vein of concurrent [[Pontiac]]s. Taillights lost the traditional "rocket" exhaust theme in favor of horizontal lights and trimmed center section.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt; Rooflines were squared off and had a "formal" air. The ''XL'' was dropped, as were concealed headlight covers for the ''LTD''.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt; The convertible was moved to the ''LTD'' series in 1970 (1971 model year) and lasted through 1972. The engine line-up saw some changes for '71. The 351 2v V8 was now standard equipment on all full-sized Fords save for the lower-line Custom &amp; Custom 500 versions where the 240 straight six was still the base power plant with a 302 2v V8 and up still offered as options. The optional 390 2v FE V8 was replaced mid-year by a new 335 series 400 2v V8. The 429 4v was still the top engine, while the police-only versions received a new 370&amp;nbsp;hp 429 'Police Interceptor' as their new top offering. A column-shifted 3-speed manual was still the base transmission on the 240,302 &amp; 351 engines with Select-Shift automatic being optional but mandatory on all of the larger engines.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;

Models for 1972 were similar but the vertical center grille section was now not so prominent as the front bumper now continued across it and the rear bumper was enlarged with inset taillamps. This was also the final year for the {{convert|240|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-six engine|six-cylinder engine]] and three-speed manual transmission (which was available only with the six-cylinder engine); all V8-powered Galaxies had SelectShift automatic transmission as standard equipment.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;

The 1973 model was marginally shorter than previous models, but had a heavier, bulker appearance. Three towing packages were optional, each with increasing towing capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1973_Ford/1973_Ford_Brochure/1973%20Ford-14.html |title=1973 Ford brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; For law men, there were multiple Police package versions available with engines ranging from the 351 2v to the powerful 460 Police Interceptor. Taxi packages continued to be offered as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dusan Ristic-Petrovic |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/Misc%20Brochures/1973%20Police%20Vehicles/1973%20Police%20Vehicles-03.html |title=1973 Police Vehicles |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; All 1973 full-sized Fords now came with a 351 2v V8-engine and SelectShift automatic transmission as their base driveline.  Four-door sedans with metal door frames were replaced with a new "Pillared Hardtop" model which featured a thin "B" post and frameless door glass.  This body style was offered together with the traditional pillarless four-door hardtop.

The 1974 model year was essentially a repeat of 1973, but it was the last year for the ''Galaxie 500'' name.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt; Ford elected to consolidate most of its full-size models under the popular ''LTD'' name for 1975, while reserving the base-model [[Ford Custom|Custom 500]] (which was below the Galaxie 500) nameplate for fleet buyers and private customers who insisted on the lowest-priced full-sized model possible. Power front disc brakes were standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1974_Ford/1974_Ford_Full_Line_Brochure/1974%20Ford%20Full%20Line-02.html |title=1974 Ford Full Line brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''LTD'' stayed on as the top full-size model.  Although a top seller and high-end model for many years, the Galaxie was slowly phased out and de-emphasized by Ford Motor Co. in an effort to push the posher LTD as a mainstream full size car.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;

Approximately 7,850,000 full-size Fords and Mercurys were sold over 1968–1978.&lt;ref name="kowalke1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kowalke|first=Ron|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975|year=1997|publisher=Krause publications|isbn=0-87341-521-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/standardcatalogo00beve}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flammang, James 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Flammang |first=James |title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1976–1999 |edition=Third |publisher=Krause Publications |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it the second best selling Ford [[automobile platform]] after the [[Ford Model T]].&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;

==Australian production==
[[File:Ford Galaxie 500 1966 Aus.JPG|thumb|1966 Australian Ford Galaxie 500]]
The Ford Galaxie was also produced in [[Australia]] from 1965 to 1969.&lt;ref name=galid/&gt; The 1965 model, which was designated as the Galaxie GE series by [[Ford Australia]], was assembled at Ford's [[Homebush]] plant in [[New South Wales]],&lt;ref name=galid/&gt; and was offered as a 4-door sedan with a choice of {{convert |289|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} or {{convert|390|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} cid V8 engines.&lt;ref name=uniquecars&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.uniquecars.carpoint.com.au/portal/alias__uniquecarsau/tabID__203009/ArticleID__8246/DesktopDefault.aspx | title = Star Gazing | publisher = Unique Cars | accessdate = 10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1966, 1967 and 1968 models were also assembled at Homebush prior to a change to full importation from 1969, with conversion from left to right hand drive being undertaken at Ford's [[Broadmeadows]] facility in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].&lt;ref name=galid/&gt; The 1969 model was marketed as the Galaxie LTD,&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt; as were subsequent models through to the introduction of the locally developed [[Ford Fairlane (Australia)#ZG / P5 (1973–1976)|Ford LTD]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Norm | last = Darwin | title = The History of Ford in Australia | year = 1986 | page = 140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to local assembly which began in late 1964, small numbers of RHD full imports were sourced through select Australian Ford dealers, and also by Ford of Australia for executive use. RHD wagons, convertibles and fastbacks, 2- and 4-door hardtops, XLs and LTDs were generally sourced as full imports from Ford of Canada until approx 1968. The fully imported 1959 to early 1963 models used a 1959 U.S. Fairlane dashboard and instruments. In late 1963, a 1959 Edsel Corsair-based dashboard was used, and for 1964, a 1959 Edsel Ranger-based dashboard was used. However, some RHD 1963s and 1964s have been photographed with the more attractive U.S.-style 1964 cluster. Australian assembled 1965–1968 models were sourced in CKD form from Ford of Canada. The 1965–1967 model Galaxies adopted the RHD dashboard based on the 1963 Lincoln Continental. The 1967 models got the U.S.-market safety steering wheel with its thickly padded center hub. This wheel was retained for 1968, and the 1968 Torino cluster replaced the Continental version. Some right hand drive 1967s have been seen with a mirror image of the US-style instrument panel for that year.

Australian assembled cars 1965–1968 received a woodgrain dashboard fascia, and accessories as standard, such as:
* Power steering
* Power brakes (front disc from 1967)
* Radio with 390 engine
* Automatic transmission
* Wipers and washers (single speed intermittent wipers for 1965–1966, 2-speed from 1967)
* 3-speed heater defroster

For the 1968 model year the 289 CID engine was dropped as the base option in favor of the new 302 CID (Windsor) V8.

Australian assembly of 1965 to 1968 model Galaxies from CKD kits totalled 3,124 vehicles with 1,766 of the 1969 to 1972 models converted to right-hand-drive in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://sites.google.com/site/australiangalaxieregistry/home/history | publisher = Google Sites | title = Australian Galaxie Registry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brazilian production==
[[File:Galaxie Landau 1982.JPG|thumb|1982 Ford Landau (a luxury Brazilian version of the Galaxie)]]
The 1966 four-door sedan version of the Galaxie was also produced in [[Brazil]] under the names Galaxie, Galaxie 500, LTD and [[Ford Landau|Landau]] from 1967 to 1983.
Two units were used as the presidential car until 1990. These ran [[Ethanol fuel|neat ethanol (E100)]], and had 28 gallons fuel tanks.

The '''Ford Ranch Wagon''' is a [[station wagon]] which was built by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] from 1952 to 1974. The Ranch Wagon was a full-size model, except in 1963 and 1964, when it was part of the intermediate-size [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Fairlane]] series, and represented the lowest-priced selection in its respective line. 
{{TOC_left}}
{{-}}
== 1952–1962 ==
[[File:1959 Ford Ranch Wagon 2-door.jpg|thumb|right|1959 Ford 2-door Ranch Wagon]]
In the early 1950s, the era of the wood-bodied station wagon was coming to an end. When Ford introduced a redesigned line of cars for the [[1952 Ford|1952 model year]], its [[Ford Country Squire|Country Squire]] continued to cater to buyers who still wanted a station wagon with the look of wood (attained by applying simulated exterior wood decals, which were framed in genuine wood through 1953). 

But for other wagon buyers, Ford also gave them two new choices that year, the first all-steel wagons in the firm's history. These were the [[Ford Country Sedan|Country Sedan]], a four-door model in the mid-range [[Ford Customline|Customline]] series; and the Ranch Wagon, which was a two-door model in the economy [[Ford Mainline|Mainline]] series, inspired by the European-term [[shooting-brake]]. The Ranch Wagon ran with either the standard "Mileage Maker" six-cylinder engine or the long-familiar flathead [[V8 engine|V8]], which was optional.

After receiving mostly cosmetic changes for 1953, a second Ranch Wagon model, a slightly fancier version in the Customline series, was added for 1954, the year Ford's new Y-block V8 replaced the flathead unit. The two models were renamed Ranch Wagon and Custom Ranch Wagon [[1955 Ford|for 1955]], when the entire Ford station wagon set became a series of its own. [[1957 Ford|For 1957]], the [[Ford Del Rio|Del Rio Ranch Wagon]] was introduced (replacing both the Custom Ranch Wagon and the [[Ford Parklane|Parklane]]), sporting special ranch-pattern upholstery.  That same model was the basis for the new 1957 [[Ford Ranchero|Ranchero]], and a Mercury version called the [[Mercury Commuter]] which was a hardtop inspired wagon without a [[Pillar (car)|"B" pillar]].  

There were three Ranch Wagons the following year, as the first four-door Ranch Wagon was added to the model range. The Del Rio was dropped for 1959, replaced by a one-year-only two-door Country Sedan. By this time, full-size two-door station wagons were fast fading in popularity, and the 1961 two-door Ranch Wagon was the last full-size two-door wagon ever built (along with the two-door Plymouth Deluxe Suburban of that same year), leaving the four-door as the sole Ranch Wagon model for 1962.

== 1963–1964 ==
[[File:1963 Ford Fairlane 500 Ranch Wagon.jpg|thumb|right|1963 Ford Fairlane 500 Custom Ranch Wagon]]
In 1963 and 1964, no Ranch Wagon was included in Ford's full-size station wagon series,&lt;ref name=Gunnell1&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975, Revised 4th Edition, pages 410 to 415&lt;/ref&gt; but the name was used for some station wagons in the intermediate-size [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Fairlane]] series.&lt;ref name=Gunnell1/&gt;  It was offered in the base and 500 trim levels, with the 500 also marketed as the "Custom Ranch Wagon". The 1963 models ran with a 200-cid six-cylinder or any of three optional V8 engines—221, 260- or 289-cid. The 221 was dropped for 1964. 
{{-}}

== 1965–1974 ==
[[File:Ford station wagon March2013.jpg|thumb|1967 Ford Ranch Wagon]]
[[File:1972 Ford Ranch Wagon.jpg|thumb|right|1972 Ford Ranch Wagon]]
The Ranch Wagon returned to the full-size line for 1965. In 1966, it was the beneficiary of Ford's innovative new dual-action Magic Doorgate, which could be opened either down or sideways. In 1968, two new Ranch Wagon models, called the Custom 500 Ranch Wagons, were introduced; one a six-passenger model, the other the first Ranch Wagon furnished with [[third row seating]], Ford's familiar side-mounted dual-facing rear seats.

Ford wagons ceased to be a separate series when they were redesigned for 1969, officially becoming part of the respective series on which they were based; thus that year's base Ranch Wagon was now a member of the low-end [[Ford Custom|Custom]] series. In 1970, for the first time, all Ranch Wagons were powered by a V8. A three-speed manual transmission continued as standard through the 1971 model year, with all cars fitted with a [[Ford C6 transmission|SelectShift]] automatic transmission starting with the 1972 models.

The Custom series was dropped when Ford issued the next generation of full-size cars for 1973, meaning all Ranch Wagons were Custom 500s. The 1974 Ranch Wagon was the last available for sale to the general public. From 1975 to 1977, small quantities of Custom 500 station wagons (no longer called Ranch Wagon) were produced strictly for fleet buyers.

Introduced September 2, 1959, the '''Ford Falcon''' is a front-engine, rear-drive six passenger [[compact car]] produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] from 1959 to 1970, across three generations. A sales success for Ford initially, outselling contemporary rivals from [[Chrysler]] and [[General Motors]], from October 8, 1959, the Falcon was offered in two-door and four-door sedan, two-door and four-door station wagon, two-door hardtop, convertible, sedan delivery and [[Ford Ranchero|Ranchero]] pickup body configurations. For several years, the Falcon name was also used on passenger versions of the [[Ford Econoline]] van.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=automotivehistory |url=https://automotivehistory.org/automotive/september-2-1959-the-ford-falcon-is-introduced/ |title=September 2, 1959 – The Ford Falcon is introduced &amp;#124; This Day in Automotive History |publisher=Automotivehistory.org |date=2016-09-02 |accessdate=2020-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Falcon's television marketing featured the first animated appearances of the characters from [[Charles Schulz]]'s acclaimed [[comic strip]], ''[[Peanuts]]'', with announcer contribution from [[Paul Frees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1961 Ford Falcon Peanuts commercial|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u43ExlkXmQs|website=Youtube|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variations of the Ford Falcon were manufactured in [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]] and [[Mexico]]. Early Mexican built versions of the [[Ford Maverick (Americas)|Ford Maverick]] used the ''Falcon Maverick'' name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.falconclub.com/fcastory.html www.falconclub.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001124752/http://www.falconclub.com/fcastory.html |date=October 1, 2013 }} The Ford Falcon Story... - accessed 30 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifhp97/5337890163/ |title=1971 Ford Falcon Maverick (Mexico) p1 |publisher=Flickr.com |accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Edsel Ford]] first used the term "Falcon" for a more luxurious Ford he designed in 1935. He decided the new car did not fit with Ford's other offerings, so this design eventually became the [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]].&lt;ref name=Durbin&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_FORD_MERCURY?SITE=NCGRE&amp;SECTION=NATIONAL&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2010-06-02-13-53-18|title=Mercury falling: Ford eliminates mid-range brand|last1=Durbin|first1=Dee-Ann|last2=Krisher|first2=Tom|work=Associated Press|date=2010-06-02|accessdate=2010-06-03}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the "[[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]]" auto manufacturers ([[General Motors|GM]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[Chrysler]]), focused purely on the larger and more profitable vehicles in the US and Canadian markets. Towards the mid-1950s, all three manufacturers realized that this strategy would no longer work. Large automobiles were becoming increasingly expensive, making smaller cars such as [[Fix it again Tony|Fiat]]s, [[Renault Dauphine|Renault]]s, [[Toyota Corona#First generation (T10; 1957–1960)|Toyota]]s, and [[Volkswagen Beetle|Volkswagen]]s increasingly attractive. Furthermore, many American families were now in the market for a second car, and market research showed women especially thought the full-size car had grown too large and cumbersome.

[[File:Ford Falcon Emblem.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Falcon wordmark emblem on side]]
At the same time, research showed many buyers would prefer to buy US or Canadian if the domestic manufacturers offered a smaller car with lower cost of ownership. Thus, all three introduced [[compact car|compact]]s: the Valiant from Chrysler (becoming the [[Plymouth Valiant]] in 1960, and joined by a downsized [[Dodge Dart]] in 1961), [[General Motors|GM]]'s [[Chevrolet Corvair]], and the Ford Falcon. [[Studebaker]] also introduced the [[Studebaker Lark|Lark]], and [[Rambler (automobile)|Rambler]] downsized its near-compact [[Rambler American|American]] in 1959. [[Ford of Britain|Ford United Kingdom]] had begun production of the [[Ford Anglia]] in 1939, and the earlier [[Ford Model Y]] in 1932, followed by the [[Ford Zephyr]], but they weren't sold in North America. [[Ford Germany|Ford of Germany]] built the [[Ford Eifel]], followed by the [[Ford Köln]] which was mechanically similar to the British Model Y, followed later by the [[Ford Taunus]] in 1939, but were also not sold in North America. The European Fords, Anglia, Zephyr, and Taunus, were in production at the same time the Falcon was introduced.

The project which became the Falcon was started and sponsored by Ford General Manager [[Robert S. McNamara]], who commissioned a team to create what by American standards of the time would be a [[small car]] but elsewhere in the world considered a [[mid-size car|mid-size]]. McNamara, who was promoted to Group Vice President of Cars and Trucks by the time the Falcon was launched, was intimately involved in development, insisting on keeping the costs and weight of the car as low as possible. Engineer [[Harley Copp]] employed a [[unibody]] atop a standard suspension and sourced parts from Ford's existing bin to keep the price low while providing room for six passengers in reasonable comfort.  The sales success of the conventional Falcon along with slow sales of GM's rear-engined Corvair led General Motors to introduce their own compact car based on the Falcon's principles, the [[Chevy II]].{{cn|date=December 2018}}

The 1960 Falcon was powered by a small, lightweight 95&amp;nbsp;hp (70&amp;nbsp;kW), 144&amp;nbsp;CID (2.4&amp;nbsp;L) ''[[Ford Straight-6 engine#Third generation|Mileage Maker]]'' [[straight-6]] with a single-barrel [[carburetor]].

There was room for six passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1960_Ford/1960_Ford_Falcon_Brochure/1960%20Ford%20Falcon-08.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1960_Ford/1960_Ford_Falcon_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Body styles included two- and four-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]]s, two- or four-door [[station wagon]]s, and the Ranchero car-based pickup, transferred onto the Falcon platform for 1960 from the Fairlane. The Comet, originally intended for the defunct [[Edsel]] marque and based on the 1960 Falcon, was launched in the US in March 1960. (By 1962 the Comet adopted more Mercury-based styling and was folded into the Mercury line as the Mercury Comet.)

The market shift which spurred the development of the Falcon and its competitors also precipitated the demise of several well-established marques in the late-1950s and early-1960s. Besides the infamous tale of the Edsel, the [[Nash Motors|Nash]], [[Hudson Motor Car Company|Hudson]], [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]], and [[Packard]] nameplates all disappeared from the marketplace.

In 1960, [[Ford Motor Company of Canada, Limited|Ford's Canadian subsidiary]] introduced the Falcon-based [[Ford Frontenac|Frontenac]]. It was designed to give [[Mercury automobile|Mercury]]-[[Meteor (car)|Meteor]] dealers a smaller model to sell, since the Comet was originally intended as an Edsel, which was sold by Ford-Monarch dealers. Produced for the 1960 model year only, the Frontenac was essentially a rebadged 1960 Falcon with its own unique grille, tail lights, and external trim, including red maple-leaf insignia. Despite strong sales (5% of Ford's total Canadian output), the Frontenac was discontinued and replaced by the Comet for 1961.

[[Robert McNamara]], a Ford executive who became Ford's president briefly before being offered the job of [[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Defense Secretary]], is regarded by many as "the father of the Falcon". McNamara left Ford shortly after the Falcon's introduction, but his faith in the concept was vindicated with record sales; over half a million sold in the first year and over a million sold by the end of the second year.

The 1961 model year introduced an optional 101&amp;nbsp;hp, 170&amp;nbsp;CID (2.8&amp;nbsp;L) six, and two new models were introduced; a bucket-seat and console sedan model in a higher trim level called the '''Futura''', and a [[sedan delivery]]. Also, the Ford Falcon brochure featured [[Charlie Brown]] and [[Lucy]] from the ''[[Peanuts]]'' comic strip who remained until 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1961_Ford/1961_Ford_Falcon_Brochure/1961%20Ford%20Falcon%20Brochure-04.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1961_Ford/1961_Ford_Falcon_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1965_Ford/1965_Ford_Falcon_Bruchure/1965%20Ford%20Falcon%20Brochure-12.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1965_Ford/1965_Ford_Falcon_Bruchure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford boasted of the good fuel economy achieved by the [[Straight-6|six-cylinder]] Ford Falcon models in advertising. The fuel economy was good, a claimed {{convert|30|mpgus|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1960_Ford/1960_Ford_Falcon_Brochure/1960%20Ford%20Falcon-11.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1960_Ford/1960_Ford_Falcon_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to other American cars at the time.

The 1962 model year had a Squire model of the four-door station wagon with faux wood trim on the sides. The bucket-seat "Futura" model was offered with a slightly upgraded interior, factory-installed safety belts, different side trim (spears), and different emblems. Halfway through the model year, Ford changed the roof line at the back window to more of a [[Ford Thunderbird|Thunderbird]] design and offered a four-speed transmission for the first time. The two-door Futura sedan (also referred to as an 'illusion hardtop' because of the chrome trim around the side window opening) sported a flat rear window in place of the panoramic (wrap-around) window on earlier models to bring its design in line with other Ford cars of the era. In 1962, Ford introduced the Ford Falcon Club Wagon and Deluxe Club Wagon, an eight-passenger, flat-front, van.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1962_Ford/1962_Ford_Falcon_Brochure/1962%20Ford%20Falcon%20Brochure-11.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1962_Ford/1962_Ford_Falcon_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford also promoted that in a [[Mobil Economy Run|Mobilgas economy run]], the Falcon got 32.5mpg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1962_Ford/1962_Ford_Falcon_Brochure/1962%20Ford%20Falcon%20Brochure-19.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1962_Ford/1962_Ford_Falcon_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, even more models were available. There was now a four-door Futura and a Deluxe wagon. Futura Convertible and Futura Sports Convertible models were also included in the 1963 range.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Ford/1963_Ford/1963-Ford-Falcon-Brochure 1963 Ford Falcon Brochure, August 1962, oldcarbrochures.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304190245/http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Ford/1963_Ford/1963-Ford-Falcon-Brochure |date=March 4, 2016 }} Retrieved 6 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Later, hardtops, and the new "Sprint" model were introduced. Halfway through the model year (February 1963), the Fairlane's 164&amp;nbsp;hp "Challenger" 260&amp;nbsp;CID (4.3&amp;nbsp;L) [[V8 engine|V8]] engine was offered for the first time. The Falcon was climbing in trim level from its budget beginnings, as Ford attempted to wring more profit from the line.

The only time a V8 option was available in a first-generation Falcon was the 1963½ model, and these cars were produced in very limited numbers (Sprint two-door hardtop (bucket seats) 10,479 produced and Sprint convertible (bucket seats) 4,602 produced). These first-generation Falcon Sprint cars were the basis for the 1964½ Mustangs released by Ford one year later. Many (if not most) of the interior, chassis, suspension, and drivetrain components were derived from those used on the 1963½ Ford Falcon Sprint and/or Fairlane models. In simplest terms, the 1963½ Falcon Sprint is nearly mechanically identical to the 1964½ Mustang while being aesthetically different.

The second generation 1964 Falcon, launched in 1963, featured revised, more squared-off styling. Later in the 1964 model year, Ford's new offering for that market was launched: the [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Ford Mustang]], based heavily on the Falcon's unified frame design. TV commercials now used the character ''[[Hazel (TV series)|Hazel]]'' as well as the Peanuts cartoon characters. The Ford Motor Company was a sponsor of the show, and also sponsored ''[[The Ford Show]]'' during the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1964 Ford Falcon starring Hazel|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c5WnKUhwbY|website=Youtube|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 1964 year, Ford added a Sprint Package, which gave the Falcon the Fairlane's 260 V8, a stiffer suspension, and a louder exhaust. Because the Mustang had the same options that the Sprint had for only a small amount more, the Sprint never caught on. Even with the addition of the 289 V8 in late 1964, the Sprint was overshadowed by the Mustang, and was discontinued after 1965. The Mustang dealt Falcon sales in North America a blow from which they would never recover. Front suspension was coil springs pivot-mounted on upper arms plus double-acting absorbers.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1964"/&gt;  Six-cylinder cars had four-lug hubs with 13-in steel wheels. V-8 cars got five-lug wheels. For 1965, changes were minimal, including a simpler grille and revised side trim on deluxe models. Production ended on June 26, 1965, for convertible Falcons. A padded instrument panel, power steering, power brakes, a radio, a remote-control trunk release, and a parking brake warning light were optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1964_Ford/1964_Ford_Falcon_Brochure/1964%20Ford%20Falcon-19.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1964_Ford/1964_Ford_Falcon_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1965, the three-speed [[Cruise-O-Matic]] automatic transmission was available.

In late 1965, Ford launched the third generation Falcon, based on a shortened Fairlane platform with revised styling. At the top of the line was the highly-trimmed Futura Sports Coupe, which featured chrome side window frames, giving this two-door sedan the look of a hardtop.  It also featured a premium all-vinyl interior.  Large "Sports Coupe" script on the "C" pillar was borrowed from the 1964–1965 Fairlane Sports Coupe.  The heater-defroster became standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1966_Ford/1966_Ford_Falcon_Brochure/1966%20Ford%20Falcon%20Brochure-09.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1966_Ford/1966_Ford_Falcon_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brakes were 9-in for six-cylinder Falcons, and 10-in for V8s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1966_Ford/1966_Ford_Falcon_Brochure/1966%20Ford%20Falcon%20Brochure-11.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1966_Ford/1966_Ford_Falcon_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-door hardtop and convertible were dropped, while the station wagon and Ranchero were moved to a larger platform shared with the contemporary Fairlane. The Ranchero left the Falcon line and adopted the Fairlane's front sheet metal for 1967. The 1966 Falcon was used in the [[Trans-Am]] series. The 1967 models were mostly the same as the 1966 models, but more Federally-mandated safety equipment was added, including a dual-circuit brake system, energy-absorbing steering wheel with a large, padded center hub, 4-way flashers, soft interior panels, and mountings for front shoulder belts (which were available as an option).  A reminder light was added for the seatbelts;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1967_Ford/1967_Ford_Falcon_Brochure/1967%20Ford%20Falcon%20Brochure-11.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1967_Ford/1967_Ford_Falcon_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1968 was the first model year for the square tail lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite 
In November 1967 pre-production 1968 models began in Ford's new St. Thomas Assembly Plant in Talbotville Ontario Canada with true production beginning in December.  Henry Ford 2 and Semon Knudson dedicated the plant in June 1968.

1968 and 1969 Falcons got new side marker lights or reflectors, front outboard shoulder belts, and headrests for cars built after January 1, 1969. The basic body and mechanical specifications remained the same as 1966–1967 models.

The final model year for the Falcon in North America was 1970. Continuing sales declines and the inability of the car to meet forthcoming safety standards resulted in a short run of 1970 models identical to the 1969 version being built through the end of December, 1969; none of the 1970-model Falcons used a locking steering column that would be standard on all other 1970 Ford products (except Mavericks built before September 1969). "Despite the listing of a plain Falcon series in some early literature, it appears that all Falcons bore the Futura name this year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dammann |first=George  |date=1993 |title=90 Years of Ford  |location=Osceola, Wisconsin |publisher=MBI Publishing Company |page=428 |isbn= 0-87938-682-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Falcon, Fairlane, and Fairlane 500, names would disappear, the Futura name would reappear in 1978 on the [[Ford Fairmont |Fairmont Futura Sport Coupe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dammann |first=George  |date=1993 |title=90 Years of Ford  |location=Osceola, Wisconsin |publisher=MBI Publishing Company |page=492,499 |isbn= 0-87938-682-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:66falcon.jpg|thumb|left|1966 Ford Falcon Sports Coupe]]

On January 1, 1970, the Falcon name was transferred to a low-priced version of the contemporary [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Ford Fairlane]]. The new model, which was a subseries of the Fairlane series,&lt;ref&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975, Revised 4th Edition, page 433&lt;/ref&gt; was marketed as the "Falcon 1970½"  and was available as a two-door sedan, four-door sedan, and four-door wagon.&lt;ref name=oldcarbrochures/&gt; Despite the fact that the [[Ford Maverick (North America)|Maverick]] two-door sedan had been released in April 1969 as a replacement for the soon to be discontinued "compact" Falcon two-door, Ford went to the trouble of tooling up a unique two-door sedan for the short 1970½ model run. While the number of luxury and convenience options available was limited, the car was available with the full range of Fairlane/Torino power-trains, ranging from the standard 250 cubic-inch six-cylinder and 302 cubic-inch V8 all the way to the 429 Cobra Jet V8.

The '''Ford Model C''' is an automobile that was produced by [[Ford Motor Company]]. Introduced in 1904, it was a revision of the [[Ford Model A (1903–1904)|Model A]] with a more modern appearance. It had a slightly more powerful [[engine]] and {{convert|6|in|mm|abbr=on}} longer wheelbase. Built at the [[Ford Piquette Avenue Plant]], it was the entry-level car in the Ford model lineup, slotting below the upscale [[Ford Model B (1904)|Model B]]. Production ended in 1905 with 800 cars made; it was replaced by the derivative [[Ford Model F|Model F]].

Both Models A and C were produced at the same time, but the Model A could also be bought with a Model C engine, an option called the [[Ford Model AC|AC]]. The Model C engine was an [[Flat twin engine|opposed twin]] giving {{Convert|8|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at first and {{Convert|10|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} by 1905, with a claimed top speed of {{convert|38|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Kimes"/&gt; The Model C two-seater was marketed as a 'Doctor's Car' and sold for $850, compared to the high-volume [[Oldsmobile]] [[Oldsmobile Curved Dash|Runabout]] at US$650,&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877-1925'' (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western Tool Works (automobile company)|Western]]'s Gale Model A at US$500,&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Success Automobile Manufacturing Company|Success]] at a low US$250.&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, p.32.&lt;/ref&gt; It offered a four-seater option for an additional $100. The top also cost extra: rubber $30, leather $50.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

Although the Model C had a protruding front "box" like a modern car, unlike the flat-front Model A, this was purely ornamental &amp;mdash; the engine remained under the seat (the gas tank was under the hood&lt;ref name="Kimes"/&gt;).

The Model C was the first vehicle to be built at [[Ford Motor Company of Canada#Former vehicles produced|Ford Motor Company of Canada]].

The '''Ford 999''' was a nameplate attached to two distinct but similar racers built by [[Henry Ford]] during the early 20th century.  Though they began as separate entities, they were virtually mechanically identical, and parts (and ultimately names) were swapped between them as needed, making the identities and legacies inseparable.

==Creation==
Henry Ford had an early interest in racing cars, having built and driven in 1901 a {{convert|26|hp}} model that won a race against [[Alexander Winton]] and other challengers.  It was from the proceeds of this race that Ford created the [[Henry Ford Company]].  In March 1902, Ford left this original company over disputes with his stockholders and [[Henry Leland]], taking with him $900 and schematics for a planned racer.  In Ford's absence, Leland took over the company, and made it into the [[Cadillac|Cadillac Motor Company]] later in 1902.

Henry Ford collaborated with bicycle racer [[Tom Cooper (cyclist)|Tom Cooper]] and a team of several assistants to create two similar racing cars that were as yet unnamed.  They were painted red and yellow, respectively.  The result was a huge [[engine]] with a bare [[chassis]] attached to it, with no [[Coachwork|bodywork]] whatsoever.  Both of the cars were extremely heavily engineered, with an 1156 cu.in.(18.9 L) [[inline-4]] engine, {{convert|230|lb}} [[flywheel]], a [[Bore (engines)|bore]] of {{convert|7.25|in|mm}} and a [[Stroke (engine)|stroke]] of {{convert|7.0|in|mm}}.  Power was quoted anywhere from 70 to {{convert|100|hp}}.  There was no rear [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], no [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]], and [[steering]] was controlled by a crude pivoting metal bar, similar to a straight handlebar on a [[mountain bicycle]], but with upright handgrips at the ends to operate it.  The total cost of the project was $5000.

Though Ford's name was attached to the cars and the ensuing legend, he had sold his stake in them for $800 to [[Barney Oldfield]] and Cooper when the cars had refused to start during a test drive two weeks before the first race.  Ultimately, Ford abandoned his share of the racing money, but reserved the right to promotions and publicity of the cars, which secured his image behind their eventual successes.  He meanwhile built up [[Ford Motor Company]], which surpassed Winton in terms of production by the end of 1903.

In summer of 1902, Cooper and Oldfield carried out further work and got the red one working.  The red one was named 999 for the [[Empire State Express#Empire State Express No. 999|Empire State Express No. 999]].  No. 999 was a [[4-4-0|type 4-4-0]] [[United States|American]] [[steam locomotive]] which had famously set a world speed record of {{convert|112.5|mi/h|km/h|1|abbr=on}} on May 10, 1893, making it the first man-made vehicle to exceed {{convert|100|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} under its own propulsion.  The yellow one was named Arrow for the connotations of a sleek [[arrow]] flying through the air.**

==Racing career==
Oldfield, despite having absolutely no driving experience, learned how to race the 999.  In his October 1902 debut, a five-mile (8&amp;nbsp;km) race known as the Manufacturers' Challenge Cup, despite a strong challenge from Winton once again (which was the rematch for which Ford had originally planned), Oldfield easily won.  The 999 set a course speed record at the track at [[Grosse Pointe]], and went on to tour America and score many other victories.  Cooper retained ownership of the car for its racing career, while Oldfield ultimately pursued a racing career with [[Winton Motor Carriage Company|Winton]], against whom he had raced at the outset.

==Icy speed record==
Arrow also had a successful racing career, but its most famous incident was to come.  It was crashed in September 1903 during a race, killing the driver Frank Day.  However, Henry Ford bought back the broken car and repaired it with the intent of performing a speed run on a frozen lake.  He renamed it 999, as the original red car had been retired already, and the press referred to it as the "new 999," "Red Devil," or a combination of the two.

On January 12, 1904 in [[New Baltimore, Michigan]], Henry Ford personally drove the rechristened 999 with his mechanic Ed "Spider" Huff at the throttle. A new land speed record was achieved of {{convert|91.37|mi/h|km/h|2|abbr=on}} on an ice track carved into Lake St. Clair's Anchor Bay.  It stood for only a few weeks, but this was ample time to bring more good publicity for [[Ford Motor Company|Ford's new company]].

The '''Ford GPA 'Seep'''' (Government 'P' Amphibious, where 'P' stood for its 80-inch wheelbase) was an [[amphibious vehicle|amphibious]] version of the [[World War II]] [[Willys MB|Ford GPW]] [[Military light utility vehicle|jeep]]. Unlike the jeep, the seep was not a successful design; it was considered too slow and heavy on land, and lacked sufficient seagoing abilities in open water.&lt;ref name=AMJP&gt;[http://www.m201.com/GPA.htm The Amphibious jeep story]&lt;/ref&gt; The design features of the much larger and more successful [[DUKW]] amphibious truck were used on the GPA.

==History and development==
[[File:Ford GPA (2).jpg|thumb|Interior of a preserved GPA, 2010]]
After having commissioned [[Willys]], Ford and Bantam to build the first 4,500 [[Willys MB|jeeps]] (1500 each) in March 1941, the US Motor Transport Board set up a project under the direction of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) to be designated "QMC-4 1/4 Ton Truck Light Amphibian".&lt;ref name=AMJP/&gt;

Roderick Stephens Jr. of [[Sparkman &amp; Stephens]] Inc. yacht designers was asked to design a shape for a {{convert|2700|lb|kg|adj=on}} amphibious jeep, in the same vein as his design for the [[DUKW]] six-wheel-drive [[amphibious vehicle|amphibious truck]]. Stephens' hull design looked like a miniature version of that of the DUKW, and just like it, the 'Seep' was going to have a screw propeller, driven by a power take-off, operating in a dedicated tunnel faired into the rear end bodywork, as well as a proper rudder.

The construction of the vehicle was developed in competition by [[Marmon-Herrington]] and [[Ford Motor Company]]. Marmon-Herrington specialized in all-wheel drive vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spoelstra |first=Hanno |url= http://www.marmon-herrington.webs.com/truck.html |title= Trucks converted with Marmon-Herrington All-Wheel Drive Conversion Kits |date= |work=Marmon-Herrington Military Vehicles}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Marmon-Herrington prototype's hull formed an integral unibody structure, created by cutting shapes out of steel sheet and welding those together. The Ford entry, however, used a sturdy chassis and internal frame, to which more or less regular automobile type sheet-steel was welded. This construction made the GPA some {{convert|400|lb|kg}} lighter than its competitor. The GPA's design was based on the Willys MB and Ford GPW standard Jeeps as much as possible, using many of the same parts. The GPA had an interior similar to that of the MB/GPW jeeps, although the driver's compartment had almost twice as many control levers: 2WD/4WD, hi-range/lo-range, capstan winch (on the bows), propeller deployment and rudder control. After a direct comparison of the two company's prototypes, Ford received a contract for production starting in 1942.

[[File:Ford-GPA-trials.jpg|thumb|Wartime Ford GPA trials in the Detroit area]]
In contrast to the DUKW, the GPA did not perform well in the field. At some {{cvt|1,600|kg|lb}} the production truck had become much heavier than the original {{cvt|1,200|kg|lb}} specified in the design brief, but its volume had not been increased accordingly. As a consequence, a low freeboard in the water meant that the GPA could not handle more than a light chop or carry much cargo. The GPA's intended use of ferrying troops and cargo from ships off-shore, over a beach and continuing inland, was therefore very limited. 

On land, the vehicle was too heavy and its body too unwieldy to be popular with the soldiers. GPAs would frequently get stuck in shallow waters, where the regular Willys MB's water fording abilities allowed it to drive straight through (Pohl, 1998). Production was already halted in March 1943 after production of only 12,778 vehicles&lt;ref name=AMJP/&gt; due to financial quibbles between Ford and the US government, as well as bad reception of the vehicle in theatre. Although some sources (Pohl; Carlin, 1989) state that less than half of that number were ever completed, serial numbers of surviving specimens suggest that the figure of around 12,700 is actually correct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bcoy1cpb.pacdat.net/gpa.htm FORD GPA AMPHIBIOUS JEEP]&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of participating in the [[invasion of Sicily|Sicily landings of September 1943]], most GPAs were routed to the Soviet Union under the [[Lend-Lease]] programme. A small number of GPAs were used in action in North Africa and the Pacific.

==Postwar==
The USSR developed a derivative of the GPA after the war. The [[GAZ 46|GAZ 46 MAV]], which closely resembled the GPA, entered production in 1952. The GAZ 46 was exported to many {{uncited|date=December 2016}} USSR-allied countries. 

GPAs were also sold as surplus and were purchased by farmers, ranchers, adventurers and others. By the 1970s, collectors had discovered them, and started restoring them back to their original specifications. They appear at various military vehicle shows.

==Half-Safe and other conversions==

After World War II, several adventurers converted surplus GPAs into world-travelling machines.

The most famous one was during the 1950s when Australian [[Ben Carlin]] (1912–1981) sailed and drove a modified Seep, that he called "Half-Safe"&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.iinet.com.au/~daveb/halfsafe/halfsafe.html Half-Safe]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ruk.ca/article/1843 Half-Safe: Across the Atlantic by Jeep]&lt;/ref&gt; on a journey around the world.

A young American couple, Helen and Frank Schreider, converted one which they called "La Tortuga" and traveled from Los Angeles to the Southern tip of South America (1954–1956). They later converted another one called "Tortuga II" which they used on National Geographic expeditions in India (1959) and Indonesia (1961).&lt;ref&gt;Helen and Frank Schreider, "20,000 Miles South, A Pan-American Adventure", Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc., Garden City, New York, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

World War II British paratrooper veteran Lionel Force purchased a GPA from Levy's Surplus in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and called it "The Amphib".&lt;ref&gt;[http://bcoy1cpb.pacdat.net/my_1942_gpa.htm 1942 GPA 4545]&lt;/ref&gt; Among many changes, he grafted on a roof from a Dodge station wagon and lengthened the hull at the stern. He used the top halves of the doors, but knowing that he might be tied up alongside a dock, he added a round roof hatch. He planned to travel from Toronto to England via the USA, Mexico, Guatemala, Panama, South Armerica including Brazil, Africa, the Middle East, Greece and up to England. He got as far as Panama but turned back when he learned that the freighter upon which he intended to ship "The Amphib" from Brazil to Africa had been taken out of service.

The '''Ford Maverick''' is a [[compact car]] manufactured and marketed by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] for model years 1970–1977 in the United States, originally as a two-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] employing a [[rear-wheel drive]] [[automobile platform|platform]] original to the 1960 [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Falcon]] &amp;mdash; and subsequently as a four-door sedan on the same platform.

The Maverick was also manufactured in Venezuela, Canada, Mexico, and, from 1970 to 1979, in Brazil.

The name "[[maverick (animal)|maverick]]" was derived from the word for unbranded range animals, and the car's nameplate was stylized to resemble a [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|longhorned]] cow head.

==History==
The Maverick was introduced on April 17, 1969, as a 1970 model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=FORD 1903 TO 1984 By The Auto Editors of Consumer Guide|last=Lewis, McCarville &amp; Sorensen|first=|publisher=Publications International Ltd.|year=1983|isbn=0-88176-151-6|location=Skokie, IL|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ford1903198400sore/page/243 243, 256]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ford1903198400sore/page/243}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Maverick was originally conceived and marketed as a subcompact "import fighter", intended to do battle with the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] and newer Japanese rivals for North America from [[American Honda Motor Company|Honda]], [[Nissan|Datsun]], and [[Toyota]].  The [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Falcon]], Ford's compact offering since 1960 and main rival to the [[Chevrolet Nova]] and [[Dodge Dart]], had seen its sales decimated by the introduction of the [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Mustang]] in 1964, and despite a redesign in 1966, was unable to meet the then forthcoming U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] &lt;!-- (NHTSA) --&gt; motor vehicle standards that would come into effect on January 1, 1970. Consequently, the Falcon was discontinued midway through the 1970 model year,&lt;ref name=fdfkmv&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sdApAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kssEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5726%2C704964 |newspaper=Daytona Beach Morning Journal |agency=Associated Press |title=Ford drops Falcon, keeps Maverick |date=September 4, 1969 |page=31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Maverick repositioned as Ford's compact entry, giving the Nova and Dart a new rival. A bigger Falcon was a rebranded low-trim version of the [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Fairlane]] for the second half of the model year,&lt;ref name=frfeb23&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RGRGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3ugMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5655%2C4406722 |newspaper=Schenectady Gazette |title=Ford models |agency=(advertisement) |date=February 23, 1970 |page=31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ftbobf&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=G0QxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mhEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6381%2C2184072 |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |title=Ford to bring out bigger Falcon |date=December 9, 1969 |page=6, part 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; then went away.

The Maverick's styling featured the long hood, [[fastback]] roof, and short deck popularized by the Mustang,&lt;ref name=tolbladn69&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NvkjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wAEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2427%2C1502894 |newspaper=Toledo Blade |title=Ford Maverick |agency=(advertisement) |date=November 4, 1969 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a {{convert|103|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase — and featured pop-out rear side windows.

Nearly 579,000 Mavericks were produced in its first year,&lt;ref name="Fifty_Years_p189"&gt;{{cite book| title=[[#FiftyYears19391989|Fifty Years of American Automobiles]]| page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; approaching the record-setting first year of Mustang sales (nearly 619,000),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://media.ford.com/newsroom/feature_display.cfm?release=20253 | title= Ford to Increase Mustang Production to Meet Consumer Demand | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080103014154/http://media.ford.com/newsroom/feature_display.cfm?release=20253 | archivedate= 2008-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and easily outpaced the Mustang's sales of fewer than 200,000 in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.advanceautoparts.com/english/youcan/html/res/res20031001m2.html | title= Advance Auto Parts Mustang history page | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061206061646/http://www.advanceautoparts.com/english/youcan/html/res/res20031001m2.html | archivedate= 2006-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Total North American Maverick production (1969-1977) reached 2.1 million units.&lt;ref&gt;http://mmb.maverick.to/threads/hemings-article-maverick-turns-50.118077/#post-1134488&lt;/ref&gt;
===Trim packages and variants===
Initially available only as a two-door sedan, early models lacked a [[glove compartment]], which was added during the model year 1973 (early 1973 models still lacked a glove compartment). A four-door sedan on a {{convert|109.9|in|m|3|adj=on}} wheelbase was introduced for 1971.&lt;ref name=mavsep72mj&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ycYdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qSgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6504%2C470253 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |title=1973 Ford Maverick |agency=(advertisement) |date=September 21, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At introduction, exterior paint colors were named with puns, including "Anti-Establish Mint", "Hulla Blue", "Original Cinnamon", "Freudian Gilt", and "Thanks Vermillion" — along with more typical names including black jade, champagne gold, gulfstream aqua, meadowlark yellow, Brittany blue, lime gold, Dresden blue, raven black, Wimbledon white, and candyapple red.

In the first half of production for the 1970 model, two engine options were available, a {{convert|105|hp|abbr=on}} {{convert|170|cid|cc|abbr=on|lk=on}} [[Straight-six engine|straight-six]] and a {{convert|120|hp|abbr=on}} {{convert|200|cid|cc|abbr=on|lk=on}} straight-six. A {{convert|250|cid|cc|abbr=on|lk=on}} straight-six was added mid-year.

Commercials and advertising compared the Maverick, at $1,995, to the smaller [[Volkswagen Beetle]], which was about $500 less in price.&lt;ref name=tolbladn69/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ford 1903 to 1984|last=Lewis, McCarville &amp; Sorensen|first=|publisher=The Auto Editors of Consumer Guide, Publications International, Ltd.|year=1983|isbn=0-88176-151-6|location=Skokie, Illinois|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ford1903198400sore/page/256 256, 273]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ford1903198400sore/page/256}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ford Pinto|Pinto]] was later Ford's primary competitor to the Beetle in the subcompact class, while also competing in that segment with the [[Chevrolet Vega]] and [[AMC Gremlin]] subcompacts new to the market at that time.

The earliest Mavericks featured two-spoke steering wheels with partial horn rings, also found on other 1969 Fords, while late 1969 production was changed to revised steering wheels with no horn rings. Also, the early models located the ignition switch in the instrument panel while the cars built after September 1, 1969, had the ignition switches mounted on locking steering columns, as did all other 1970 Fords in compliance with a new federal safety mandate that took effect with the 1970 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.themaverickpage.com/History/69half/69half.html|title="1969½" Ford Maverick|website=Ford Maverick|access-date=March 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A four-door model was introduced for 1971, available with a vinyl roof. Mercury also revived the [[Mercury Comet#1971–1977|Comet]] as a [[badge engineering|rebadged variant]] of the Maverick. Also for 1971, an optional {{convert|210|hp|kW|abbr=on|adj=on}} 302&amp;nbsp;CID [[V8 engine|V8]] was introduced for both the Comet and the Maverick. The Comet was distinguished from the Maverick by using a different [[grille]], [[taillight]]s, trim, and [[hood (vehicle)|hood]].

The Maverick Grabber trim package was introduced in mid-1970. In addition to larger tire fitment, the package included graphics and trim, including a [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]]. It was offered from 1970 to 1975. In 1971 and 1972, the Grabber came with a special "dual dome" hood.

A "sprint" package offered for 1972 featured white and blue two-toned paint with red pinstripes and a special color-coordinated interior. The rear quarter panels included a stylized U.S.A. flag shield. This trim package acknowledged the 1972 Olympics and was available for only one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://barnfinds.com/red-white-blue-plate-1972-ford-maverick-sprint/|title=Barnfinds: 1972 Ford Maverick Sprint|website=Barnfinds.com|access-date=March 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.autokrafters.com/p-752-decal-body-rear-quarter-panel-1972-ford-maverick-pinto-sprint-usa-shield-gold-red-white-blue-df391.aspx|title=1972 Ford Sprint USA Shield Decal|website=Autokrafters.com|access-date=March 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fordmaverick.com/articles/72Sprint.htm|title=The 1972 Sprints|website=Ford Maverick|access-date=March 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "luxury decor option" (LDO) trim level introduced late in the 1972 model year included reclining bucket seats in a soft vinyl material, plush carpeting, woodgrained instrument panel trim, radial tires with body-color deluxe wheel covers, and a vinyl roof.&lt;ref name=mavsep72mj/&gt; The Maverick LDO option was one of the first American compacts to be marketed as a lower-priced (and domestic) alternative to the more expensive European luxury and touring sedans from Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi, and others.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Minor changes were made from 1973 to 1975. For 1973, the 170 CID engine was dropped, making the 200 CID I6 the standard engine. Additionally, improved brakes and a previously optional chrome grille became standard. An AM/FM stereo, aluminum wheels, and a slightly larger front bumper to comply with federal 5 MPH regulations were also standard. In 1974, the Maverick was unchanged except for new larger federally-required 5 MPH bumpers for both front and rear which required new rear quarter panel end caps. Jumping gas prices and increasing demand for smaller cars resulting from the Arab oil embargo did cause the Maverick to grow in popularity, selling 10,000 more units than the year before. Production of the Maverick dropped in 1975 with the release of the [[Ford Granada (North America)|Granada]] as a more European-style luxury compact (the Granada and Maverick shared the same basic chassis). The Maverick received minor trim changes for 1975 that included new grilles and the replacement of nameplates on the hood and trunklid with Ford nameplates, in block letters.

In 1976, the Grabber was dropped, and a "Stallion" package was introduced. The Stallion option came with special paint and trim.  Standard Mavericks received new grilles and gained front [[disc brakes]] as standard equipment along with new foot-operated parking brakes that replaced the old under-dash T-handle units. Sales continued to drop.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In its final year, the Maverick remained unchanged for 1977 except for a police package which was not sufficiently upgraded for police work and sold less than 400 units. The Maverick was produced in Brazil until 1979. The Maverick's place in the North American Ford lineup was essentially taken by the 1978 Fairmont. The Maverick had no significant changes towards the end of its lifespan, since it was originally meant to be replaced in 1975 by the Granada. However, Ford decided to keep selling both lines until the 1978 model year introduction of the [[Ford Fairmont|Fairmont]].

The '''Ford Bronco II''' is a [[compact sport utility vehicle]] (SUV) that was manufactured by the American manufacturer [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]].  Closely matching the [[Ford Bronco#First generation (1966–1977)|first-generation Ford Bronco]] in size, a single generation of the Bronco II was produced from the 1984 to 1990 model years.  Derived from the [[Ford Ranger (Americas)|Ford Ranger]] compact pickup truck, the model line was produced as a three-door wagon, competing against the [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer]] and the [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]].

For the 1991 model year, Ford repackaged its Ranger-derived SUV as the mid-size [[Ford Explorer]].  A three-door Explorer largely replaced the Bronco II; to better match market demands, the Explorer was also released as a five-door wagon.  The next Ford compact SUV was the 2001 [[Ford Escape]]; Ford has yet to produce another compact three-door SUV.  

The Bronco II was assembled in the [[Louisville Assembly Plant]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] alongside the Ford Ranger. 

==History==
[[File:Ford Bronco II (2370203134).jpg|left|thumb|Ford Bronco II, Eddie Bauer trim]]
[[File:89-90 Ford Bronco II.jpg|left|thumb|1989-1990 Ford Bronco II XLT]]
The first Bronco II was developed in parallel with the [[Ford Ranger (Americas)|Ranger]] pickup truck that was introduced for the 1983 model year. Introduced in March 1983, Ford marketed the Bronco II as a "vehicle for men, single people, or young couples ... almost like [[John Wayne]] vehicles ... that gave people the sense that they could conquer anything ..."&lt;ref name="Baura"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=543gDMmaaZQC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=Ford+Bronco+II |page=135 |title=Engineering Ethics: An Industrial perspective |first=Gail |last=Baura |publisher=Elsevier |year=2006 |isbn=9780080458021 |accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Bronco II was nearly a foot shorter than the competing [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer]] (introduced for 1982), the use of the Ranger chassis allowed for lower production costs by using a common assembly line with many shared components.&lt;ref name="Baura" /&gt;

All Bronco IIs were four-wheel drive until 1986 when the rear-wheel-drive [[Automobile layout|layout]] became standard,&lt;ref name="Ernst"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.hemmings.com/blog/2013/05/13/lost-cars-of-the-1980s-ford-bronco-ii/ |title=Lost Cars of the 1980s – Ford Bronco II |first=Kurt |last=Ernst |date=May 13, 2013 |work=Hemmings |accessdate=August 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the rear-wheel-drive models still had a transfer case that was capped or sealed where the front drive shaft connected on four-wheel-drive versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.broncoiicorral.com/tech_library/ford-bronco-ii-facts/ |title=Ford Bronco II Facts |work=Bronco II Corral |publisher=959 Media |accessdate=January 28, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 1989 model year, the Bronco II was restyled alongside the Ranger. The exterior featured new front bodywork with new a new hood, front fenders, and a closer-fitting front bumper. Inside, the dashboard was redesigned, featuring a new instrument panel. Alongside the overall change in appearance, the new bodywork marked improvements in structural support. The 1989 Bronco II was short-lived as it was built for little less than a year when production ended in early 1990. It was succeeded by the larger [[Ford Explorer]] for 1991.

As a running change, four-wheel drive 1990 models produced after November 1989 were produced with [[Dana 35]] front axles, replacing the previous Dana 28 front axle.

==Engines==
The 1984 and 1985 models were equipped with the [[Germany|German]]-built [[carbureted]] 2.8&amp;nbsp;L [[Ford Cologne V6 engine#2.8|Cologne]] [[V6 engine|V-6]] with {{convert|115|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4600&amp;nbsp;rpm, which was also used in the 1984 and 1985 [[Ford Ranger (North America)#First generation|Ford Ranger]]. It was originally available exclusively with four-wheel drive.&lt;ref name=Moniteur&gt;{{cite journal | ref = PdL | journal = Le Moniteur de l'Automobile | page = 2 | title = La nouvelle vague des tout terrain made in USA |trans-title=The new wave of off-roaders "made in USA" | last = Bryant | first = Thos L. | location = Brussels, Belgium | language = French | volume = 33 | number = 770 | date = 1983-06-02 | publisher = Editions Auto-Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1986 model year introduced the {{convert|140|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[fuel injected]] 2.9&amp;nbsp;L [[Ford Cologne V6 engine#2.9|Cologne]] V6 engine.

A Mitsubishi 4-cylinder 2.3&amp;nbsp;L turbodiesel was optional during the 1986 model year; however it delivered poor performance and had low sales.&lt;ref name="Ernst"/&gt;

== Discontinuation ==
Before the 1991 model year, the Bronco II was discontinued in February 1990, with its role in the Ford light-truck line largely taken over by the Ford Explorer. While the Explorer was also based upon the Ranger (to the point of also sharing parts of its interior with the Bronco II and Ranger), the Explorer was a mid-size SUV. Sized slightly larger than the S-10 Blazer, the five-door Explorer was nearly {{convert|23|in|0|}} longer than a 1990 Bronco II. As a more direct successor, a shorter-wheelbase three-door Explorer Sport was introduced (though still a foot longer than a Bronco II). Shared with the Ranger and [[Ford Aerostar]], the Explorer was solely powered by a 160&amp;nbsp;hp 4.0&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Ford Cologne V6 engine#4.0|Cologne]]'' V6 engine.

The Explorer would be developed in parallel with the Ranger through its first generation until its major update in the 1995 to 2001 model years where it lost all its exterior styling shared with the Ranger.

==Safety controversy==
Stability problems with Bronco II were noted during the design phase, as well as in the verification tests by 1981.&lt;ref name="Baura"/&gt; For example, the J-turn test was canceled during the testing procedures by Ford officials "out of fear of killing or injuring one of its own drivers."&lt;ref name="Bogus"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CBnBMiJq3SkC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=Ford+considered+the+Bronco+II+so+dangerous+that+it+suspended |page=160 |title=Why lawsuits are good for America: disciplined democracy, big business, and the common law |first=Carl T. |last=Bogus |publisher=New York University Press |year=2003 |isbn=9780814799161 |accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engineering modifications were suggested, but Ford officials declined the modifications because they would have delayed the marketing of the new vehicles.&lt;ref name="Bogus"/&gt; Eight months before production began, Ford's Office of General Counsel collected 113 documents concerning the new vehicle's handling problems.&lt;ref name="Baura"/&gt; However, 53 of these test, simulation, and related reports about stability of the Bronco II "disappeared" in an "unusual document handling procedure" that forebode the lawsuits against Ford starting in the late-1980s.&lt;ref name="Baura"/&gt;

The Bronco II was dogged by reports that it was prone to [[Vehicle rollover|rollover]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autosafety.org/srr/ROLLFBRO.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011109232459/http://www.autosafety.org/srr/ROLLFBRO.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2001-11-09 |format=PDF |title=Safety Research Report Index - Ford Bronco II Rollover |publisher=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration |accessdate=2011-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the headlines in 1989-90 included "NHTSA Investigates Bronco II Rollovers," ''Automotive News'' (March 20, 1989) "Magazine Gives Ford's Bronco II 'Avoid' Rating," ''The Wall Street Journal'' (May 8, 1989), and "Consumer Reports Criticizes Ford Bronco II's Handling," ''The Washington Post'' (May 18, 1989).

After analysis of SUV crashes of the [[Suzuki Samurai]], the U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) opened a formal study of the Ford Bronco II in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1989-03-16/business/fi-2108_1_ford-bronco-ii |title=Agency to Launch Study of Ford Bronco II After High Rate of Roll-Over Accidents |date=March 16, 1989 |first=Linda |last=Williams |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 43 Bronco II rollover fatalities in 1987, compared with eight for the Samurai, but accident data in four states showed the Bronco II's rollover rate was similar to that of other SUVs, so the investigation was closed. NHTSA declined to reopen the investigation in 1997 after more Bronco II crashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.detnews.com/specialreports/2002/nhtsa/monrollover/monrollover.htm |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120730122123/http://www.detnews.com/specialreports/2002/nhtsa/monrollover/monrollover.htm |url-status= dead |archive-date= July 30, 2012 |title=Rollover complaints dismissed |first=Jeff |last=Plungis |work=Detroit News |date=March 4, 2002 |accessdate=2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was estimated that 260 people had died in Bronco II rollover crashes, a rate that is several times more than in any similar vehicle according to the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]].&lt;ref name="Geyelin"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB854584398590422000 |title=Ford Reaches a New Settlement In Bronco II Rollover Litigation |first=Milo |last=Geyelin |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=January 30, 1997 |accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1995, Ford had paid $113 million to settle 334 injury and wrongful death lawsuits.&lt;ref name="FordSettlesAgain"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1997-01-31/business/fi-23934_1_bronco-ii |title=Ford Settles Again With Owners of Its Bronco II |date=January 31, 1997 |agency=Reuters |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A class-action settlement with owners of its controversial Bronco II provided "new safety warnings and up to $200 for repairs and modifications."&lt;ref name="FordSettlesAgain"/&gt; Ford ended production of the Bronco II in 1990, but "always contended that rollovers are overwhelmingly caused by bad driving or unsafe modifications to the vehicle."&lt;ref name="Geyelin"/&gt;

Individual lawsuit examples include famed jockey [[Bill Shoemaker]], that awarded him one million dollars. Shoemaker was paralyzed from the neck down after rolling his Bronco II in California in 1991 while intoxicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1993/04/19/128405/from-fame-to-shame-bill-shoemaker-a-casualty-of-his-own-drunk-driving-has-lost-respect-by-launching-lawsuits-to-shift-the-blame-for-his-tragic-folly |title=From Fame To Shame Bill Shoemaker, a casualty of his own drunk driving, has lost respect by launching lawsuits to shift the blame for his tragic folly |work=Sports Illustrated |first=William |last=Nack |date=April 19, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, he was confined to a wheelchair. The largest award involving the Bronco II up to 1995 was a $62.4 million verdict for two passengers, one of whom who received brain injuries and left her in need of a legal guardian, after the 1986 model in which they were riding rolled over.&lt;ref name="Darin"&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.autonews.com/article/19951106/ANA/511060754/ford-loses-$62.4-million-bronco-ii-case |title=Ford loses $62.4 million Bronco II case |first=Ann Therese |last=Darin |journal=Automotive News |date=November 6, 1995 |accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The safety record was "frightening" with "one in 500 Bronco II's ever produced was involved in a fatal rollover."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.autoblog.com/2010/09/07/ford-explorer-rollover-settlement/ |title=Behind Fords Recent $131 Million Rollover Judgment - Another Reminder of Tragedies From A Decade Ago |date=September 7, 2010 |first=David |last=Kiley |work=autoblog.com |accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Automobile insurer [[GEICO]] stopped writing insurance policies for the Bronco II.&lt;ref name="Darin"/&gt; By 2001, ''Time'' magazine reported that the "notorious bucking Bronco II" rollover lawsuits had "cost the company approximately $2.4 billion in damage settlements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,128198,00.html |title=Inside the Ford/Firestone Fight |first=John |last=Greenwald |date=May 29, 2001 |journal=Time |accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ford Fairlane''' is an [[automobile]] model that was sold between 1955 and 1970 by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in North America. The name is derived from [[Henry Ford]]'s estate, ''[[Fair Lane]]'', near [[Dearborn, Michigan]].

Over time, the name referred to a number of different cars in different classes; the Fairlane was initially a full-sized car, but became a mid-sized car from the 1962 model year. The mid-sized model spawned the [[Ford Fairlane (Australian)|Australian-built Fairlane]] in 1967, although in that market it was considered a large car.

For the 1955 model year the Fairlane name replaced the [[Ford Crestline|Crestline]] as Ford's premier full-sized offering. Six different body styles were offered, including the [[Ford Crown Victoria Skyliner|Crown Victoria Skyliner]] with a tinted, transparent plastic roof, the regular [[Ford Crown Victoria|Crown Victoria]] [[coupe]] with lots of stainless steel trim, a convertible Sunliner, the Victoria hardtop coupe, and traditional sedans. All featured the trademark stainless-steel "Fairlane stripe" on the side. Power options were a {{convert|223|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[straight-6]] engine and a {{convert|272|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]]. The {{convert|292|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Y-block was offered as an option and was called the Thunderbird V-8.

Few changes were made for 1956; a four-door Victoria hardtop and two new, more powerful V8 options, of {{convert|292|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|312|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}, the latter available up to {{convert|225|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, were introduced. The [[Lifeguard (automobile safety)|Lifeguard]] safety package was introduced. The two-door Victoria hardtop featured a new and slimmer roofline. A one-year only two-door station wagon, the 1956 [[Ford Parklane]], featured Fairlane-level trim.  It was marketed to compete against the [[Chevrolet Nomad]].

The new proportions and modern styling were a hit with customers to the extent that the Ford outsold Chevrolet in 1957 for the first time since 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motortrend.com/features/consumer/112_1003_six_decades_of_best_selling_cars/viewall.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816161451/http://www.motortrend.com/features/consumer/112_1003_six_decades_of_best_selling_cars/viewall.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 16, 2011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A new top trim level was reversed, the Fairlane 500.  For the first time, the lower-level Custom line had a shorter wheelbase than the Fairlane.  Engines were largely the same as the year before.  The big news for 1957 was the introduction of the [[Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner|Fairlane 500 Skyliner]] power [[Coupé convertible|retractable hardtop]], whose solid top hinged and folded down into the trunk space at the touch of a button.

Another facelift for 1958 had fashionable quad headlights, a grille that matched the 1958 [[Ford Thunderbird|Thunderbird]], and other styling changes.  New [[big-block]] [[Ford FE engine|FE]] [[V8 engine|V8s]] of 332 and 352&amp;nbsp;CID (5.4 L and 5.8 L) replaced the previous largest V8s, and a better three-speed automatic transmission was also available.

A new top-level full-sized model was introduced at mid-year 1959, the [[Ford Galaxie]]. The 1959 Galaxie displayed both "Fairlane 500" and "Galaxie" badging.

Full-sized Fairlane and Fairlane 500 models were restyled for 1960 and again for the 1961 model year.  The Galaxie series continued as the top-of-the-line full-sized Ford. Fairlane 500s demoted to mid-level in the lineup and were equivalent to the [[Chevrolet Bel Air]].  Fairlanes were primarily sold as base level trim models for fleet use (taxi, police). Both were only available as pillared sedans.

The big-block 390 CID V8 was available in 1961 as the top-horsepower option, as the "horsepower wars" in Detroit continued.&lt;ref&gt;Ford 1960 Brochure "1960 Fords". Ford Motor Company&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ford 1961 Brochure "1961 Fords". Ford Motor Company&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fairlane name was moved to Ford's new intermediate, introduced for the 1962 model year, to bridge the gap between the compact [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]] and the full-sized [[Ford Galaxie|Galaxie]], making it a competitor for [[General Motors|GM's]] [[GM A platform|A-body "senior compacts"]], the Plymouth [[plymouth Belvedere|Belvedere]], and the [[Rambler Classic|AMC Rambler]]. With an overall length of 197 in (5004&amp;nbsp;mm) and a wheelbase of 115.5 in (2934&amp;nbsp;mm), it was 16 in (406&amp;nbsp;mm) longer than the Falcon and 12.3 in (312&amp;nbsp;mm) shorter than the Galaxie.  Wheel track varied from 53.5 in (1355&amp;nbsp;mm)  to 56 in (1422&amp;nbsp;mm) depending on model and specification.

Like the Falcon, the Fairlane had a [[monocoque|unibody]] frame, but the body incorporated an unusual feature Ford dubbed torque boxes, four boxed structures in the lower body structure designed to absorb road shock by moving slightly in the vertical plane. Suspension was a conventional short-long arm independent arrangement in front, with [[Hotchkiss drive]] in the rear. The Fairlane was initially offered only in two-door or four-door sedan body styles.g

The Fairlane's standard engine was the 170&amp;nbsp;CID (2.8&amp;nbsp;L) [[Straight-6|six]], but as an option, it introduced Ford's new, lightweight [[Ford Windsor engine|Windsor]] [[V8 engine|V8]], initially with a displacement of 221&amp;nbsp;CID (3.6&amp;nbsp;L) and 145&amp;nbsp;hp (108&amp;nbsp;kW); a 260&amp;nbsp;CID (4.2&amp;nbsp;L) "Challenger" version was added at mid-year, with an advertised {{convert|164|hp|abbr=on}}. The Sports Coupe option débuted mid-year and featured bucket seats and a small floor console. The trim level supplemented the Fairlane and Fairlane 500 trim levels (the 500 model had more decorative trim, such as a wider chrome stripe down the side and three bullets on the rear quarter panels). The Challenger 289&amp;nbsp;CID engine was introduced in mid-1963, with solid lifters and other performance pieces helping the engine produce an advertised {{convert|271|hp|abbr=on}}; however, it was equipped with single exhaust like the less powerful engines. This engine was coded "K" in the [[vehicle identification number]].  Exterior identification was by fender-mounted "V" badges that read "289 High Performance".  That same year, [[station wagons]] arrived, called the Ranch Wagon and Ranch Custom Wagon. All 1962 Fairlanes had "B" posts despite the popularity of the pillarless hardtop and convertible styles in that era.

Ford saw the problem and introduced two pillarless hardtop coupes for 1963, in Fairlane 500 and Sports Coupe trim. For 1963 and later Sports Coupe models, the center console, which had come from the Falcon parts bin for 1962, was changed to be similar to that of the Galaxie. Sports Coupe models got a floor-mounted shift lever for the center console when Cruise-O-Matic or 4-speed manual transmissions were specified; however when the two-speed Fordomatic was ordered, the shift lever was installed on the steering column (and the console was the same without the shifter).  Front-end styling for the 1963 models mimicked the big Galaxie models, but the rear end retained the small tailfins and "pieplate" tail lamp styling cues.  The Squire wagon (a fake [[Woodie (car body style)|woodie]]) was available for 1963 only, including one model with front bucket seats. The "Swing-Away" steering wheel became an option in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1964_Ford/1964_Ford_Brochure_1/1964%20Ford-All-03.html |title=1964 Ford brochure 1 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1964 and 1965, Fairlane ranges consisted of similar body styles: base Fairlane and Fairlane 500 two-door [[coupe]]s and four-door [[Sedan (car)|sedans]], and Fairlane 500 and Sports Coupe two-door hardtops. As in 1963, the Sports Coupe got its own standard "spinner" wheel covers and extra exterior brightwork.  Large "Sports Coupe" scripts graced the "C" pillars.  The Fairlane Squire wagon was dropped, but the standard station wagon was continued.  The 221 V8 was dropped after 1963, leaving the six as the base engine and the 260 as the base V8. The "K-code" 271-horsepower 289 V8 continued into 1964, gaining dual exhausts, while a {{convert|195|hp}} version of the 289 with a two-barrel carburetor and hydraulic lifters was introduced. The two-speed Fordomatic continued as the automatic transmission choice for the 260 in 1964, while 289 V8s got the three-speed Cruise-O-Matic transmission option. All 1965 models featured {{convert|14|in|mm|adj=on}} wheels as standard, in place of the earlier {{convert|13|in|mm|adj=on}} wheels, and Fordomatic was finally phased out, leaving the Cruise-O-Matic as the only automatic available for the Fairlane. The 260 was also dropped after 1964, leaving the two-barrel 289 as the base V8. Styling-wise, in 1964, a new grille and headlight bezels were introduced, the tail fins were dropped, some chrome decorating on the side was changed, and the shape of the trunk lid changed. Styling features for 1965 included body-color headlight bezels for the deluxe models and rectangular taillight lenses, a return to the 1962-1963 trunk lid, along with less chrome on the body and a small standup hood ornament.

Australian and New Zealand models had longer cut-outs in the rear bumper to accommodate their license plates.

===Thunderbolt===
{{main|Ford Fairlane Thunderbolt}}
[[File:1964 thunderbolt.jpg|thumb|Modified, street-driven 1964 [[Ford Fairlane Thunderbolt]] factory experimental drag car]]

As the [[muscle car]] market took shape, Ford built a small number of Fairlane two door hard tops prepared for [[drag racing]] during the 1963 season.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} These cars were running the 289 and were set up at Dearborn Steel Tubing that built the special cars for Ford special vehicle operations
.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} These soon evolved into the "Thunderbolts" for 1964. The racing Thunderbolt was a two-door post car, heavily modified to incorporate Ford's new 427&amp;nbsp;CID (7.0&amp;nbsp;L) V8 race engine with two four-barrel carburetors on a high-riser manifold, [[Cold air intake|ram-air]] through the openings left by deleting the inboard headlights, equal-length headers, trunk-mounted battery, several [[fiberglass]] parts (hood, door skins, fenders, and front bumper), [[acrylic glass]] windows, and other lightweight options, including deleted rear-door window winders, carpeting, radio, sealant, sun visors, armrests, jack, lug wrench, heater, soundproofing, and passenger-side windshield wiper.  The cars wore Fairlane 500 trim, and were only offered with the two-door sedan body. This special model, of which 111 to 127 total were made (sources disagree),{{who|date=February 2010}} delivered 657&amp;nbsp;hp (490&amp;nbsp;kW) at 7,500 rpm&lt;ref&gt;[[Ford FE engine]]&lt;/ref&gt; and was known as the [[Ford Fairlane Thunderbolt|Thunderbolt]].

Racing in NHRA [[Super Stock (drag racing class)|Super Stock]] (which required only fifty cars be available to the public&lt;ref name="NHRA.com"&gt;Burgess, Phil, ''National Dragster'' editor.  "Favorite Race Car Ever voting: Early Door Cars/Roadsters", written 11 July 2008, at [https://www.nhra.com/news/2008/favorite-race-car-ever-voting-early-door-carsroadsters NHRA.com] (retrieved 27 September 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;), on {{convert|7|in|mm|adj=on}}-wide tires, the Thunderbolt was based on the midlevel Fairlane 500 two-door pillared sedan, and in 1964 set elapsed time and top speed records at 11.6 seconds and 124&amp;nbsp;mph (200&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=David Traver |last=Adolphus |url= http://www.hemmings.com/mus/stories/2008/08/01/hmn_feature15.html |title=1964 Ford Fairlane 500 Thunderbolt |journal=Hemmings Muscle Machines |date=August 2008 |accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; took the Super Stock title (with [[Gas Ronda]] taking the honors&lt;ref name="NHRA.com"/&gt;), and won the Manufacturer's Cup. The car as delivered was slightly too light to meet NHRA's 3200-lb (1451-kg) minimum weight unless it was raced with a full tank of gasoline, which would bring it to 3203&amp;nbsp;lb (1453&amp;nbsp;kg). NHRA rules at the time required a metal front bumper, so the cars began to be supplied with an aluminum bumper and previous purchasers were supplied with one.

Thunderbolt production was ended due to NHRA rule changes for Super Stock competition, requiring 500 vehicles be built to be entered in that class. Ford had been losing $1500 to $2000 on each Thunderbolt sold at the sticker price of $3900. The first 11 Thunderbolts were painted maroon (known as Vintage Burgundy in Ford literature), the rest white; 99 had manual transmissions. Many are still raced. About 50 similar [[Mercury Cyclone]]s were also produced by Ford in 1964, destined to be modified to represent Ford in A/FX competition, which they dominated, as well. These vehicles varied greatly in wheel track due to customer options for varying suspension and wheel/tire combinations. Front tracks from 54 to 56 in and rear tracks from 53.5 to 55.5 in were common.

The Fairlane was revised in 1966.&lt;ref name="Gunnell2002"&gt;{{cite book|first=John |last=Gunnell |title=Standard Catalog of American Cars, 1946-1975 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MfmbPwAACAAJ |accessdate=24 February 2013|date=1 April 2002|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=978-0-87349-461-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance was changed to match the full-sized Ford, which had been restyled in the 1965 model year. The front end featured vertically stacked dual headlights. The XL, GT, and GTA packages were introduced, as well as a convertible to join the existing range of sedans, hardtops, and station wagons. The "K-code" 289 CID engine was dropped this year. The GT featured a [[Ford FE engine|390 CID FE]] V8 as standard, while the GTA also included the newly introduced the [[Ford C6 transmission|SportShift Cruise-o-Matic]] automatic transmission. The GT/GTA 390 CID engine developed {{convert|335|bhp|abbr=on}} with higher compression, and had a four-barrel carburetor. Mid year, Ford produced 57 special Fairlane 500 two-door hardtops with "R-code" [[Ford FE engine#427|{{cvt|427|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine]] rated at {{convert|425|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6000 rpm and {{convert|480|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3700 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myclassicgarage.com/knowledge-base/1966-Ford-Fairlane|website=myclassicgarage.com|title=1966 Ford Fairlane|accessdate=June 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; equipped with Ford's "Top-Loader" four-speed manual transmission. Built to qualify the engine/transmission combination for [[NHRA]] and [[International Hot Rod Association|IHRA]] Super Stock racing, they were white and had fiberglass hoods with a forward-facing hood scoop which ended at the edge of the hood. The Fairlane Squire wagon was reintroduced for 1966.

Minor trim changes were introduced for 1967 as the Fairlane was mildly facelifted. The 289&amp;nbsp;CID small-block was the base V8, with a 200 CID six standard, with the 390&amp;nbsp;CID optional (with either two- or four-barrel carburetor, at 275 and {{convert|320|bhp|abbr=on}}, respectively). The 427s were still available, either with a single four-barrel carburetor or dual quad carbs, developing 410 (W-code) and 425&amp;nbsp;bhp (R-code), 427s were available on XL models, but very few were built. The notable addition for the 1967 model year was a [[Ford Ranchero|Ranchero]] [[pickup truck|pickup]] as part of the Fairlane range (from 1960 to 1965, the Ranchero was based on the Falcon, while in 1966 it used the Fairlane platform but Falcon styling). The 1967 Fairlanes also included a number of federal government-mandated safety features, including a new energy-absorbing steering column with a large padded steering wheel hub, soft interior trim, four-way hazard flashers, a dual-chamber braking system, and shoulder belt anchors. The convertible had a tempered safety glass rear window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1967_Ford/1967_Ford_Full_Line_Brochure/1967%20Ford%20Full%20Line-09.html |page=9 |title=1967 Ford Full Line Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Falcon Ranchero and Falcon station wagon were, between 1966 and 1970, identical under the skin to the Fairlane versions of the same model. Only sheetmetal and trim differed.

Two different two-door coupe models were offered. The lower-end Fairlane Club Coupe had pillars separating the door glass and rear side glass, while the higher trim level Fairlanes were pillarless two-door hardtops, similar to the convertibles.

A redesign was introduced for the 1968 model year. The [[wheelbase]] remained at {{convert|116|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, but it grew in other dimensions. They were about four inches (102&amp;nbsp;mm) longer and {{convert|200|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} heavier than the cars they replaced.&lt;ref name="curbside"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-american/curbside-classic-1968-ford-fairlane-gt-the-unexpected-wallflower/ |title=1968 Ford Fairlane GT – The Unexpected Wallflower |first=Jim |last=Grey |work=Curbside Classic |date=March 23, 2013 |accessdate=October 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[fastback]] Sportsroof model was introduced in the Fairlane 500 series, as well as a more luxurious [[Ford Torino|Torino]] model at the top of the intermediate range, contributing 172,083 of the Fairlane's 371,787 units sold that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flory |first=J. "Kelly", Jr. |title=American Cars 1960-1972 |publisher=McFarland |year=2004 |page=599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a cost-saving decision, the station wagons carried over the 1966-67 bodies from the cowl back.&lt;ref name="curbside"/&gt; The Ranch Wagon model name was deleted; Fairlane wagons had either the base or the 500 trim. Base [[hardtop]] sales more than doubled, to 44,683 units.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p.599.&lt;/ref&gt;

The base engine was the {{convert|200|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} I6, with several optional V8s. Early production 1968 base V8 Fairlanes were equipped with the two-barrel {{convert|289|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}, while later units came with the {{convert|302|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fordfairlane.com/68codes.html |title=Fairlane Registry 1968 VIN Codes |publisher=FordFairlane.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GTs were part of the Torino range, with the 302 CID V8 standard, with optional engines being the 390 CID V8 in two- and four-barrel versions. The 390 four-barrel was supplanted mid-year as the top performance engine by the {{convert|428|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Cobra Jet, developing {{convert|335|bhp|abbr=on}}. There was also a {{convert|428|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Super Cobra Jet.  The [[Fairlane 500]], Ranchero, and [[Torino]] GT/GTA were also offered with the new [[351W]] CID with a four-barrel producing 250 HP and only in the Torino GT/GTA the [[351C]] four-barrel with 275 HP could be ordered.

The Ranchero coupe utility body style was available in standard, 500, and GT versions.

The Cobra was introduced in 1969 as a competitor for Plymouth's Road Runner. Basic models featured the 302 CID V8 and three-speed manual transmission as standard. Options included the 390 CID and two {{convert|428|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8s. The Cobras had a standard 428 CID V8 rated at {{convert|335|bhp|abbr=on}}, while options included bucket seats, hood scoop, clock, tachometer, power disc brakes, and 4.30:1 rear axle gearing. "Regular" Fairlanes and Rancheros continued, all with bucket-seat options.

Ford's intermediates grew again in 1970, now with a {{convert|117|in|mm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} wheelbase. At the start of the model year, only the Fairlane 500 remained as the base trim model in what was now effectively the Torino series.

The straight six-cylinder was the economy power, while largest engine was now a {{convert|429|CID|l|1|abbr=on}} with four-barrel carburetor and {{convert|360|bhp|abbr=on}}. Different heads were optional and gave the Cobra {{convert|370|bhp|abbr=on}} and higher compression. Other options included the Cobra Jet Ram Air 429, though Ford quoted the same power output, and the Drag Pack rated at {{convert|375|bhp|abbr=on}}. However, the 1970s were slower than the 1969s, and race teams were forced to run the older models.

The [[Ford Falcon (Americas)|Falcon]] name was transferred from Ford's now discontinued, in the US, compact to a basic, even lower-trim version of the intermediate platform as a "1970½" model on January 1, 1970. This series included a two-door sedan which was not available in the higher trim lines. For 1971, the Falcon and Fairlane 500 names were dropped, as all of the intermediate models took the [[Ford Torino|Torino]] name. The [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]] and [[Ford Fairlane (Australia)|Fairlane]] names continued to be used in [[Australia]] through to the 21st century. The Fairlane name continued to be used in Venezuela through 1978 on corresponding Ford Torino and LTD II models.&lt;ref&gt;Ford 25 Aniversario published by Ford Venezuela in 1987&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

==Ford Fairlane in Argentina==
[[File:Blue Argentine Ford Fairlane.jpg|thumb|The Argentine Ford Fairlane]]
The four-door sedan of the 1968 body style was built in [[Argentina]] from 1969 to 1973 and the 1969 body style from 1973 to 1981 under the Fairlane name with three equipment packages: Standard, 500 and LTD. The car was similar to the American model except the engines. The two options were a 221&amp;nbsp;CID 6-cylinder with {{convert|132|hp|abbr=on}}, and the old 292 phase I (1969–1971)&amp;nbsp;CID "Y-block" V8 which had been last used in the 1964 F-Series truck; it was rated at {{convert|185|hp|abbr=on}}, in 1971 the Ford Motor Company Argentina decided to make an improvement on the 292, was started by the covers mainly the problem of spark plugs was solved by giving an inclination towards the front of the engine that allowed an easier extraction in the car, changed the opening order and exhaust cam, valves larger intake (of the 292 heavy duty American) were placed, fuel lines making them more direct was improved with a new admission very similar to that of the small block 289, 302 pistons maximum compression with lomo brand Buxton were used, raising the compression at 8 to 1, allowing the engine erogue 185 HP at 4500 rpm, another improvement were leaks with individual manifold runners, eliminating the original American system of a manifold connected to another in series, used in trucks, in cars they were always individual. Distributors are different in coupling, calling FASE II . In 1978, the LTD "Elite" option was introduced as the most luxurious made in Argentina. By the end of production in 1981, almost 30,000 Fairlanes had been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fairlaneargentina.com |title=Fairlane Argentina 2.0 |language=Spanish |publisher=www.fairlaneargentina.com |date= |accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ford Fairlane in Venezuela==
Ford manufactured the [[Ford Torino|Torino]] in Venezuela marketed as the Fairlane and Fairlane 500.  These cars were identical to the U.S. Torino through 1976 and both base Fairlane and upscale Fairlane 500 used the "base" Torino grille.  For 1977–1979 the Fairlane was based on the American [[Ford LTD II|LTD II]].

==2005 concept==
[[File:Ford Fairlane Concept.jpg|thumb|The Ford Fairlane concept car at the 2005 [[Chicago Auto Show]]]]
At the [[North American International Auto Show#2005|2005 Auto Show circuit]], Ford revealed a new [[concept car]] with the Fairlane nameplate.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.motortrend.com/auto_shows/coverage/112_05_chicago_ford_fairlane_photos/index.html 2005 Chicago Auto Show: Ford Fairlane Photo Gallery]." ''Motor Trend,'' 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The "people-mover" Fairlane [[Crossover SUV|crossover utility vehicle]] concept featured three-row seating for six passengers, and previewed the chromed three-bar horizontal grill design, which currently appears on the 2006 [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]] sedan and 2007 [[Ford Edge]] crossover utility vehicle."&lt;ref&gt;Nevin, Brad.

===Production model===
:''See [[Ford Flex]]''
A production version of the Fairlane concept, now called the [[Ford Flex]], debuted at the 2007 New York Auto Show, and entered production for the 2009 model year in summer 2008. Unlike the concept, the production model comes with seven seats. It is built on the [[Ford D3 platform]], which is also used by the [[Ford Taurus]], and [[Mercury Sable]]. It is intended to replace the people-mover capability of the [[Ford Freestar]] minivan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_ford_oks_fairlane/ |title=Ford OKs Fairlane, Keeps Town Car |work=Ward's AutoWorld |date=1 October 2006 |accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.caranddriver.com/dailyautoinsider/11644/ford-develops-people-movers-to-replace-minivans.html Ford Develops People Movers to Replace Minivans] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323104046/http://www.caranddriver.com/dailyautoinsider/11644/ford-develops-people-movers-to-replace-minivans.html |date=2007-03-23 }}."

The '''Ford Durango''' is a two-passenger [[coupe utility]] sold in limited production by Ford Motor Company&lt;ref name=hemmings&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2008/01/03/fords-last-chero-the-durango/ |title=Ford’s last ‘chero – the Durango |publisher=Hemmings Daily |date=January 3, 2008 |access-date=July 14, 2015 |first=Daniel |last=Strohl}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the 1979 and 1982 model years.{{cn|date=August 2016}} The vehicle was the result of a joint venture between Ford and National Coach Works, located in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref name=CollectibleAutomobile&gt;{{cite journal |title=1981-1982 Durango: The Should-Have-Been Ranchero Replacement |journal=Collectible Automobile |date=February 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not officially a production vehicle or a replacement for the [[Ford Ranchero]] (which ended production after the 1979 model year), the Durango was designed as a potential competitor to the newly downsized [[Chevrolet El Camino]] and was commissioned by Ford to be sold through Ford dealerships.  As no official totals were kept by either company production estimates vary between the low 200s and 350, with 212 conversions known to have been made by National Coach Works.&lt;ref name=hemmings/&gt;&lt;ref name=jalopnik&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jalopnik.com/390648/another-ford-fairmont-durango-for-sale-can-you-resist-the-foxchero |title=Another Ford Fairmont Durango For Sale, Can You Resist The Foxchero? |first=Matt |last=Hardigree |website=Jalopnik |date=May 15, 2008 |access-date=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design overview==
=== Production ===
To produce the Durango, National Coach Works used the body of the [[Ford Fairmont|Ford Fairmont Futura]] two-door coupe.  Aft of the [[B-pillar]], the roof was removed along with the trunklid and rear seating area. Behind the rear seats, the company added a flat-floor fiberglass cargo bed along with a bulkhead and new rear window behind the two front seats.  The rear fascia above the bumper was redesigned into a fold-down tailgate.  As the tailgate included the license plate and taillamps, the Durango was produced with a disclaimer warning drivers from driving with the tailgate in the down position.&lt;ref name="hemmings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ranchero.us"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ranchero.us/forum/index.php?threads/durango-the-last-ranchero-looking-for-other-fairmont-durango-owners.7113/page-2|title=Durango-the last Ranchero (Looking for other Fairmont Durango owners) {{!}} Page 2 {{!}} ranchero.us|website=www.ranchero.us|access-date=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Pickup, Van and 4WD'' magazine from December 1981 features an article about the Durango that states: "The project had been planned for an earlier date in 1981 than that which was finally achieved, so only a little over 100 units were assembled before the current-year model went out of production."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Durango |journal=Pickup, Van &amp; 4WD |date=December 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Features ===
[[File:Durango tailgate.jpg|thumb|Ford Durango tailgate detail, showing filler panel and integrated taillamps]]

As the B-pillar design of the Fairmont Futura coupe lent itself to the conversion on an unofficial basis, there are several unique features to the Durango that identify it as a vehicle converted by National Coach.&lt;ref name="BoldRide"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.boldride.com/2014/01/auction-car-of-the-week-1981-ford-durango/41838/ |title=Auction Car of the Week: 1981 Ford Durango |first=Craig |last=Fitzgerald |website=BoldRide |date=January 3, 2014 |access-date=August 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426215719/http://news.boldride.com/2014/01/auction-car-of-the-week-1981-ford-durango/41838/ |archive-date=April 26, 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the exception of a prototype based upon a 1979 Mercury Z-7, all examples were based upon the Fairmont Futura.&lt;ref name="CollectibleAutomobile"/&gt;  Conversions by National Coach, which are the only versions with a functioning tailgate, feature a fiberglass filler panel between the cargo bed and the tailgate; the design of the panel stores the tailgate hinges when it is folded down.&lt;ref name="CollectibleAutomobile"/&gt;  

As equipped from the factory, the Ford Durango was equipped only with a 200 cubic-inch inline six, the mid-range engine of the Fairmont line.&lt;ref name="CollectibleAutomobile"/&gt;  The engine was paired with a three-speed automatic transmission.  

The ''Pickup, Van and 4WD'' magazine from December 1981 features an article about the Durango that states: "The project had been planned for an earlier date in 1981 than that which was finally achieved, so only a little over 100 units were assembled before the current-year model went out of production."  Nearly all factory-converted Durangos were produced during the 1981 model year;  it is unknown how many 1982 examples were produced.&lt;ref name="hemmings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CollectibleAutomobile"/&gt;

The '''Ford Starliner''' was the fastback version of the flagship [[Ford Galaxie|Galaxie]] line of full-size [[Ford]]s in 1960 and 1961.

In 1960, the Starliner hardtop, along with the Sunliner convertible, made up the Galaxie Special Series.&lt;ref name=Gunnell_404&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalogue of American Cars 1946-1975, Revised 4th Edition, 2002, page 404&lt;/ref&gt;  It utilized the high-level Galaxie trim, however the Galaxie name on the trunklid was replaced by Starliner script.&lt;ref name=Gunnell_404/&gt; In 1961 the Starliner hardtop and Sunliner convertible were part of the Galaxie Series.&lt;ref name=Gunnell_406&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalogue of American Cars 1946-1975, Revised 4th Edition, 2002, page 406&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ford Starliner shares its name with the 1952–1954 [[Studebaker Starlight|Studebaker Starliner]] and the [[Lockheed L-1649A Starliner|Lockheed L-1649A]] airplane. 

Characterized by their thin roof pillars, fastback styling and slippery aerodynamics, they symbolized 1960s jet age design. While the '60 and '61 body styles share only their roof lines and chassis, they did share the same overall styling concept.

The base engine in the 1960 and 1961 models was the aging 292&amp;nbsp;CID Y-block V-8, with the optional 352 motor that was originally introduced in 1958. In 1961 Ford offered the new Thunderbird 390 cubic-inch motor in three versions with the top line offering in 375 horsepower. There was also a dealer option for a 6V-401 HP that came with a three-2 barrel manifold and carb setup in the trunk to be installed by the dealer or the buyer.

In 1962 the Galaxie 500 (and 500 XL) replaced the Starliner as the top offering. The number of Starliners built in 1960 was 68,641,&lt;ref name=Gunnell_404/&gt; and 29,669 were built in 1961.&lt;ref name=Gunnell_406/&gt;

==Motorsport==
The Starliner offered a suitable platform for NASCAR teams to build their race cars. They were produced in limited numbers and due to their racing applications few survivors exist today. For 1962, Ford initially proposed a "Starlift" removable slant back, but the car was dropped after one race.  Finally in 1963, Ford introduced a fastback version of the Galaxie called the "1963 1/2 Sports Hardtop," which featured a NASCAR-inspired 1-inch lowered roofline.

The '''Ford Torino''' is an automobile that was produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] for the North American market between 1968 and 1976. It was a competitor in the [[mid-size car|intermediate]] market segment. The car was named after the city of [[Turin]] (''Torino'', in [[Italian language|Italian]]), considered ''"the Italian [[Detroit]]"''. The Torino was initially an upscale variation of the intermediate sized [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Ford Fairlane]], which Ford produced between 1962 and 1970. After 1968, the ''Fairlane'' name was retained for the base models with lower levels of trim than those models which wore the ''Torino'' name. During this time, the Torino was considered a subseries to the Fairlane. By 1970 ''Torino'' had become the primary name for Ford's intermediate, and the Fairlane was now a subseries of the Torino. In 1971 the ''Fairlane'' name was dropped altogether, and all Ford intermediates were called ''Torino''. This name was one of several originally proposed for the [[Ford Mustang|Mustang]] while in development.&lt;ref name="Ford Mustang - 40 Years of History "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mocsem.org/other/mustang_history_intro.php|title=The Accelerator, Ford Mustang - 40 Years of History|accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Torino was essentially a twin to the [[Mercury Montego]] line.

Most Torinos were conventional cars, and generally the most popular models were the 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedans]] and 2-door [[hardtop]]s.   However, Ford produced some high-performance versions of the Torino by fitting them with large powerful engines, such as the {{convert|428|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|429|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} "Cobra-Jet" engines. These cars are classified as [[muscle car]]s. Ford also chose the Torino as the base for its [[NASCAR]] entrants, and it has a successful racing heritage.

For 1968,  Ford redesigned its intermediate Fairlane line and introduced a new premium subseries model,  the '''Torino'''. The 1968 Fairlane and Torino used the same wheelbases as its 1967 predecessor: {{convert|116|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} on 2- and 4-door models, and {{convert|113|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} for station wagon models.

[[File:1968Torino.JPG|thumb|left|1968 Ford Torino 2-Door Hardtop]]
Styling was drastically changed from the 1967 Fairlane models, resulting in growth in size and weight. The front fascia featured a full width recessed grille, with horizontal quad headlights placed at the outer edges. Horizontal dividing bars were featured in the grille depending on the model. Parking lights were placed at the outer edge of the front fenders and wrapped around the corner to also act as side marker lights to meet the new 1968 requirements. The body sides were smooth with one horizontal body crease running just below the beltline from front to back. The taillights were rectangular in shape and vertically situated in the rear panel above rear bumper. Reverse lights were located in the middle of the taillights, and reflectors were located on the rear edge of the quarter panel.

A new addition for 1968 was the two-door [[fastback]] "SportsRoof" bodystyle. Similar to Mustang fastback models, it featured a gently sloped roof line that extended to the edge of the trunk lid and a unique concave taillamp panel. This new fastback body style gave the Fairlane and the Torino excellent aerodynamics that would later prove to be advantageous on the race track.

Ford had 14 different models in its intermediate line for 1968. The base model was the "Fairlane", which was available in a 2-door [[hardtop]], a 4-door sedan, and a 4-door [[station wagon]]. Next was the mid level "Fairlane 500", which was available as a 2-door hardtop, 2-door SportsRoof, [[convertible (car)|convertible]], and a 4-door sedan and station wagon. This was followed by the top level "Torino" series, which consisted of a 2-door hardtop, a 4-door sedan, and the Squire station wagon that featured wood grained applique. Finally, the "Torino GT", the sporty version of the Fairlane 500 series, included a 2-door hardtop, a 2-door SportsRoof, and a convertible.

The 1968 Fairlane/Torino was constructed with [[Monocoque|unit-construction]] using the same platform as the 1966-67 models. The front suspension consisted of short/long control arms with coil springs mounted on an upper control arm and a strut stabilized lower control arm.  Rear suspension consisted of long semi-elliptical leaf springs on a solid axle. A heavy-duty suspension option was available for V8 powered [[car]]s, and included extra-heavy-duty springs and shocks. Steering was recirculating ball system, with power steering optional. All cars came standard with four-wheel drum brakes, although front disc brakes and power assist were options.

The interior on the Fairlane/Torino was all new for 1968. A new dashboard featured four equally sized round pods centred around the steering wheel. However, the pods did not contain a full set of gauges; rather an assortment of warning lights along with the speedometer and fuel gauge. The fuel gauge and temperature warning lights were in the first pod, a {{convert|120|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} speedometer was located in the second pod from the left, alternator and oil pressure warning lights were in the third pod from the left and the fourth pod was blank. An optional tachometer was available, which would be located in the third pod, and an optional clock occupied the fourth pod. Ford offered many upholstery options, including a knitted vinyl option, called "comfortweave." This unique option allowed the vinyl to "breathe" unlike conventional vinyl, offering more comfort in hot weather.  Conforming to U.S. safety standards, there was much padding inside the Torino's interior, which also featured shoulder belts for front outboard passengers on all cars built after December 31, 1967.

[[File:Ford Torino Indy 500 pace car.jpg|thumb|left|1968 Ford Torino Pace Car Convertible]] All Torinos included full colour-keyed carpeting, additional exterior and interior trim over a Fairlane, and Torino crests on the 'C' pillar. The Torino GT's standard features included  special name plaques and exterior trim, GT markings on wheel covers and courtesy lights on the inside door panels. Initial sales literature showed that bucket seats were standard equipment.  However, due to a six-week UAW strike, the GT's standard seating was changed to a bench seat.&lt;ref name="Hemmings 68-69 GT"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Litwin |first1=Matthew |title=1968-69 Ford Torino GT |url=https://www.hemmings.com/blog/article/1968-69-ford-torino-gt-2/ |website=Hemmings |accessdate=18 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Torino GT was available with a GT handling suspension package, which included extra-heavy-duty springs and shocks, and a heavy-duty front anti-sway bar. Of note, when the 428 CJ engine was installed, the suspensions used the stiffest springs and largest front sway bar compared to other Torinos with the heavy-duty suspension.&lt;ref name="hemmings"/&gt; Four-speed equipped cars used staggered rear shocks which helped resist axle hop. GTs were available with a stripe option, which started as a 'C' shape at the edge of the front fender, and two body stripes extended the length of the car.

[[File:1968 Ford Torino GT Fastback.jpg|thumb|left|1968 Ford Torino GT SportsRoof]]Ford had quite a variety of engine options for its intermediate line. All models other than the Torino GT came standard with a {{convert|200|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-6|six-cylinder]] engine. Torino GT models came standard with a {{convert|302|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}-2V  [[Ford 302 Engine|small block]] [[V8 engine|V8]] and this was also the base V8 engine optional on other models. Other available engines included a {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}-2V [[Ford FE engine#390|FE engine]], {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}-4V [[Ford FE engine#390|FE engine]] and a {{convert|427|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}-4V [[Ford 427 engine|FE engine]]. About one month within the beginning of the 1968 model year production, a six-week UAW strike against Ford occurred. This resulted in a cost-cutting measure of making a {{convert|289|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}-2V [[Ford Windsor engine#289|small block V8]] the base V8 engine and the standard engine on the Torino GT. Ford did not change any of its factory sales literature to reflect this change.&lt;ref name="hemmings"&gt;{{cite web|first=Daniel|last=Strohl|url=http://www.hemmings.com/mus/stories/2006/10/01/hmn_buyers_guide1.html|title=1968-'69 Ford Torino GT|publisher=Hemmings Motor News|date=2006-10-01 |accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the {{convert|427|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}-4V [[Ford 427 engine|FE engine]] was initially listed as an engine option for 1968 in factory literature, no Fairlanes or Torinos were actually produced with this engine during 1968.&lt;ref name="hemmings"/&gt; Introduced on April 1, 1968, the {{convert|428|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}-4V CJ (Cobra-Jet) [[Ford FE engine#428|FE engine]] became available as an engine option, but due to its mid-year introduction these engines are very rare. The 428-4V Cobra-Jet was the most potent engine available for 1968, and is general believed to be under-rated at {{convert|335|hp||abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Mueller"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mueller |first=Mike |title=American Horsepower: 100 Years of Great Car Engines|publisher=Motorbooks Publishing |year=2006 | isbn=978-0-7603-2327-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cars equipped with the 428 Cobra Jets had emblems borrowed from the full-sized Fords (a red-and-chrome badge reading "428") mounted on the fenders behind the parking lamps. All models came standard with a three-speed [[manual transmission]], while the [[Cruise-O-Matic]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] and four-speed manual transmissions were options.

According to contemporary reviews, when equipped properly the Torino GT offered a good combination of power and handling. In ''Car Life'' magazine's test of a 1968 Torino GT SportsRoof equipped with a 390-4V, C-6, and 3.25:1 axle, they recorded a 0 - {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} time of 7.7 seconds, and the quarter-mile (402&amp;nbsp;m) [[dragstrip]] time of 15.8 seconds at {{convert|90|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Car Life 68 Torino"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Torino GT - 390 Fastback 2-Dr Road Test|journal=Car Life|date=Mar 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine wrote "Putting the car through quick and/or tight corners isn't a matter of practiced art - it's more like second nature for the GT" in their test of a 1968 Torino GT.&lt;ref name="MT 68 Torino 390 GT"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Torino GT - 390|journal=Motor Trend|date=Dec 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Car and Driver'' magazine tested a 1968 Ford Torino GT equipped with the 428 CJ with Ram Air induction, C-6 Cruise-O-Matic, and 3.91:1 gears and recorded a quarter mile time of 14.2 seconds at {{convert|98.9|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. ''[[Car and Driver]]'' wrote the Torino had "a 1-2 shift that broke the Wide-Ovals loose for at least a length. With a price tag of $306 for the Cobra-Jet option, Ford lovers have a reason to rejoice."&lt;ref name="CD 68 428CJ"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitlock|first=Joe|title=Inside the Torino Cobra Jet|journal=Car and Driver|date=June 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Station wagons came in three different models: "Fairlane", "Fairlane 500", and "Torino Squire." All wagons came equipped with Ford's "Magic Doorgate" two-way tailgate, and were available with an optional rear-facing third seat which increased the car's carrying capacity from 6 to 8 people. Torino Squire models came standard with [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] side panels, and had the more refined trim and upholstery of the Torino sedans. Unique station wagon options included a chrome roof rack and a power rear window.

1968 was a successful year for Torino with 172,083 units produced. Including Fairlane production, 371,787 cars were produced.&lt;ref name="SC1"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Gunnell|editor-first=John|title=The Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975|publisher=Krause Publications|year=1987|isbn =978-0-87341-096-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Torino was well received by the automotive press and a 1968 Torino GT convertible was selected as the [[1968 Indianapolis 500]] [[List of Indianapolis 500 pace cars|pace car]].

The 1969 Fairlane/Torino saw some cosmetic changes, and there were quite a few performance oriented changes. Ford performed the typical minor styling adjustments, but overall the 1969 models were similar in appearance to the 1968 models. The grille was revised slightly, and now had a more prominent centre dividing bar, while the taillights were restyled on non-fastback models to be similar to the 1969 Ford full-size cars.  Fastbacks retained the 1968-style taillights and rear panel.  All models above the Fairlane, had an aluminium dividing bar that ran across the rear panel, between the taillights and inline with the reverse lights on SportsRoof models.&lt;ref name=SC1 /&gt;

[[File:Ford Torino 1969 (7416953828).jpg|thumb|left|1969 Ford Torino 2-door Hardtop]]The number of models produced by Ford increased for 1969, from 14 to 16. All carryover models were the same as 1968, with the two new models being the "Cobra" 2-door SportsRoof and 2-door hardtop. Some automotive literature list these models as "Torino Cobra", with the Cobra being a sub-series to the Torino. The Cobra has the same body code as a Fairlane 500, so some sources refer to these cars as the "Fairlane Cobra". Most of Ford's literature at the time only used the name "Cobra" without Torino or Fairlane attached. The car itself did not have any Fairlane or Torino nameplates on its exterior or interior, although 1969 [[NASCAR]] entrants were labeled "Torino Cobras." For the purpose of this article, only "Cobra" will be used, as Ford marketed the car as such in 1969 without Fairlane or Torino attached.

The engine line-up was slightly revised for 1969. All models, except Torino GTs and Cobras, came standard with a new larger {{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} I-6 engine. The larger displacement produced more power and torque than the {{convert|200|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine. Optional engines included the {{convert|302|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}-2V (standard on GTs), the new for 1969 {{convert|351|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}-2V [[351 Windsor|Windsor]], 351-4V Windsor, {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}-4V, and the {{convert|428|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}-4V Cobra Jet (standard on Cobras). The 428 CJ was available with or without the Ram Air Induction package, however, those with Ram Air still carried the same advertised power rating. The 428 CJ without Ram Air, came with the following items: 80-ampere heavy-duty battery, 3.25:1 open differential, heavy-duty cooling package, 55-ampere alternator, chrome valve covers and dual exhaust. The Ram Air 428 CJ included all of the above, but had a 3.50:1 open differential, and the functional hood scoop. With Ram Air, "428 Cobra Jet" emblems were placed on each side of the hood scoop; without Ram Air, "428" emblems were placed on the front fender. The 428 Cobra Jet had a 735 cfm [[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] four-barrel carburetor.

The 428 CJ was no longer the top engine choice; superseded by the 428-4V Super Cobra Jet (SCJ). This engine was specifically designed for drag racing, and it was included with the "Drag Pack" option package. The Drag Pack option package could be ordered with the Q-code 428-4V or the R-code 'Ram Air' equipped 428-4V, and would transform either engine into a Super Cobra Jet. Included with 428 SCJ were cast pistons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pistons |url=https://www.428cobrajet.com/id-piston |website=Mustang 428 Cobra Jet Registry |accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a nodular controlled cast-iron crankshaft casting 1UA or 1UA B with an external weight on the snout behind the balancer, 427 (LeMans) capscrew connecting rods, an engine oil cooler, and either a {{convert|9|in||abbr=on}} rear axle with 3.91:1 gears and a Traction-Lock limited slip or 4.30:1 gears with a Detroit Locker. The Detroit Locker and the oil cooler were industry exclusives to Ford. This package did not change Ford's advertised power rating of {{convert|335|hp|abbr=on}}.

The Cobra was Ford's attempt at making a [[muscle car]] package that focused on performance features. As a result, the Cobra came standard with a 428-4V CJ, competition suspension, 4-speed manual transmission and F70-14 tires. The Cobra had a blacked out grille, hood lock pins, and "Cobra" emblems.  A hood scoop was standard on Ram Air equipped Cobras, while a non-functional scoop was optional on other Cobras. Early Cobras had a large "Cobra" decal on the front fenders, but this was later replaced with a metal emblem. The Cobra was Ford's response to the successful [[Plymouth Road Runner]], which was a high-performance car at low cost. For this reason, the Cobra had the lesser trim level of the Fairlane 500 to help keep costs low. ''Road Test'' magazine wrote the "big engine and whopping torque get the Cobra Jet off the line with smoking tires" in their test of a 1969 Cobra with the Ram Air 428 CJ, four-speed manual, and 3.50 gears. They obtained a 15.07 seconds at {{convert|95.74|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} quarter mile run, however, according to the article, the elapsed time was likely hampered due to the car not being equipped with a tachometer.&lt;ref name="Road Test 69 Cobra"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The 'Brute' from Ford's Snake Pit: Cobra Jet 428 Road Test|journal=Road Test Magazine|date=July 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Road Test'' reported difficulty with the factory shifter and stated "we would have liked a Hurst shifter, and might have bettered our times with one." &lt;ref name="Road Test 69 Cobra" /&gt;

[[File:1969 Ford Torino GT 351 Sportsroof.jpg|thumb|left|1969 Ford Torino GT SportsRoof]]The Torino GT was relatively unchanged from 1968. The grille received minor updates, including revised divider bars and the GT emblem moved to the lower left corner of the grille. The 'C' stripe was revised, and now ran in straight lines, rather than following the body line like in 1968. All 1969 Torino GT's came equipped a non-functional fibreglass hood scoop that had turn signal indicators at the rear of the scoop. This scoop was functional if the 428-4V and Ram Air induction options were specified. The hood scoop could also be deleted from the GT for a credit. Although the Torino GT could be optioned to include all of the Cobra's performance features, the GT was a more upscale vehicle which had the more deluxe Torino trim.

Ford added one more special high-performance vehicle to its intermediate line-up, the [[Ford Torino Talladega|Torino Talladega]]. See the [[Ford Torino#NASCAR Inspired Torinos|NASCAR Inspired Torinos]] section for a detailed information on this model.

Ford Torino production decreased for 1969, and a total of 129,054 units were produced. Including Fairlane production, 366,911 cars were produced, slightly down from the 1968 numbers. Torino GTs were the majority of Torinos produced, accounting for 81,822 units produced. Ford did not provide separate production number for the Cobra.&lt;ref name="SC1"/&gt;

For 1970, the Torino became the primary model and the Fairlane became a sub-series of Torino. Ford moved away from emulating the boxy lines of the [[Ford Galaxie|full-size Fords]] to a completely new body for the 1970 Torino/Fairlane line influenced by [[coke bottle styling]]. Just as [[tailfins]] were influenced by jet aircraft of the 1950s, stylists such as Ford stylist Bill Shenk who designed the 1970 Ford Torino were inspired by supersonic aircraft with narrow waists and bulging forward and rear fuselages needed to reach supersonic speeds (see [[Area rule]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torinocobra.com/articles/birth_of_torino.htm|title=The Birth of the 1970 Ford Fairlane/Torino|first=Bill|last=Shenk|date=May–June 1995|publisher=The Fairlaner News|accessdate=10 October 2010|quote=This was the era of 'Area Rule,' 'Compressibility,' 'Mach I,' and 'Delta Wings.' So some of my personal likes rubbed off into my sketches at the Ford styling center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1970 Torino had more prominent long hood short deck styling, and was longer, lower and wider than the 1969 models. All models had a lower and less formal roofline compared to previous years. The windshield rake was increased, and the SportsRoof models had an even flatter fastback roofline. The Torino had a pointed front end and overall styling appeared much more aerodynamic than years previous. The grille covered the full width of the front fascia and surrounded the quad headlights. The front fender line extended to front door, sloping downward and gradually disappearing in the quarter panel. Both front and rear bumpers were slim tight fitting chromed units, that followed the body lines. The taillights were situated in the rear panel above the bumper, and were now long rectangular units with rounded outer edges.

The model line-up for 1970 initially featured 13 models. The base model "Fairlane 500", was available in a 2-door hardtop, 4-door sedan, and 4-door wagon. Next the mid-level "Torino" was available as a 2-door and 4-door hardtop, a 4-door sedan and station wagon. The 4-door pillarless hardtop was a new body style for the 1970 model year (Chevrolet introduced this body style for its intermediate Chevelle starting in 1966). The "Torino Brougham," the top trim level, was available as a 2-door and 4-door hardtop, and a 4-door station wagon. The sporty "Torino GT" was available as a 2-door SportsRoof and convertible. The performance model, the "Torino Cobra" was available as a 2-door SportsRoof only.

To add to this extensive line-up, the Falcon name was added mid-year as a new entry-level intermediate. The [[Ford Falcon (North American)|Ford Falcon]] compact model continued for the first half of the 1970 model year, but was discontinued as it could not meet new federal standards that came into effect on January 1, 1970. As a result, the Falcon model name was used as the new price leader for the intermediate line. The 1970½ Falcon was available as a 2-door and 4-door sedan, and 4-door station wagon. These were the lowest priced intermediate models with less standard features than the Fairlane 500s. The Falcon was the only intermediate that used a rubber floor instead of carpet, and was the only series that offered a pillared 2-door sedan. Also introduced mid-year was a Torino 2-door SportsRoof model, which was marketed as a low price alternative to the GT. With the above mid-year additions, the Ford intermediate line-up consisted of 17 separate models.

The new body for 1970 added inches and pounds to the Torino resulting in stretching the chassis used in 1968–69. All cars grew by about {{convert|5|in|mm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} in length, and now rode on a longer {{convert|117|in|mm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} wheelbase (station wagons used a {{convert|114|in||abbr=on|adj=on}} wheelbase). Weight was up for most models by at least {{convert|100|lb|abbr=on}}. The wheel track was widened to {{convert|60.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} in front and {{convert|60|in|mm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} in the rear to help the Torino improve its road holding abilities.  The extra width between the spring towers increased the engine compartment size allowing the larger [[Ford 385 engine|385 Series V8's]] to fit. However, the suspension remained unchanged from the 1969 models. Optional suspension packages included the competition suspension and heavy-duty suspension options. The competition suspension consisted of extra-heavy-duty front and rear springs ({{convert|500|lb|1|abbr=on}} per inch front, and {{convert|210|lb|1|abbr=on}} per inch rear), Gabriel shocks (staggered rear shocks on 4-speed cars), and a large 0.95" front sway bar (0.75" standard on other suspensions). In a 1970 ''[[Motor Trend]]'' test of a Torino Cobra, ''Motor Trend'' described the competition suspension as "completely different: The car goes through tight turns in a confidence-inspiring controlled slide. It's all very smooth and unusual."&lt;ref name="MT Three Strippers"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Date with Three Strippers - Torino Cobra 429 vs Chevelle SS 454 vs Road Runner 440|journal=Motor Trend|date=December 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interiors on the Torino were all new for 1970. The dashboard used a linear style speedometer centered on the driver and a new "ribbon" style tachometer was an option for V8 models. A temperature gauge was the only available gauge; oil pressure and electrics were monitored with warning lights only. High back bucket seats were available for all 2-door models, as was an optional console. All 2-door hardtop, SportsRoof and convertible models had "DirectAire" ventilation systems as a standard feature, which eliminated the need for side vent windows. The 2-door sedan, 4-doors and station wagons still had vent windows but the "DirectAire" system was an option for these models. The ignition switch was moved from the instrument panel to the steering column, in compliance with Federal regulations. The steering wheel and column-mounted shifter locked when the key was removed.

The engine line-up received major changes, and only the 250 CID I-6, 302-2V and the 351W-2V were carried over from 1969. Most models continued used the 250 CID I-6 as the standard engine. Optional engines included the 302-2V (standard on GT and Brougham models), 351W-2V, the new 351 [[Ford 335 engine#351 Cleveland|Cleveland]] available with a 2- or 4-barrel carburetor, and the new 429-4V [[Ford 385 engine|385 Series V8]] (standard on the Cobra models). Selecting the 351-2V on the option list could have resulted in the buyer receiving either the 351W-2V or the 351C-2V; both shared the same power rating and VIN code. The 429-4V was available in three different versions. The first was the 429 Thunder Jet, the standard engine for the Cobra, rated at {{convert|360|hp|abbr=on}}. Next was the 429 CJ (Cobra Jet), rated at {{convert|370|hp|abbr=on|0}}, which included a 2-bolt main block, hydraulic lifters, a 700 CFM [[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] or 715 CFM Rochester Quadrajet carburetor, and was available with or without Ram Air. The top option was the 429 SCJ (Super Cobra Jet), rated at {{convert|375|hp|abbr=on|0}}, and was part of the "Drag Pack" option. Selecting the "Drag Pack" option turned a 429 CJ into a 429 SCJ. The drag pack required either the 3.91:1 or the 4.30:1 axle ratio, and included a 4-bolt main engine block, forged pistons, 780 CFM [[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] carburetor, engine oil cooler, and a solid lifter cam. The "Detroit Locker" rear differential was included when the 4.30:1 axle was ordered while the "Traction-Lock" limited-slip differential was included with the 3.91:1 axle.&lt;ref name="HMM Torino Cobra"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Litwin |first1=Matthew |title=1970 Ford Torino Cobra |url=https://www.hemmings.com/magazine/mus/2016/08/1970-Ford-Torino-Cobra/3749976.html |website=Hemmings |publisher=Hemmings |accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ram Air induction was optional on the 351C-4V, 429 CJ and 429 SCJ, but Ram Air did not change the advertised power ratings. The Ram Air option included a "shaker hood" where the scoop was attached to the top of the air cleaner assembly, and protruded through a hole in the hood. A 3-speed transmission was standard on all models except for the Cobra which came with a 4-speed as standard equipment. The Cruise-O-Matic was optional for all engines while the 4-speed transmission was available on all engines except the six and the 302-2V.&lt;ref name="TorinoCobraSpecs"&gt;{{cite web |title=Torino Specifications |url=http://www.torinocobra.com/specs.htm |website=TorinoCobra.com |accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Torino Brougham models came standard with extra exterior and interior trim, finer upholsteries, wheel covers, unique emblems, extra sound insulation and "Hideaway" headlights.  "Hideaway" headlights had headlight covers that were styled to look like the grille of the vehicle extended across the front end. When the lights were turned on, vacuum actuators would flip the covers up and out of the way to expose the quad headlamps. ''[[Motor Trend]]'' wrote{{When|date=September 2018}} that "when you get into a Brougham, it's the same feeling as an LTD, or even, dare we say it, a Continental. But in a more manageable scale."&lt;ref name="MT 1970 Road Test" /&gt; ''[[Motor Trend]]'' gave accolades to the 1970 Torino Brougham 2-door for its quiet interior that only allowed "the muffled thump of freeway expansion-joints [to] intrude."&lt;ref name="MT 1970 Road Test" /&gt;

The Torino GT came standard with non-functional hood scoop molded into the hood, GT emblems (including the centre of the grille), dual colour-keyed sport mirrors, full width tail lights with a honeycomb effect (the centre portion was only reflective), black decklid appliques, and hub caps with wheel trim rings. Standard tires for the GT were E70-14 fibreglass belted tires, while convertibles wore F70-14s. Bucket seats and console were not longer standard equipment on the GT, but remained as options. Other new options for the Torino GT were a reflective laser stripe, which ran down the middle of the side of the Torino from the front fender to the door, and Hideaway headlamps. ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine tested a 1970 Torino GT SportsRoof with a 429 CJ, C-6 Automatic, and 3.50:1 gears, and obtained a 0 - {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} time of 6.0 seconds, while the quarter mile took 14.4 seconds at {{convert|100.2|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="MT 1970 Road Test" /&gt;

[[File:1970 ford torino cobra sportsroof chiolero rear.jpg|thumb|right|1970 Ford Torino Cobra shown with optional sport slats and Magnum 500 wheels]]
The Torino Cobra remained the top performance model, and but was a lower level of trim than the Torino GT. The Cobra was only available as a SportsRoof, and came standard with a 4-speed close ratio transmission, [[Hurst shifter]], competition suspension, flat black hood and grille, 7-inch-wide wheels, F70-14 tires with raised white letters, twist style exposed hood latches and "Cobra" emblems.&lt;ref name="TorinoCobraSpecs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HMM Torino Cobra"/&gt; New options included {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on|adj=on}} Magnum 500 wheels with F60-15 tires and flat black "Sport Slats" for the rear window (both also available on the Torino GT). Performance was strong even though the Torino was heavier for 1970. ''[[Motor Trend]]'' tested a 1970 Torino Cobra equipped with the Ram Air {{convert|370|hp|0|abbr=on}}, 429 CJ, C-6 automatic and 3.50:1 rear axle, and it went from 0 - {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 6.0 seconds while taking 14.5 seconds at {{convert|100|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} to go through the quarter mile. ''Motor Trend'' wrote "The weight obviously helped traction, as it was fairly easy to accelerate away from a standing start with only a modicum of wheelspin." ''Motor Trend'' also tested a 1970 Cobra with a 429 SCJ, 4-speed and 3.91:1 gears, and resulted in a 5.8 second 0 - {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} time, with a 13.99 second quarter mile at {{convert|101.0|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="MT 1970 Road Test" /&gt; ''Super Stock and Drag Illustrated'' bested that time, in their test of a Torino Cobra equipped with the {{convert|375|hp||abbr=on}}, 429 SCJ, C-6 automatic, and 3.91:1 rear gears. They were able to run the quarter mile in 13.63 seconds at {{convert|105.95|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, however, this was after the carburetor had been modified (improved power valve, larger primary and secondary jets). ''Super Stock and Drag Illustrated'' fitted a pair of slicks to the same Torino and ran a 13.39 seconds at {{convert|106.96|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.

Station wagon models for 1970 were offered initially in three different levels: the Fairlane 500 wagon, the Torino wagon, and the Torino Squire wagon. Mid-year 1970, the Falcon wagon became base station wagon. The sheetmetal on the station wagons was not changed as drastically as 2-door and 4-door models. The majority of the sheetmetal behind the front doors was carried over from the 1968-69 body style. As a result, the wagons appeared more upright and square than the sedans and coupes. The Torino Squire, the top level wagon, featured simulated woodgrain sides, headlamp covers and a trim level similar to the Torino Brougham sedan. The Squire came standard with a 302-2V V8 engine and power front disc brakes; other wagons had 4-wheel drums and the 250 CID I-6. All wagons used Ford's "Magic Doorgate" two-way tailgate, but the power rear window, rear-facing third seat and roof rack were options. Ford offered a trailering towing package for all Torinos that would allow Torino to have a Class II tow rating ({{convert|3500|lb|0|abbr=on}}). This package included heavy-duty suspension, heavy-duty battery and alternator, extra cooling package, and power front disc brakes. The {{convert|351|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} or {{convert|429|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine, power steering and the Cruise-O-Matic transmission were required options.

Overall, 1970 was a successful year for Torino. It was a well received car by the automotive press and was selected as the [[Motor Trend Car of the Year]] for 1970. ''Motor Trend'' said the Torino was "Not really a car line in the old sense, but a system of specialty cars, each for a different use ... from luxury to performance." Ford produced 230,411 Torinos for 1970, along with 110,029 Fairlanes and 67,053 Falcons, for a total production of 407,493 units.&lt;ref name="SC1"/&gt;

For the 1971 model year, Ford limited changes to its intermediate line to minor revisions. The biggest change for 1971 was the decision to drop the Fairlane and Falcon model names. The Torino line-up consisted of 14 models. The base model was the "Torino", available as a 2-door hardtop, 4-door sedan and 4-door station wagon. Next was the mid-level "Torino 500", available as a 2-door hardtop and SportsRoof, 4-door sedan and hardtop and a 4-door station wagon. The top of the line Torino remained the "Torino Brougham", available as a 2-door and 4-door hardtop, while the "Torino Squire" remained the station wagon equivalent to the Brougham. The "Torino GT" was offered as a 2-door SportsRoof and convertible, while the "Torino Cobra" was still only available as a 2-door SportsRoof.

The styling was mostly unchanged for the 1971 models, save for minor revisions to trim and the grilles. The grille on the 1971 Torinos was divided by a vertical division in the centre for all models except the Cobra. The Cobra used the same grille the 1970 model. A revised emblem was located on the vertical grille divider for all Torinos except the Cobra. The Torino 500, Brougham, Squire wagon and GT models had the hideaway headlamp option available, which included a unique grille with a less prominent divider bar.

The engine line-up remained almost identical to the 1970 model year, with most models featuring the 250 CID I-6 as standard. Broughams, Squires and GTs continued to have the 302-2V as standard, while the Torino Cobra was downgraded to a 351-4V as its standard engine. All engines, other than the 429s, saw a slight drop in compression, which also resulted in a corresponding drop in power ratings. Other manufactures were following suit, including Torino's main competitor [[Chevrolet Chevelle|Chevrolet's Chevelle]], which had an even larger drop in compression on all of its 1971 engines. Ram Air induction was an option on the 351-4V, 429 CJ, and the 429 SCJ.

[[File:1971 Ford Torino Coupe Rear.jpg|thumb|left|1971 Ford Torino 500 2-door Hardtop]]
The Torino Cobra came with a 351-4V rated at {{convert|285|hp|abbr=on}} and it also included a 4-speed manual with a [[Hurst shifter]], F70-14 tires Cobra emblems, competition suspension, hub caps, and a blacked out grille. A new option for Cobra models was the reflective laser stripe, formerly an option for just GT models. Although the high-performance 429 Cobra Jets were still rated at the same power as the 1970 models, ''Super Stock and Drag Illustrated'' had disappointing results from its test of a 1971 Torino Cobra. They tested a Cobra equipped with the {{convert|370|hp|abbr=on}}, 429 CJ, C-6 automatic, 3.50:1 gears, and were only able to turn a best quarter mile time of about 15 seconds at {{convert|97|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The article states "this car would really respond to a good ignition system, a better intake manifold, a larger carburetor and a set of headers."  ''Cars'' magazine had better luck with their test of a 1971 Torino Cobra equipped with the Ram Air {{convert|370|hp|abbr=on}}, 429 CJ, C-6 automatic, and 3:50:1 gears. They went through the quarter mile in 14.5 seconds at {{convert|102|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in the {{convert|4100|lb|abbr=on}} Torino. The former time was obtained after the ''Cars'' staff did some "proper tuning."

The GT was the Torino's sporty/high trim model and included a 302-2V engine, dual colour keyed racing mirrors, GT identification, a non-functional hood scoop, hub caps and trim, rings, chrome trim on the foot pedals, full width taillights with honeycomb effect, and E70-14 tires (F70-14 on convertibles). Torino GT's had a shaker scoop when equipped with the Ram Air Induction. The Torino Brougham was Torino's luxury oriented model. This model included Brougham ornamentation, additional trim, full wheel covers, additional sound proofing, and cloth upholstery. Hideaway headlamps were no longer standard, but remained an option. ''[[Motor Trend]]'' tested a 1971 Torino Brougham 4-door and stated "The [seat] cushioning and support was excellent. ..[and] the upholstery was magnificent."  [[File:1971 Ford Torino 500 Station Wagon.jpg|thumb|left|1971 Ford Torino 500 Wagon]]

Production for 1971 was 326,463 units, slightly lower than 1970 Ford intermediate production. Only 1,613 Torino GT Convertibles and 3,054 Torino Cobras were produced for 1971.&lt;ref name="SC1"/&gt;

For 1972, the Torino was redesigned using many characteristics carried over from the previous generation. The 1972 Torino styling emphasized the "long hood short deck" look and had strong elements of [[coke bottle styling]]. The Torino line-up was revamped with three models "Torino," "Gran Torino" and "Gran Torino Sport." The most radical change was a large eggcrate grille in an oval opening on Gran Torinos. [[Tom McCahill]] stated, "the gaping grille looks a little like it was patterned after [[Namu (orca)|Namu, the killer whale]]," but also stated that the Torino had "kind of pleasing, no-nonsense styling."&lt;ref name="McCahill 1972"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCahill|first=Tom|title=MI Tests the 1972 Torino: A Tom McCahill Report|journal=Mechanix Illustrated|date=September 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gran Torinos had chrome bezels surrounding the headlamps on each side of the large oval grille. Base Torinos had a full width argent eggcrate grille that surrounded the headlights. Base Torinos also used a unique hood and front bumper differentiating it from the Gran Torino models. The Torino's front fenders were flared around the wheel opening and the rear quarter panel had strong character line extending to the rear bumper. The windshield rake was increased to a faster 60-degree angle, while the A-pillars and roof were thinner. Despite these changes, structural integrity remained the same as 1971 models. A full width rear bumper had inset rectangular tail lights with pointed ends.  "DirectAire" ventilation was standard equipment for all Torino models, resulting in vent windows vanishing. The Torino incorporated new safety features for 1972, including new flush mount door handles and side door guard rails.

The new model line-up reduced the number of models from 14 in 1971 to 9 in 1972. The convertible and 4-door hardtops were discontinued but all other body styles remained. The 4-door hardtops and sedans were replaced with 4-door "pillared hardtops."  This was Ford's term for 4-door sedans with frameless door glass and a thin "B" pillar. This configuration was also used by station wagons. "Torino" remained the base series, but the mid-level Torino 500 was renamed "Gran Torino". The Torino Brougham was reduced to an option package for the Gran Torino, and Torino GT became "Gran Torino Sport." The Torino and Gran Torino were available as a 2-door hardtop and a 4-door sedan; the Gran Torino Sport was available as a 2-door hardtop and SportsRoof. The station wagon line-up consisted of three models: "Torino," "Gran Torino," and "Gran Torino Squire." The Cobra model was discontinued as the Torino line was refocused toward luxury and de-emphasized performance.

The biggest change for the Torino was the switch to [[body-on-frame]] construction from the [[Unit body|unit-construction]] of the 1971 models. The new chassis was a perimeter design that was used to help give the Torino a quieter and more isolated ride. It featured an energy absorbing "S" shaped front end, torque boxes to isolate road shock, fourteen rubber body mounts and five cross members.&lt;ref name="HMM 1972 Torino"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Litwin |first1=Matthew |title=1972 Gran Torino Sport |url=http://Hemmings.com |publisher=Hemmings Muscle Machines |accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front suspension used a short/long control arm design, with a computer selected coil spring mounted on the strut stabilized lower control arm, as in the fullsize [[Ford LTD (North America)|Ford]]. The rear used a four link suspension, which Ford called "Stabul," with a computer selected coil spring mounted on a solid axle. The wheel track increased by at least {{convert|2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} over 1971 models.&lt;ref name="HMM 1972 Torino" /&gt; ''[[Motor Trend]]'' stated the "road isolation and vibrational dampening is superb" in its test of a 1972 Gran Torino Brougham 4-door.&lt;ref name="MT Torino Chevelle 1972"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brokaw|first=Jim|title=The Long and the Short of It|journal=Motor Trend|date=March 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford offered two suspension options, a heavy-duty and competition suspension. The heavy-duty suspension included a larger front sway bar, and heavy-duty springs and shocks.  Competition suspension, only available in two-door models, included the most heavy-duty springs and shocks, heavy duty rear upper control arms and bushings, a larger front sway bar, and a rear sway bar. This was the first year that a rear sway bar was offered in the Torino. Front disc brakes was standard equipment on all Torinos, which no other American intermediate (other than its sister car the [[Mercury Montego]]) offered in 1972. Gran Torino Squire station wagons had power brakes as standard equipment, but it remained an option for all other models. Further, it was a mandatory option for all {{convert|429|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} powered models. The power steering was completely revised to be integral in the steering box, rather than the external booster style used in previous years. All Torinos used 14-inch wheels, while 15-inch wheels were used for exclusively by police and taxi models.&lt;ref name="Ford Master Parts"&gt;{{cite book|title=1965/1972 Ford Master Parts and Accessories Catalog|publisher=Forel Publishing Company, LLC|location=Woodbridge, Virginia|isbn=1-60371-100-7|page=Section 10, page 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant change to Torino chassis for 1972 was the use of separate wheelbases for 2-doors and 4-doors. Starting in 1968, [[General Motors|GM]] had begun to use a shorter wheelbase for its 2-door intermediates, and a longer one for the 4-doors. This allowed for stylists to make fewer compromises when trying to turn a 2-door into a 4-door. [[Chrysler]] also followed suit in 1971, although its intermediate coupes and sedans didn't even share body panels. The 1972 Torino used a {{convert|114|in|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} wheelbase for 2-doors and a {{convert|118|in|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} wheelbase for 4-doors, station wagons, and the related [[Ford Ranchero|Ranchero]].&lt;ref name="SC1" /&gt; Like GM intermediates, the Torino 2-door and 4-door shared many body panels. Overall, the size and weight for Torino had increased for 1972, following the longer, lower, wider trend.&lt;ref name="SC1"/&gt; Gran Torino sedans saw a {{convert|5|in|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} length increase, while 2-doors had a {{convert|1|in|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} increase in length. Base Torino sedans were only {{convert|1|in|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} longer, and 2-doors were {{convert|3|in|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} shorter than 1971 models. Weight increased significantly for 4-door and station wagon models, while 2-doors had a small increase in weight.

[[File:Ford Gran Torino (5058063411) - 2.jpg|thumb|left|1972 Ford Gran Torino 4-door pillared hardtop]]Interiors were all new and featured an improved instrument panel, that used ABS plastic for much of its construction. The standard instrument cluster featured five equally sized round pods which contained a speedometer, fuel gauge, and temperature gauge, along with various warning lights. The leftmost pod was a vent for the "DirectAire" ventilation system. A clock was optional with the standard instrument package. The "Instrumentation Group", available on all V8 models, featured two large round pods centered on the steering wheel, containing the speedometer (with trip odometer) and a tachometer. A third equal sized pod on the left contained the DirectAire vent. The instrument cluster included an ammeter, fuel gauge, temperature gauge, oil pressure gauge and clock set in a smaller stacked of pods near the centre of the instrument panel. The seats were also new for 1972, the standard front bench seat changed to a high back integrated headrest for the outboard seating positions, but high back bucket seats remained an option on 2-door models. Ford offered "comfort weave" vinyl inserts on the bucket seats for the last time in 1972. An optional 6-way power bench seat, replaced the 4-way seat offered in 1971.

The base engine was the {{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-six engine|inline-six]] in all models except the Gran Torino Squire station wagon and the Gran Torino Sport which used the 302-2V [[Ford 302 Engine|small-block V8]]. The engine options included the 302-2V, a 351-2V ([[Ford Windsor engine#351|"Windsor"]] or [[Ford 335 engine#351 Cleveland|"Cleveland"]]), a 351C-4V [[Ford 335 engine#Q-code (Cobra-Jet)|"Cobra Jet"]] (CJ), a 400-2V, and a 429-4V.&lt;ref name="HMM 1972 Torino" /&gt; The 400-2V was a new engine to the Torino line-up, and was part of the [[Ford 335 engine#400|335 series engine]] family like the 351 Cleveland. The 429-4V was not a high-performance engine like the Cobra Jets of previous years; instead, it was a high torque, low revving engine. Emissions and low-lead fuel requirements had become more strict for 1972. To meet these requirements, compression ratios on all Torino engines were dropped to at least 8.5:1, and all engines ran on regular gasoline. These engines generally produced less power than their predecessors in 1971, although this was exaggerated due to the switch to the new [[Horsepower#SAE net power|SAE net bhp]] ratings from the SAE gross figures used in 1971. As a result, the power loss was not as dramatic as the numbers suggest, and the horsepower figures are not directly comparable. All models came equipped with a three-speed manual transmission as a standard equipment. The Cruise-O-Matic was optional, but was a mandatory option for the 351-2V, 400-2V and 429-4V. The 351-4V CJ required either the 4-speed or the Cruise-O-Matic transmissions as mandatory options.

The only performance engine for 1972 was the 351-4V CJ. The 351-4V CJ offered a number of performance enhancing features not offered on the 1970–71 351C-4V. It included a special intake manifold, modified camshaft, special valve springs and dampers, a 750 CFM [[Motorcraft]] Carburetor, 4-bolt main bearing caps and {{convert|2.5|in|1|abbr=on|adj=on}} dual exhaust. Dual exhaust and the 4-speed transmission option were exclusive to the 351-CJ. A Ram Air Induction system was available briefly during the early model year, and could be equipped on 351 CJ and 429 powered cars.&lt;ref name="HMM 1972 Torino" /&gt; Performance from the 1972 351 CJ was competitive with the 1970-71 Torinos with the high compression 351-4V. ''[[Car and Driver]]'' tested a 351 CJ, 4-speed Gran Torino Sport SportsRoof with 3.50:1 gears to have a 0 - {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} time of 6.8 seconds.&lt;ref name="CD 1972"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Preview: Ford Torino GT|journal=Car and Driver|date=September 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Car and Driver'' did not publish its quarter mile times, but ''Cars'' magazine tested a Gran Torino Sport SportsRoof with a 351 CJ, C-6 automatic, and 3.50 gears to run through the quarter mile in 15.40 seconds.&lt;ref name="Cars 72"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Grand Tourer|journal=High Performance Cars|date=December 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1972 Ford Gran Torino Sport SportsRoof rear.jpg|thumb|left|1972 Ford Gran Torino Sport 2-Door SportsRoof with optional laser stripe and Magnum 500 Wheels]]
The Gran Torino Sport was offered in two body styles: A 2-door formal hardtop and a 2-door SportsRoof. The Gran Torino Sport included an integrated hood scoop, twin colour-keyed racing mirrors, molded plastic door panels unique to the Sport model, body-side and wheel lip [[molding (automotive)|molding]]s, and F70-14 tires (E70-14 on hardtop models). A revised full body length laser stripe was an option for all Torino 2-door models. It replaced the chrome side moldings and was available in four colours to match the exterior paint. Ford offered an option package for the driving enthusiast called the "Rallye Equipment Group." This grouped all the performance options together including the Instrumentation Group, Competition Suspension, G70-14 tires with raised white letters, and a [[Hurst shifter]].&lt;ref name="HMM 1972 Torino" /&gt; The option group came standard with a 351CJ-4V and 4-speed but the 429-4V and the Cruise-O-Matic were optional. The competition suspension was highly regarded by [[Tom McCahill]] of ''Mechanix illustrated'', as well as ''[[Motor Trend]]'' and ''Car and Driver'' as being less harsh than past Torino performance suspensions, while still offering excellent handling.&lt;ref name="McCahill 1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MT Torino Chevelle 1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CD 1972" /&gt; ''Motor Trend'' described the suspension as "Unlike the super heavy-duty springs of years past, the folks at Ford have managed to produce superior ride control without harshness. It takes a ride in one [Torino] to truly appreciate it."&lt;ref name="MT Torino Chevelle 1972" /&gt;

[[File:Ford Gran Torino Front.jpg|thumb|right|1972 Ford Gran Torino Squire Station wagon, with non-stock wheels]]
Torino wagons grew much larger in 1972. Length increased by {{convert|2|in|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} for Torino models, and {{convert|6|in|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} for Gran Torinos. Wheelbase was up by {{convert|4|in|0|abbr=on|adj=on}}, width increased by {{convert|3|in|0|abbr=on|adj=on}}, and weight increased significantly. The extra width allowed Torino station wagons to carry a 4×8' sheet of plywood flat in the cargo area with the tailgate down. Station wagons had a rated capacity of {{convert|83.5|cuft|L|0|abbr=on}}, nearing the capacity of some full-size wagons. An available rear-facing third seat was available, increasing the wagon's capacity from 6 to 8 passengers. All station wagons used the 3-way "Magic Doorgate" featuring for the first time a tailgate that could be opened as a door with the rear window up. A heavy-duty frame was standard equipment for all wagons. The Squire models came standard with a luggage rack and simulated woodgrain panels that were slightly translucent, allowing some of the paint tint to show through.

Torino wagons were often used to tow, but all Torino models could be equipped with one of two optional towing packages. A medium-duty trailer package for Class II towing allowed towing up to {{convert|3500|lb|abbr=on}}. This package included heavy-duty suspension, the extra-cooling package, trailer towing identification sticker and wiring harness. This option group required the 351-2V or larger engine. A heavy-duty Class III package included heavy-duty suspension, heavy-duty frame (standard on wagons), extra cooling package, heavy-duty battery and alternator, along with a 3.25:1 axle and trailer wiring. This package allowed the Torino to tow up to {{convert|6000|lb|abbr=on}} and required the 400-2V or larger engine and G78-14 or larger tires. Both towing packages listed an automatic transmission, power steering and brakes as mandatory options.

Overall, the 1972 Torino was a sales success and a total of 496,645 units were produced,&lt;ref name="SC1"/&gt; making it the best-selling intermediate for 1972. This was the first time Ford had ever outsold the [[Chevrolet Chevelle]] since its 1964 introduction.&lt;ref name="SC1"/&gt;  The automotive press responded positively to the all new Torino, and it received generally positive reviews. In addition, ''Consumer Guide'' selected the Torino as a "Best Buy" for 1972.

The 1972 Ford Gran Torino Sport SportsRoof was featured in the movie ''[[Gran Torino (film)|Gran Torino]]'', directed by and starring [[Clint Eastwood]].

The most obvious change for the 1973 model saw was a new front fascia, required to meet new federal regulations. The new regulation mandated that all cars manufactured after September 1, 1972 must be able to take a {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} strike to the front without damaging safety related components such as headlamps and the fuel system. For 1973 only, rear bumpers had a {{convert|2.5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} requirement. The Torino's front end featured totally new sheetmetal from the firewall forward, with a blunt, more squared-off fascia replacing the previous year's pointed prow. The new large square {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} energy absorbing bumper replaced the almost body-fitting chrome bumper used on the front of the 1972 Torino. The new larger bumpers caused all Torino models to increase in length by at least {{convert|1|in|mm|abbr=on}}, and weight also increased by at least {{convert|100|lb|abbr=on}} for all models. Rear bumpers and taillights were unchanged from 1972.

[[File:1973 Ford Gran Torino LDO.jpg|thumb|left|1973 Ford Gran Torino 2-door hardtop with Luxury Decor Package]]
Separate grille designs were still maintained for Torino and Gran Torino models; they mimicked the 1972s in design. The Gran Torino now had a more rectangular grill with the parking lamps horizontally placed in the grille, but the quad headlights were still surrounded with a chrome bezel. Base Torino models had a wider full width grill that surrounded the headlamps; however, the parking lamps were located on the outer edge of the fascia. The leading edge of the hood was squared off to follow the fascia's lines, and all models shared the same hood. The 1973 Torino used the same rear bumper as the 1972 Torino, and incorporated minor changes to meet the {{convert|2.5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} mandate. Rear bumpers now had new brackets that increased the space between the bumper and the sheetmetal, an impact strip and bumper guards.

The model line-up for 1973 increased to 11 from the 9 models in 1972. The model line-up consisted of "Torino", "Gran Torino", "Gran Torino Sport", and "Gran Torino Brougham." The "Gran Torino Brougham" was available as a 2-door hardtop and a 4-door sedan. Other models were offered in the same body styles as 1972. Bench seats for 1973 reverted to low backs with separate head rests to increase rear visibility. The high back bucket seats were still available on the two-door models. The hood release was moved to inside for increased security. All models used larger {{convert|11|in|mm|0|adj=on}} rear drum brakes for 1973 to help cope with the extra weight; 1972 models used {{convert|10|in|mm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} drums. Radial tires were added to the option list which offered longer tread life and better road manners.

The standard engine remained the 250 CID [[Straight-six engine|inline-six]] for all models except the station wagons and Sport, which used the 302-2V. Engine options also remained the same, but all engines now had their compression ratio dropped to 8.0:1. Power for all engines was slightly lower than in 1972. The 351 CJ continued to be the only high-performance engine and only saw a {{convert|2|hp|abbr=on}} drop from 1972. Police package Torinos had the same engine options as the civilian models but with the addition of a high-performance 460-4V exclusive to the "Interceptor" package.  [[File:1973 Ford Torino 2-dr Hardtop, front left.jpg|thumb|left|1973 Ford Torino 2-door hardtop base model]]

For 1973, Gran Torino Sport had its own unique emblem, which it displayed in the grille and on the trunk lock cover. The laser stripe was revised to a slightly different shape, and ran higher along on the body side. The Sport no longer had a hood scoop, and the Ram Air induction option was gone. The Sport was available as a 2-door SportsRoof or a 2-door hardtop but was otherwise unchanged from the 1972 model year. In the ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine road test of a 1973 Gran Torino Sport, the suspension was noted to be a good balance of comfort and handling. ''Car and Driver'' wrote that the Torino was as "..quiet as a Jaguar, smooth as a Continental, the Torino's ride is exceptional...even with the competition suspension." Their test of a SportsRoof equipped with the 351 CJ, C-6 automatic, and 3.25:1 gears, resulted in a 0 - {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} time of 7.7 seconds while the quarter mile went by in 16.0 seconds at {{convert|88.1|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="CD 1973"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ford Gran Torino Sport|journal=Car and Driver|date=July 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 0 - 60&amp;nbsp;mph time was 0.9 seconds slower than the 1972 model ''Car and Driver'' tested a year before; however, this can partially be attributed to differences in gear ratio, transmission type, and an almost {{convert|350|lb|abbr=on}} increase in weight.&lt;ref name="CD 1972" /&gt; The 1973 Sport had a test weight of {{convert|4308|lb|abbr=on}}, while the 1972 had a test weight of {{convert|3966|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="CD 1973" /&gt; For comparison, in a ''[[Motor Trend]]'' test of a 1970 Torino 2-door equipped with a 351-4V, Cruise-O-Matic, and 3.00:1 gears, they recorded a 0 - {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} time of 8.7 seconds, and a quarter mile time of 16.5 seconds at {{convert|86|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="MT 1970 Road Test"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Torino Road Test|journal=Motor Trend|date=February 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the high compression 1970 motor required premium fuel, while the low compression 1973 motor could run on regular.

The Gran Torino Brougham featured the most premium upholsteries in the Torino line-up, including nylon cloth fabrics and "leather like" vinyl. Standard equipment included a front bench seat with a fold down armrest, woodgrained trim on the instrument panel, deluxe steering wheel, electric clock, bright pedal pad trim, and a dual note horn. The Squire wagon was trimmed similarly to the Brougham. Along the same genre, Ford introduced spring special option group called the Luxury Décor Package, in March 1973. This option package was available on 2-door Gran Torino models and included a white, brown, or green halo vinyl roof with colour-keyed body-side molding pinstripe package, colour keyed rear bumper pad and wheel covers, black sidewall radial tires, flight bench seat in tan super soft vinyl with matching door panels, deluxe 2-spoke steering wheel, wood tone instrument panel applique, dual note horn, 25-oz cut-pile carpet, and upgraded insulation. The Luxury Décor Package was only available with three exterior colours, saddle bronze, medium copper metallic or metallic ivy glow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=C |first1=Vince |title=CC For Sale: 1973 Ford Gran Torino Luxury Décor Package – Torino's Personal Luxury Spring Special |url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-american/cc-for-sale-1973-ford-gran-torino-luxury-decor-package-torinos-personal-luxury-spring-special/ |website=Curbside Classic |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1973 was a successful year for the Torino, with 496,581 units being sold. The sales continued to be strong, even with the stiff competition from GM's new for 1973 "Colonnade" intermediates. Torino was the number one selling intermediate and outsold its main competitor, the [[Chevrolet Chevelle]], by over 168,000 units.&lt;ref name="SC1"/&gt;

The 1974 model year saw more extensive revisions to the Torino line. Government safety regulations now required that the rear bumpers must also meet the {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} standard, so all Torinos had the rear bumper and tail lamp panel redesigned. The new rear bumpers were much larger, square shaped, and sat lower on the body. No longer was there a valance panel located below the bumper as on the 1972–73 models. The tail lights were beveled rectangular wrap-around units which eliminated the need for rear side marker lights. The fuel filler was repositioned above the bumper, hidden behind an access door in the center of the taillight panel. The front fascia for Gran Torinos was revised for 1974. The new grille was of similar shape to the 1973, but was slightly larger and divided into 8 equal sized vertical rectangular sections. The grille had a fine mesh pattern with vertical parking lamps in the outer sections (embossed with the grille pattern on the surface of the lens) and the grille emblem was changed  The front bumper was revised to be slightly more pointed while the bumper guards moved more towards the center of the bumper compared to 1973 models. The license plate bracket was relocated to the driver's side of the bumper. Base Torino models carried on with the same front fascia as 1973; however, its front bumpers were revised similarly to the Gran Torinos except the license plate remained in the center. Gran Torino Broughams had a red reflector panel between the taillamps to give them a full width look. Broughams and Squires had a stand-up hood ornament inplace of the emblem on the grille.

[[File: 1976 Ford Gran Torino Crop.jpg|thumb|left|1974 Ford Gran Torino Elite]]

The Torino model line-up was the same as 1973, with two exceptions. The Gran Torino Sport was no longer available with the "SportsRoof" fastback roofline, and the new [[Ford Elite|"Gran Torino Elite"]] debuted. Although 2-door Torinos were advertised as hardtops, the rear windows were revised to be fixed unlike the 1972–73 models. Ford announced to its dealers in January 1974 that new Gran Torino Elite, Ford's entry in the mid-sized luxury car market, would be available for sale as of the week of February 18, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=For Release January 28th, 1974 - Gran Torino Elite |agency=Ford Motor Company |publisher=Ford Division Public Relations |date=January 28, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Elite was Ford's response to Chevrolet's popular low-priced luxury coupe the [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo|Monte Carlo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flammang|first1=James M.|title=Cars Of The Sensational '70s|date=2000|publisher=Publications International, LTD.|location=Lincolnwood, IL|isbn=0-7853-2980-3}} Page 188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis, McCarville &amp; Sorensen|first1=Auto Editors Of Consumer Guide|title=Ford 1903 to 1984|date=1983|publisher=Publications International, LTD.|location=Skokie, IL|isbn=0-88176-151-6|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ford1903198400sore}} Pages 305 &amp; 312&lt;/ref&gt; The Elite was described by Ford as "A totally new 2-door hardtop...with Thunderbird-inspired styling, solid engineering and personal luxury...plus mid-size economy."  The Elite wasn't totally new, as Ford described, but it did have a number of unique features. The Elite used the [[Mercury Montego#Second generation (1972-1976)|Mercury Montego]] and [[Mercury Cougar#Third generation (1974–1976)|Mercury Cougar]] body shell with unique front end styling that resembled the [[Ford Thunderbird (sixth generation)|Thunderbird]]. It had a large eggcrate mesh grille surrounded by single headlamps recessed in chrome bezels and vertical wrap-around parking lamps. On the rear there was large wrap-around taillamps with a reflective center panel giving it a full width taillight appearance. Large color-keyed vinyl moldings were placed higher on the body side, similar to the Thunderbird. Standard equipment for the Elite included a 351-2V V8 engine, automatic transmission, and radial tires. It also featured standard luxury items such as a vinyl roof with twin opera windows, split bench seat, "Westminster" cloth upholstery, woodgrain trim, and complete instrumentation.

For 1974, Torino added several new luxury oriented options and features including a leather-wrapped steering wheel, split bench seat, an electric sunroof, rear fender skirts, speed control with steering wheel controls and opera windows for 2-doors. Opera windows were added as standard equipment on Brougham models. The exterior trim was revised, with moldings the rocker panels instead of the lower doors. Brougham and Sport models had an extra chrome molding that ran on the lower fender edge between the front wheelwell and bumper; this gave the appearance of bumper-to-bumper chrome. Squires had no lower body moldings. All 1974 Torinos used the seat belt-interlock system, as mandated by the U.S. government. This short-lived safety system would be removed after the 1974 model year. The competition suspension was no longer offered, and the only suspension option was a revised heavy-duty suspension package. This option was available on all Torinos except the Elite, and included a larger front sway bar and heavy-duty front and rear springs. Heavy-duty shocks and a rear sway bar were included in this package on 2-door and 4-door sedan models only.

Torinos were now even larger and heavier than ever before. All body styles were approximately 5" longer due in part to the [[Bumper (car)#United States|safety bumpers]]. With Torinos gaining weight and inches, the 250 CID I-6 was no longer the base engine. Nevertheless, even though original sales literature does not list the six cylinder engine as being available, ''Chilton's'' and ''Motor's'' repair manuals list availability and data for 6-cylinder powered Torinos.  That said, it appears that a small number of base model Torinos were built with the 250 CID 6-cylinder engine;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starskytorino.com/lance/index.html |title=Starsky and Hutch Torinos |publisher=Starskytorino.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in fact one of the 6-cylinder Torinos became the main car for the 2004 movie ''[[Starsky &amp; Hutch (film)|Starsky &amp; Hutch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starskytorino.com/moviemike/moviemike.html |title=Starsky and Hutch Movie Torino |publisher=Starskytorino.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 429-4V was replaced with the 460-4V which produced more power and torque and was equipped with dual exhaust. All other engines saw a slight increase in power levels compared to 1973. Other than the few six cylinder exceptions, all Torinos and Gran Torinos came with the 302-2V as the base engine, and the 3-speed manual remained the standard transmission. The larger V8 engine options required the Cruise-O-Matic as a mandatory option, except the 351-CJ. The 351-CJ remained the only performance engine, and it was limited to 2-door models. It produced more power than the 460-4V, and saw a {{convert|9|hp|abbr=on}} increase but a loss of {{convert|22|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. It was the only engine available with the 4-speed transmission but the more common Cruise-O-Matic was also available. This was the last model year for the 351 CJ and the four-speed transmission.

With the SportsRoof bodystyle discontinued, the Gran Torino Sport model was difficult to distinguish from other Gran Torino 2-doors. The Gran Torino Sport's main identifiers were its unique emblems, with placement on the grille, the C-pillar, and the fuel filler door. In addition, a "Sport" script was placed by the C-pillar emblem. To further remove it from the sporty theme, Gran Torino Sports even had opera windows (on vinyl-roofed cars) and fender skirts added to its option list. Of note, when opera windows were ordered, the "Sport" script was placed below the "Gran Torino" nameplate on the fender and the C-pillar emblem was deleted. The laser stripe was no longer available, but a lower body multi-coloured non-reflective stripe was an option. Higher profile 78 series radial ply tires replaced the previously used 70 series bias-plys.

The interior of the Gran Torino Sport had more distinction from other models. The instrument package became a standard feature, but bucket seats remained an option. Bucket seats were revised to a low back design with separate head rests. Sport door panels, now vinyl rather than molded plastic, and seats were highlighted with coloured stripes, similar to the 1973 Luxury Décor Package interior. As a cost-cutting measure, the "Magnum 500" wheel was revised with the formerly chrome plated wheel replaced by a polished trim ring and argent painted spokes. Overall, performance was more lackluster for 1974 models. The 1974 Sport had a shipping weight almost {{convert|400|lb|abbr=on}} heavier than a 1972 Sport.

Torino had another successful year in 1974, and continued to be popular. Ford produced 426,086 units, including 96,604 Gran Torino Elites.&lt;ref name="SC1"/&gt;

For the 1975 model year, the Ford Torino received a number of minor improvements, but was for the most part unchanged. The model line-up received only one change, the Gran Torino Elite was dropped. The Elite became an independent model, and marketed simply as the [[Ford Elite]]. All Torinos featured solid state ignition systems for 1975, which improved starting performance and fuel economy, while reducing maintenance costs. Radial tires, another fuel saving feature, power steering and power brakes were all new standard features for all Torinos. 1975 Torinos received a new steering wheel design and a "Fuel Sentry" vacuum gauge was added to the option list.

The 1975 model year saw virtually no changes to the exterior styling. The only significant change was that Torino models adopted the Gran Torino grille and front fascia. Torino's weight continued to climb even though the exterior dimensions were unchanged from 1974.

The Federal Clean Air Act caused Ford to install [[catalytic converter]]s for 1975 to help meet new emission standards. The converter significantly reduced the power output of the engines due to increased exhaust back pressure. In response, Ford revised the base engine on all Torinos to the 351-2V engine. Along with this change, the Cruise-O-Matic transmission became standard; no manual transmissions were available. Power for all engines, except the 460, was significantly reduced compared to 1974, and with the weight increase, fuel economy and performance continued to decrease. The 400-2V and the 460-4V were the only engine options, as the 351-4V was no longer available.

The new [[Ford 335 engine#351 Modified|351M]] (Modified) joined the line-up to replace the [[Ford 335 engine#351 Cleveland|351 Cleveland]]. Although, when a Torino was equipped with a 351-2V engine it could result in the car being delivered either the 351M or the 351W, as they were used interchangeably. The 351M and 351W had no appreciable power output difference. Due to the lack of emissions certification, the 351M was not available in California. The 351M used the 400's tall deck block and shared its connecting rods and intake manifold, resulting in more parts shared between 351M and 400 compared to the 351C and 400. This saved Ford on the engine production costs.

The Gran Torino Sport remained but was virtually unchanged from the 1974 model. The Sport was almost indistinguishable from a conventional Gran Torino, and customers responded with a lack of interest. 1975 was the least popular and last year for this model; only 5,126 units were produced.

Sales for Torino's dropped off significantly from the 1974 model year. With the [[Ford Elite|Elite]] now a separate model, Torino lost a large portion of its sales. Ford produced only 195,110 Torino's for 1975. Even with the addition of the 123,372 Elites produced for 1975, total output was 318,482 which was still significantly lower than 1974. Sales decreases were likely due to the increased demand for smaller economical cars, while Ford's more sensibly sized [[Ford Granada (North America)|Granada]] likely also stole sales from Torino. The Ford Granada was classed as a compact by Ford, but had exterior dimensions close to that of a late 1960s Ford Torino.&lt;ref name="SC1"/&gt;

The 1976 model year saw no major changes to the Torino. The Gran Torino Sport was discontinued, and so the Torino consisted of 9 separate models; 2- and 4-door versions of the Torino, Gran Torino, and Gran Torino Brougham, along with three station wagon models. New options for the 1976 model year included a power trunk release and an automatic parking brake release. Gran Torino 2-doors could be ordered with the center console when optional bucket seats were specified; previously the console was only available on Sport models. In addition, opera windows and landau roofs were now available options for all 2-door models. There were no styling changes made to Torino for 1976.

Engine options remained the unchanged for 1976, however fuel economy was improved on all engines with revisions to the engine spark advance and the EGR valve operation. The 351-2V engines and the 400-2V had a power and torque increase, and the 460-4V had a power decrease. In an attempt to help improve fuel economy, the standard rear axle ratio for all models was now 2.75:1.

[[File:Starsky and Hutch Torino.jpg|thumb|left|Starksy and Hutch Replica]]


1975–1976 Gran Torinos were used in the popular [[Spelling-Goldberg Productions]] TV series ''[[Starsky and Hutch]]''. The producers needed a flashy specialty car for the main characters to drive. Since Ford was the lease supplier for on-screen cars through their Studio-TV Car Loan Program, eventually it was decided by the producers that a bright red 1975 Gran Torino two-door would be the vehicle of choice for the pilot episode.&lt;ref name="Fairlaner Starsky"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mannel|first1=Bob|title=1976 Starsky &amp; Hutch Ford Gran Torino|journal=Fairlaner|date=January–February 1996|volume=XVI|issue=1|pages=13–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make the Torino less mundane, a large white vector stripe was added. Aluminum 5-slot mag wheels and larger rear tires replaced the stock wheels and tires, and air shocks were added to give the car an aggressive rake. The television show became quite popular with the public, and much of that popularity was centered on the star Torino. Ford couldn't help but take notice to the public's interest in the "Starsky and Hutch" Torino, and decided to introduce a replica version of the TV car.
Ford built 1,000 replicas of the "Starsky and Hutch" car in the spring of 1976.&lt;ref name="Starsky &amp; Hutch Gran Torino Update"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starskytorino.com/articles/maynard.html |title=Starsky &amp; Hutch Gran Torino Update |publisher=Starskytorino.com |date=1999-09-11 |accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production of the replicas began in March 1976, and all were produced in Ford's Chicago manufacturing plant. This limited production package was essentially a special paint option, but required the deluxe bumper group and dual color-keyed sport mirrors as mandatory options. The TV car's slotted mag wheels were not offered by Ford, and the only sporty wheel option was the Magnum 500 wheel. They were not a mandatory option though, and these cars came equipped with wheel covers as standard equipment. When producing the replicas, Ford painted the entire car white, then masked off the stripe and painted the rest of the car the shade of bright red (code 2B) used on the 1972–75 models (and subsequently the TV cars). This color had been discontinued for all other Torino models for 1976 in favor of a different shade of red.&lt;ref name="Starsky &amp; Hutch Gran Torino Update"/&gt; The factory replicas were close to the TV show car, but had minor differences in the stripe, and did not have the aggressive rake of the TV car. Many replica owners installed slotted mag wheels, and air shocks after purchase to give the car a more authentic look. The "Starsky and Hutch" replica was available with all Torino engines. Seat colors were limited to black or white and were available with all seating trims and options. One of the factory replicas was leased to Spelling-Goldberg as a backup for the original Torinos that were created for the show.

Production total for the Torino in 1976 was 193,096 units, slightly lower than 1975.&lt;ref name="SC2"&gt;{{cite book | last = Flammang | first= James | first2= Ron |last2 = Kowalke | title = The Standard Catalog of American Cars 1976–1999 | publisher = Krause Publications | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-87341-755-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be the final year for the Ford Torino.

The Torino chassis continued to live on under the [[Ford LTD II]], [[Ford Thunderbird#Seventh generation (1977–1979)|Ford Thunderbird]], [[Ford Ranchero]] and [[Mercury Cougar#1977–1979|Mercury Cougar]] through the 1977 to 1979 model years.

[[File:DickTrickle1968Torino.jpg|thumb|left|Dick Trickle's 1968 Torino Stock Car with the aerodynamic "Sportsroof" body]]
The fastback roofline of the 1968-69 Ford Torinos provided a wind-cheating design that dominated [[NASCAR]] superspeedway racing. In 1969 Dodge responded with the [[Dodge Charger (B-body)#Charger 500|Dodge Charger 500]]. This car was built with specific modifications to improve the aerodynamics of the car on the NASCAR track. In turn Ford added a special high-performance vehicle to its intermediate line-up, the [[Ford Torino Talladega|Torino Talladega]]. This limited edition car was made specifically with NASCAR racing in mind and all of its modifications were to improve the aerodynamics of the Torino.

=== Torino Talladega ===

The Torino Talladega was equipped with unique front fascia that extended the length of the car by approximately {{convert|5|in|mm|0}}. This front-end extension allowed Ford engineers to taper the front-end to reduce drag. The grille, which was normally recessed was made to be flush fitting, and the smoother rear bumper was reworked to fit the front. The rocker panels were rolled, which allow NASCAR teams to lower their race Talladegas by 5&amp;nbsp;inches (127&amp;nbsp;mm) legally.

The Talladega came only in the SportsRoof body style and in three colours: Wimbledon White, Royal Maroon, and Presidential blue. All had a flat black hood and a unique beltline pin stripe. The Talladega came standard with a 428 CJ (non-Ram Air), C-6 Cruise-O-Matic, staggered rear shocks (normally reserved for 4-speed cars) and 3.25:1 open differential. Talladegas were equipped with a cloth and vinyl bench seat, and used the Fairlane 500 body code like the 1969 Cobra. These cars could not be ordered with additional options, and only 743 Talladegas were produced.&lt;ref name="Talla "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordfairlane.com/t-story.html|title=Fairlane Registry - 1969 Ford Torino Talladega|accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Talladega further improved Ford's success rate on the NASCAR track. Dodge and Plymouth responded with the even more radical 1969 [[Dodge Charger Daytona]] and the 1970 [[Plymouth Superbird]] which used pointed nose cones and "goalpost" tail wings. Meanwhile, for those racing teams using Fords in 1970, some kept their 1969 Torinos when the new curvaceous 1970 models proved to be slower on the NASCAR track due to its less aerodynamic design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |url=http://musclecars.howstuffworks.com/classic-muscle-cars/1970-ford-king-cobra.htm |title=1970 Ford King Cobra |publisher=howstuffworks.com |date=2007-01-11 |accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Torino King Cobra ===
[[File:Ford Torino King Cobra.jpg|thumb|1970 Torino King Cobra]]
Ford planned to introduce another limited edition Torino to once again dominate at NASCAR. The result was the 1970 Ford Torino King Cobra. Like the Talladega, the King Cobra was modified with aerodynamics specifically in mind and looked very different from a typical 1970 Torino. It had a sloped front end with dual headlamps located in sugar scoop shaped cut-outs on the front fenders, similar in appearance to the [[Datsun 240Z]]. The King Cobra's grille was a large opening below the front bumper, much like the [[bottom breather]] design now used in some modern cars. Parking lamps were located between the headlamps, molded into the front fascia. The hoods had a blacked-out center portion, and a side stripe similar to 1968-69 Torino GTs ran from the front fender to quarter panel. Ford planned to offer covers for the headlight cutouts to NASCAR teams to improve aerodynamics even further.  In actuality it is said the front end created too much down force.  In addition to no rear down force creation this caused the car to become very loose in turns as per Musclecar Review.

Due to NASCAR changing the homologation rules which increased the minimum number of cars produced for the public from 500 to 3,000 for a vehicle to qualify at NASCAR, and new Ford president Lee Iaccoca, the King Cobra project was abandoned by Ford. It never saw a NASCAR track or a showroom and only three prototype cars were produced. One was equipped with the Boss 429 engine, only offered otherwise in the Boss 429 [[Ford Mustang|Mustang]], one had the 429 SCJ, and one had a 429 CJ.&lt;ref name="MCC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myclassiccar.com/MCCTV/2004Season/9007/torino.shtml|title=1970 Ford Torino King Cobra|first=Keith |last=Fudge|accessdate=2007-03-20 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061118170041/http://www.myclassiccar.com/MCCTV/2004Season/9007/torino.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Torino King Cobra with the Boss 429 has been listed on eBay as of 3 May 2014, with a "buy-it-now" price of $599,999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebay.com/itm/Ford-Torino-King-Cobra-1-of-2-bud-moore-owned-torino-king-cobra-boss-429-/121320283794|title=1970 Ford Torino - eBay|website=eBay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1970–71 Torino Cobras, the 1969 Torino Talladega, the 1970 King Cobra, the 1968–1971 Torino GT convertibles, and the 1969 Cobras are the most collectible Torino muscle cars. The 1972 body style has received notable exposure with the release of the 2008 film ''[[Gran Torino (film)|Gran Torino]]'' (featuring a 1972 Gran Torino Sport and [[Clint Eastwood]]) and the 2009 film ''[[Fast &amp; Furious (2009 film)|Fast &amp; Furious]]''.  The 1974–76 body style was popularized due to the 1970s television series ''[[Starsky and Hutch]]'', and revived with the release of the 2004 film ''[[Starsky &amp; Hutch (film)|Starsky &amp; Hutch]]''.  As a result, the value of the 1974–76 Torinos has risen; still they are not the most valuable of the Torino body styles. However, the limited-edition factory replica Torino will likely be a valuable investment due to the series having a longtime cult following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starskytorino.com |title=Starsky and Hutch Torinos |publisher=Starskytorino.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of popularity and the low numbers of Torinos in existence today is likely due to the Torino's durability issues that caused low survivability. Torinos had serious problems with chassis and body corrosion as well as having a less-than-perfect reliability record. In areas where severe winters exposed these cars to road salt, Torinos were reported to have major rust problems within the first 5 years of ownership. To further worsen the corrosion problems, 1969–1973 Torinos were reported to have severe paint-peeling problems. As a result, Torinos had the lowest resale value of any of the American [[mid-size car|intermediate]] cars in the 1970s used-car market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Edmonston |first=Louis-Philippe |title=Canadian Used Car Guide |publisher=Musson |year=1976 |isbn= 978-0-7737-1011-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''mainstream full-sized Ford''' line of cars from '''1960''' to '''1964''' was now complemented by a variety of other [[Ford Motor Company|Fords]], including the [[Ford Thunderbird|Thunderbird]] and compact [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Falcon]], and from 1962 the midsized Fairlane. So the mainline car grew even more, now riding on a 119&amp;nbsp;in (3023&amp;nbsp;mm) wheelbase. The engines were carried over from the [[1959 Ford]], as was the basic chassis design, but the sheetmetal was modern. The retracting [[Ford Skyliner (disambiguation)|Skyliner hardtop]] was gone, though the Sunliner convertible remained, and the [[Ford Fairlane (North American)|Fairlane]] name would last only two years before migrating to a new midsize model.

==1960==
&lt;gallery widths="200px" heights="150px"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The 1960 Ford looked all-new with twin headlights riding in a scalloped-square front clip.  The Fairlane was now the base model in the full-sized lineup, along with the Fairlane 500, Galaxie and range-topping Starliner.&lt;ref name=Gunnell1960&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975, Revised 4th Edition, pages 403–404&lt;/ref&gt; The Station Wagon Series continued with Ranch Wagon, Country Sedan and Country Squire models.&lt;ref name=Gunnell1960/&gt; The elegant Starliner 2-door [[hardtop]] was Ford's choice for [[NASCAR]] racing.  The 1960 fullsize Fords abandoned the ostentatious ornamentation of the 1950s for a futuristic, sleek look.  Round taillights were replaced by half-moon shaped taillights for 1960 only.  There were tailfins still, but smaller ones – the focus of Ford's stylists abandoning, as did the rest of the industry, the aviation influences of the previous decade and instead capturing the new obsession – the [[Space Race]].  The Galaxie name was particularly appealing to this trend, it seems. Windshield wipers were extended to cover more of the windshield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1960_Ford/1960_Ford_Brochure/1960%20Ford-22-23.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1960_Ford/1960_Ford_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford also introduced the center rear fuel door lid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1960_Ford/1960_Ford_Brochure/ |title=Directory Index: Ford/1960_Ford/1960_Ford_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engines offered for 1960 were the 223 cubic inch six and 292 &amp; 352 V8s. With the change in dimensions from 1959, the New York Times described the 1960 full-size Ford as the "longest, lowest, and widest in the fifty-six year history of the Ford Motor Company."&lt;ref&gt;Ingraham, Joseph C. "New Ford to Set Record for Size." New York Times, 25 September 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; The car ran afoul of regulations in many states, where vehicles wider than eighty inches were typically trucks, which had lighting requirements not mandated for passenger cars.&lt;ref&gt;"1931 Statute Requires Truck Lights for New, Wide Cars," Kingsport (TN) Times-News, 25 November 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1961==
[[File:1961 Ford Galaxie Sunliner.jpg|left|thumb|150px|1961 Ford Galaxie Sunliner]]
The scalloped hood was gone for 1961, as the sheetmetal was revised for a cleaner look.  This time, the tailfins were almost gone; replacing them, two giant circular taillights at each rear corner, glowing like an [[afterburner]].  Ford was definitely going with the space and science-fiction theme, and with successful results; this style of Galaxie is widely regarded as a classic.  A new 390&amp;nbsp;CID (6.4&amp;nbsp;L) ''[[Ford FE engine|FE]]'' V8 was added with a claimed 401&amp;nbsp;hp (298&amp;nbsp;kW) gross output in triple-two-barrel [[carburetor]] form. A trunk release button was optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1961_Ford/1961_Fords_Prestige_Brochure/1961%20Fords%20Prestige-22.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1961_Ford/1961_Fords_Prestige_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1962==
[[File:Ford Galaxie Coupe (Byward Auto Classic).jpg|thumb|left|150px|1962 Ford Galaxie]]
With the Fairlane and Fairlane 500 names shifted to a new [[Intermediate car|intermediate-sized]] model range for 1962, the full-size Ford lineup consisted of the Galaxie, new '''Galaxie 500''' and '''Galaxie 500XL''' models and the Station Wagon Series.&lt;ref&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975, Revised 4th Edition, pages 407–409&lt;/ref&gt;  Also new was a 406&amp;nbsp;CID (6.7&amp;nbsp;L) version of Ford's ''[[Ford FE engine|FE]]'' mid-sized V8 rated at 405&amp;nbsp;hp (302&amp;nbsp;kW).  [[Bucket seat]]s were everywhere in 1962 – sold as "The Lively Ones", the XL series added buckets to the Sunliner convertible and hardtop coupe.  The slow-selling Starliner semi-hardtop coupe was cancelled, leaving Ford no choice than to compete in stock car racing with the Club Victoria, which had a formal roofline.  Their top speed was lower than the 1961s because of the inferior aerodynamics.  Trying to come up with a quick solution, Ford attempted to enter the Starlift, which was a Sunliner convertible with a removable roof with a curved roofline similar to the 1960–61 Starliner.  NASCAR banned the Starlift from competition, and few if any were actually produced.  It is said that the windows could not be rolled up on the Starlift when the top was on, as the windows were the stock Sunliner windows which did not fit the roofline.

==1963==
[[File:1963 Ford Galaxie sedan 2 -- 06-05-2010.jpg|left|thumb|150px|1963 Ford Galaxie 500 Sedan]]
[[File:1963_Ford_Galaxie_427.jpg|right|thumb|150px|1963 Ford Galaxie 427 Convertible]]
Ford rolled into 1963 with a [[NASCAR]]-winning Galaxie and a 427&amp;nbsp;CID (7&amp;nbsp;L) ''[[Ford FE engine|FE]]'' V8 sporting either 410&amp;nbsp;hp (306&amp;nbsp;kW) or 425&amp;nbsp;hp (317&amp;nbsp;kW).  A new hardtop coupe body was added to the Galaxie range, and the base model became known as the '''[[Ford 300|300]]'''.

The hardtop coupe sported a lower, fastback roofline and was added mid year to improve looks and make the big cars more competitive on the NASCAR tracks. This 63½ model was called the "Sports Roof" hardtop.

Ford took the 427&amp;nbsp;CID (7.0&amp;nbsp;L) equipped Galaxie to the dragstrip in serious fashion beginning in 1963, building a number of lightweight cars just for that purpose. They featured fiberglass fenders, doors, trunklid and aluminum bumpers.  Rated conservatively at 425&amp;nbsp;hp (317&amp;nbsp;kW), this engine also featured in [[Carroll Shelby]]'s final incarnation of the [[AC Cobra]].

The Ranch Wagon name was transferred to the Ford Fairlane range for 1963, leaving only the Country Sedan and Country Squire models in the full-size Ford Station Wagon Series.&lt;ref&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975, Revised 4th Edition, pages 410–411&lt;/ref&gt;

==1964==
[[File:1964 Ford Galaxies.jpg|left|thumb|150px|1964 Ford Galaxies]]
The final year of the 1960 full-size Fords was 1964, with the 300 base model again using the '''Custom''' name.  The base Galaxie was now called "Custom 500."  The Sports Roof was continued for all hardtop coupes.  In addition, new sloped rooflines were introduced for all non-wagon '64 big Fords.  Interior trim was new, including new thin-shell bucket seats for all XL models.  The instrument panel remained the same, except for the ignition switch, which was moved from left of the steering column, to the right.  External styling was once again refreshed, with a more sculptured body that was supposed to reduce drag at high speeds, no doubt done for NASCAR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1964_Ford/1964_Ford_Brochure_1/1964%20Ford-All-07.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1964_Ford/1964_Ford_Brochure_1 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the hood, the 427&amp;nbsp;CID (7.0&amp;nbsp;L) engine carried on the high performance duties.  Ford again took the 427-equipped Galaxie to the racetracks in serious fashion in 1964, building a number of lightweight, fiberglass equipped cars just for that purpose.  These competed with success not only in North America but also in the United Kingdom.  Initial doubts as to their competitiveness in Britain were short-lived; despite their great size and weight compared to the opposition, the Ford 427 engine gave them a competitive power-to-weight ratio and the handling was better than might have been supposed.  They were raced in Europe reasonably successfully.

Late in the year Ford introduced their new engine challenger, the [[SOHC]] ''[[Ford FE engine#427 SOHC|427 Cammer]]'', Though it is not documented it is believed a few may have found their way onto the street. (This engine was only available to racers through the dealer network or from the manufacturer, none were ever factory installed)  Rated at over 600&amp;nbsp;hp (447&amp;nbsp;kW), this is possibly the most powerful engine ever fitted to a production car by an American manufacturer.  [[NASCAR]] changed the rules, however, requiring (instead of hundreds) thousands of production examples in service to qualify for the next season, and Ford decided against producing the Cammer in that quantity.  Fears of liability concerns and the bad publicity possibilities in giving the public a car that was so dangerously powerful are often cited as reasons, but it might simply have been that Ford doubted that an engine so unsuited to street use could sell in such numbers.

The 1964s represent a high point in early 1960s Ford quality, durability, and styling.  They were not only enormously popular, but proved to be so durable that many continued to run well past the 100,000 mile mark without a major overhaul.  [[Holman &amp; Moody]] continued to supply high-performance equipment for the big '64 Fords, giving them wins at NASCAR.

The '''Ford Edge''' is a range of [[crossover SUV|crossover SUVs]] manufactured by the [[Ford Motor Company]].  Introduced for the 2007 model year, the Edge is the first CUV marketed by Ford in North America; the model line is currently in its second generation.  Deriving its name from a trim package of the [[Ford Ranger (Americas)|Ford Ranger]], the Ford Edge is slotted between the [[Ford Escape]] and the [[Ford Explorer]] within the Ford product line.  

Sharing its underpinnings with the [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion sedan]], Ford has also produced the model line as the [[Lincoln MKX]] (since 2019, the Lincoln Nautilus); the first generation was also produced as the [[Mazda CX-9]].  The second-generation is also marketed by [[Ford of Europe]], slotted between the Kuga (Escape) and the Explorer PHEV.  

All production of the Ford Edge is sourced from [[Ford Motor Company of Canada|Ford of Canada]] at [[Oakville Assembly]] ([[Oakville, Ontario]]) alongside the Lincoln Nautilus.

Ford Canada announced in June 2007, that a gasoline-electric hybrid version of the Edge was to debut in the 2010 model year. The model was expected to use a new hybrid system from Ford, pairing an electric motor with a [[V6 engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/Business/article/228210 |title=Ford hybrid plans unclear after 2008 |newspaper=The Star |location=Toronto |date=2007-06-22 |accessdate=2018-03-23 |first=Tony |last=Van Alphen |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007031404/http://www.thestar.com/Business/article/228210 |archivedate=2012-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2015, the Ford Edge was redesigned with a new Taurus and Explorer-like grille, new headlights, LED combination taillights, increased interior room, and a rear-view camera. This generation of the Edge comes with a standard EcoBoost engine, the all-new 2.0L (only the displacement and bore-center spacing carry over), which has a new twin-scroll turbo to boost low-end torque figures. Unlike the previous 2.0L EcoBoost, the 2015 generation has a towing capacity of 3500 pounds and is available with all-wheel drive. Mid-spec engine is a 3.5L V6, with slightly reduced power output. The highest engine in the range, powering Sport models, is the new 2.7L twin-turbo EcoBoost V6.

For the first time, Ford markets the Edge in European markets (as part of the company's "One Ford" strategy); it sits above the [[Ford Kuga]]. Gasoline engines are not sold in Europe; instead this market receives a pair of turbo-charged Duratorq diesel engines as used in other Ford Europe products such as the [[Ford Mondeo]]. Both engines are mated to an all-wheel drive system as standard; there is no option for two-wheel drive. The two engines are rated at 180&amp;nbsp;hp and 210&amp;nbsp;hp. Which output the customer receives is entirely dependent on the transmission choice, with a 6-speed manual as standard mated to the 180&amp;nbsp;hp unit. A 6-speed [[PowerShift]] [[dual-clutch transmission]] automatic option is available, mated to the 210&amp;nbsp;hp unit.

In January 2018, Ford announced that the entire Edge lineup (alongside the Lincoln MKX's renaming) will receive a mid-cycle facelift for 2019, which replaces the existing Ford three-bar front grille with a front grille design similar to the larger [[Ford Explorer]], new aluminum-alloy wheel options for each trim level, new exterior and interior color combinations, and a 12-speaker [[Bang &amp; Olufsen|B&amp;O]] Play surround-sound system that replaces the existing [[Sony]] system. All models receive a newly designed Ford 8F35 eight-speed automatic transmission (featuring automatic stop-start technology), which also allows the base 2.0&amp;nbsp;L EcoBoost turbocharged inline four-cylinder (I4) engine to gain a {{convert|5|hp|adj=on}} boost, and all Edges to achieve improved [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]]

Ford also announced that a new model of Edge, the ST, would be offered instead of the Sport as the top trim level for the line.  It will feature a 2.7&amp;nbsp;L [[EcoBoost]] twin turbocharged V6 engine producing {{convert|335|hp}}, a modest {{convert|20|hp}} increase over the 2018 Sport, which used the same engine. ST styling will include as a dark-finished mesh front grille, aluminum-alloy wheels, and unique interior.

With the launch of the 2018 model in Australia and New Zealand, the Edge is sold as the '''Ford Endura''' and is the successor to the Ford Territory.&lt;ref name="NE"&gt;https://www.aa.co.nz/cars/motoring-blog/ford-endura-2018-confirmed-as-territory-successor/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-news/ford-endura-2018-pricing-and-specs-confirmed-71306&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the Endura was made available in Trend, ST and Titanium trim levels.&lt;ref&gt;https://practicalmotoring.com.au/car-news/ford-endura-price-specs-and-release-date/&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2019 Ford Edge will be offered in nine exterior colors, some of which are new for 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ford.com/suvs-crossovers/edge/2019/?gnav=header-all-vehicles |title=All-New 2019 Ford Edge SUV Coming Soon |website=www.ford.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112214702/https://www.ford.com/suvs-crossovers/edge/2019/?gnav=header-all-vehicles |archivedate=2018-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the 2019 Edge will offer three new safety technologies:

* Post-collision braking: Automatically applies brake pressure when a collision event is detected.
* Evasive steering assist: Assists drivers in steering around stopped or slower vehicles in order to avoid a possible collision.
* Adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go [[lane centering]]: Allows the vehicle to maintain a comfortable driving distance and helps reduce stress during longer drives.

The 2019 Edge made its debut at the 2018 [[North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]], Michigan, and will go on sale in the spring of 2018 as an early 2019 [[model year]] vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pr |url=https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/01/11/ford-drives-all-new-edge-st-into-showrooms.html |title=Revving Up: Ford Drives New Edge ST into Showrooms, Accelerating its SUV Sales Momentum |date=January 11, 2018 |website=media.ford.com |accessdate=March 23, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114205546/https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/01/11/ford-drives-all-new-edge-st-into-showrooms.html |archivedate=January 14, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''1949 Ford''' was an [[United States of America|American]] automobile produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. It was the first all-new automobile design introduced by the [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]] after [[World War II]], civilian production having been suspended during the war, and the 1946-1948 models from Ford, GM, and Chrysler being updates of their pre-war models. Popularly called the "Shoebox Ford" for its slab-sided, "[[Ponton (automobile)|ponton]]" design, the 1949 Ford is credited both with saving Ford and ushering in modern streamlined car design with changes such as integrated fenders and more. This design would continue through the 1951 model year, with an updated design offered in [[1952 Ford|1952]]. The crest was designed by [[Frank L. Engle]].&lt;ref name="andalusiastarnewsfordcrest"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Ford Crest |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/537979139/?terms=%22Frank%2BL.%2BEngle%22 |accessdate=February 29, 2020 |work=The Andalusia Star-News |location=Andalusia, Alabama |date=February 1, 1951|page=7|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After sticking with [[1941 Ford|its well-received previous model]] through model year 1948, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] completely redesigned its namesake [[Automobile|car]] for the year 1949. Save for its drive-train, this was an all-new car in every way, with a modern [[ladder frame]] now supporting a [[coil spring]] independent suspension in front and longitudinal [[leaf spring|semi-elliptical spring]]s in back.  The engine was moved forward to make more room in the passenger compartment and the antiquated "[[torque tube]]"  was replaced by a modern [[drive shaft]].  Ford's popular 226&amp;nbsp;[[Cubic inch displacement|CID]] (3.7&amp;nbsp;L) ''[[Ford Straight-6 engine|L-head]]'' [[straight-6]] and 239&amp;nbsp;CID (3.9&amp;nbsp;L) ''[[Ford Flathead engine|Flathead]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] remained, now rated at 90&amp;nbsp;hp (67&amp;nbsp;kW) and 100&amp;nbsp;hp (75&amp;nbsp;kW), respectively.

==1949==
The 1949 models debuted at a gala at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in New York City in June 1948, with a carousel of the new Fords complemented by a revolving demonstration of the new chassis.  The new integrated steel structure was advertised as a "lifeguard body", and even the woody wagon was steel at heart.  The convertible frame had an "X member" for structural rigidity.
  
From a customer's perspective, the old Custom, De Luxe, and Super De Luxe lines were replaced by new Standard and Custom trims and the cars gained a modern look with completely integrated rear fenders and just a hint of a fender in front. The new styling approach was also evident in the 1949 [[Mercury Eight]] and the all-new [[Lincoln Cosmopolitian|Lincoln Cosmopolitan]]. The styling was influential on many European manufacturers, such as Mercedes Benz, [[Borgward]], [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]], [[Volvo]] and many others. The all new 1949 Ford was said at the time to be the car that saved the Ford Corporation. Competition from GMH was surpassing the Old Ford designs. In some ways the vehicle was rushed into production, particularly the door mechanism design. It was said that the doors could fling open on corners. In the 1950 model there were some 10 changes in the door latching mechanism alone.

All wagons received flat-folding middle seats at mid-year, an innovation that would reappear in the [[minivan]]s of the 1990s.  The 1949 and 1950 styling was similar, with a single central "bullet" in the frowning chrome grille.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=the Auto Editors of Consumer Guide |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1949-ford7.htm |title=HowStuffWorks "1949 Ford Spinner Grille" |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=2007-09-24 |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the center there was a red space that had either a 6 or 8 depending if the car had the six-cylinder engine or the V8.&lt;ref name="American Cars" /&gt; The trim lines were renamed as well, with "Standard" becoming "Deluxe" and "Custom" renamed "Custom Deluxe".

The '''Ford Probe''' was a [[hatchback#liftback|liftback]] [[coupé]] produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], introduced in 1988 and produced until 1997. The Probe was the result of Ford's collaboration with its longtime Japanese partner, [[Mazda]], and both generations of Probe were derived from the front-wheel drive [[Mazda G platform]] that underpinned the [[Mazda Capella]].

The Probe succeeded the [[Ford EXP]], and the instrument cluster of the first-generation Probe and pop-up headlight mechanisms were borrowed from the [[Mazda RX-7|FC RX-7]].

Based on the [[Mazda MX-6]] as a sport compact [[coupé|coupe]], the Probe was intended to fill the market niche formerly occupied by the [[Ford Capri|Capri]] in Europe, and it was originally intended to be the fourth generation [[Ford Mustang]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; in the North American market as a direct competitor with the [[Honda Integra|Acura Integra]], [[Nissan 200SX]], and the [[Toyota Celica]]. During that time, Ford's marketing team had deemed that a [[front-wheel drive]] platform (borrowed [[Mazda G platform|Mazda GD and GE platforms]]) would have lower costs for production, and also because the platform had been gaining popularity with consumers.

Mustang fans objected to the [[front-wheel drive]] configuration, [[Japan]]ese engineering, and lack of a [[V8 engine|V8]], so Ford began work on a new design for the Mustang instead. On March 17, 1997, Ford announced the discontinuation of the Probe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.performanceprobe.com/text/info/history.htm |title=Probe History |publisher=Performanceprobe.com |date=March 17, 1997 |accessdate=June 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207112708/http://www.performanceprobe.com/text/info/history.htm |archivedate=February 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Starting in the late 1970s, Ford and [[Carrozzeria Ghia|Ghia]] started exploring a series of futuristic designs with the "Probe" series of [[concept car|concept vehicle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080705143355/http://www.aus-cartalk.com/probe/history.htm History of the Ford PROBE, Concept Cars]&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Probe I''', first shown in 1979, was a wedge-shaped design that incorporated a number of drag-reducing features like covered rear wheels and pop-up headlights. This was followed the next year by a much more conventional looking '''Probe II''', whose [[hatchback]] styling was also reminiscent of the [[pony car]]s. The 1981 '''Probe III''' was an advanced demonstrator with covered wheels, but its bodywork evolved into the more conventional [[Ford Sierra]] (or [[Merkur XR4Ti]]) and styling notes that were used on the [[Ford Taurus (first generation)|Ford Taurus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=mojo1961 |url=http://www.carstyling.ru/en/cars.1981_Ford_Probe%20III.html |title=1981 Ford Probe III |publisher=Carstyling.ru |date=May 2, 2010 |accessdate=July 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1983 '''Probe IV''' was a more radical concept car with a low Cd ([[drag coefficient]]), and evolved into the equally radical 1985 '''Probe V'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sergio |url=http://www.carstyling.ru/en/cars.1985_Ford_Probe%20V.html |title=1985 Ford Probe V (Ghia) |publisher=Carstyling.ru |date=June 10, 2008 |accessdate=July 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[1979 energy crisis]], the economic slump initiated by high fuel prices prompted [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] to give the [[Ford Mustang]] a major redesign. The new design would be based on a totally new platform introduced to Ford by Japanese automaker [[Mazda]], who had been partnering with Ford since 1971, and whom Ford had owned a 25% stake in since 1979. Toshi Saito, a North American-based designer working for Ford, took the lead in envisioning styling directions for the front-wheel drive Mustang, and a design by Saito was chosen and finalized in late 1983. The project was then transferred to Mazda in Hiroshima, Japan and in internal Ford parlance, was referred to by the codename "SN-16".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosa|first1=Mike|title=Design Notes: 1989 Ford Probe|url=http://autosofinterest.com/2012/10/20/design-notes-1988-ford-probe/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended to gradually phase out the RWD Fox platform Mustang under the name "Mustang Classic" and have it eventually supplanted by the SN-16 as the "Mustang."

By 1985, Mazda acquired the former Ford [[Flat Rock Assembly Plant]] in [[Flat Rock, Michigan]] and intended to commence production of the two Mazda-badged GD platform cars for North America, the 626 along with the MX-6, and the SN-16, contracted by Ford, in 1987.

Christopher Sawyer, writing for [[AutoWeek]] magazine, in their issue for April 13, 1987, was the first to publicly reveal the existence of the SN-16 Mustang in a sensational report that featured an artist rendering on the issue's cover of a vehicle nearly identical to what would be released as the 1989 Ford Probe GT stating "Exclusive: The '89 Mustang," along with detailed technical reports about its Mazda origins and switch to front-wheel drive. The public outcry was immediate, with many Mustang fans and [[pony car]] purists detesting the SN-16's Japanese engineering, front-wheel drive platform and lack of a V8 engine, which were anathema to traditional Mustang buyers and enthusiasts. Ford Motor Company executives, along with many car magazines received strongly-worded letters of criticism decrying the decision.

Neil Ressler, the then-chief of small car engineering at Ford, spoke about the internal cultural differences at Ford Motor Company which led to a strong disagreement between two factions that had radically different notions about what the Mustang should be:

{{cquote|This idea came forth that we would replace the Mustang with this front-drive car, the ST-16. There were a lot of people who thought that was a great idea—a modern car. There were also a lot of us who were appalled by that. It was like the champagne sipping crowd replaced the beer drinking crowd. The idea that we would replace the Mustang with a Japanese car—a different car from a different culture aimed at a different audience—this is not going to work.}}

By 1987, [[Alex Trotman]], the newly-appointed vice president in charge of Ford's North American operations, with strong urging from Ford Marketing vice president Bob Rewey, a dedicated performance enthusiast, decided that in the light of consumer outrage, the SN-16 would not make a suitable Mustang. At this point, somewhat ironically, Mustang sales, which were lackluster, grew substantially after the article's publication, out of fear that it would be the last opportunity to purchase a traditional RWD V8 Mustang. While Trotman approved the development of a RWD successor, there were many difficulties, notably that the engineering budget for the Mustang was spent on the SN-16 and Ford was still recovering from a financial crisis of the early 1980s that brought the company close to bankruptcy until the [[Ford Taurus|Taurus]] arrived.

[[John Coletti]], Ford's small-car engineering manager and a vociferous opponent of the SN-16 Mustang, said of the project, "I would rather have seen the Mustang name die than put the Mustang name on the Probe&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pierce|first1=Benjamin|title=How Ford Almost Ruined the Mustang|url=https://blog.americanmuscle.com/2016/10/20/how-ford-almost-ruined-the-mustang/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ken Dabrowski, Ford's small-car line manager, tapped Coletti to lead a [[Skunkworks project|skunkworks team]] that would develop a RWD Mustang successor with the understanding there would not be a full budget to create an entirely new car. Coletti's team heavily revised the 1979 [[Ford Fox platform|Fox platform]] for the new car, which eventually became the [[Ford Mustang (fourth generation)|fourth-generation Ford Mustang]] released for the 1994 model year.

However, production for the SN-16 was about to commence, meaning Ford had to put it on sale or lose its development budget along with further potential financial headaches if Ford would break its production contract with Mazda. It was decided that the SN-16 would be released as the '''Ford Probe''' in 1988, taking the name from Ford's line of futuristic concept vehicles, and be sold alongside the Mustang, which would continue production in its then-current form with minor refreshing. Instead of being aimed as a successor to the Mustang or as a rival to its traditional competitors, the [[Chevrolet Camaro]] and [[Pontiac Firebird]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wernle|first1=Bradford|title=How Ford's pony car survived a brush with death|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20140411/OEM03/304149994/how-fords-pony-car-survived-a-brush-with-death|website=[[Automotive News]]|accessdate=March 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford would aim the Probe against popular imported sports coupes of the era such as the [[Toyota Celica]] and [[Honda Prelude]].

Both generations of the Probe were sold in Japan as Fords, at Ford/Mazda sales channels called Autorama. Japanese models were not in compliance with Japanese Government regulations concerning [[vehicle size class#Japan|exterior dimensions and engine displacement]], resulting in Japanese buyers being held liable for additional taxes as a result.

The Probe was a sales success in its first model year, owing to its futuristic styling and enjoyable driving experience. In fact, demand exceeded supply in 1988, enough that buyers were paying list price or higher for a Probe, and Jim Mateja, the automotive columnist for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', urged potential Probe buyers who couldn't find a Probe to consider its sibling, the Mazda MX-6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mateja|first1=Jim|title=If You Can`t Find A Ford Probe, Try Its Cousin: Mazda`s Mx-6|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-08-21/business/8801240496_1_probe-gt-mazda-mx-6-probe-gl|website=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales of the first-generation Probe were successful enough that Ford partnered with Mazda again, with further Ford engineering from the beginning of the project, to create a second-generation Probe for the 1993 model year developed alongside a second-generation Mazda MX-6. A proposed third-generation Probe, which would have been based on the [[Ford Mondeo]] instead of being Mazda-derived, was eventually released as the 1999 [[Ford Cougar|Mercury Cougar]] in the North American market to strengthen the Mercury brand. However, it is important to note that Ford in North America considered the Escort-based [[Ford ZX2|ZX2]] the official successor to the Probe and not the Cougar. After disappointing sales of the Cougar and the waning popularity of front-wheel drive sport coupes in the late 1990s in favor of [[sport utility vehicle]]s, Ford left the market segment with the 2002 discontinuation of the Cougar, and the 2003 discontinuation of the ZX2.

The first generation Ford Probe was based on the [[Mazda G platform|Mazda GD platform]], and was powered by a 2.2&amp;nbsp;L SOHC 4-cylinder [[Mazda F engine#F2|Mazda F2 engine]]. It debuted in 1988 for the 1989 model year and was produced until 1992 in the United States. The Probe was available in several trim levels that differ depending on the market in which the vehicle was sold. In the [[United States]], the Probe was available in GL, LX, and GT trim levels:&lt;ref name="Mon896"&gt;{{cite journal | ref=MA896 | journal=Le Moniteur de l'Automobile | page= 120 | title= Ford Probe: La Maztang |trans-title=Ford Probe: the MazTang | last= Geenen | first= Bernard | location=Brussels, Belgium | language=French | volume=3 | number= 896 | date=March 31, 1988 | publisher=Editions Auto-Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The GL was the base model with the {{Convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}/{{convert|130|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} F2 2.2&amp;nbsp;L engine and few options. Most Probes sold in the United States were equipped with air conditioning.
* The LX added options for power locks, power windows, electrically adjusted exterior mirrors, a storage tray underneath the front passenger seat, as well as an optional flip-up moon roof. Starting in 1990, the LX was available with the 3.0&amp;nbsp;L "Vulcan" [[V6 engine]], that was also used in the [[Ford Taurus]], [[Ford Ranger]], [[Ford Tempo]], and [[Ford Aerostar]]. The LX package offered optional equipment, such as a single-disc CD player, and a [[Electronic instrument cluster|digital instrument cluster]] coupled with a fuel economy computer installed in a hidden compartment on top of the center dashboard air conditioning vents.
* The GT included all the equipment of the LX, but featured the F2T 2.2&amp;nbsp;L [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]], intercooled engine that produced {{Convert|145|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|190|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. It came with an IHI RHB5-VJ11 turbocharger and an intercooler to the intake tract, as well as a knock sensor and electronic boost controller to the engine-control system. The boost pressure was {{convert|7.3|psi|bar|abbr=on}} in the vicinity of 2,500 rpm. The GT version also came with 4-wheel disc brakes with [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], a 3-way adjustable suspension utilizing variable damping shocks, and a speed-sensitive variable-assist power steering (VAP). The Probe GT's suspension system was based on a Mazda design, but its tuning was different and included nitrogen-gas pressurized front and rear struts, with stabilizer bars.

The 1991 Probe was given a 4-star crash rating in collision tests conducted by the U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]].&lt;ref name="NHTSA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safercar.gov/Cars/1125.html|title=NHTSA|accessdate=February 29, 2008|work=safercar.gov}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ford and Mazda design teams merged once again to give the Ford Probe a complete redesign for the 1993 model year. As before, the Probe was to share its under-structure with Mazda's MX-6 and 626. Mazda engineered the engine, transmission, and chassis, while Ford engineered the body and interior. Technically, the second generation Probe is 60% Mazda and 40% Ford. Despite the car being extended 2&amp;nbsp;inches and widened 4&amp;nbsp;inches, it was 125 pounds lighter than the first generation Probe. The second generation Probe was introduced in August 1992 as a 1993 model. As first planned during 1992, it finally went on sale in [[Europe]] in the spring of 1994, filling the gap left there by Ford in that market sector since the demise of the [[Ford Capri|Capri]] seven years earlier. The Capri had regularly been one of Britain's 10 best selling cars throughout the 1970s, but its popularity declined in the early 1980s as Ford launched high performance versions of the [[Ford Fiesta|Fiesta]], [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Escort]] and [[Ford Sierra|Sierra]] hatchbacks. Such was the falling demand for this type of car that by 1986, when the end of Capri production was announced, Ford decided against launching a direct replacement.

The second-generation Probe was designed by a team led by Mimi Vandermolen, who led the interior design of the 1986 [[Ford Taurus]]. In 1987, Vandermolen became the first female designer to be the design executive of small cars for an automobile manufacturer, and Vandermolen designed the Probe to improve the driving experience for women, stating "If I can solve all the problems inherent in operating a vehicle for a woman, that'll make it that much easier for a man to use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Veit|first1=Rebecca|title=Mimi Vandermolen, the Ergonomics Genius Behind Ford's “Rounded Edge Revolution”|url=http://www.core77.com/posts/39532/Mimi-Vandermolen-the-Ergonomics-Genius-Behind-Fords-Rounded-Edge-Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the late 1980s and early 1990s saw the sales of affordable sports cars recover, first with a rising demand for [[Japan]]ese built models like the [[Honda Prelude]], [[Nissan Silvia]], [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]], and [[Toyota Celica]], and then with the [[Volkswagen Corrado]] and the [[Opel Calibra|Vauxhall/Opel Calibra]] from Ford's direct competitor [[General Motors]]. By 1992, Ford had decided that there was now justifiable demand in Europe for a new affordable sports coupe to be launched.

Ford had been hoping to sell around 20,000 Probes each year in Britain as the car market recovered from the effects of the [[Early 1990s recession|recession]] from 1992, but in the three years it was sold there, a total of just over 15,000 were sold - around a quarter of the projected figure for that length of time. Imports ceased during 1997, and its [[Ford Cougar|Cougar]] successor - launched a year later - was even less successful, being imported to Europe for just two years.

By February 2016, just 718 examples of the Probe were still in use in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msn.com/en-gb/cars/enthusiasts/100-popular-cars-vanishing-from-our-roads/ss-BBpikzO#image=23]&lt;/ref&gt;

The base model started at just over US $13,000 and came standard with the 2.0L Mazda FS-DE 16-valve 4-cylinder engine, performance instrument cluster with tachometer and full gauge complement, and an electronic AM/FM stereo. The sportier GT model started at $15,504&lt;ref name="Driver 1992, Pages 32-37"&gt;Car and Driver, August 1992, Vol.38 No.2, Pages 32-37&lt;/ref&gt; and came standard with the 2.5L [[Mazda K engine]] KL-DE 24-valve V6, low profile P225/50VR16 91V Goodyear VR50 Gatorback tires, 4-wheel disc brakes, unique front and rear fascias, fog lights, 5-spoke aluminum wheels, leather-wrapped steering wheel, and driver-seat power lumbar/seat back side bolster adjustment. Both engines featured dual overhead cam designs with the choice of a 5-speed [[manual transmission]] or a 4-speed automatic transmission.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ford original sales brochure, Litho in Canada 4/92, Pages 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[automatic transmission]]s were available in the Probe. At first both engines shared the same automatic transmission, the [[Ford F-4EAT transmission]], but from 1994 onwards this changed.  The [[V6 engine]] continued to use the 4EAT, but the 2.0&amp;nbsp;L I4 engine used a different automatic transmission, the [[Ford CD4E transmission]]. It was sourced by Ford, and manufactured at Ford's [[Batavia Transmission]] plant in Batavia, Ohio.&lt;ref name="A-Team"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atxprobes.com/atxinfo.html|title=ATX Info|accessdate=February 28, 2008|work=atxprobes.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040904120713/http://atxprobes.com/atxinfo.html|archive-date=September 4, 2004|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new SE (Sport Edition) trim level was available for 1995 and 1996. It included the GT front fascia (without fog lamps), unique {{convert|15|in|mm|adj=on}} aluminum wheels, P205/55R15 BSW and Sport Edition "SE" nomenclature.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Ford original sales brochure, Litho in Canada 9/93, Page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In a coast to coast road test by Automobile Magazine in search of the best cars in the world, the Probe GT scored third place, behind an $80,000 Mercedes-Benz and an $80,000 BMW. In the article, the Probe listed at about $15,000.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Special editions===
For 1993 and 1994, Ford offered a "SE" appearance package on the base model Probe. The package offered 3 spoke swirl-style alloy wheels, the GT model's ground effects, and the GT model's front bumper. Unlike the base, you were able to opt for power windows and mirrors on the SE package. Appearance wise, the only noticeable differences from the GT model were the wheels, "SE" nomenclature, rear bumper w/o air slot and lack of fog lights. "SE" was an appearance package and not an actual model or trim level. "SE" became a trim level in 1995 and was the middle grade model in the Probe lineup ahead of the base but behind the GT.

In 1994, Ford released a limited edition of the Probe, marketed as the Probe "Feature Car", but officially called the "GT Plus" package. This special package is better known to the general public and enthusiast community as the Probe "Wild Orchid Edition". Included on this limited appearance package was Wild Orchid exterior paint, "PROBE" badge on floor mats outlined in Wild Orchid, black cloth bucket seats with unique Wild Orchid inserts, and the "PROBE" badge on the rear outlined in Wild Orchid. This package was offered in 1994 only, and was exclusive to GT models. After dropping the Probe Feature Car after only a year of production, Ford carried over the Wild Orchid exterior color for the 1995 model year which was available on all Probe models.

In 1997, a "GTS" package was offered on the Probe GT. It was essentially nothing more than an appearance package, as performance was identical to the GT, but differences with the exterior were distinct. Dual racing stripes available in either white or black started at the top edge of the front bumper and continued on to the back lip of the hatch, terminating just below the center light reflector on the rear bumper. A chrome plated version of the GT's directional "swirlie" wheels and a spoiler were also included in the package, as well as having a "blank" center reflector which lacked "GT" lettering as the regular GT models have. The "GTS" was an appearance package and not an actual model or trim level. Very few Probes were produced with the GTS package and are considered today to be extremely rare.

== Proposed third generation ==
The last Probe was built on June 20, 1997. A third-generation model, using the same platform as the [[Ford Contour]], was under development intended for release in mid-1998 as a 1999 model. When Ford decided to discontinue the Probe, this new design became the next-generation [[Mercury Cougar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hemmings.com/blog/2013/05/16/cars-of-futures-past-ford-probe/ |title=Cars of Futures Past – Ford Probe |last=Ernst |first=Kurt |work=Hemmings Daily |publisher=American City Business Journals |date=May 16, 2013 |accessdate=August 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name change was intended to attract younger buyers into Mercury showrooms, but this proved unsuccessful.{{fact|date=August 2019}} The [[Escort ZX2]], released shortly after the discontinuation of the Probe, was considered the Probe's successor. In June 1998, Ford released what would have been the new Probe as the [[Mercury Cougar#Eighth generation .281999.E2.80.932002.29|1999 Mercury Cougar]].

=== Awards ===
The Probe ''GT'' was ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Car of the Year]] for 1993. It also made ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 1989, 1993, and 1994.

The ''[[NASCAR Dash Series]]'' version of a 1990 Ford Probe driven by [[Jeffrey Collier]] set a new track record at ''[[Daytona International Speedway]]'' February 13, 1990 with a speed of 166.553&amp;nbsp;mph. That record still stands as the fastest closed course lap for a non-turbo 4-cylinder powered car.

In 1986, [[Ford Motor Company]] expanded its agricultural holdings when it purchased the Sperry-New Holland implement line from [[Sperry Corporation]], and named their agricultural division Ford New Holland Inc. The following year, [[Versatile (company)|Versatile]] was purchased, giving Ford a complete agricultural lineup. In 1988 [[Ford Motor Company]] sold 80% of Ford-New Holland Inc. to [[Fiat]], and in 1991 Fiat acquired the remaining 20%, with the agreement to stop using the Ford brand by 2000. By 1999, [[Fiat]] had discontinued the use of both its own and the Ford name, and united them both under the [[New Holland Agriculture|New Holland]] brand.

'''The Ford P100''' is a [[coupe utility|car-based pickup truck]] that was built by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] from 1971 to 1993, initially in [[South Africa]], and later [[Portugal]]. It was based on medium-sized [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] passenger cars, originally the [[Ford Cortina]] and from 1988 the [[Ford Sierra]]. Initially marketed as the '''Ford Cortina Pickup''',&lt;ref name=Cortina_Pickup/&gt; the P100 name was adopted in 1982.&lt;ref name=commercialmotor/&gt; The P-100 name had previously been used on a small North American [[panel van]] in the 1960s.

==Cortina-based model==
The P100 is a car-based [[pickup truck]], introduced in [[South Africa]] in 1971, based on the [[Ford Cortina]] Mk3. Initially marketed as the Ford Cortina Pickup, its overall bodywork closely followed that of the Cortina. The cab used the doors of the Cortina two-door sedan models, giving it a lengthy, yet truncated look, due to the use of a vertical rear window and B-pillar. The rear tray could be had as a wellside, styled with the Cortina MkIII estate's tail lights, or fitted with a flatdeck or purpose built body. A fibreglass canopy was offered as an option. It soon proved a popular seller in its home market of South Africa.

The bodywork was changed for 1977, to correspond with that of the Ford Cortina MkIV. The cab was redesigned, using the shorter front doors from the MkIV four-door models. A further change occurred for 1980, when the MkV's front sheetmetal was introduced. The Ford 1-Tonner name was used in the South African market.&lt;ref name=1-Tonner/&gt; From 1986 the [[Mazda]]-based [[Ford Courier]] replaced the P100 pick-up in South Africa. The Courier was available with the [[Ford Essex V6 engine (UK)|Ford Essex V6]] through to April 2000.

From 1982 the P100 name was adopted,&lt;ref name=commercialmotor/&gt; and the model was exported from South Africa to Europe. For Europe, the chassis and tray were lengthened, whilst in South Africa it was available in both short wheelbase and long wheelbase variants. The P100 was released to Europe in Mk5 form, just as the parent Cortina MkV was being replaced by the Sierra. Ford had considered selling a rebadged [[Mazda B-Series#UC|Mazda pickup]], which would have been lower priced, but rejected this on political grounds as there was a lot of fear over Japanese imports at this time.&lt;ref name="Truck9.82"&gt;{{ cite journal | journal = TRUCK | date = September 1982 | ref = truck982 | pages = 36–37 | editor-last = Kennett | editor-first = Pat | title = The great European retreat | last = Walker | first = Alan | location = London, UK | publisher = FF Publishing Ltd }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford UK considered being made in [[Apartheid]] South Africa as less of a liability than being made in Japan, and also managed to achieve 35 percent local parts content.&lt;ref name="Truck9.82"/&gt; Country of origin and outdated styling proved to be no effect on sales however, with the P100 continuing in its Cortina Mk5 based form until 1988. In 1986 the "hi cap" was released with a taller roof and door tops and a more upright windscreen specific to the last of the Cortina-based P100s.

Turkey's [[Otosan]] also produced a P100 variant, with a separate bed and using the shorter doors from the four-door sedan to achieve parts commonality - Otosan did not build any other two-door models. The Otosan P100 is based on the [[Ford Taunus TC]], which was built in Turkey in sedan form until 1994. The Otosan P100 was produced until 1996.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Sierra-based model==
In late 1987, for the 1988 model year, the P100 was re-bodied with a new [[Ford Sierra]]-based cab. Engine choices were originally the Sierra's [[Ford Pinto engine#TL20|2.0 litre "Pinto"]] carburetted petrol engine, with a 1.8&amp;nbsp;L turbo-diesel following soon thereafter.&lt;ref name=AOggi&gt;{{cite journal | title = Brevissime |trans-title= In short | language = Italian | page = 4 | journal = Auto Oggi | date = 1987-12-17 | volume = 2 | number = 54 | publisher = Arnoldo Mondadori | location = Verona, Italy | editor-last = Liberali | editor-first = Sandro }}&lt;/ref&gt; The range was now built in [[Portugal]] for the European market, to a design set out by Ford UK. It proved a strong seller, particularly on the UK market. The later P100's petrol engine, while a 2.0&amp;nbsp;L Pinto engine, differed from the units in the passenger Sierra and Granada models in that it was a low compression version of the 205 block Pinto, the Cosworth engine is based on this block.  Single choke carburettors were used along with the lower compression to raise torque whilst lowering maximum power, which was now at {{convert|74|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=AOggi/&gt;

Production of the P100 ceased when the parent Ford Sierra was replaced by the [[front wheel drive]] [[Ford Mondeo|Mondeo]] range.

File:Ford P100 rear right.JPG|Ford P100 Pickup - ([[Ford Sierra]] based) 
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Differences between the Cortina and Sierra==
The P100, while it appeared similar to the models that it was based upon, had several key differences under its skin. While it used the front bodywork of the Cortina, and later Sierra, only the front half of the underbody was utilized - the rear, from the middle of the front seats backward, utilized a ladder chassis for which the pickup tray was mounted to, which could accept a payload of 1000&amp;nbsp;kg.

The P100 was longer than the corresponding Cortina and Sierra models, and had a higher ride height due to having a multi leaf spring suspension in the rear and larger five-stud wheels all round. The hub design on the Cortina was a SA specific pattern and actually a Rover PCD, hence Rover SD1 alloys and steel wheels fit.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The later Sierra front hubs were from the Granada with adapter plates to allow fitment of the heavier duty [[Ford Transit]] wheel. Its rear axle was lifted directly from the SWB Transit 80, hence the need for the front adapters to match.

The later P100's gearbox was simply a lower ratio version of the popular Ford T9 gearbox which was also fitted in some earlier Transits, unlike the car version of the Sierra the Type 9 was used up until production ceased - the cars had been updated in 1989 to the MT75 box. While this was a stronger box, it did not use a slip joint yoke so was unsuitable for use on the P100, as it had a live axle compared to the cars independent rear setups with non-moving diff units.

==Modifications==
In recent years the Sierra-based P100 has gained a following in [[Drifting (motorsport)|drifting]] and modifying circles, and many are becoming modified to include [[Cosworth]] engines, which are based on the truck version of the Pinto block.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

There are many Ford P100 Pickups which have been modified by their owners. The running gear from any Sierra and certain running gear from the Ford Granada can fitted to the front of the P100. The rear suspension is vehicle specific, with the Capri/Mk1/2 Escort atlas axles being interchangeable, however it requires much more modification (other than simply bolting in) to fit Sierra independent or any other rear running gear. Many modifiers have converted their P100 to Sierra XR/Cosworth drivetrain and running gear. The very fact that they are so easily modified under the bonnet and inside the cab has made the P100 extremely popular in modifying and cruise circles. The Cosworth BOA 24v and YB 16v engines are a popular choice with the YB offering tuning potential for a price while the BOA boasts unbeatable reliability and an astonishing engine note. Rover and Ford V8's are also a common swap, the former being the same weight as the [[Ford Pinto engine|Pinto unit]].

Other modifications include:
*Changing front hubs from [[Ford Transit|Transit]] style wide spaced 5 stud to standard 4 stud Sierra hubs and fitting the back axle from a similar width 4-stud Ford vehicle - e.g. [[Ford Sierra]] XR4x4 to allow lowering and 4 stud standard alloys.
*Replacing the fabricated steel bed with a lighter fibreglass body to reduce weight.

In 2013, a modified British P100 became the fastest coffee-powered vehicle in the world reaching 65.5&amp;nbsp;mph,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=This Ford Pick-Up Is The Fastest Coffee-Powered Vehicle In The World|url=http://jalopnik.com/this-ford-pick-up-is-the-fastest-coffee-powered-vehicle-401749886|work=Jalopnik|accessdate=25 February 2013|date=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; entering the [[Guinness World Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Co-op revs up for Fairtrade Fortnight with coffee-powered car|url=http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/companies/supermarkets/the-co-operative-group/co-op-revs-up-for-fairtrade-fortnight-with-coffee-powered-car/236740.article|work=The Grocer|accessdate=25 February 2013|date=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ford Fairlane Thunderbolt''' is a limited production, factory experimental, [[drag racing]] version of the [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)#Fourth generation (1962–1965)|Ford Fairlane]] produced during the 1964 model year only.  A total of 100 units were produced; forty-nine 4-speeds and fifty-one automatics, enough to secure the 1964 [[NHRA]] [[Super Stock (drag racing)|Super Stock]] championship for Ford.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/hi/427fairlane/ Thunderbolt fansite at Angelfire.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.musclecarclub.com/musclecars/ford-fairlane/ford-fairlane-history-2.shtml |title=History of the Thunderbolt at Musclecarclub.com |access-date=2010-04-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193516/http://www.musclecarclub.com/musclecars/ford-fairlane/ford-fairlane-history-2.shtml |archive-date=2013-10-29 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Based on the standard two door post sedan [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)#Fourth generation (1962–1965)|Fairlane]] and named for a factory experimental Fairlane of 1963, the Thunderbolt combined the light weight of Ford's intermediate-sized body introduced in 1962 with a "high rise" [[Ford FE engine#427|{{convert|427|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine]] with dual 4-barrel [[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] [[carburetor]]s intended for use in the much larger [[Ford Galaxie#1960–1964|Galaxie]]. That engine as used in the Galaxie for [[NASCAR]] racing did well, but the Galaxie was simply too heavy an automobile in stock trim to be drag raced successfully; so-called "lightweight" 427-powered Galaxies were built both for stock car racing as well as drag racing during the 1964 model year, although these cars were not modified to the extent of the Thunderbolt.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carcraft.com/featuredvehicles/ccrp_0411_1964_ford_galaxie_500/index.html Feature on the 1964 Galaxie lightweight factory race car at Carcraft.com&lt;/ref&gt; As installed in the Thunderbolt, the engine was rated conservatively at {{Convert|425|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000 rpm and {{Convert|480|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3,700 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myclassicgarage.com/knowledge-base/1964-Ford-Fairlane|website=myclassicgarage.com|title=1964 Ford Fairlane|accessdate=June 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; estimates placed the actual output was close to {{Convert|600|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kitcarmag.com/thehistoryof/0411kc_ford_427_cammer/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.holmanmoody.com/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;
In standard form, the Fairlane is {{convert|12|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} shorter than a Galaxie, rides on a {{convert|3.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} shorter wheelbase and weighs approximately {{convert|700|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} less. Installing the Ford FE V8 in a vehicle intended for an engine no larger than a [[Ford_Windsor_engine|Ford Windsor/Challenger engine]] required major reworking and relocation of the car's front [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] components and the modification and strengthening of the suspension mounting areas. [[Fiberglass]] doors, [[Hood (car)|hood]], front [[Fender (vehicle)|fenders]] and even the front [[Bumper (car)|bumper]] on the earliest cars along with [[Plexiglas]] side and rear windows aided in weight reduction; the hood with its distinctive raised "teardrop" [[Ram-air intake|ram air]] scoop designed to draw hot air from the engine compartment was pinned in position, eliminating the need for a hood [[hinge]]s and a [[latch]]. Later cars have aluminum front bumpers in place of the fiberglass units due to racing regulations.&lt;ref name=hsw/&gt;&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PGYLpmlt5coC&amp;pg=PA130|pages=130–131|title=Ultimate Performance Cars|author=Richard Gunn|publisher=MotorBooks International|year=2006|isbn=0-7603-2571-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racing equipment includes tubular [[exhaust header]]s, an electric [[fuel pump]], altered rear suspension with heavy-duty [[Traction control system|traction control]] bars and asymmetrical [[leaf spring]]s, trunk-mounted [[heavy duty battery]], [[locking differential]], auxiliary gauges, special drag race wheels and tires supplied both by [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] and [[Mickey Thompson]] (himself a recipient of one of the first ten cars) and an aluminum scatter shield designed to contain the [[clutch]] in case of disintegration under load. The claimed [[compression ratio]] was 13.5:1.&lt;ref name=hsw&gt;[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1964-ford-fairlane-thunderbolt.htm Article on the 1964 Thunderbolt at Howstuffworks.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z15643/Ford-Thunderbolt.aspx History of the Thunderbolt at Conceptcarz.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other weight-saving measures include the elimination of such street items as the sunvisors, radio, heater, wheel covers, passenger-side windshield wiper, arm rests, rear window cranks, mirrors, sound deadening material, [[carpeting]], trunk mat, lug wrench, jack and spare tire.  The front seats are either lightweight units from Ford's police package vehicles or rudimentary [[bucket seat]]s from the [[Ford Econoline|Econoline]] van; the carpeting was replaced with a black rubber mat. The rear seat is a standard Fairlane unit. The high-beam [[headlight]]s were eliminated as well and in their place are [[mesh]]-covered [[air intake]]s which run directly to a special [[air cleaner]] atop the 427. Like the street version, the Thunderbolt's outer high-low {{convert|5.75|in|0|abbr=on}} headlights of the type normally used with a four-lamp system are selectable with a standard foot-operated switch. Though it was technically a [[street-legal vehicle]], these modifications and deletions along with a [[final drive ratio]] of 4:57.1 for the four-speed cars and 4:44.1 for the automatics make the Thunderbolt impractical for street use.

The Thunderbolt was not built on a regular Ford assembly line, but rather in conjunction with Andy Hotton of Dearborn Steel Tubing. It was there that partially built Fairlane bodies in top-of-the-line "500" exterior trim were combined with the 427 and either a heavy-duty [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]] [[automatic transmission]] or a [[Borg-Warner]] four-speed [[manual transmission]]. The first eleven cars were painted in Ford's "vintage burgundy" while the remaining eighty-nine cars were painted "Wimbledon white." The engine code reflected not the 427 on most cars but rather the so-called [[tappet|solid lifter]] [[Ford Windsor engine#289 HiPo (K-code)|"K-code" 289 hi- performance engine]]. "427" emblems replaced the normal "260" or "289" emblems, and the "Fairlane 500" script on the upper front fenders was deleted. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hotrod.com/featuredvehicles/hrdp_0911_ford_thunderbolt_reunion/index.html Article on the reunion of surviving Thunderbolts at Hotrod.com&lt;/ref&gt; 

Given the special nature of the car, Ford riveted a metal plate to the inside of the [[glovebox]] door of the Thunderbolt and other race-only models with a disclaimer relating to fit and finish. The plate reads:

::''This vehicle has been built specially as a lightweight competitive car and includes certain fiberglass and aluminium components.  Because of the specialized purpose for which this car has been built and in order to achieve maximum weight reduction, normal quality standards of the Ford Motor Company in terms of exterior panel fit and surface appearance are not met on this vehicle.''

::''This information is included on this vehicle to assure that all customers who purchase this car are aware of the deviation from the regular high appearance quality standards of the Ford Motor Company.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotrod.com/featuredvehicles/hrdp_0001_1964_ford_thunderbolt/index.html Reprint of January 2000 article in ''Hot Rod'' Magazine describing the disclaimer plate on a Thunderbolt used on a road tour]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.1964ford.com/lightweight.aspx |title=History of the lightweight 1964 Ford drag cars at 1964ford.com |access-date=2010-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713162615/http://1964ford.com/lightweight.aspx |archive-date=2014-07-13 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance and motorsports==
The Thunderbolt, as tested with a four-speed transmission at [[Lions Drag Strip]] in November 1963, ran a [[Dragstrip|{{convert|1/4|mi|m|0}}]] of 11.61 seconds at {{Convert|124.8|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hotrod.com/cars/featured/hrdp-0001-1964-ford-thunderbolt/ Thunderbolt specification chart from January 2000 at Hotrod.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Thunderbolts faced off in the final of the [[1964 NHRA Winternationals]], driven by [[Butch Leal]] and [[Gas Ronda]]; Ronda took the win, with a pass of 11.78 seconds at {{convert|123.40|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Phil, ''National Dragster'' editor.

The '''Ford Festiva''' is a [[subcompact car|subcompact]] car that was marketed by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] between 1986 and 2002. Festiva was sold in [[Japan]], the [[Americas]], and [[Australia]]. The name "Festiva" is derived from the Spanish word for "[[wiktionary:festive|festive]]". It was not related to the similarly sized and named [[Ford Fiesta]], and was not replaced by the [[Ford Ka]], which is smaller.

Designed by [[Mazda]] using the [[Mazda D platform#DA|DA platform]] and [[Mazda B engine|B series]] [[inline-four engine]]s, the Festiva continued the trend of Fords built and designed by Mazda for the [[Asia-Pacific]] market such as the [[Ford Laser|Laser]] and [[Ford Telstar|Telstar]].

South Korean first generation sales began in 1987 under the name '''Kia Pride''', assembled by [[Kia Motors|Kia]] under license. Australasia and Europe received the first version between 1987 and 1991 as the "[[Mazda 121]]". After 1991, Australasian sales occurred under the "Ford Festiva" name, while European sales continued under the name "Kia Pride". Kia ended production of the Pride in 2000. This ongoing production has been in parallel to the second generation Festiva introduced in 1993, sold as the '''Ford Aspire''' in North America and '''Kia Avella''' in South Korea and other markets. Although these second generations models were withdrawn in 2000, a third generation was sold between 1996 and 2002 in Japan as a [[badge engineering|badge-engineered]] version of the [[Mazda Demio]].

Kia reached and agreement to supply Ford with its Festiva model. [...] Kia planned to ship about 70,000 units annually for Ford and a like number of the cars to other countries. Kia's sales topped US $2.4 billion in 1987 as its work force swelled to about 23500. Kia's arrangement with Ford reflected its strategy, first evident in the mid-1980s, to gradually assume Japan's role as the leading supplier of low-end economy cars. By the mid-1980s, in fact, it was clear to Kia executives that Japan was reducing its emphasis on low-priced cars and focusing on higher-priced, high-profit vehicles. [...] Kia planned to use its low-cost production advantages to fill the void. Kia's greatest edge in comparison to US, European, and Japanese automakers was labor. Indeed, until the late 1980s Kia paid its workers a mere fraction of what their foreign counterparts earned. The savings were mirrored in cars like the Festiva, which enjoyed steady demand as a result of their extremely low prices. Over a period of about five years, Kia shipped 350,000 Festivas to Ford.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement with Ford materialized in accordance with Kia's strategy implemented in the mid-1980s to progressively fill the void at the low-cost end of the market slowly being abdicated by the Japanese brands pursuing more expensive models with higher profit margins.&lt;ref name = "Grant (1999)"/&gt; Compared to rival automakers in Japan, and also Europe and North America, Kia's main competitive advantage was its lower-paid South Korean workforce—which translated into lower-priced cars.&lt;ref name = "Grant (1999)"/&gt;

Mazda began producing the Festiva as the "Mazda 121" for Australia and Europe in 1987, but this model was never retailed in Japan.&lt;ref name = "History of Festiva"/&gt; The 121 ended production in 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://redbook.com.au/used-cars/results.aspx?Qpb=true&amp;Ntt=DA&amp;SearchAction=N&amp;N=2994+4294953017+4294843250&amp;Ns=p_Make_String%7c0%7cp_ClassificationType_String%7c0%7cp_Family_String%7c0%7cp_Year_String%7c1%7cp_SequenceNum_Int32%7c0&amp;sid=12E167C930C2&amp;Dx=mode+matchany&amp;Nne=15&amp;Ntx=mode+matchallpartial&amp;Ntk=CarAll&amp;D=DA | title = Mazda 121 (DA) | work = Red Book | publisher = Automotive Data Services | accessdate = 2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was officially discontinued by Mazda Australia in February 1991.&lt;ref name = "Mazda 121 DB11 (Mk1) 121 1989-1991"/&gt; From October 1991, [[Ford Australia]] began importing the car as the "Ford Festiva" from Kia's South Korean production facility.&lt;ref name = "Ford Festiva (WA Festiva) 1991-1994"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/carfamilytree?ReadForm&amp;ID=D116291D96DD7480CA257125001A135F | title = Ford Festiva (WA Festiva) 1991–1994 | work = GoAuto | publisher = John Mellor | accessdate = 2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where the Mazda was sold as a three-door hatchback, the Ford was sold initially as a five-door only.

Ford Australia's action was paralleled in Europe where Kia started exporting three- and five-door hatchback, four-door sedan, and five-door wagon variants of the Kia Pride in 1991 under their own name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Foulfellow | first = John | url = http://www.honestjohn.co.uk/carbycar/kia/pride-1991?section=good | title = KIA Pride (1991–2000 ) | publisher = Honestjohn.co.uk | accessdate = 2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; These additional sedan and five-door hatchback body variants were also imported from South Korea to Japan in left-hand drive form (Japan officially being a right-hand drive market) as the "Ford Festiva 5" (from May 1991) and "Festiva β", respectively.

In [[Taiwan]], it was assembled using [[knock-down kit|complete knock-down kits]] from 1989 via the local joint venture [[Ford Lio Ho]].&lt;ref name = "Ford Lio Ho, plant Information"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=l5YSAQAAMAAJ | title = Japanese Motor Business | publisher = [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] | year = 1994 | page = 56 | quote = Ford's Taiwanese affiliate, Ford Lio Ho, has been involved in the alliance.

The 2008 edition of [[Monash University]]'s ''Used Car Safety Ratings'' (UCSR), found that the first generation Festiva provides a "worse than average" (two out of five stars) level of [[Automobile safety|safety]] in the event of an [[Car accident|accident]], in a comparison to other "light cars".&lt;ref name = "UCSR 2008"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ols2.rta.nsw.gov.au/ebus/docs/rescat/pdf/3/938/45094801usedcarsafety2008.pdf | format = PDF | title = Used Car Safety Ratings 2008 | publisher = [[Monash University]] | accessdate = 2011-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The safety rating was not calculated solely on the basis of the protection of the vehicle's occupants, with protection for "cyclists, pedestrians and drivers of other vehicles" included to give a "better guide to the total community impact of vehicle safety."&lt;ref name="UCSR 2008"/&gt;

[[Mazda]] began selling the 121 as a single three-door hatchback body variant in 1987 to sit below the larger [[Mazda Familia#BF|323]] model.&lt;ref name = "Mazda 121 DB11 (Mk1) 121 1987-1989"/&gt; Despite being manufactured there, the 121 was not sold in Japan under the "Mazda" brand.&lt;ref name = "History of Festiva"/&gt; Australian specification 121s were fitted with the 1.3-liter ''B3'' engine, mated to a five-speed manual transmission.&lt;ref name = "Mazda 121 DB11 (Mk1) 121 1989-1991"/&gt; European markets also received the {{convert|55|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} 1.1-liter [[Mazda B engine#B1|''B1'' engine]] with a four-speed manual transmission.&lt;ref name = "TAM90"&gt;{{cite book | editor = Mastrostefano, Raffaele | year = 1990 | language = Italian | title = Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1990 | location = [[Milan]] | publisher = Editoriale Domus | pages = 454–456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 121 was sold in Australia from March 1987.&lt;ref name = "Mazda 121 DB11 (Mk1) 121 1987-1989"/&gt; It featured a sliding rear [[bench seat]], which increased cargo space by as much as {{convert|180|mm|in|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name = "Mazda 121 DB11 (Mk1) 121 1987-1989"/&gt; Levels of trim in Australia comprised the base-line "deluxe", the "super deluxe", and the "fun top" (based on the super deluxe), featuring a large electric sliding canvas [[sunroof]].&lt;ref name = "Mazda 121 DB11 (Mk1) 121 1987-1989"/&gt; From October 1988, the super deluxe was discontinued and replaced by the "shades" trim.&lt;ref name = "Mazda 121 DB11 (Mk1) 121 1987-1989"/&gt; The European premiere for the 121 was at the [[Geneva Motor Show|Geneva Auto Salon]] in March 1988.

Trim levels were L and LX, with an SR version also available in the UK.&lt;ref name = "TAM90"/&gt; In Europe, the car's ventilation system, developed with American consumers in mind, was notable for its refinement for the class.&lt;ref name="QR0189"&gt;{{cite magazine | magazine = Quattroruote | title = È astuta e si scopre | trans-title = She is smart and it shows | language = Italian |date = January 1989 | volume = 34 | issue = 399 | publisher = Editoriale Domus | location = Milan, Italy | first = Carlo | last = Sidoli | pages = 128-129 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An interesting design feature was that the rear seat back could reclined somewhat and the seat could be moved longitudinally, adding up to {{convert|50|L|impgal|abbr=out}} of space to the otherwise very small luggage compartment.&lt;ref name="QR0189"/&gt;

The [[Kia Pride]] badged version of the Festiva was manufactured in South Korea by Kia Motors from March 1987 to January 2000. Prior to its South Korean market release, exports as the Festiva had begun in December 1986 to Japan and the United States. The Pride was sold in four-door sedan form (in LX, GTX, and β trim levels), as well as three- and five-door hatchback forms (the CD-5) and five-door wagon body styles. The original Pride was only available as a three-door hatchback, while the five-door was added in June 1988. The four-door sedan model, the Pride Beta, arrived in November 1990, and the range was completed by the three-door van and five-door wagon in February 1992. In November 1993 the Pride received a minor facelift and production was also moved to Kia's [[Asia Motors]] subsidiary's [[Gwangju]] plant as Kia focused on the new Avella (Ford Aspire/WB Festiva). Until the Mazda 121 was replaced in late 1990, Kia-badged cars were only exported to certain tertiary markets. The Pride was replaced in 2000 by the [[Kia Rio|Rio]].

The Pride launched in the United Kingdom in June 1991, fitted with both the 1.1- ''B1'' and 1.3-liter ''B3'' engines. The 1.1 was only available as a three-door in the basic L trim ([[whitewall tires|whitewall tyres]] were a commonplace feature on them).&lt;ref name="Used Kia Pride (1991 - 2000) Car Review"&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101103043530/http://www.autoweb.co.uk/car-review/kia%20pride%20%281991%20-%202000%29 | url = http://www.autoweb.co.uk/car-review/kia%20pride%20%281991%20-%202000%29 | title = Used Car Review: Kia Aura | publisher = Autoweb | archivedate = 2010-11-03 | first = Jonathan | last = Crouch | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a panel van two-seater version in the UK and some other markets. [[Fuel injection]] appeared on the 1.3-liter-engined models in November 1994, referred to as the "1.3i". At this time, the 1.1-liter version was deleted.&lt;ref name = "Used Kia Pride (1991 - 2000) Car Review"/&gt; December 1995 saw the Start 1.3i three-door replace the L, but from June 1999, the entry-level three-door was again renamed S with the higher-level three- and five-doors known as the SX.&lt;ref name = "Used Kia Pride (1991 - 2000) Car Review"/&gt; Production ended during 2000.&lt;ref name = "Used Kia Pride (1991 - 2000) Car Review"/&gt;

=== SAIPA ===
[[SAIPA]] has built the Kia Pride in [[Iran]] under license since 1993 and using up to 85&amp;nbsp;percent local parts as the SAIPA Pride from 2001 to 2005. Since 2003, SAIPA has produced a new five-door liftback model based on the Pride called the SAIPA 141, while continuing to sell the Iranian version of the Pride under the names SAIPA Saba GLXi (four-door sedan), SAIPA Nasim Safari (five-door wagon) and SAIPA Nasim DMi (five-door hatchback). Compared to these versions, the SAIPA 141 features revised rear styling with a longer liftback tail, and different interior design. The SAIPA 141 is sold in Venezuela under name Turpial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abn.info.ve/go_news5.php?articulo=96989 President Chávez to give first 300 Venirauto vehicles], ABN&lt;/ref&gt; Another variant, known as the SAIPA 132 began production in 2008 and differs from the Saba with its revised front and rear styling. The company introduced a [[coupe utility]] body style in 2008 under the name SAIPA Pick-Up, with a {{convert|500|kg|lb|adj=on}} payload. The platform/engine of the Kia Pride also formed the basis for the Iranian [[P.K]] (2000 to 2005) and [[P.K|New P.K]] (2005 to 2007) models, which utilize [[Renault 5]] bodies. In Iran, the Pride continues to be the most common car with approximately 40&amp;nbsp;percent of vehicles in the country being a Pride-derived SAIPA.

[[Arab American Vehicles]] (AAV) manufactured the Pride in Cairo, Egypt, circa 1998.&lt;ref name="Arab American Vehicles"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aav.com.eg/Pathtosuccess.html | title = Production History | publisher = [[Arab American Vehicles]] | accessdate = 2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second model Ford Festiva was jointly developed between Kia and Ford, retaining most of the [[powertrain|drivetrain]] of the previous model with a more rounded body style. This new Festiva was slightly longer, wider, more aerodynamic, and suspended by [[MacPherson strut]]s in the front and a [[torsion beam]] axle in the rear. While it was sold in certain markets as a second generation Festiva, Ford renamed it the "Aspire" in North American markets, where the five-door model was offered for the first time. In South Korea, the car was badged "Kia Avella". The sedan version was mainly restricted to the South Korean market, although it was also available with Festiva badging in Taiwan.

Depending on the market, some retained the SOHC, throttle-body injected motor, while others received an engine with a DOHC cylinder head and MPI also designed by Mazda. These engines were:
* '''B3 EGi''': 1.3&amp;nbsp;L (1,323&amp;nbsp;cc) [[fuel injection|fuel injected]] 8-valve [[Straight-4|I4]] making {{Convert|63|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5000&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|74|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3000&amp;nbsp;rpm
* '''[[Mazda B engine#B5|B5 EGi]]''': 1.5&amp;nbsp;L (1,498&amp;nbsp;cc) fuel injected 16-valve I4 making {{Convert|88.4|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5000&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|99|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 4000&amp;nbsp;rpm (Asia and Oceania only)

Transmission options comprised a five-speed [[manual transmission]], although all models could be optioned with a four-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]. Australian and U.S. models were equipped with a three-speed automatic.

In 1997, the Festiva received a new front bumper with an oval grille, reshaped headlamps, and other minor changes. The Aspire was dropped from the Ford range in the United States after 1997.

The second generation Festiva continued to be sold in Australia until 2000 when it was replaced by the [[Ford Ka]]. Australian second-generation Festivas have U.S. side marker light cut-outs on each side of the vehicle (driver-side and passenger-side) at the front and rear. Instead of housing orange reflectors/lights at the front sides and red reflectors/lights at the rear sides, there are non-lit orange reflectors at all four locations. These redundant reflectors, coupled with the orange side indicator repeater (which is not required in the U.S., and was not included on the Aspire) make for a unique side profile.

Kia developed their following model, the Kia Rio, completely independently, and finished their relationship with Ford.

Like the first generation, the 2008 edition of the ''Used Car Safety Ratings'' (UCSR) by [[Monash University]] in Australia found the second series Festiva to provide a "worse than average" (two out of five stars) safety protection level in the event of an accident.&lt;ref name = "UCSR 2008"/&gt; In the 2010 edition, the scoring was downgraded to "very poor" (equivalent to one of five stars, or the "significantly worse than average" terminology used in 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.monash.edu.au/muarc/projects/ucsr-2010.pdf | format = PDF | title = Used Car Safety Ratings 2010 | publisher = [[Monash University]] | accessdate = 2011-05-22 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ford-Aspire.jpg|thumb|right|1996–1997 Ford Aspire three-door]]

The Ford Aspire was sold in North America from 1993 to 1997. It was the replacement for the Ford Festiva. It was the first car in its class to have dual airbags standard and antilock brakes optional. It came in two and four door body styles, both hatchbacks. The two door was available in base and SE trim while the four door was only available in base trim. The SE model offered a sporting package that consisted of fog lights, rear spoiler, alloy wheels, blue face instrument cluster with tachometer, and upgraded interior trim. The Aspire had very few options for the base model: cassette player, automatic transmission, rear defrost and wiper, alloy wheels, and a comfort and convenience package that had several minor interior upgrades. Due to slow sales the SE model was dropped after 1995 along with all of its optional equipment. The base model also lost its optional alloy wheels and rear wiper, making the Aspire a true "stripper" of a car.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} The performance with the five-speed was acceptable{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} but the automatic was slower with 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph times of 16.2 seconds. Power steering was only available with the five-door automatic. The Aspire was given a facelift in 1997 with redesigned front and rear bumpers, a new radio, and new seat facings. In August 1997, Ford announced the Aspire would be discontinued due to slow sales. The last one rolled off the assembly line on September 26, 1997.

The Avella was primarily intended for export markets carrying Ford badging, as South Korean customers tended to prefer sedans over hatchbacks. It was sold in a very few export markets with Kia badging, such as [[Malta]]. The [[Kia Avella]] was discontinued in 1999 (although production for some export markets continued until 2000), it and the [[Kia Pride|Pride]] (first generation Festiva) were collectively replaced by the [[Kia Rio]] in 2000.

All Avellas came standard with 13&amp;nbsp;inch wheels, a four-speaker stereo, heated rear glass, [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] (ABS), driver's side [[airbag]], and door impact beams. Optional equipment included [[air conditioning]], power locks, power mirrors, power windows, folding rear seats, dimming interior mirror, a [[tachometer]], and [[aluminum]] wheels. The Avella was the first South Korean car in its class to offer dual airbags and ABS-brakes.&lt;ref name="BFP30"/&gt; The Delta version received a slightly reworked front end from its hatchback siblings.

While the standard Avellas received the {{convert|73|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} 1.3 liter [[Mazda B engine#B3|Mazda B3]] engine, higher spec versions were available both with an [[SOHC]] and a more powerful [[DOHC]] version of the 1.5 liter [[Mazda B engine#B5|B5]] engine. The {{convert|105|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} DOHC version was only available in the four-door Avella Delta. Five-speed manuals as well as three- or four-speed automatic transmissions were available.

Sales of the second generation Festiva ended in 1996 for the Japanese market, being replaced by generation three—a [[badge engineering|badge engineered]] [[Mazda Demio]] (DW). Known as the "Ford Festiva Mini Wagon", the Japanese-only model range consisted of a single five-door hatchback body style available with either a 1.3- or 1.5-liter engine. Transmission options were a three-speed or four-speed automatic and a five-speed manual. Production continued until Mazda ceased manufacture of the equivalent Demio in 2002.

The '''Ford Expedition''' is a [[Full-size car|full-size]] [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]] manufactured by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. Introduced for the 1997 model year as the successor of the [[Ford Bronco]], the Expedition was the first full-size Ford SUV sold with a four-door body. For its entire production life, the Ford Expedition has been derived from the corresponding generation of the Ford F-150 in production, sharing some body and mechanical components. The fourth-generation Ford Expedition began production for the 2018 model year. Similar to the configuration of the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] and [[Chevrolet Suburban|Suburban]], the Ford Expedition is sold in regular and extended lengths (the Ford Expedition EL/Max); sold since 2007, the latter functionally serves as the replacement for the [[Ford Excursion]].

Since 1997, the Lincoln division has marketed the Ford Expedition as the [[Lincoln Navigator]], the first full-size SUV sold by a luxury auto brand in North America (the Expedition was never sold as a [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]]). The third Ford vehicle to use the Expedition nameplate, the full-size SUV follows a 1992 F-150 Eddie Bauer concept vehicle and a 1995 trim level package on the two-door [[Ford Explorer Sport]].

Prior to 2009, the Ford Expedition was assembled at the [[Michigan Assembly Plant]] in [[Wayne, Michigan]] (previously home to the Ford Bronco)., After 2009, the Ford Expedition was moved to the [[Kentucky Truck Assembly|Kentucky Truck Plant]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Background==
The Expedition offered up to nine-passenger seating in model years before 2007 (with a front bench seat option in the first row); 2007–present model year Expeditions have bucket seats in the first row and seats eight passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Expedition Review|url= http://www.edmunds.com/ford/expedition/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was equipped with a standard [[V8 engine]] from October 1996 until 2014 when it was replaced with more compact, yet more efficient and powerful 3.5L EcoBoost V6 for model year 2015. It is similar to the [[Lincoln Navigator]], especially in ''Limited'' (2005–present) or ''King Ranch'' (2005–2017) high-end trims; both of which were introduced for the 2005 model year. With the 2011 model year, the base model was designated XL, an upgraded XLT, and new for 2011 XLT Premium that replaced the [[Eddie Bauer]] trim  (1997–2010) which was phased out from the entire Ford vehicle lineup. As of 2010, over 1,545,241 Expeditions (both standard and EL/Max) have been sold. A modified ''Special Service Vehicle'' version is available for [[law enforcement agencies]], [[Firefighting worldwide|fire departments]], and [[emergency medical services]].

The Ford Expedition is also known for being one of the longest-lasting vehicles on the road. With 5% of vehicles over 200K miles, it landed the #4 spot in a 2016 study by [[iSeeCars.com]] listing the top 10 longest-lasting vehicles. The Expedition was also the last Ford vehicle to retain its older design found in the early to mid 2000s. Meaning, all the way up to 2017, it kept its triangular-styled taillamps and rounded-rectangular shaped headlamps along with the overall boxy shape of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.iseecars.com/2016/03/03/longest-lasting-vehicles-2016/ |title=Longest Lasting Vehicles Over 200,000 Miles – 2016 Study Shows Top 10 Consists of Mostly Trucks and SUVs |website=Blog.iseecars.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known internally at Ford as the UN93, the first generation Expedition was developed under the UN93 program from 1993 to 1996, headed by chief engineer Dale Claudepierre at a cost of US$1.3 billion. Initial planning began in 1991 parallel to PN96 F-Series development, prior to the UN93 program fully being approved in 1993. Styling approval was completed in early 1993 (3 1/2 years ahead of 1996 production) under design chief Bob Aikins, with the UN93 design being frozen by September 1993, at 34 months prior to July 1996 production commencement.&lt;ref name="planedge.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planedge.com/forecasting/engineexcerpt.pdf |title=4100 engmy report1 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/specs/2003/2003_expedition.html |title=Ford Truck Enthusiasts - Expedition Overview |publisher=Ford-trucks.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Connelly|first1=Mary|title=FORD'S EXPEDITION TAKES ON TAHOE, SEEKS CONQUEST SALES|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/19960513/ANA/605130761/fords-expedition-takes-on-tahoe-seeks-conquest-sales|website=Automotive News|publisher=Crain Communications|accessdate=8 February 2017|date=13 May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Has A Bigger Idea: The Expedition|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-05-16/topic/9605140728_1_expedition-ford-motor-ford-explorer|website=Orlando Sentinel|publisher=Detroit Free Press|accessdate=8 February 2017|date=16 May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Connelly|first1=Mary|title=DANA COMES TO FORD'S AID FOR HOT-SELLING BIG TRUCKS|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/19960805/ANA/608050750?template=print|website=Automotive News|publisher=Crain Communications|accessdate=8 February 2017|date=5 August 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The all-new full-size SUV was unveiled on May 9, 1996 and launched on October 2, 1996 as a 1997 model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Truett|first1=Richard|title=Ford's Big New Baby|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-10-03/topic/9610011147_1_expedition-land-rover-range-rover|website=Orlando Sentinel|publisher=Orlando Sentinel|accessdate=8 February 2017|date=3 October 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rewey|first1=Bob|title=Ford Reports October U.S. Car and Truck Sales|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/press/date/19971104/press007737.html|website=The Auto Channel|publisher=Ford Motor Company|accessdate=8 February 2017|date=4 November 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; It replaced the aging two-door [[Ford Bronco]]. The ''XLT'' was the base model. The Expedition featured optional three row seating, first row captains chair seating, available second row captains chair seating, leather seating surfaces, illuminated running boards, heated side view mirrors, power [[moon roof]], dual zone climate control and Ford's Mach audio sound system with rear [[subwoofer]]. Many of these features were standard on the ''[[Eddie Bauer]]'' version.

Expedition was available with automatic full-time [[Control Trac|ControlTrac]] four-wheel drive with two-speed dual range BorgWarner 4406 [[transfer case]] and a center [[Electromagnetic clutch|multi-disc differential]]. ControlTrac was introduced in 1995 and included four selectable modes: Two High, Auto, Four High (lock) and Four Low (lock). Two High mode and Auto mode with ''auto-lock'' was not available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/automotive/motor-vehicle-models-sport-utilitys/7273668-1.html]{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A short- &amp; long-arm (SLA) independent front suspension with speed-sensitive power-assisted steering was combined with a multi-link rear [[live axle]]. Optional equipment included off-road under-body skid-plate protection, ''Traction-Lok'' rear [[limited-slip differential]], and a heavy-duty trailer towing package.

Optional was an electronically controlled [[pneumatic]] [[air suspension]] system that would raise and lower the vehicle depending on road and load conditions. The system also included a kneel-down mode for easier ingress and egress, as well as loading cargo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/specs/2001_expedition.html |title=Ford Truck Enthusiasts - 2001 Expedition Overview |publisher=Ford-trucks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard was the 4.6 liter Triton V8 with the 5.4 liter version optional. The first generation Expedition was rated as a [[Low Emission Vehicle#Phase 1 - 1994–1999|Low Emission Vehicle]] (LEV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/specs/2000_expedition.html |title=Ford Truck Enthusiasts - 2000 Expedition Overview |publisher=Ford-trucks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter engine combined with the heavy-duty trailer towing package and appropriate axle ratio can achieve a [[towing capacity]] of 8,100&amp;nbsp;lbs (3,674&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/specs/2001_expedition_1.html |title=Ford Truck Enthusiasts - 2001 Expedition Specifications |publisher=Ford-trucks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/specs/2000_expedition_2.html |title=Ford Truck Enthusiasts - 2000 Expedition Features and Options |publisher=Ford-trucks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety and security===

A two air bag [[Supplementary Restraint System|supplementary restraint system]] (SRS) with 2-way occupant protection was standard. The air bags would adjust deployment force depending on crash severity. Features included [[SecuriLock]] with smart key and engine [[immobilizer]], security approach lamps, four-wheel [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS), side-intrusion door beams, post-crash fuel pump shut-off and three-point safety belts for all rows of seating with tension and locking retractors.

An optional four air bag SRS with 4-way occupant protection was available for the 2000–2002 model years. This included seat-mounted [[Torso airbag|side torso side air bags]].

The redesigned second-generation Expedition was developed under the U222 program code name from 1996 to 2002, under Ford chief vehicle engineer Steve von Foerster and chief program engineer [[John Krafcik]] from 1998 to 2002.&lt;ref name="planedge.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/in/frankquenneville |title=Frank Quenneville |publisher=LinkedIn |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design work began in 1997, with a proposal by Tyler Blake being chosen by management and frozen for production in 1999. UN93-body mules were spotted testing in 2000, with full prototypes running from late 2000. The new Expedition was unveiled at the 2002 [[North American International Auto Show]], in January. It was launched in May 2002 for the 2003 model year&lt;ref name="http"/&gt; and featured a new four-wheel independent [[Long travel suspension|long-travel]] suspension system, becoming the first [[full-size]]  sport utility vehicle to use a fully independent suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall |first=Bob |url=http://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1003712_2003-ford-expedition |title=2003 Ford Expedition Page 1 Review |publisher=The Car Connection |date=2002-04-29 |accessdate=2015-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new [[independent rear suspension]] (IRS) was perceived as being controversial by some at the time of its introduction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autofieldguide.com/driven/0402dri04.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511231955/http://www.autofieldguide.com/driven/0402dri04.html |date=May 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A misconception was that the Expedition's towing and off-road capabilities would be reduced, in comparison to the previous generation's rear [[live axle]]. Nevertheless, underbody obstacle clearance improved by half an inch, and up to two inches under the axle differentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/specs/2003/2003_expedition_2.html |title=Special Features |publisher=www.ford-trucks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new suspension reduces rear unsprung mass by 110 pounds, and allows for a full 9.4 inches of [[suspension travel]] (how much the wheels can travel up or down) improving its ability to traverse uneven terrain for improved control and ride quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cars.com/ford/expedition/2003/expert-reviews/ |title=2003 Ford Expedition |publisher=Cars.com |accessdate=2012-11-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007063005/http://www.cars.com/ford/expedition/2003/expert-reviews/ |archive-date=2012-10-07 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourwheeler.com/roadtests/2003/129_0407_2003_ford_expedition/index.html |title=2003 Ford Expedition |publisher=FourWheeler.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four-wheel independent long-travel suspension itself is a purpose-built version of race suspensions found on off-road desert race vehicles.&lt;ref name="ReferenceQW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=548&amp;item_id=2408&amp;press_section_id=2871 |title=Expedition Chassis |publisher=media.ford.com |accessdate=2012-11-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319185555/http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=548&amp;item_id=2408&amp;press_section_id=2871 |archivedate=2013-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towing capacity increased by 800&amp;nbsp;lbs (363&amp;nbsp;kg) for a high [[towing capacity]] of 8,900&amp;nbsp;lbs (4,037&amp;nbsp;kg) when properly equipped with the appropriate axle ratio and heavy-duty trailer towing package.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Payload capacity was increased up to 1,614&amp;nbsp;lbs (732&amp;nbsp;kg). Expedition also gained a [[hydroformed]] fully boxed frame providing a 70 percent improvement in torsional stiffness.  Heavy Towing versions received a heavy duty 9.75" Rear Differential and Axle combination compared to the 8.8" of the standard version.

Along with the high towing capability came all-new steering, braking and electronic systems to help the Expedition better control and maneuver long heavy trailers. Adaptive variable assist power rack-and-pinion steering was introduced along with the largest brake rotors in the segment at that time (13.5&amp;nbsp;inches up front, 13&amp;nbsp;inches in back) with brake calipers 100 percent stiffer than the previous generation Expedition. The four-speed 4R70W automatic transmission received all-new control software to allow the transmission to automatically adjust to the demands of towing, using new computer [[logic]] that recognizes changes in load and road conditions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The automatic full-time [[Control Trac|ControlTrac]] four-wheel drive system remained available, with an uprated two-speed dual range BorgWarner 4416 transfer case. The new transfer case featured an updated intelligent locking center multi-disc differential with front-to-rear "[[Torque vectoring|torque biasing]]" capability in Auto mode. A new dedicated [[microprocessor]] with new control software was added allowing the system to detect different terrain and surface conditions to predict traction loss before it happens. Two High mode was also reintroduced. [[Ford Expedition#Traction Control|Four-wheel electronic traction control]] was now available as an option, and simulated ''front'' and ''rear'' [[Locking differential#Alternatives|differential locks]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceQW" /&gt;

The V8 engines offered on the previous generation were carried over, but not without major changes and improvements. Both the 4.6 and 5.4-liter Triton V8 engines received further refinements in design and overall efficiency. Expedition qualified as an [[Ultra Low Emission Vehicle]] (ULEV) and was certified under the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] Tier 2 regulations one year earlier than required.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/specs/2003/2003_expedition_3.html |title=2002 Ford Expedition Powertrain |publisher=Ford-trucks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 4.6-liter engine received an all-new redesigned cast aluminium engine block optimized for weight reduction and [[Noise, vibration, and harshness|NVH]] improvements. The 5.4-liter engine received an all-new redesigned cast-iron engine block with computer designed ribbing and bracing, along with thicker side skirts and reinforcement at the oil pan flange. The new engine block helped reduce engine vibration and unwanted noise while providing refined performance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Both engines featured piston skirts coated with a [[teflon]]-based friction-reducing material, and fitted with low-tension, low oil consumption rings. In addition, a new fail-safe cooling mode provided protection even in the case of a catastrophic coolant loss (such as a punctured radiator). In the event of coolant loss, the engine control unit shuts off fuel to alternate cylinders to reduce the risk of engine damage from overheating. The valves continue to operate, in order to pump cooling air through the cylinders. The cooling system was designed to maintain an ideal engine temperature even when subjected to a prolonged 15 percent gradient in 46&amp;nbsp;°C (115&amp;nbsp;°F) weather. A returnless fuel supply system helped to reduce evaporative emissions by providing consistent pressure to the [[fuel injector]]s through a high-pressure pump.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

New active hydraulic engine mounts were introduced to prevent the powertrain from inducing vibrations into the chassis. By optimizing these engine mounts, the engine block can act as a mass damper, absorbing chassis resonance, improving ride comfort.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Expedition's passenger cabin was better sealed than before, in an effort to eliminate intrusive outside noise from reaching the occupants. Wind, powertrain, road and vehicle body noise was reduced by improving interior acoustics through new damping materials, a total of 10 shear-style isolating body mounts, heavier sealing of body and panels, redesigned rubber door seals, and extensive use of interior structural acoustic foam in the upper B-pillars, upper and lower D-pillars and floor pan. Road noise was reduced by 2 [[decibels]], body air leakage reduced by 56 percent, chances for sealant noise disturbances reduced from 15 percent to less than 0.5 percent and wind noise measured at {{convert|80|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} was reduced from 35 [[sones]] to a world class level of 29 sones.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The Expedition also received a thorough exterior and interior cosmetic redesign. Expedition featured an all-new front fascia, grille work, headlamps, body trim, rear fascia, tail lamps and liftgate. Interior fit and finish were improved with an all-new interior featuring new dash, door panels, genuine aluminium trim, and plush carpeting. Premium perforated leather seating surfaces were standard on Expedition ''Eddie Bauer'' (optional on Expedition ''XLT''). Expedition ''FX4'' models featured all of Expedition's optional off-road equipment as standard equipment. Expedition's [[drag coefficient]] was 0.41 Cd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/specs/2003/2003_expedition_1.html |title=2003 Ford Expedition Specifications |publisher=Ford-trucks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three-row seating was standard with all-new manual fold-flat stow away third row seats. No longer did owners have to remove the third rows seats for more storage. The third row could simply "disappear" into the floor. Power assisted PowerFold fold-flat third row seating was available as an optional extra.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Available features included in-dash [[CD-ROM]] based [[navigation system]], [[DVD]] based rear entertainment system, [[ultrasonic sensor|ultrasonic]] rear park assist/back up sensors, power [[moon roof]], power adjustable accelerator and brake pedals (introduced on the first generation Expedition), Gentex auto dimming electrochromatic rear view mirror, [[Turn signals#Side marker lights and reflectors|lane departure indicators]] on side-view mirrors, second-row captain's chair luxury seating, premium audiophile sound system with in-dash six-disc [[CD changer]] and rear [[subwoofer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/specs/2003/2003_expedition_2.html |title=2002 Ford Expedition Special Features |publisher=Ford-trucks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and four-wheel independent pneumatic air-ride suspension system.

===Safety and security===

Like the generation before, a 2 air bag [[Supplementary Restraint System|supplementary restraint system]] (SRS) with 2-way occupant protection was standard on Expedition. The dual front SRS air bags now included the Personal Safety System (PSS). PSS would tailor air bag deployment for driver and first passenger and included occupant classification, seat position, crash severity, safety belt pretensioner, load-limiting retractor and safety belt buckle usage sensors.

A new optional 4 air bag supplementary restraint system (SRS) with 6-way occupant protection was also available. This new air bag system included ''SafetyCanopy'' [[Side curtain airbag|dual side curtain air bags]] for head, upper torso and rollover protection. SafetyCanopy would deploy along the A, B and C-pillars down to the vehicle's [[beltline (automotive)|beltline]]. SafetyCanopy could remain inflated after deployment for extended protection and replaced the dual front side airbags featured on the first-generation Expedition.

Other features included side-intrusion door beams, security approach lamps, [[SecuriLock]] with smart key and engine immobilizer, BeltMinder, three-point safety belts for all rows of seating, post-crash fuel pump shut-off, [[tire pressure monitoring system]] (TPMS) and four-wheel, four-sensor, four-channel anti-lock braking system (ABS) with [[electronic brakeforce distribution]] (EBD) and [[emergency brake assist]] (EBA). ''AdvanceTrac'' [[electronic stability control]] with [[traction control system]] was introduced as an optional extra. The electronic traction and stability mitigation system would expand to include ''roll stability control'' (RSC) for the 2005 model year.

===Model year changes===

====2003====
Before the 2003 model year ended, Ford updated the running boards on Expeditions equipped with the Eddie Bauer trim. Earlier in the model year, Eddie Bauer models had received standard black running boards. Toward the end of the model year, Arizona beige running boards were reintroduced to complement the Arizona beige body work which came standard on Eddie Bauer. Body colored running boards had previously been offered on the first-generation Expedition from 2000 to 2002.

====2004====
No major cosmetic or mechanical changes. The Expedition ''Eddie Bauer Premier'' model is reintroduced after being absent from the 2003 model trim line-up. Monochromatic paint work with blacked-out headlamps and special alloy wheels were standard on Eddie Bauer Premier versions. A new Expedition ''XLT Sport'' model is added with Dark Shadow grey exterior body trim. The ''FX4'' trim level was renamed ''NBX''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/specs/2004/2004_expedition.html |title=2004 FORD EXPEDITION OVERVIEW |publisher=Ford-trucks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2005====
Expedition received new roof rails which replaced the traditional sliding cross-bar roof racks. A new high end ''Limited'' trim level replaced the Eddie Bauer Premier model (though the regular Eddie Bauer was still available) and featured chrome accented roof rails, chrome-clad aluminium wheels, PowerFold power assisted stowable side view mirrors and chrome tipped exhaust. An upper high end ''King Ranch'' trim level with Castano leather seating was also introduced. The base 4.6 liter Triton V8 engine was dropped for the 2005 model year as the 5.4-liter Triton V8 was made standard on all Expeditions and updated with [[multi-valve|24-valve]] technology and [[variable valve timing]]. Along with the 2005 model V8 engine update, the Expedition also received a significantly updated version of the four-speed 4R70W automatic transmission.

The new four-speed automatic transmission, now called 4R75E, featured fully electronic Smart Shift technology. A turbine speed sensor improved transmission control and provided the basis for the fully electronic shift scheduling. The transmission's [[microprocessor]] speeds were improved for better responsiveness and precision of the control system. The transmission was continuously learning, and would calculate the torque in the next gear and schedule shift points based on the Expedition's projected performance in the next gear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meadowlandford.com/ford-transmission-specs.htm |title=New Ford Transmission Specs |publisher=Meadowlandford.com |accessdate=2009-05-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623071741/http://meadowlandford.com/ford-transmission-specs.htm |archivedate=2009-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2005 model Expeditions the 4R75E transmission is designated by the letter "'''B'''" on the manufacturers safety compliance certification label, located in the driver's-side doorjamb. For 2006 model Expeditions, the 4R75E transmission is designated by the letter "'''Q'''".

====2006====
No major cosmetic or mechanical changes. Last year model for the U222. The Gentex auto dimming rear view mirrors were updated. Two new exterior colors were added later on within the model year. They were Pewter metallic and Dark Copper metallic. Medium Flint grey interior was also added to Limited models later on within the model year. Chrome tipped exhaust was made standard on King Ranch models. 2006 would be the last year model for the NBX trim. The ultrasonic rear park assist and SafetyCanopy side curtain airbags were offered as standalone options. Adjustable headrests were also added to the front seats to replace the one piece units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/specs/2006/2006_ford_expedition.html |title=2006 Ford Expedition |publisher=Ford-trucks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russian Москва-Чукотка (Moscow-Chukotka) overland expedition====
On April 12, 2006, three second-generation full-size Ford Expedition ''Eddie Bauer'' vehicles completed a 32-day overland expedition. This was a {{convert|28000|mi|km|adj=on}} trip across North Asia and the Arctic Tundra. Six team members consisted of leaders, Alexey Mikhailov and Alexander Borodin, technical director, Andrey Rodionov, and professional off-road drivers,: Sergey Goryachev, Victor Parshikov, and Alexey Simakin. The route took them on [[permafrost]] and crossed the Arctic Circle twice. Visited landmarks included where American aviator [[Carl Ben Eielson]] was lost, and the birthplace of Russian explorer [[Semyon Dezhnev]]. The northernmost point on the route was latitude 69°42′ North ([[Pevek]]). The easternmost point visited was longitude 169°40′ West ([[Cape Dezhnev]]). Temperatures reached -36&amp;nbsp;°C (-32&amp;nbsp;°F) and the team encountered [[Whiteout (weather)|whiteouts]] and a [[polar cyclone]]. An estimated 200&amp;nbsp;kg (440&amp;nbsp;lbs) of snow was removed from each of the vehicles on the following day.&lt;ref name="Москва-Чукотка Overland Expedition"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moscow-chukotka.com/eng/ |title=Москва-Чукотка Overland Expedition |publisher=moscow-chukotka.com |accessdate=2013-07-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002075104/http://www.moscow-chukotka.com/eng/ |archivedate=2013-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vehicles were modified with front end guards along with front and rear utility bumpers, winches, safari roof racks, high-powered off-road lights and extra underbody plating for the engines. Two of the vehicles towed a dual axle [[Trailer (vehicle)|utility trailer]]. Two were equipped also with [[caterpillar track]] systems supplied by [[Mattracks]]. The rubber track systems were only used when off-road conditions became too demanding for conventional tires. The rear stabilizer bar failed on both vehicles fitted with the Mattracks system. The vehicles were also equipped with gas stoves (to prepare food) and high-capacity auxiliary fuel tanks (mounted in the rear cargo bay) and sometimes run on poor-quality gasoline.&lt;ref name="Москва-Чукотка Overland Expedition"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carsellers.ru/news/article/2639/ |title=Ford проложил трассу "Москва-Чукотка" |publisher=Carsellers.ru |date=2006-04-26 |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Ford introduced the third generation of the Expedition developed under the U324 program code name which was an updated version of the second generation Expedition. Most of the improvements were mechanical in nature, and included a sheet metal refresh and redesigned interior with upgraded materials A new long wheelbase ''Expedition EL'' in (U.S. only) and called the ''Expedition Max'' (in Canada and Mexico only) as an extended-length version to take on the [[Chevrolet Suburban]] and [[GMC Yukon XL]].
[[File:Motoršou 2009 - Flickr - Infodad (8).jpg|thumb|left|2008 Ford Expedition [[Funkmaster Flex]] edition]]
High-strength [[hydroformed]] fully boxed [[Ford T platform]] (chassis) was a modified version of the half-ton [[Ford P platform|Ford P2 platform]] from the [[Ford F-150]]. The new T1 platform replaced the old U platform, and provides 10 percent more torsional rigidity than the U platform. T1 incorporates a four-wheel independent long-travel suspension system (first introduced on the second generation) with redesigned suspension geometry and an all-new five-link rear suspension with new rear lower control-arms. As with previous model years, the suspension system could be had with adaptive pneumatic air-ride springs.

Ford's new 6-speed 6R75 intelligent automatic transmission with dual overdrive gears was introduced. The transmission featured push-button overdrive lock-out, electronic shift scheduling, adaptive shift algorithms and a mechatronic transmission control module (TCM) that would save adaptive shift data in keep alive memory (KAM). This safeguarded against complete data loss in case of a power failure (such as disconnecting the battery). In the event of a power failure, the mechatronic unit would simply read the last saved data entry from the system's memory, thus, the transmission did not have to completely relearn] the owner's driving style.

Additionally, the Expedition is powered by the same 5.4 liter Triton V8 engine, rated at {{Convert|300|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} and 365&amp;nbsp;lbf·ft (495 N·m) of torque from the previous generation. When properly equipped with the heavy-duty trailer towing package the SUV can tow up to 9,200&amp;nbsp;lbs (4,130&amp;nbsp;kg). Expedition is classed under the Tier 2, Bin 5 / ULEV 2 [[Ultra Low Emission Vehicle]] environmental classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/specs/2007/2007_ford_expedition_1.html |title=2007 Ford Expedition Chassis |publisher=Ford-trucks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Off-road geometry figures for approach, departure and ramp breakover angles are 22°, 21° and 18° respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordvehicles.com/suvs/expedition/specifications/ |title=2010 Ford Expedition &amp;#124; View Full Specification Library |publisher=FordVehicles.com |accessdate=2010-07-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714050608/http://www.fordvehicles.com/suvs/expedition/specifications/ |archivedate=2010-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Minimum running (lowest point) ground clearance is {{convert|8.7|in|mm}}. Underbody (overall) ground clearance is 9.1 inches (230&amp;nbsp;mm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carsplusplus.com/specs2011/ford_expedition.php |title=Ford Expedition 2011 |publisher=carsplusplus.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selectable automatic full-time [[Control Trac]] four-wheel drive continues to be offered, and uses a two-speed dual range BorgWarner 4417 transfer case with intelligent locking center multi-disc differential and "torque biasing" capability. Four-wheel electronic traction control is standard and off-road underbody [[skid plate]] armor is optional. A new default off-road program with throttle response recalibration was added, and is automatically activated when Four Low (lock) mode is selected. Expedition can achieve an off-road [[crawl ratio]] of 41.06:1 with a low range ratio of 2.64:1 and rear axle ratio of 3.73:1.

The SUV also underwent a nip/tuck with a few cosmetic enhancements, both inside and out. Expedition's front end now featured Ford's signature three "hollow-bar" grille to complement the SUV's truck close relation to the F-150 and Super Duty pickups. New complex stepped style multifaceted headlamps, side view mirrors with updated [[LED]] lane departure indicators, sleeker body work and redesigned tail lamps were also added. The interior received a new dash with F-150-like center stack, center console, redesigned first row captains chair luxury seating, door panels and interior trim.

To further reduce outside noise intrusion for quieter, more isolated ride comfort, new SoundScreen laminated acoustic and solar tinted windshield&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/ford-64090-lincoln-soundscreen.html |title=Ford Products to Launch with Carlite's SoundScreen Noise-Reducing Glass Technology |publisher=Orange County Register |agency=PR Newswire |date=2008-08-25 |accessdate=2015-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; was added with thicker laminated side window glass.

The new SUV was unveiled at the [[Houston Auto Show]] rather than at the [[North American International Auto Show]], the [[Greater Los Angeles Auto Show]], or the [[New York International Auto Show]] where most new models are, as 20 percent of all Expedition sales are in [[Texas]]. The third generation Expedition went on sale in August 2006. The first 2007 Expedition to roll off a Ford assembly line was donated by Ford to the Peter family of [[Jamaica, Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]] as part of an episode of the [[American Broadcasting Company]] series ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]'' that aired May 7, 2006.

In late 2014, the third generation standard wheelbase U324 Expedition and long-wheelbase U354 Expedition EL/Max underwent a [[Ford Expedition#2015|cosmetic and mechanical refresh for the 2015 model year]].

===Model year changes===
====2008====
For the 2008 model year, power deployable/retractable running boards became available, along with a rear view backup camera system. The camera, which is mounted under the Expedition's center liftgate appliqué, utilizes the [[Gentex]] auto dimming rear view mirror's picture-in-mirror technology to display what it sees. Expedition ''King Ranch'' was also reintroduced after being absent from the 2007 model year trim line-up. Expedition ''XLT'' models now get body colored lower body work, replacing the previous black plastic trim and was the Last Ford Model Year for the nine-passenger Front Bench seating option in the Ford Full-Size SUV's from Ford Motor Company (Ford discontinued the 9-passenger Front Bench Seating Option for 2009 and Forward on the old Ford Full-Size SUVs 2009–present)

====2009====
In July 2008, Ford's [[Michigan Assembly Plant|Wayne, Michigan plant]] started production of the 2009 models until finishing the plants run in December of that same year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trucktrend.com/features/news/2008/163_news081201_ford_ends_operations_at_michigan_truck_plant_to_retool_for_2011_small_cars/index.html "Ford Ends Operations at Michigan Truck Plant to Retool for 2011 Small Cars"] From Truck Trend (December 1, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009 production of the Expedition was relocated to the [[Kentucky Truck Assembly]] in Louisville along with its sister SUV, the [[Lincoln Navigator]], and the [[Ford F-Series]] Super Duty. That plant used to build the Ford Excursion until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trucktrend.com/features/news/2009/163_news090428_ford_kentucky_truck_plant_reopens/index.html |title=Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant Reopens with Flexible Body Shop From |work=Truck Trend |date=April 28, 2009 |accessdate=2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expedition's 6-speed 6R75 automatic was replaced by an improved version, the 6-speed 6R80 automatic. 6R80 features more robust internals, new software logic and a tow/haul mode (replaces the overdrive lock-out) that utilizes new uphill/downhill gradient shift logic for improved performance while towing or hauling heavy loads. The 6-speed automatic can compensate for altitude, grade/slope and present load conditions. The system also reduces the transmission's tendency to "hunt" for the right gear(s) and provides engine braking when descending hills. The nine-passenger front bench seating option has been discontinued for the 2009 model year, leaving only the eight-passenger seating option left with two front bucket seats and two rear bench seats. and the chrome "Expedition" name plate badges have been removed from the left and right front doors. The chrome "Expedition" name plate badge on the rear liftgate remains.

Additional features included the now standard [[Flexible-fuel vehicle|FlexFuel capability]], which can take gasoline, [[E85]] (85% ethanol/15% gasoline), or any combination of the two, and the newly installed EasyFuel capless fuel-filler system. The 5.4 liter V8/FlexFuel feature also upgraded its power to {{convert|310|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while the torque rating stayed the same at {{convert|365|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. The 2009 model year also boosted its maximum towing capacity to {{convert|9200|lb|abbr=on}} for the 4x2 version, and up to {{convert|9000|lb|abbr=on}} for the 4x4 version.

The new entertainment features added to the 2009 model year included the optional [[Ford Sync|Ford SYNC]], and an all-new DVD-based voice-activated, [[In car entertainment|multi-entertainment/navigational system]] with liquid crystal touch display. The rearview camera system is now integrated to show the video feed through the navigation screen instead for the rearview mirror, however, the rearview mirror is still used to show images on Expeditions not equipped with the navigation system. The new navigation system features up to 10 gigabytes of storage space for more than 2400 songs, a jukebox function, a screened photo display, [[iPod]]/[[Zune]] capability for downloading and recharging, ripping CDs, and integrated compatibility for cellphones and Bluetooth; the newly compatible [[Sirius XM|Sirius Travel Link]], which allow drivers to access traffic, weather, sports, and local movie listings; and a "Route Guidance" mode for road and street information. The steering wheel also has a tilt feature and radio controls, including Ford SYNC buttons, allowing the driver to press the button and use voice commands to activate the system, which became standard on Eddie Bauer, Limited, and King Ranch. The tilt w/radio control feature was optional on the XLT during its Wayne plant built orders, but after production moved to Louisville it became standard. For accessory purposes, a HD radio can be installed upon request at a Ford dealership in the United States. New for 2009 were standard heated second row outboard seats on the Limited and King Ranch models only with either the second row bench seat or the optional bucket seats.

====2010====
No major cosmetic or mechanical changes. For the 2010 model year optional packages have now been renamed (to Rapid Specificated Order Codes) and upgraded (100s for XLT, 200s for Eddie Bauer, 300s for Limited, 400s for King Ranch) for the newer models. It has also announced that the 2010 models will now feature Ford's MyKey and trailer sway control as a standard on all trims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/buy/2010-Ford-Expedition+EL/overview/ |title=2010 Ford Expedition EL |publisher=Autoblog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 models were ranked 6th among the top 11 affordable large size SUVs in "[[US News &amp; World Report]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/Ford_Expedition/ |title=from US News &amp; World Report (August 2009) |publisher=Usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A diesel version for the 2010 model year did not get past the planning stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.leftlanenews.com/44l-diesel-powered-ford-expedition-spied.html |title=4.4L Diesel-powered Ford Expedition spied |work=Left Lane News |date=April 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rain-sensing]] windshield wipers were added as an optional extra for Eddie Bauer, but standard on the Limited and King Ranch versions.

====2011====
No major cosmetic or mechanical changes. [[HD Radio]] became a standard on all trims, and a dual DVD system that placed at the headrest area became an optional feature. Another change that was made was in the entry-level trim department, with the Expedition offering the newly designated standard XL entry level with lower black cladding, while the XLT level trim was upgraded along with a new XLT Premium trim with gold cladding, replacing the Eddie Bauer level trim. Also, silver cladding was added as an exterior trim as part of a newly optional XLT Premium Sport Appearance Package. Both Limited and King Ranch trims receive new paint and interior trim. The limited trim also has a chrome grille for a change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=2129&amp;item_id=5796&amp;press_section_id=2870 "2011 Expedition Overview"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005091602/http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=2129&amp;item_id=5796&amp;press_section_id=2870 |date=2012-10-05 }} from media.ford.com (July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012====
[[File:Black &amp; White Ford Expedition 2012.JPG|thumb|2012 Ford Expedition]]
No major cosmetic or mechanical changes. The second heated row seating option was added to XLT Premium and the front park assists became a standard feature on the Limited and King Ranch trims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.ford.com/images/10031/2012_Expedition.pdf 2012 Ford Expedition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813171305/http://media.ford.com/images/10031/2012_Expedition.pdf |date=2012-08-13 }} from media.ford.com&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013====
No major cosmetic changes; however the XL trim and XLT Sport options were dropped, leaving only the XLT, XLT Premium, Limited, and King Ranch trims. Updates made to the 2013 models (which went on sale in August 2012) included the [[Ford Expedition#Heavy-duty trailer towing package|TowCommand]] trailer brake controller system that is bundled with the heavy-duty trailer towing package, a new internal shift control module which allows the six-speed automatic transmission to tailor shifts to engine demand, 10 equipment levels, three new colors (Blue Jeans Metallic, Kodiak Brown Metallic and Ruby Red Metallic Tinted Clearcoat), and a new 20-inch chrome-clad aluminum wheels that was available on both the ''Limited'' and ''King Ranch'' trims. The latter trim also featured chrome roof racks and side mirrors. Another notable change can be found on the driver's instrumental panel, with the temperature and fuel gauge trading sides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.ford.com/images/10031/2013_Expedition.pdf 2013 Ford Expedition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904234744/http://media.ford.com/images/10031/2013_Expedition.pdf |date=2012-09-04 }} from media.ford.com&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014====
No major cosmetic changes. Only three trims, XLT, Limited and King Ranch are offered. The Sirius XM with Navlink and HD radio is added to the XLT as an optional feature. A new, quieter, mechanical [[Nivomat]] adaptive hydraulic load-leveling suspension system is available, in place of the adaptive pneumatic air-ride load-leveling suspension. When properly equipped the Expedition continues to offer top-end towing capability with a braked trailer towing capacity of 9,200&amp;nbsp;lbs (4,173&amp;nbsp;kg or 4.6 tons).

====2015====
[[File:'15 Ford Expedition.jpg|thumb|Facelifted 2015 Ford Expedition]]
On February 18, 2014, Ford introduced a [[Facelift (automobile)|mid-cycle refresh]] of the Expedition (U324) and Expedition EL (U354), dubbed the U3242 and U3542 respectively, for the 2015 model year.&lt;ref name="2015 Ford Expedition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wot.motortrend.com/2015-ford-expedition-interior-spied-421189.html |title=2015 Ford Expedition |publisher=motortrend.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "2" signifying the second phase of the U324 and U354. The debut was at the Dallas-Fort Worth Auto Show on February 19, 2014; because Texas (especially Dallas and Houston) is an important market. Despite a 27% drop in sales since 2008, Ford is committed to continuing producing the Expeditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/terry-box/20140218-new-ford-expedition-to-be-introduced-at-2014-dfw-auto-show.ece "New Ford Expedition to be introduced today as 2014 DFW Auto Show opens"] From [[Dallas Morning News]] (February 19, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Ford started production on the updated Expedition (and Expedition EL, which will continue to compete with the Suburban and Yukon XL) around the first quarter of 2014 and placed the 2015 models in dealerships in July 2014. Ford announced that the three level trims, XLT, Limited, and King Ranch, will continue to be offered along with a new top of the line Platinum trim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2014/02/18/2015-ford-expedition-revealed-official/ "2015 Ford Expedition stays the course, adds EcoBoost power"] from Autoblog (February 18, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; On September 12, 2013, (which was the same day that GM unveiled their next generation SUVs), Automobile Magazine posted a spy shot of the 2015 Expedition, which showed a repositioned tailpipe, and a more upright front fascia which bore a taller, wider grille that appeared inspired by the F-150 and Ford F-Series Super Duty trucks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rumors.automobilemag.com/2015-ford-expedition-spied-245407.html#axzz2euaeD4tP 2015 Ford Expedition Spied] from [[Automobile Magazine]] (September 12, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Official photos released on February 18, 2014 revealed an all-new aggressive [[armadillo]]-like three-bar grille, which features step-stacked bars that evoke the appearance of stepped armor-plating on an armadillo's back. All-new thinner headlamps were added, in addition to an all-new front bumper with oversized lower air intake. The new bumper also features a lower chrome bar and twin LED fog lamps that flank the chrome bar. Brightwork was added on the rear liftgate; and the tailpipe was repositioned straight, instead of making a 90 degree turn behind the right rear wheel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/photos/2015-ford-expedition/ 2015 Ford Expedition photos] from Autoblog (February 18, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Expedition remained a [[body-on-frame]] (BOF), allowing the SUV to retain its heavy-duty truck underpinnings for towing and hauling needs.&lt;ref name="https://www.motoring2.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://motoring2.com/2013/07/ford-readies-hybrid-power-for-next-f-150-expedition-navigator/ |title=Ford readies hybrid power for next F-150, Expedition, Navigator |publisher=motoring2.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leftlanenews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/next-lincoln-navigator-to-ditch-v8-for-ecoboost-v6.html |title=Ford's Expedition and Lincoln Navigator |publisher=www.leftlanenews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full-size SUV received the 3.5 liter 24-valve [[DOHC]] [[Variable Cam Timing|Ti-VCT]] [[EcoBoost]] V6 engine which features an aluminium engine block, [[twin-turbo]]chargers, [[Direct fuel injection|direct injection]], and twin independent [[variable camshaft timing]]. Power output for the [[EcoBoost]] V6 will be rated around 365 horsepower and 420&amp;nbsp;lb-ft of torque, and will be the only engine featured, dropping the 5.4 liter V8 that was available in the 2007–2014 models due to Ford wanting to make the Expedition more fuel efficient. Despite the changeover from V8 to V6, the Expedition did boost its MPG to 16 (city)/23 (highway) for the 2WD and 15 (city)/21 (highway) for the 4WD, but it is now on par with the GM large-size SUVs, which also boasts the same MPGs as the Expedition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2014/07/21/2015-ford-expedition-review-first-drive/ "2015 Ford Expedition"] from Autoblog (July 21, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the new engine, Expedition received an updated 6-speed 6R80 SelectShift intelligent [[manumatic]] gearbox with manual shift mode. Expedition also features a new [[Electric power steering#Electric systems|electric power servo-assisted steering]] and Pull-Drift Compensation (PDC) which [[Crosswind stabilization|detects crosswinds and compensates for it]].

The interior remained similar to the outgoing models, but with upgraded materials and a revised prominent center stack, which introduces the latest version of the 8-inch [[MyFord Touch]] touchscreen [[infotainment]] and [[telematics]] system. [[Push-button start|Push-to-start engine ignition]] with intelligent access was added and the four-wheel drive mode selector (for models with 4x4) was revised and repositioned. The [[Ford Expedition#Heavy-duty trailer towing package|TowCommand]] paddle controls were repositioned over the four-wheel drive mode selector, to make way for revised audio and climate controls on the center stack.&lt;ref name="2015 Ford Expedition"/&gt;

The new features for 2015 included an optional, revised four-wheel independent suspension system with intelligent continuously-controlled damping (CCD) system that alters suspension settings constantly based on 46 parameters and offers comfort, normal, and sport modes. Expedition is the first Ford vehicle in North America to have continuously-controlled damping. Other new optional features includes [[Blind spot monitor#Blind Spot Information System|blind-spot information system]] (BLIS) with cross-traffic alert, and a rearview camera and apps for the infotainment system to help with towing and off-road driving, all of which is standard in the Platinum trim, whose seating and interior features include Brunello leather, a red wine color with tuxedo-stripe accents and French seamed stitching, or black leather with Agate Gray accents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truckinweb.com/webonly/1402_2015_ford_expedition_ecoboost_platinum/ 2015 Ford Expedition:EcoBoost and Platinum] from ''Truckin' Magazine'' (February 19, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The selectable automatic full-time ''ControlTrac'' four-wheel drive system continues to be offered, but gains a trio of new off-road electronic systems in the form of Hill Ascent Assist (HAA), [[Hill Descent Control system|Hill Descent Control]] (HDC), and Ford Truck Apps (FTA). FTA gives off-road orientation/geometry, 4x4 system status, and traction control system status in real-time. The four-wheel electronic traction control system (brake differential locking control) was recalibrated to take into account the new [[EcoBoost]] V6's higher torque output and earlier torque delivery.

'''EcoBoost Performance'''

The heavyweight 6,155&amp;nbsp;lb (3+ ton) as tested, 2015 Expedition ''Platinum'' with 3.5 EcoBoost V6 and selectable automatic full-time ControlTrac four-wheel drive was clocked from [[0 to 60]] mph in 6.4 seconds. The full-size SUV can clip 100&amp;nbsp;mph in 18.2 seconds, 110&amp;nbsp;mph in 24.3 seconds, and is electronically safety-limited to 113&amp;nbsp;mph. Expedition has a near perfect 50:50 front:rear balanced weight distribution and [[center of gravity]] positioned at 28.5 inches.&lt;ref name="2015 Ford Expedition Platinum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/2015-chevrolet-tahoe-ltz-vs-2015-ford-expedition-platinum-comparison-test |title=2015 Ford Expedition Platinum |publisher=caranddriver.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expedition ''Platinum'' averaged 39.2&amp;nbsp;mph in a 610&amp;nbsp;ft slalom run and pulled 0.78g in roadholding [[skidpad]] testing. High speed emergency braking from 70&amp;nbsp;mph to 0 (full stop) was completed in 170&amp;nbsp;ft. In comparison, the Expedition's main rival took a full 10 feet longer, completing the same emergency brake test in 180&amp;nbsp;ft.&lt;ref name="2015 Ford Expedition Platinum"/&gt;

====2016====
For the 2016 model year, most of the features that were introduced from 2015 were carried over. However, the Expedition began adding Ford's upgraded enhanced SYNC3 to its trims, as an optional feature on the XLT and standard on Limited, King Ranch and Platinum. The Limited added Sony's Premium Audio System as a standard.

====2017====
In June 2016, Ford began selling the 2017 model year Expedition, with no major changes being made and continued to be offered in XLT, Limited, King Ranch, and Platinum level trims. This is the final year of the third generation Expedition and Expedition EL  (U324) and (U354)

The fourth-generation Expedition, known internally at Ford Motor Company as the "U553", was unveiled on February 7, 2017 at the [[Dallas Cowboys]] training facility, Ford Center in [[Frisco, Texas]], ahead of its [[Chicago Auto Show]] debut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leftlanenews.com/redesigned-ford-expedition-loses-weight-gains-power-94451.html "Chicago Live:2018 Ford Expedition"] from Left Lane News (February 9, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Production of the new Expedition started on September 25, 2017. The vehicles arrived at dealerships in November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donlen.com/buildstart-trucks-ford.html |title=Ford-Lincoln Trucks (Build Out Final Order Start Up Dates) - Donlen Corporation |website=Donlen.com |date=2013-01-24 |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.just-auto.com/analysis/ford-and-lincoln-future-models-into-the-2020s_id170361.aspx |title=Ford and Lincoln future models into the 2020s|publisher=just-auto.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The all-new Expedition was developed in secret under the U553 program codename and features [[body-on-frame]] (BOF) architecture with high-strength lightweight material construction consisting of [[boron steel]] and aluminium.&lt;ref name="The F-150's Aluminum Diet"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/automobiles/autoshow/the-f-150s-aluminum-diet.html?_r=0 |title=The F-150's Aluminum Diet |publisher=autonews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four-door body is constructed from alumimium-alloy, while the frame is constructed from boron steel. The U553 will move to the all-new half-ton [[hydroformed]] T3 platform ([[chassis]]), which is a modified version of the half-ton platform underpinning the P552 2015 Ford F-150. The T3 platform will use a new four-wheel independent suspension system design. Updated powertrain systems (engines and transmissions) including a [[Hybrid electric vehicle|Hybrid]] variant with proprietary parallel [[Parallel hybrid#Parallel hybrid|hybrid electric-drive system]] to help increase fuel efficiency are expected.&lt;ref name="https://www.motoring2.com"/&gt; Expedition will gain Ford's new 10-speed 10R80 ''[[Manumatic|SelectShift]]'' automatic transmission which will feature [[artificially intelligent]] shifting, electronic range select, manual shift mode, and be controlled via a rotary dial on the center console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2014/12/exclusive-inside-look-fords-new-10-speed-transmission/ |title=Exclusive: An Inside Look At Ford's New 10 Speed Transmission |publisher=thetruthaboutcars.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next-generation Expedition's chief engineer is Jackie Marshall DiMarco, who is also the chief engineer for the next-generation F-150 pickup.&lt;ref name="Interview: Jackie Marshall DiMarco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trucktrend.com/features/consumer/163_1304_jackie_marshall_dimarco_ford_interview/ |title=Interview: Jackie Marshall DiMarco, Ford chief engineer, F-150 and Expedition |publisher=trucktrend.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spy photographers captured early, engineering test mules of the U553 in late 2015, which sported a crude highly modified non-production intent F-150 SuperCrew body atop the production intent T3 platform chassis. In late 2016, spy photographers managed to capture photos of the actual first pre-production prototypes of the U553, wearing the production intent body on the production intent platform. The styling and appearance of the U553 Expedition is inspired by the U502 Explorer along with elements of the P552 F-150, the vehicle on which the new Expedition is based, and will have a more aerodynamic and streamlined silhouette, with raked windshield and sloped roofline which will lead to a rear liftgate spoiler. The U553 Expedition's C-pillar will be more forward slanted, echoing the forward slanted C-pillar of the U502 Explorer introduced for 2011. In addition the Expedition's body will feature sculpted sides with character lines, similar to the U502 Explorer, as opposed to the straight slab sides of the current Expedition. Expedition's front grill and headlamp design is inspired by the facelifted P552 F-150, with the front bumper retaining a similar design and appearance to its predecessor, the U324 Expedition, after its facelift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kbb.com/car-news/all-the-latest/2018-ford-expedition-remake-spotted/2100001092/ |title=2018 Ford Expedition Remake Spotted|publisher=kbb.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also expanded the standard size version's wheelbase by 3 inches and its length by 4 inches while decreasing the height by one inch (losing 300 pounds in the process) in order to allow more leg room and space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2018-ford-expedition-photos-and-info-news "2018 Ford Expedition: Bigger, Aluminumier, EcoBoostier"] from Car and Driver (February 8, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

Expedition (U553) will be one of the very first vehicles in North America to use a new next-generation high speed [[Controller Area Network]] 3 (CAN-3) vehicle data bus system. The CAN-3 electrical architecture is akin to a human nervous system and allows the Expedition's various on-board microprocessors and electronic vehicle control systems to communicate or "talk" to one another through electronic data that is sent and received. With high speed CAN-3, Expedition can learn and react faster than before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sae.org/15244/ |title=All-new 2018 Ford Expedition gets aluminum body, 10-speed - SAE International |website=Articles.sae.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.co.za/how-to-fix/your-cars-nervous-system/ |format=PDF |title=Your Car's Nervous System |website=Popularmechanics.co.za |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Expedition will be available with selectable automatic full-time four-wheel drive that routes torque through a two-speed dual range [[transfer case]] with electronic locking center multi-disc differential. A new [[Locking differential|electronic locking rear differential]] will be available to augment the 4x4 system. Both the center and rear locking systems will be teamed with four-wheel electronic traction control (ETC), which simulates a locking front differential by ABS "brake locking" the front differential. Expedition's off-road electronic aids Hill Descent Control (HDC) and Hill Ascent Assist (HAA) will be joined by the Terrain Management System adapted from the [[Ford Raptor]]. Terrain Management is capable of working with 4L mode, like the Ford Raptor, and has 7 (seven) drive modes to choose from which include Normal, Eco, Sport, Tow/Haul, Gravel/Snow, Mud/Ruts, and Sand. The four-wheel drive system has 3 (three) direct drive modes which include 2H, 4A, and 4L. The 4H mode has now been dropped from the selection, as the Terrain Management computer now controls the electronic center lock of the four-wheel drive system. Terrain Management will engage the electronic center lock for a 50:50 front:rear torque split while in 4A direct drive mode, when the Mud/Ruts or Sand modes are selected. The 4L direct drive mode engages the electronic center lock regardless of the off-road drive mode selected. A "tap to lock/unlock" button is located near the drive mode dial for operation of the electronic rear lock.&lt;ref name="motorauthority.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Brandon Turkus |url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1108753_2018-ford-expedition-goes-aluminum |title=2018 Ford Expedition goes aluminum |website=Motorauthority.com |date=2017-02-09 |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Off-road geometry figures for approach, departure, and ramp breakover, improve slightly with 23.3°, 21.9°, and 21.4° of obstacle clearance. Minimum running (lowest point) ground clearance increases by a full inch, from 8.7 to 9.8 inches.&lt;ref name="ford.com"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.ford.com/suvs/expedition/2018/models/expedition-platinum/ |title=2018 Ford Expedition |website=ford.com |date=2017-10-09 |accessdate=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expedition (U553) is [[certified]] by the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]]' independent SAE J2807 towing standard to tow a maximum 9,300&amp;nbsp;lbs (4,218&amp;nbsp;kg or 4.65 tons) of braked trailer. The tow rating increases by 100&amp;nbsp;lbs over the previous generation and continues to be the highest tow rating among full-size SUVs.&lt;ref name="thecarconnection.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Aaron Cole |url=http://www.thecarconnection.com/news/1110639_most-capable-full-size-suv-for-towing-the-2018-ford-expedition-again |title=Most capable full-size SUV for towing?

Among the new features that have been incorporated into the fourth generation Expedition includes a 360-degree camera and park assist system that can make parking much easier, along with optional safety features that will use both camera and radar technology, and include automatic braking, lane-keep assist, active cruise control, and blind-spot monitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumerreports.org/suvs/preview-2018-ford-expedition/ "Preview: 2018 Ford Expedition"] from Consumer Reports (February 8, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are two USB ports per row, four 12-volt outlets and a 120-volt household outlet. Ford has also partnered up with Sling that enables the twin-screen rear entertainment system, as well as personal tablets on the vehicle's Wi-Fi, to watch cable TV content. The Wi-Fi content can be used up to 10 devices and features Apple Car Play and Android Auto capabilities that is compatible to Ford SYNC3 and Ford Pass. There is also at least 40 different spaces and cup holders to allow items to be stored. A dual vista panoramic sunroof is available as an optional feature.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cars.com/articles/2018-ford-expedition-review-first-impressions-and-photo-gallery-1420693398935/ "2018 Ford Expedition Review: First Impressions and Photo Gallery"] from Cars.com (February 10. 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth generation Expedition will only be available in four level trims as the King Ranch trim (from 2005–2017) was discontinued after the 2017 model year. The three primary trims, XLT, Limited, and the top-of-the-line Platinum, will be available to regular customers, while the fourth trim, XL, will only be exclusive to rental companies, corporate fleets, and government agencies, as they will not have a lot of the features as the aforementioned three trims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2017/02/07/2018-ford-expedition-max-aluminum-details/ "The 2018 Ford Expedition goes aluminum and gets bigger"] from Autoblog (February 7, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; The Expedition will still retain its unique (standard) eight passenger seating on all trims like before, with optional seven passenger seating.&lt;ref name="motorauthority.com"/&gt; The MSRP has been listed by Ford for the fourth generation Expedition will be higher than the previous generation, starting at around $52,000 (US) for XLT and $63,000 (US) for Limited level trims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carsdirect.com/automotive-news/2018-ford-expedition-priced-from-52-890-will-range-to-nearly-80k "2018 Ford Expedition Priced From $52,890, Will Range To Nearly $80k"] from Cars Direct (June 20, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ford Expedition (23764739745).jpg|thumb|left|Ford Expedition EL/Max (United Arab Emirates)]]
[[File:'15 Ford Expedition EL -- Front.jpg|left|thumb|2015 Ford Expedition EL (U354)]]

As part of the shift to the T1 platform for the 2007 model year, Ford developed an extended-length version of the Expedition, to more closely match the Chevrolet Suburban/GMC Yukon XL in size. Introduced as the ''Ford Expedition EL'' (EL=extended length alongside the Lincoln Navigator L, the variant effectively replaced the Super Duty-based [[Ford Excursion]].  In Canada, to avoid confusion with the [[Acura EL]] sedan, Ford renamed the extended-length version as the ''Expedition Max''.

Originally intended to carry the [[Ford Everest]] name, Ford product planners changed their minds, as the nameplate was already in use for a midsize Ford SUV in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/GeneralFuture/articleId=105986|title=Spy Shots: 2007 Ford Everest from|last=Jacquot|first=Josh|date=|publisher=Edmunds.com|accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Outside North America, including the [[U.S. territories]] of [[Puerto Rico]], [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], and [[Guam]], the Expedition EL is also imported to and sold in the Middle East and Taiwan.  In the Philippines, the Expedition EL is the only version imported and sold; coincidentally, it is also a market where the Ford Everest SUV is sold.

===Expedition EL/Max (2007–2017)===
For the 2007 [[model year]], Ford introduced the extended-length Expedition EL/Max.  With a wheelbase stretched 12 inches (to 131 inches) and a length increased 14.8 inches (to 221.3 inches) over the standard Expedition, the EL/Max is sized comparably to the Suburban/Yukon XL, providing additional cargo space over the standard-wheelbase version.  The extended-length body of the EL/Max is distinguished by its longer cargo-area windows and its rear door design (the rear wheels no longer intrude into the lower half of the doors).

Alongside the standard-length Ford Expedition, the EL/Max was offered with a single powertrain; the 5.4L Triton V8 was standard from 2007 to 2014, replaced by the twin-turbocharged 3.5L EcoBoost V6 for 2015 to 2017.  The EL/Max is also sold with both rear-wheel and four-wheel drive configurations.  The larger overall size restricted towing capacity by approximately 300 pounds, to {{convert|8900|lb|abbr=on}} (for 2WD) and {{convert|8700|lb|abbr=on}} (for 4WD) over a standard-wheelbase example.

Over its first-generation, the EL/Max shared its features with the standard-length Expedition; for 2012 model, a cargo organizer became an exclusive feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/ford-expedition-el.html#overview |title=2010 Ford Expedition EL overview from www.leftlanenews.com (May 26, 2009) |publisher=leftlanenews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Expedition EL was introduced in 4 trim lines: XLT, Eddie Bauer, Limited, and the King Ranch series during the 2007–2010 model year.  For 2011, the Eddie Bauer trim was replaced by XLT and XLT Premium, with XL becoming the new base trim level.  After 2012, all versions of the XL trim were dropped.

For 2015, the EL/Max received the same facelift and upgrades as the standard-length Expedition.

For its second generation, the Expedition EL became known as the Expedition Max (now stylized with all capitals as '''MAX''') along with the rest of the world. It debuted in November 2017 for the 2018 model year. Like the standard size Expedition, this was also unveiled ahead of the Chicago Auto Show and carried the same features and the three featured trims, XLT, Limited, and Platinum. It also expanded its length size by one inch to allow more space and legroom in the third seat row. Although the rear passenger doors were widened, the aft wheel well trim still doesn't cut into them.

[[File:Ford Expedition MAX Back P4220634.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view]]

This version became more competitive with the Suburban/Yukon XL in the long wheelbase SUV segment, an area where GM dominates; when photos for the fourth generation Expedition were released, a majority of the pictures and videos indicated where Ford wants to target the Max. Like the (standard length) Expedition, the (extended length) Expedition Max also retained its (standard) eight passenger seating on all trims like before. The Max also saw a starting MSRP range of $55,000 (US) for the XLT and $66,800 (US) for the Limited level trims, making this more expensive than the Suburban but on par with the Yukon XL in terms of pricing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/photos/2018-ford-expedition-and-expedition-max/ "2018 Ford Expedition and Expedition Max (Photos)"] from Autoblog (February 7, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2017/06/the-2018-ford-expedition-is-getting-a-major-price-hike.html "The 2018 Ford Expedition is Getting a Major Price Hike"] from Autoguide.com (June 21, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availability==
===Full Size Expedition===
The standard size Expedition are sold in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the [[U.S. territories]] of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands|the CNMI]], U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam, Republic of China (Taiwan), the Philippines, the Middle East (excluding Israel), Central America, the Caribbean, South America (except Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela), Asia (Cambodia, Laos, Mongolia and South Korea), Africa (Algeria, Angola, Cape Verde, Egypt, Gabon, Ghana, Libya, Madagascar, Morocco, Nigeria and Senegal), and Central Asia (Armenia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fleet.ford.com/global/pdfs/AllRegions.pdf |format=PDF |title=Global Fleet :Product Guide 2012 |website=Fleet.ford.ca |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2015 refresh, the standard size Expedition became exclusive to the United States, Canada, Mexico, Republic of China (Taiwan), and the Middle East. The US and Canadian Expeditions are available in XLT, Limited, King Ranch and Platinum, while The Mexican Expedition offers the XLT, Limited, and King Ranch trims. The Middle East Expeditions are offered in XL, XLT, Limited, King Ranch, and in Platinum (RWD only) trims.

With the introduction of the fourth generation Expedition, Ford will make the SUV available to North America in the Fall of 2017 first, followed by a global launch in early 2018, where it will go on sale in selected countries.

===Expedition EL/Max===
For the Expedition EL/Max, all six versions (XL, XLT/Eddie Bauer, XLT Platinum/Sport, Limited, King Ranch and Platinum) are available in the United States. From the 2007 to 2010 model years, The EL/Max level trims were limited to only 3 versions for Canada, Republic of China (Taiwan), and The Middle East, two for Mexico, and one for the Philippines. Canada's Expedition Max offered the Eddie Bauer, Limited and King Ranch trims, Mexico's Expedition Max in Limited and King Ranch trims, and the Middle East's EL level trims in XLT, Eddie Bauer and Limited. The Philippines' lone Expedition EL level trim was the Eddie Bauer model from 2007 to 2010.

After the 2011 model year Ford made changes in the international exportation of the EL/Max trims. As a result of the changes, the Limited trim became the only version available in Canada and Mexico as Eddie Bauer (in Canada) and King Ranch trims (in both Canada and Mexico) were discontinued, while the Philippines and the Middle East replaced the Eddie Bauer with the XLT trim. The Middle East also started to get all of the 5 US level base trims, including the new XL trims that took the XLT's place and the King Ranch trim.

With the 2015 refresh, the Expedition EL US level trims are the same as the standard versions: XLT, Limited, King Ranch, and Platinum, all four available in rear wheel and four wheel drive. The Canadian Expedition Max are only featured in Limited and Platinum level trims, also available in RWD and 4WD. Mexico's Expedition Max are available in rear wheel drive XLT only, but available in RWD and 4WD Limited versions. The Philippines, Republic of China (Taiwan), and Middle East ELs are only available in 4WD Limited trims.

With the introduction of the Expedition Max for the 2018 model year as the successor to the first generation Expedition EL, Ford made the vehicle available globally, with North America in late 2017 and selected countries in early 2018.

==Four-wheel drive system==

Selectable automatic full-time [[Control Trac]] four-wheel drive designed by [[BorgWarner]] is standard on all 4x4 Expeditions. There are four modes: Two High mode, Auto mode, Four High mode and Four Low mode. Each mode can be selected via a rotary control dial on the dash.

The Expedition's system uses a two-speed dual range BorgWarner [[transfer case]] with a software controlled variable intelligent locking [[Electromagnetic clutch#Multiple disk clutches|center multi-disc differential]]. The four-wheel drive system does not use a [[Planetary gear|planetary]] or [[Bevel gear|bevel]] geared center differential, which are typically found in permanent four-wheel drive systems where torque is supplied to all four wheels.

|-
| style="width:10%;"| '''Mode'''
| style="width:10%;"| '''Drive type'''
| '''Operation'''
|-
! ''Two High'' (2H)
| Rear-wheel drive
| The intelligent locking center multi-disc differential is inactive, torque is routed to the rear-wheels only, with high range gearing. Imitates [[rear-wheel drive]] and is more economical for on road driving.
|-
! ''Auto'' (4A)
| All-wheel drive&lt;br /&gt;(unlocked, variable)
| [[Software]] does all the work, adjusting the torque split between the front and rear wheels when wheelslip is anticipated or detected. The intelligent locking center multi-disc differential is unlocked and allows for a variable front:rear torque split that ranges from 0:100 to 100:0, or anywhere in-between. Up to 100 percent of torque can be sent to the front wheels, via "[[Torque vectoring|torque biasing]]" for temporary front-wheel drive, in extreme situations where the rear [[drive axle]] loses complete traction. High range gearing is used. For use in all-weather on road (dry, wet or slippery pavement) conditions or light off-road conditions.
|-
! ''Four High'' (4H)
| All-wheel drive&lt;br /&gt;(locked)
| The intelligent locking center multi-disc differential is locked providing a permanently locked 50:50 torque split.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/specs/2006/2006_ford_explorer_2.html |title=2006 Ford Explorer Powertrain |publisher=Ford-trucks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front and rear drive shafts are mechanically locked together forcing them to turn together with absolute zero rotational speed difference.

4WD Expeditions come with standard dual front frame-mounted closed-loop recovery hooks and available off-road under body protection. Steel plates are placed over vital areas with a composite shield for the fuel tank. Expedition 4x4s are tested alongside the [[F-150]] and [[Super Duty]] trucks at Ford's California and Arizona [[Ford Proving Grounds|proving grounds]]. Expedition is put through the same durability tests and evaluations to meet the same durability standards as its pickup truck brethren.&lt;ref name="ford-trucks.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/specs/2007/2007_ford_expedition.html |title=2007 Ford Expedition |publisher=Ford-trucks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traction control===
Rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive have conventional open-type [[Differential (mechanical device)|differentials]] with a choice of axle ratios. Traction control systems, both mechanical and electronic, are optional.

'''Mechanical traction control''' (1997–2006)

Both first and second generation Ford Expeditions (UN93 and U222) had optional ''Traction-Lok'' rear [[limited-slip differential]] (LSD). The clutch packs inside the LSD tend to be weak, will wear over time, gradually losing their ability to transfer torque, and LSD will function like an open-type differential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escondidotransmission.net/Driveline_Axles/traction_lock.htm |title=Traction-Lok |publisher=escondidotransmission.net |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front differential on four-wheel drive models are open-type differential. The ''AdvanceTrac'' electronic stability control for the 2003 model year. The 2006 was the last model year for the Traction-Lok limited-slip differential.

'''Electronic traction control''' (2003–present)

''AdvanceTrac'' [[electronic stability control]] was introduced for the 2003 model year as an optional extra on the second generation Ford Expedition (U222). Bundled with the electronic stability control system is [[Traction control|four-wheel electronic traction control]] (functions at all wheels) for Expeditions with four-wheel drive.&lt;ref name="ReferenceQW" /&gt; Two-wheel drive Expeditions only receive two-wheel electronic traction control for rear wheels. ''AdvanceTrac'' was made standard equipment on all third generation Expeditions (U324).

The traction control system uses four-wheel, four-sensor, four-channel [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS) to apply and release the disc brakes on the drive wheel that has lost traction. The ABS clamps down on the slipping drive wheel or wheels, "brake locking" the differential, which can transfer up to 100 percent of supplied torque to the opposing drive wheel with better traction. By ABS "brake locking" both the front ''and'' rear differentials, the traction control system can simulate front and rear [[Locking differential#Alternatives|differential locks]]. The system works even if two of its drive wheels (one front, one rear) are completely off the ground.&lt;ref name="ReferenceQW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/specs/2003/2003_expedition.html |title=2003 Ford Expedition Overview |publisher=Ford-trucks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the ABS brakes rather than mechanical limited-slip or locking devices inside the axle differentials gives quicker response, more seamless performance, and enhanced durability.&lt;ref name="ReferenceQW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Terrain Management System (2018–present)===
Starting with the 2018 model year, the Expedition and Expedition MAX will utilize Ford's Terrain Management System. Buttons to control the 4x4 system are arranged around the central Terrain Management dial. The system is similar to the one found in the 2011–present Explorer, however the Explorer's system is more simplified. The Expedition's Terrain Management System is adapted from the SVT Raptor to allow use of a 4L (low-lock) mode as well as an electronic locking rear differential. Moreover, the Explorer's Terrain Management System has 4 (four) drive modes, while the Expedition has 7 (seven) drive modes, not including the 3 (three) 4x4 system direct drive modes.

Depending on the mode selected, Terrain Management will control, adjust, and fine tune the engine, [[Automatic transmission|transmission]], center multi-disc differential lock, throttle response, [[Traction control system#Use of traction control|four-wheel electronic traction control]] and [[electronic stability control]] (ESC) to adapt the SUV for optimal performance on the corresponding terrain.

==Towing capability==
When first introduced in 1996, the Expedition competed with both the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] and [[Chevrolet Tahoe|GMC Yukon]] in the full-size half-ton SUV towing segment. New competitors included the [[Dodge Durango]] (which was discontinued in 2009, but reintroduced as a crossover in 2011), [[Nissan Armada]], and [[Toyota Sequoia]]. Product research conducted by Ford indicated that 92 percent of Expedition owners use the SUV for vacations. Some 60 percent use it to transport outdoor sports equipment, while 40 percent of Expedition owners use the vehicle for towing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automotive.com/2007/12/ford/expedition/reviews/index.html |title=2007 Ford Expedition In-Depth Review |publisher=Automotive.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The half-ton Expedition EL/Max competes with the half-ton [[Chevrolet Suburban]] 1500 and [[GMC Yukon XL]] 1500 in the towing segment.

Since its introduction, the Expedition's [[Trailer (vehicle)#Brakes|braked trailer]] towing capacity has grown from 8,100&amp;nbsp;lbs (3,674&amp;nbsp;kg or 4.05 tons) to a current rating of 9,200&amp;nbsp;lbs (4,173&amp;nbsp;kg or 4.6 tons) when properly equipped. The list of towing features is also ever growing. Towing features common to all generations of the Expedition include: smallest possible [[turning radius]] for increased trailer maneuverability, large [[Side-view mirror|side view mirrors]] to improve rearward visibility, rearward-facing [[Turn signals#Side marker lights and reflectors|lane departure indicators]] which are helpful to other motorist when the Expedition is towing a long trailer providing added visual safety, heavy-duty flashers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordvehicles.com/assets/pdf/towing/10FLMrvEXPEDITIONsep09.pdf |title=Ford 2010 Expedition Towing Guide |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-07-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821125728/http://www.fordvehicles.com/assets/pdf/towing/10FLMrvEXPEDITIONsep09.pdf |archivedate=2010-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; heavy-duty large disc brakes to withstand prolonged braking while towing, and an available heavy-duty trailer towing package which includes necessary additions for heavy-duty towing.

As of the 2010 model year, the Expedition received trailer sway control (TSC) as standard equipment. TSC detects trailer oscillations and corrects it via asymmetrical ABS braking and reducing engine power until the Expedition and its trailer are both back under control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordvehicles.com/suvs/expedition/features/#page=Feature22 |title=Ford - Cars, SUVs, Trucks &amp; Crossovers &amp;#124; Ford Vehicles &amp;#124; The Official Site of Ford Vehicles |publisher=FordVehicles.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heavy-duty trailer towing package===

Expeditions equipped with the heavy-duty trailer towing package are prepped and readied, at [[Kentucky Truck Assembly|the factory]], for towing. The package includes a VESC (Vehicle Equipment Safety Commission) V-5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vesc.org/vescregs.html |title=Vehicle Equipment Safety Commission Regulations VESC V-5 |publisher=vesc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or [[Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE]] J684) Class IV (Class 4) rated [[trailer hitch]] with [[Tow hitch#Weight-distributing hitch|weight distribution]] capability, heavy-duty radiator, heavy-duty auxiliary [[transmission fluid]] cooler, and hitch mounted 4 and 7-pin trailer electrical connectors.

For model years prior to 2013, these Expeditions are prewired for later installation of an after-market electronic [[trailer brake controller]]. The brake controller wiring harness is located under the dash on the driver's side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford.com/resources/ford/general/pdf/towingguides/13flrv&amp;tt_expedition.pdf |title=2013 Ford Expedition Towing |publisher=media.ford.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the 2013 model year onward, these Expeditions are factory equipped with the [[TowCommand]] electronic trailer brake controller system. This features +/– gain brake adjustment with support for heavy-duty trailers with up to four axles (quad axle trailers) and is compatible with electrically actuated trailer drum brakes and electric-over-hydraulic (EOH) actuated trailer drum or disc brake systems. The trailer brake controller is fully integrated into the Expedition's four-wheel, four-sensor, four-channel [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS), and trailer sway control (TSC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/images/10031/2013_Expedition.pdf |title=2013 Ford Expedition |publisher=media.ford.com |accessdate=2012-08-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904234744/http://media.ford.com/images/10031/2013_Expedition.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford.com/suvs/expedition/features/#page=Feature6 |title=2013 Ford Expedition TBC |publisher=media.ford.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expeditions were offered with an adaptive pneumatic air-ride suspension system with self leveling, payload leveling and trailer load leveling capability from 1997 to 2013. For the 2014 model year, a [[Nivomat]] adaptive hydraulic suspension system with self leveling, payload leveling and trailer load leveling replaced the pneumatic system. Both systems can automatically detect when a heavy trailer is coupled, such as a [[travel trailer]], and level the load. Additional ride-height sensors placed on the left and right sides of the SUV also monitor and compensate for any [[List (watercraft)|listing]] caused by improper cargo loading. This keeps the Expedition running straight and level while towing, and at night helps to keep the Expedition's headlamps from blinding oncoming traffic.

To compete with large police SUVs that are sold by other automobile companies, primarily the [[Chevrolet Suburban]], Ford has made a special version of the Expedition available to [[law enforcement agencies]], [[Firefighting worldwide|fire departments]], and [[Emergency medical services|EMS agencies]]. Ford calls it the '''''Expedition Special Service Vehicle''''' (SSV). The only differences between the standard Expedition and the Special Service Vehicle Expedition are provisions for emergency services related equipment such as [[Walkie talkie|radio]]s, [[lightbar]]s, and [[Siren (noisemaker)|siren]]s.

With the fourth generation Expedition (2018–present) debuting in 2017, Ford announced that the standard size version will be sold to government agencies and law enforcement, available in the lower based XL trim only.

==Funkmaster Flex edition==
[[File:'08 Ford Expedition Funkmaster Flex Edition (Montreal).jpg|thumb|Ford Expedition Funkmaster Flex special edition]]
2008 was the only year for the [[Funkmaster Flex]] special edition Expedition. In 2005, [[Ford Motor Company]] teamed up with rapper and New York City [[radio personality]] Funkmaster Flex in a multi-year partnership to create a series of special edition Ford vehicles and advertise the Ford brand. One of those creations was a 2008 Ford Expedition bearing the rapper's name. This limited production Expedition featured a special Colorado Red and black two-tone paint job with orange pinstriping, 20 inch chrome wheels, 3D Carbon body kit, Funkmaster Flex badging and a custom black and Colorado Red leather interior on top of Expedition ''Limited'' standard equipment. The FMF Expedition went on sale in the fall of 2007 and production was limited to 650 units total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuningnews.net/news/061031b/ford-expedition-funkmaster-flex.jpg |title=Ford Expedition Funkmaster Flex Edition |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideline.com/ford/expedition/2008/follow-up-test-2008-ford-expedition-funkmaster-flex-edition.html |title=2008 Ford Expedition Funkmaster Flex Edition Follow-Up Test |publisher=Insideline.com |date=2008-02-15 |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[Motor Trend]]'' gave the 2018 Expedition a good review in its February 14, 2018 article, in which they cite the vehicle's “blend of performance (both on- and off-road), comfort, utility, and tech [that] easily make it the new benchmark for the full-size SUV class.” However the review notes that there were a few drawbacks in terms of hp acceleration (coming in second to the 2018 [[Nissan Armada]] but ahead of the 2018 [[Chevrolet Tahoe]]), off-road performance, and its MPG estimate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/expedition/2018/2018-ford-expedition-first-test-review/ “2018 FORD EXPEDITION FIRST TEST: TA-WHO?”] from [[Motor Trend]] (February 14, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2018 Expedition also ranked first among large SUVs with a score of 9.3 from [[U.S. News and World Report]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/ford/expedition “2018 Ford Expedition”] from [[U.S. News and World Report]] (February 5, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|information on the Australian Ford Landau|Ford Landau (Australia)}}

Launched at the 1970 São Paulo Auto Show, the '''Ford Landau''' was a full-size [[automobile|car]], manufactured in Brazil from 1971 until 1983 by [[Ford Brasil]] at their [[São Paulo]] facility. It became Ford's flagship in that country. It was based on the U.S. 1966 [[Ford Galaxie]].  It was only offered as a 4-door sedan, although the American version was offered in a wide variety of bodystyles.  After 1976, it gained more differences from the Galaxie and LTD, and featured the newly introduced 302 engine, a lighter 5.0L V8, and its radical restyling clearly resembling the 1965 [[Lincoln Continental]].

==American origin, Brazilian style==
The Landau joined the existing models Galaxie 500 and LTD in the showrooms in 1976 as Ford's new top-of-the-range model. All three models featured the new 302&amp;nbsp;CID engine with 4942 cc and {{Convert|198|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, which replaced the heavier 292, but the Galaxie and LTD kept their design elements from the American original. Initially the Landau offered in the single colour scheme “Prata Continental” (Continental Silver), an exclusive metallic clearcoat. The vinyl roof was painted silver coloured too.

==Trivia==
On June 25, 1979, during the oil crisis in Brazil, Ford includes in Galaxie/ Landau range an 302 CID engine with higher compression ratio (11,0:1 vs. 7,8:1), and that made use of true dual exhaust, aluminum intake manifold and nickel-covered carburetor, to accept the use of [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Ethanol]] (sugar cane alcohol). The first car was a present to the Brazilian president at the time, [[João Figueiredo]].

From the total of 77,647 Galaxie versions built in Brazil in 16 years of market presence, 2492 units ran with alcohol as fuel.

'''Full-size Ford''' is the popular term for a long-running line of [[Ford]] vehicles in North America with a shared model lineage.  Beginning in 1908 with the [[Ford Model T|Model T]], the line ended fifteen generations later in 2019 with the production of the final [[Ford Taurus (sixth generation)|Ford Taurus]] as Ford withdrew sedans from the North American market.  With the exception of the Taurus (which entered production in 2005 as the [[Ford Five Hundred]]), all models of the lineage shared body-on-frame construction and rear-wheel drive; the [[Ford Crown Victoria]] was the last body-on-frame car in mass production at its 2011 discontinuation.   

During the first half of the 20th century, American automobiles were typically identified by manufacturer and model year (such as a [[1952 Ford]]); excluding trim lines, manufacturers typically produced one distinct vehicle line each model year.  As automakers began to augment their vehicle lineups, manufacturers began to market nameplates to distinguish vehicle lines.  The term "full-size" came into use in the early 1960s as Ford introduced [[Compact car|compact]] and [[Mid-size car|intermediate-size]] cars alongside other manufacturers.  The term full-size does not necessarily indicate it was large relative to its competitors, but that it was the largest and most complete model offered by Ford; at 134 inches long, the Model T is 20 inches shorter than a [[Ford Ka]], the smallest Ford sold worldwide (as of 2019).

If the fifteen generations of the full-size Ford are considered a single shared lineage, it was the longest-running in automotive history worldwide, including over 60 million vehicles across 111 years.  By comparison, the longest-used single nameplate in the industry, the [[Chevrolet Suburban]], has been in use for 84 model years.    

==Design commonality==
Over a century's time, full-size Fords from North America have been updated to keep pace with contemporary technology and tastes.  In addition to the status of largest Ford vehicle, they were distinguished by a [[FR layout|front-engine, rear-wheel–drive layout]], [[Live axle|live rear axle]], and [[body-on-frame]] construction; unibody construction was introduced in 2005 with the Ford Five Hundred.  From 1932 to 2012, a [[V8 engine]] was available, being standard from 1935 to 1940 and from 1973 to 2012.

Where the newest generation of full-size cars produced by Ford (those derived from the [[Ford Taurus (sixth generation)|2010-present Ford Taurus]]) fit into this lineage is contentious; though similar in many dimensions in comparison to their Panther-platform predecessor, they are [[front-wheel drive]] with a [[monocoque]] design, [[independent suspension]], and a V8 engine is unavailable.  Likewise, the European [[Ford Zephyr]], the [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]], and other internationally produced large Ford sedans of the past have major mechanical and cultural differences from the American full-size lineage.

Since the rear–wheel–drive full-size Ford moved to the [[Ford Panther platform|Panther platform]] for the 1979 model year, approximately 5,000,000 units&lt;!-- [[User:Redhanker/List_of_vehicle_nameplate_sales_figures]] --&gt; have been produced under the LTD, LTD Crown Victoria, Country Squire, Crown Victoria, Crown Victoria P71, and Crown Victoria Police Interceptor nameplates.

===Police usage===
Police forces of North America have heavily used full-size Fords for decades because of their preference for V8 power and torque, the pulling power provided by rear-wheel drive, and the robust body-on-frame construction that can be cheaply repaired (important for American police due to usage of the [[PIT maneuver]]).  However, with the demise of any vehicles with these characteristics from [[General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]], the [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]] has held a virtual monopoly on police cruisers sold in North America since 1996.  The Crown Victoria has become equally commonplace as a taxi cab.

==First generation (1908–1927)==
{{Main article|Ford Model T}}
[[File:Oldtimer Ford T.jpg|thumb|Model T (4-door touring)]]
In September 1908, the lineage of the full-size Ford began as the [[Ford Model T|Model T]] entered production.  The successor to the [[Ford Model N|Model N and Model S]], the Model T would become the first Ford to utilize mass production techniques.  Produced in over fourteen body styles, over 15 million would be produced in 19 years of production.  Although its predecessors introduced the front-engine, rear-wheel drive configuration to the company, the Model T was the first Ford produced in left-hand drive.

Throughout its production run, the Model T saw relatively few changes.  In addition to changes to refine its production (which dictated its specification of black paint), technological upgrades were made along the way. Ford added electric lights (in 1910), electric starting (1919), balloon tires (1925), and wire wheels (1926).

As the Model T aged in comparison to its competition, the market share held by Ford began to erode by the mid-1920s.  At the end of 1927, the Model A was introduced as its replacement.

{{Main article|Ford Model A (1927–31)}}
[[File:Ford A Tudor Sedan, 1930.jpg|thumb|1930 Model A (Tudor sedan)]]

Introduced in December 1927, the [[Ford Model A (1927–1931)|Model A]] borrowed its name from the first car produced by the company in 1903.  As with the Model T, the Model A used a front-engine, rear-wheel drive layout with body-on-frame construction; an all-new 4-cylinder engine was introduced. As before, the Model A was produced in a wide variety of body styles; in contrast to its predecessor, the car's bodywork was designed by an in-house styling predecessor headed by [[Edsel Ford]].  Produced from 1927 to 1931, approximately 4.8 million were produced.

As the Model A was the first all-new design in 19 years, many features were upgraded.  The Model A introduced Ford buyers to conventional driver controls; it now had pedals for the brakes, throttle, and clutch as well as a separate gearshift.  [[Libbey-Owens-Ford|Safety glass]] made their automotive industry debut when Ford used it for the windshield.

==Third generation (1932–1934)==
{{Main article|1932 Ford}}
[[File:1932 Ford Model 18 160 De Luxe Fordor Sedan EYZ976.jpg|thumb|1932 Model 18 (V8) DeLuxe Fordor sedan]]
For the 1932 model year, Ford introduced a revised version of the Model A.  The Model B was introduced with a modernized powertrain and chassis and slightly restyled bodywork.  Only five years removed from the last Model T, the Model B introduced Ford and the entire automotive industry to yearly changes for model styling.  In 1933, the exterior was redesigned while the 1934 wore a new front end of its own; all three versions rode on the same basic chassis.

For 1932, Ford introduced an option that would remain in the full-size Ford line for seven decades.  Developed as a response to the 1929 introduction of the [[Chevrolet Inline 6 engine|Chevrolet "Stovebolt Six"]], the Model 18 offered a 65-hp [[Ford flathead V8 engine|flathead V8]] engine for a $10 price premium over the standard Model B.  Demand for the V8 was so strong that Ford struggled to keep up.  After 1934, the 4-cylinder engine was discontinued; the next 4-cylinder Ford in North America would be the [[Ford Pinto|Pinto]] in 1971.

For the 1935 model year, the Ford lineup was powered exclusively by a V8 engine.  Styling changes introduced the first integrated trunks on sedan models and suspension changes increased interior room.  In 1936, further updates included the introduction of solid wheels and the integration of the horn into the bodywork.

[[File:1940 Ford DeLuxe convertible 2.jpg|thumb|1940 De Luxe convertible]]
For 1937, Ford updated its car lineup with minor styling changes.  However, the introduction of the [[De Luxe Ford]] marked the beginning of expansion of the Ford Motor Company brand lineup.  De Luxe Ford was marketed as an upscale sub-brand to bridge the gap between Ford and [[Lincoln-Zephyr]].  In 1939, the [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] was launched; although sharing a chassis with the Ford, it wore a body six inches wider with a wheelbase four inches longer; Mercury would supersede De Luxe Ford as a brand.

As buyer tastes began to change in the late 1930s, certain body styles were pruned from the lineup.  1939 would be the last year for the 4-door [[phaeton body|phaeton]] and for single-seat coupes and convertibles (and their rumble seats).  A conventional "alligator" hood replaced the "butterfly" hood with its lifting side panels.  Ford also made several safety-related changes as well.  The dashboard was redesigned (to feature recessed controls) in 1938, hydraulic brakes were added in 1939, and sealed-beam headlights were introduced a year later.

For 1941, Ford introduced an all-new generation of cars and trucks. These would be the final generation of cars produced in the lifetime of both Edsel Ford and Henry Ford. Due to the success of Mercury, De Luxe Ford was changed from a sub-brand back to a trim level within the Ford lineup. The width of the body had now increased to the point where running boards had become vestigial.  For the first time since the [[Ford Model K|Model K]] of 1906, an inline-six engine was available (as a base engine).

From February 1942 to July 1945, civilian production was discontinued as Ford manufactured military products for World War II.  As production resumed, Ford released the 1946 model with few changes aside from a new grille. Under the hood, the V8 engine was now shared with Mercury, allowing Ford to break the 100-hp barrier for the first time. In 1947, the last Ford trucks based on the car chassis were produced.  For 1948, the [[Ford F-Series|F-Series]] was introduced as a dedicated truck chassis.

{{Main article|1949 Ford}}
[[File:1950 Ford at Cosford.jpg|thumb|1950 Ford 4-door sedan]]
For the 1949 model year, Ford redesigned its car lineup with a number of significant changes.  The transverse-leaf suspension, seen since the Model T, was replaced by independent front suspension and longitudinal leaf springs.  Fenders and running boards were completely integrated into the bodywork.

In 1950, the Ford model line expanded itself further as the division added model names to the lineup (as opposed to Ford Standard or Ford Custom).  A year later, an automatic transmission appeared for the first time.  Wood-paneled station wagons were now available as [[Ford Country Squire|Country Squire]].  1951 also saw Ford enter the youth market with a new Victoria pillarless hardtop-convertible, a direct competitor to the Chevrolet Bel Air.

For 1952, Ford updated its cars with mild exterior updates; this generation is distinguished by the introduction of a single-piece windshield.  The pedals were remounted from the floor to below the dashboard.

Mechanically, power brakes and power steering became an option in 1954. In 1954, the overhead-valve [[Ford Y-block engine|Y-block]] V8 replaced the Flathead V8 seen since 1932.  At 130&amp;nbsp;hp, the Y-block produced twice the horsepower as the original 1932 V8.

In 1955, the Ford car lineup was given a mild update over the previous year, although several features made their first appearance in this generation.  Air conditioning was now available as a factory-installed option.  The [[Lifeguard (automobile safety)|Lifeguard]] option package, introduced in 1956, featured front and rear seat belts, a padded dashboard, and redesigned door latches.  Although this was the first generation of Fords to undergo crash testing, the Lifeguard package was not well received by buyers.
Several nameplates in the Ford lineup made their first appearance during this time.  Ford introduced the [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Fairlane]], [[Ford Crown Victoria|Crown Victoria]], and [[Ford Ranch Wagon|Ranch Wagon]] as part of the 1955 lineup.  Station wagons were now a separate model series from 2-doors and 4-doors.

==Tenth generation (1957–1959)==
{{Main article|1957 Ford}}
For the first time since 1949, the 1957 Ford lineup was built on an all-new chassis; a new frame allowed for the use of lower-mounted bodies.  As part of the convertible lineup, the [[Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner|Skyliner]] introduced a new feature: the retractable hardtop.  The [[Ford Ranchero|Ranchero]], introduced in 1957, was the first [[coupe utility]] pickup sold in North America, predating the [[Chevrolet El Camino]] by two years.  The Ranchero was developed from the [[Ford Courier|Courier]] sedan delivery with the bodywork above the cargo area removed.

In 1959, the [[Ford Galaxie|Galaxie]] nameplate was introduced.

For 1960, the full-size Ford chassis was lengthened one inch to a 119-inch wheelbase. Coinciding with the redesign, a long-running precedent within Ford came to an end. Since the introduction of the Model T over a half-century before, Ford had largely produced a single model line of cars (as well as trucks, before 1948), with individual nameplates denoting a trim-level hierarchy.  With the 1960 introduction of the [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]] compact, the previous line of Fords (ranging from the Custom to the Galaxie and station wagons) became the full-size Ford model range of cars.  For 1962, Ford used the Fairlane nameplate for a third model range, sized between the Falcon and Galaxie (sharing components from both model lines); named an intermediate, the Fairlane was an ancestor of the mid-size car segment of today.    

Following the expansion of Ford chassis, several Ford body styles ended their production during this generation.  Following a large decline in demand, 1960 marked the final year of the Ford Courier sedan delivery (largely replaced by the Ford Econoline van, derived from the Falcon) and 1961 marked the end of the two-door Ranch Wagon (with all Ford station wagons becoming four-doors).  The Ranchero shifted to the compact Falcon chassis for 1960, ending its commonality with full-size Fords.  For 1961, Mercury [[Downsize (automobile)|downsized]] its model line; in what would be a precedent through 1978, Mercury full-size sedans became mechanical counterparts of the full-size Ford, distinguished by a slightly longer wheelbase.    

The 1960 Ford chassis saw a number of drivetrain revisions.  While 1960 saw engines carried over from the previous generation, 1961 marked the first use of the long-running [[Ford Windsor engine#289|Windsor V8]] engine family, with a 289 V8 replacing a 292 Y-block V8.  The 390 [[Ford FE engine|FE-series V8]] was introduced, marking the first big-block V8 (ranging from 352 to 427 cubic inches) in a Ford sedan.        

===Nameplates===
The 1960 Ford saw several nameplate shifts.  Following the discontinuation of the Custom/Custom 300, the Fairlane served as the standard Ford for 1960 and 1961.  As a replacement for the Skyliner retractable hardtop, the [[Ford Starliner|Starliner]] fastback hardtop served as the flagship hardtop, with the Sunliner convertible making its return.  For 1962, as the Fairlane was established as a free-standing model range, all full-size Fords were Galaxies; with the introduction of the Galaxie 500 and Galaxie 500XL submodels (replacing the Starliner/Sunliner), the bucket-seats-and-console 500XL served as a competitor to the Chevrolet Impala Super Sport.  As a base model for fleets, for 1963, Ford introduced the [[Ford 300]], which was renamed the Custom for 1964.

The three-model station wagon series remained unchanged from 1960 to 1962.  For 1963, the base-trim Ranch Wagon was adopted by the Fairlane model range.

For the 1965 model year, the full-size Ford platform underwent a complete redesign.  While sharing the 119-inch wheelbase of the previous generation, Ford redesigned the frame and suspension in an effort to upgrade ride and handling.  The longitudinal rear leaf springs (used since 1949) were replaced by a three-link coil-sprung live rear axle, becoming the first full-size American car fitted with four-wheel coil springs.  In modified form, the design was used through the production of the 1979-2012 Panther chassis (and the Ford Aerostar van).    

To comply with federal safety mandates, in 1967 the full-size Fords were updated with a padded dashboard, recessed controls, collapsible steering column with padded steering wheel, and 3-point seatbelts; 1968 models gained side marker lights.  For 1968, the front fascia underwent a revision, shifting from vertically-stacked headlights to horizontally-mounted headlamps; the XL, LTD, and Country Squire were given hidden headlamps.  

===Nameplates===
The 1965 Ford saw the introduction of the [[Ford LTD (Americas)|Ford LTD]].  Initially a 1965 submodel of the Galaxie 500, the LTD became a full model line for 1966.  Adopting many of the convenience features available on a Lincoln or Mercury, the Ford LTD was introduced before or alongside sedans such as the [[Chevrolet Caprice]] and [[Dodge Monaco]].  The Ranch Wagon returned to the station wagon line, based upon the Custom.  

For 1967, the Ford Galaxie 500XL was rebranded as the Ford XL (sportiest of the full-size Ford line).

In 1969, full-size Fords were given another all-new platform.&lt;ref name=Odin&gt;Odin, L.C. ''A concise guide to the Ford and Mercury full-size automobile production 1969-1978''. Belvedere Publishing, 2016. ASIN: B01HE91Y4K.&lt;/ref&gt;  The vertically stacked headlamps seen on the previous generation were replaced by horizontally mounted units.  Lincoln-style [[hidden headlamps]] distinguished LTDs and XLs from Galaxies and Customs.  Similar to the [[Mercury Marauder]], SportsRoof "fastback" versions of the Galaxie 500 and XL were sold for 1969 and 1970.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;  LTD and Custom two-doors featured a formal hardtop roofline.

With the declining market for full-size performance cars, the XL was discontinued after 1970.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;  In 1971, as part of a redesign, the LTD became one of the first cars equipped with a [[Automotive lighting#Centre high mount stop lamp (CHMSL)|third brake light]] (this was dropped in 1973).  With the impending threat of federal rollover standards coupled with declining demand, 1972 marked the final year for the convertible.  1972 marked the final year for the Custom; the Custom 500 would remain, sold nearly exclusively as a fleet vehicle.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;

For 1973, the Custom 500, Galaxie sedan, LTD, and station wagons were given an all-new body.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;  In response to federal regulations, the front ends were fitted with large [[5 mph bumper]]s; they would be fitted to the rear for 1974.  Two-door hardtops were also redesigned with thick B-pillars and fixed rear quarter windows.  Four-door and wagon models were marketed as "pillared hardtops"; while still wearing frameless door glass, they were reinforced with thin metal B-pillars. To deal with the added weight, only V8 engines were available (for the first time since 1940).

As emissions standards eroded the output of the powertrains under the hood, Ford refocused towards features such as comfortable ride instead of outright performance.  To do so, Ford began to move its full-size line gradually upmarket.  After 1974, the Galaxie and its companion Country Sedan station wagon were discontinued, integrated into the LTD line.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;  With the Custom 500 essentially relegated to fleet and police sales, the LTD/Country Squire became the sole full-size model available at dealerships.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;

Approximately 7,850,000 full-size Fords and Mercurys were sold from 1969-78.&lt;ref name="kowalke1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kowalke|first=Ron|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975|year=1997|publisher=Krause publications|isbn=0-87341-521-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/standardcatalogo00beve}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flammang, James 1999"&gt;Flammang, James ''Standard Catalog of American Cars 1976–1999 3rd Edition'' (Iola, WI: Krause Publications, Inc 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it the second best selling Ford [[automobile platform]]  after the [[Ford Model T]].&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;

Necessitated by federal fuel economy standards, the full-size Ford lineup underwent [[Downsize (automobile)|downsizing]] for the 1979 model year.  The full-size Fords were redesigned on an [[Ford Panther platform|all-new platform]].  Losing fifteen inches of length and 800 pounds of weight, Ford's full-size car now had smaller exterior dimensions than the mid-size LTD II.  In spite of the smaller size, interior dimensions and trunk space increased over its 1978 predecessor.  In a move upmarket, the Custom 500 became a Canada-only model, which was deleted in 1981.
As the LTD was introduced, Ford began development on its intended replacement, the front-wheel drive [[Ford Taurus (first generation)|Ford Taurus]].  As fuel prices stabilized and demand for full-sized cars remained, Ford made the decision to continue to produce the Panther platform alongside the Taurus.  In 1983, as part of a major model shift throughout Ford Motor Company, the LTD and LTD Crown Victoria were split apart.  The LTD Crown Victoria (and the Country Squire) became the sole full-size cars, while the LTD nameplate took over for a facelifted version of the slow-selling Granada sedan.

For 1992, the LTD Crown Victoria was replaced by the Crown Victoria and the Country Squire was discontinued.  Styled like a larger version of the Taurus, the Crown Victoria borrowed a nameplate from the mid-1950s Ford lineup.  Many features, such as four-wheel disc brakes, ABS, and dual airbags were all-new, and the Windsor V8 was replaced by the Modular V8, the first overhead-cam V8 in an American full-sized sedan.

In 1998, in what would be the final exterior redesign of the Crown Victoria, it received the roofline of Mercury Grand Marquis.  For 2003, the frame and suspension were redesigned to improve its handling.  After 2007, it was no longer sold to retail customers in North America.  On September 15, 2011, Ford produced the final Crown Victoria; it was sold for export to Saudi Arabia.

For the 2005 model year, Ford introduced the [[Ford D3 platform|D3 platform]], its first all-new full-size car design in 26 years.  A modification of a Volvo large-car platform, the D3 chassis introduced several major design changes to full-size Ford cars.  In place of body-on-frame construction, the D3 became the first full-size Ford in North America to adopt unibody construction; rear-wheel drive was replaced by front-wheel drive (with all-wheel drive as an option).  For the first time since the 1931 Model A, no V8 engine was available, with a V6 as the exclusive engine (making its first appearance in the full-size line).  In all-wheel drive models (from 2005 to 2007), an automatic transmission was replaced by a [[continuously variable transmission|CVT]].  

Officially intended as the larger of two vehicle platforms replacing the [[Ford D186 platform|D186 chassis]], the D3 was sized between the D186 and the Panther platform in many dimensions.  Largely marketed to replace the [[Ford Taurus (fifth generation)|Ford Taurus]], after its 2005 launch, the [[Ford Five Hundred]] also unofficially began to serve as a replacement for the [[Ford Crown Victoria]] (in retail markets).  While marketed as a crossover SUV, the [[Ford Taurus X|Ford Freestyle]] (based upon the Five Hundred) would functionally become the closest successor to the [[Ford Country Squire|Ford LTD Country Squire]] station wagon, marking the first time since 1991 that Ford offered full-size vehicles in multiple body styles.  

As part of a mid-cycle redesign, the Ford Five Hundred and Ford Freestyle were rebranded for 2008 as the [[Ford Taurus (fifth generation)|Ford Taurus]] and [[Ford Taurus (fifth generation)|Ford Taurus X]], marking the shift of the Ford Taurus into the full-size segment; at the time, Ford management cited greater recognition of the Taurus nameplate as a factor of the rebranding.  

For 2010, the sixth-generation Taurus was introduced on the D3 platform, coinciding with the discontinuation of the [[Mercury Sable]] and 2009 introduction of the [[Lincoln MKS]].  As part of the redesign, Ford produced its first full-size [[Ford Taurus SHO|Taurus SHO]], featuring a  twin-turbocharged [[Ford EcoBoost engine#3.5-L|EcoBoost V6]] and all-wheel drive. As part of a 2013 update, a 4-cylinder [[Ford EcoBoost engine#2.0-L (2010–)|EcoBoost]] engine was added, becoming the first 4-cylinder Taurus since 1991 and the first full-size Ford available with a 4-cylinder engine since 1934.  To replace the long-running [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]], Ford introduced the [[Ford Taurus (sixth generation)#Police Interceptor Sedan|Ford Police Interceptor Sedan]] police patrol/pursuit car.  Derived from the Taurus SHO, the Police Interceptor Sedan features the all-wheel drive and twin-turbocharged V6 as optional equipment.  

In 2011, Ford ended production of the Panther platform, with production of the [[Ford Falcon (Australia)#Seventh generation (2008–2016)|Ford Falcon]] (by Ford Australia) ending in 2016.  Since the 2017 model year, the Ford Mustang is the sole Ford car produced worldwide with either rear-wheel drive and/or a V8 engine.  Production of the D3 Taurus ended in March 2019 as Ford shifted vehicle production in North America away from sedans.

The '''Ford Flex''' is a [[full-size]] [[crossover SUV]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ford.com/crossovers/flex/specifications/capacities/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 27, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230083714/http://www.ford.com/crossovers/flex/specifications/capacities/ |archive-date=December 30, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; manufactured by the [[Ford Motor Company]] Between the 2009 to 2019 model years.  The Flex supersedes the [[Ford Taurus X]] and Freestyle, sharing their drivetrains and using an updated platform.

The Flex is manufactured alongside the [[Ford Edge]] and [[Lincoln MKX]] [[mid-size]] CUVs at the [[Oakville Assembly]] plant in [[Oakville, Ontario]], where the first Flex was manufactured at the beginning of June 2008.&lt;ref name='start'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=28364 |title=New Ford Flex rolls off line at Oakville Assembly |work=Media.Ford.com |date=June 3, 2009 |accessdate=October 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823185533/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=28364 |archivedate=August 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Flex is directly related to a group of [[badge engineering|rebadged variants]], Ford's ''Chicago D4's'', so called for the plant where they were manufactured ([[Oakville Assembly]]) and the platform (D4) they share: the [[Ford Explorer]] and [[Lincoln MKT]].  The Flex is closely related to Ford's ''Chicago D3's'': the [[Mercury Montego]] and third generation [[Mercury Sable]] sedans; the [[Ford Taurus X|Ford Freestyle/Ford Taurus X]] wagons, marketed as a crossover vehicles; as well as the fifth and sixth generations [[Ford Taurus]] and [[Lincoln MKS]].

Noted for styling by [[Peter Horbury]] that recalls the [[Mini (marque)|MINI]], and a series of horizontal grooves in its doors and tailgate evoking a [[Woodie (car body style)|Woodie]], the Flex is marketed in the [[United States]], in [[Canada]] and in the [[Middle East]].

==Background==
[[File:Ford Fairlane Concept.jpg|thumb|left|2005 Ford Fairlane concept at 2005 Chicago Auto Show]]
The Ford Flex was first unveiled at the [[New York International Auto Show#2007|2007 New York International Auto Show]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authorlink=Auto123.com |title=The Ford Flex, a.k.a. Fairlane, to debut in New York |date=March 24, 2007 |url=http://www.auto123.com/en/info/news/news,view.spy?artid=79129&amp;pg=1 |accessdate=March 24, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928110123/http://www.auto123.com/en/info/news/news,view.spy?artid=79129&amp;pg=1 |archive-date=September 28, 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was introduced as Ford sought to introduce a 7-passenger family vehicle without it being a minivan, a segment in decline since the late 1990s.

At the 2005 Chicago Auto Show, Ford showed the [[Ford Fairlane concept|Ford Fairlane]] concept vehicle.  Based on the [[Ford CD3 platform]], it was a 3-row people-mover with distinctive styling.  The rear passenger doors of the Fairlane were rear-hinged; although this allowed better interior views for auto-show viewers, this configuration also previewed the sliding doors of a minivan.

In the change to a production vehicle, the Fairlane would change names to Flex and shift platforms to the larger D3/D4 architecture.  A notable change from the concept was the adoption of 4 conventionally hinged doors, as Ford chose to market it more as a wagon-type crossover.  Several key styling features of the Fairlane concept would make their way into the production Flex, however.  The most distinctive is a series of horizontal grooves in the doors, intended to evoke a [[Woodie (car body style)|Woodie]] look without using simulated wood. [[Car Design News]] said the styling references "a previous era without resorting to obvious retro styling cues."&lt;ref name="flex evoke"&gt;{{cite web
 |title       = Driven: Ford Flex
 |quote       = Reminiscent of the infamous "woodie wagons" of the ‘50s, the Flex's aesthetic is notable for referencing a previous era without resorting to obvious retro styling cues. Woodie wagons, such as the type-defining 1953 Buick Roadmaster estate, featured wooden exterior panels towards the rear of the car. The Flex reinterprets this through four distinctive horizontal grooves set into the lower half of both front and rear door panels, and a brushed-aluminum tailgate finish.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, these help to visually lower the vehicle.  In a design similar to the Mini and the Range Rover, the roof pillars are blacked out, creating a "floating roof" effect.

==Design overview==
The Flex is based on the [[Ford D3 platform#D4|Ford D4 platform]], a version of the Volvo-derived [[Ford D3 platform]] that is re-engineered for use in crossover sport-utility vehicles. The chassis shares its underpinnings with the 2005-2007 [[Ford Taurus X|Ford Freestyle]], 2008-2009 [[Ford Taurus X]], and the 2011-2019 Ford Explorer.  While front-wheel drive is standard, all-wheel drive is available as an option.  The Flex includes an independent rear suspension system and a traction control system called AdvanceTrac.

==Model history==
===2009–2012===
At its 2009 introduction, the Flex was launched with three trim levels. As with other Ford cars, there was an ''SE'' base model, mid-level ''SEL'', and top-trim ''Limited''.  Flexes were available in six or seven-passenger seating configurations, (7-passenger models have a bench seat for the second row). As part of the roof design, Ford offered three colors for the roof paint: black, white/cream, and body-color.

In 2010, a second available engine was added, as a 355&amp;nbsp;hp twin-turbocharged [[EcoBoost#TwinForce / EcoBoost|EcoBoost]] V6 became available for all-wheel drive models. On US models, reverse cameras were restricted to Limited-trim models.&lt;ref name='start'/&gt;

For 2012, an [[automatic parking]] system was added as option for upper-trim models.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===2013–2019===
For the 2013 model year, the Ford Flex was given a major body update. The 2013 Flex made its world debut at the [[LA Auto Show#2011|2011 LA Auto Show]]. While the roofline and doors were retained, the front and rear saw major changes.&lt;ref name="Autoblog 2013 FD"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/03/23/2013-ford-flex-first-drive-road-test-review/ | title=First Drive:  2013 Ford Flex  Freshly Tweaked for a Second Life | publisher=AOL Inc. | work=Autoblog.com | date=March 23, 2012 | accessdate=April 1, 2012 | author=Kiley, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single-bar grille replaced the three-bar grille, but other changes to the front end attracted even more attention. Along with the SVT Raptor, the Flex was a model that did not wear the Ford blue oval emblem; the hood wore "F-L-E-X" above the grille. On the tailgate, the Ford emblem was decreased in size and moved to the bottom right corner.  Inside, the dashboard was updated, with a new 3-spoke steering wheel.&lt;ref name="Autoblog 2013 FD"/&gt;

The 2019 model year Flex only had minor changes, and is the final year for the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fordauthority.com/2019/03/what-is-new-for-2019-ford-flex/ “Here is What’s New For 2019 Ford Flex”] from Ford Authority (March 16, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powertrain==
The Ford Flex is powered by two different [[V6 engine]]s.  The Flex's {{convert|213|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[Ford Duratec engine#Duratec 35|Duratec]] V6 engine produces {{Convert|262|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|248|lbft|abbr=on}}, and is paired with the 6-speed [[GM-Ford 6-speed automatic transmission|6F]] [[automatic transmission]]. As of the 2013, the output was raised to {{Convert|287|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|254|lbft|abbr=on}}, respectively.

A direct-injected twin-turbocharged [[EcoBoost#TwinForce / EcoBoost|EcoBoost]] engine is available for the 2010 model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Neff
 | first = Natalie | title = Flexitarian | journal = [[AutoWeek]] | volume = 59 | issue = 17 | page = 24 | publisher = [[Crain Communications Inc.]] | location = [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] | date = August 24, 2009 | issn = 0192-9674}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EcoBoost produces {{Convert|355|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|350|lbft||0|abbr=on}} of torque. In 2013, the Flex gained 10 horsepower to make a total of {{Convert|365|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while the torque remained the same. According to Ford, the turbochargers in the engine are designed to last {{Convert|150000|mi|km}} or 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/109011116090/ford-flex-first-car-to-receive-new-35-liter-twin-turbo-ecoboost-engine#ixzz1AsRAEjFE |title=Ford Flex first car to receive new 3.5-liter Twin Turbo EcoBoost engine |date=January 11, 2009 |author=Thami Masemola |publisher=WorldCarFans}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2018}}
AWD is required with the EcoBoost engine option. Towing capacity is {{convert|4500|lb||0|abbr=on}}. The [[all-wheel drive]] system is capable of transferring up to 100% of torque to the front or rear axle as needed.

==Trim levels==

Since its introduction in 2009, the Ford Flex has only been available in three trim levels:

The base '''SE''' trim level, only available with front-wheel-drive (FWD), offers the following features as standard equipment: a 3.5L "DuraTec" V6 engine, a six-speed automatic transmission, seventeen-inch alloy wheels and tires, an A/M-F/M stereo with a single-disc CD/MP3 player and an auxiliary audio input jack (later, Ford SYNC also became standard equipment on this trim level), a six-speaker audio system, cloth seating surfaces, aluminum interior trim panels, keyless entry, power windows, power door locks, black side mirrors and door handles, and manually controlled two-row air conditioning.

On the 2011 and 2012 models there was an additional '''Titanium''' trim level which was the Limited with blacked out headlights, tail lights, rear applique, 3 bar grille without the Ford logo, blacked out beltline trim, foglamp bezels, and mirror caps. It had different interior trim, upholstery and was only available in Black, White, Red and Silver.
&lt;ref&gt;Ford Flex Sales Brochure, 2011, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, a Ford Flex [[Funkmaster Flex]] Edition was available between 2009 and 2010. Produced in limited numbers with an individually numbered dash plaque, this special edition Ford Flex was based on the top-of-the-line Titanium trim level, and offered basically identical features, though was only available in a special two-tone Red and Black Clear Coat exterior paint scheme, special twenty-inch chrome-plated alloy wheels and tires, gloss black side mirrors and door handles, gloss black fascia inserts, a red-and-black two-tone leather and suede-trimmed interior, "FMF" exterior emblems and interior embroidery, and red interior trim panels.

==Marketing==
As part of the "electrifying the night" campaign, Ford partnered with ''[[Esquire Magazine|Esquire]]'' magazine in the magazine's first issue with a cover using [[E Ink]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2008/09/08/098985.html |title=Ford Flex Partners With Esquire and E Ink to Present First-Ever Digital Magazine Cover |publisher=Theautochannel.com |date= |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original '''Ford Model A''' is the first [[car]] produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], beginning production in 1903. Ernest Pfennig, a [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] dentist, became the first owner of a Model A on July 23, 1903;&lt;ref name="lacey"/&gt; 1,750 cars were made from 1903 through 1904 during Ford's occupancy of its first facility: the [[Ford Mack Avenue Plant]], a modest rented wood-frame building on [[Detroit]]'s East Side.  The Model A was replaced by the [[Ford Model C]] during 1904 with some sales overlap.
[[File:Ford1903.jpg|left|thumbnail|200px|Ad for the Model A from a December 15, 1903 newspaper]]
The car came as a two-seater [[runabout (car)|runabout]] for $800 or the $900 &lt;ref&gt;ad in Automobile Review magazine, Chicago, Dec. 15, 1903, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; four-seater [[tonneau]] model with an option to add a top.  The horizontal-mounted [[flat-2]], situated amidships of the car, produced 8&amp;nbsp;hp (6&amp;nbsp;kW).  A planetary transmission was fitted with two forward speeds and reverse, a Ford signature later seen on the [[Ford Model T]].  The car weighed 1,240&amp;nbsp;lb (562&amp;nbsp;kg) and could reach a top speed of 28&amp;nbsp;mph (45&amp;nbsp;km/h). It had a 72-inch (1.8 m) wheelbase and sold for a base price of US$750. Options included a rear tonneau with two seats and a rear door for $100, a rubber roof for $30 or a leather roof for $50. [[Band brake]]s were used on the rear wheels.&lt;ref name="Kimes1989pp547–548"/&gt; However, it was $150 more than its most direct competitor, the [[Oldsmobile Curved Dash]], so did not sell as well.&lt;ref name="lacey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lacey|first=Robert|title=Ford: The Men and the Machine|year=1986|publisher=Little, Brown and company|isbn=0-316-51166-8|authorlink=Robert Lacey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company had spent almost its entire $28,000 initial investment funds with only $223.65 left in its bank account when the first Model A was sold. The success of this car model generated a profit for the [[Ford Motor Company]], [[Henry Ford]]'s first successful business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ritzsite.nl/FORD_1/02_eford.htm|title=Early Ford|accessdate=February 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Ford advertised the Model A as the "most reliable machine in the world", it suffered from many problems common to vehicles of the era, including overheating and slipping transmission bands.  The Model A was sold only in red by the factory, though some were later repainted in other colors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://automuseumonline.com/1903-ford-model-a.html Auto Museum Online - 1903 Ford Model A]&lt;/ref&gt;

1904 Model A cars were equipped with the larger, 10-horsepower engine of the [[Ford Model C|Model C]] and were sold as the Model AC.&lt;ref name="Kimes1989pp547–548"/&gt; The Model AC can be visually distinguished from the Model A by its larger six-by-three-bar [[radiator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=May 2014|title=1904 Ford Model 'AC' 10hp Four Seater Rear Entrance Tonneau: Engine No. 982|url=https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/22174/lot/308/|publisher=[[Bonhams]]|accessdate=August 29, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426224251/https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/22174/lot/308/|archivedate=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1955 Ford Crown Victoria Skyliner roof.JPG|left|thumb|150px|detail of the Skyliner roof panel]]
The first time Ford used the "victoria" as a naming convention was in 1932 on the [[1932 Ford#1932|Ford Victoria]] 2-door coupe. [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]'s [[1952 Ford|1954]] [[Ford Crestline Skyliner|Crestline Skyliner]] was replaced in 1955 by the '''Fairlane Crown Victoria Skyliner''', based on the new [[1955 Ford]] design.  It shared the flashy chrome "basket handle" which stretched the [[B-pillar]] across the roof of the 1955 [[Ford Crown Victoria|Crown Victoria]] model but added a smoked [[acrylic glass]] window over the front seat area. It was an interpretation of a horse-drawn carriage bodystyle, called a "[[Victoria (carriage)|victoria]]". The model, commonly referred to as the "Glasstop Vicky" lasted just two years, with sales slipping sharply as customers realized the trouble of keeping the car cool. An optional snap-in sunshade or [[air conditioning]] system were desirable. The Skyliner name was later applied to the [[Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner]] [[hardtop convertible]] based on the [[1957 Ford]].

Similar roof panels were used on [[General Motors]] products of the time. The concept of a single, fixed window over the front seat reappeared in the late 1970s on Lincoln's full-size [[Lincoln Continental|Continental]] models (through 1979), and later, over the rear seat of General Motors' 1991 [[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]] and [[Buick Roadmaster]] wagons. Currently, the 2004-2009 [[Opel Astra#Astra H (2004–2009)|Opel Astra]] offers a "panoramic windshield", which is similar in concept.

[[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]]'s similar [[Mercury Montclair|Montclair]] '''[[Mercury Monterey Sun Valley|Sun Valley]]''' was produced in 1954 and 1955.

The '''Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner''' is a two-door [[full-size car]] with a [[retractable hardtop]] that was produced by [[Ford Motor Company]]  for the model years 1957 to 1959. In 1959 the model name changed to '''Ford Galaxie Skyliner''' very shortly after production of the 1959 models had started. The retractable roof mechanism – also known as "Hide-Away Hardtop" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1957_Ford/1957_Ford_Skyliner_Brochure/dirindex.html |title=1957 Ford Skyliner brochure|website=oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; – was unique to Ford branded products, and was not offered on [[Lincoln Motor Company#Continental Division (1956–1960)|Continental]], [[Lincoln Motor Company#1945–2012: Lincoln-Mercury Division|Lincoln]], [[Mercury (automobile)#Mercury-Edsel-Lincoln Division (1957–1960)|Mercury]], or [[Edsel]] branded vehicles during this time period. A total of 48,394 units were built. 

==Design==

The Ford Skyliner Retractable was only the second car in history to be mass-produced produced with a retractable hardtop; the first to reach four and five digit mass-production numbers, and the first series produced ''[[list of coupé convertibles|coupé convertible]]'' to feature a roof composed of more than one segment. Additionally, the trunk-lid also consisted of two pieces — one segment took the place where other convertibles typically had a separate lid to cover the soft-top stowage compartment. Both the folding roof and trunk-lid are power operated through an exceptionally complex system. At the time of its introduction, the Skyliner was the only true hardtop convertible in the world.&lt;ref&gt;John Gunnell, The Standard Catalog of American Cars 1945 to 1975, Revised 4th Edition, page 397&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the [[Ford Fairlane (North American)|Ford Fairlane]] 500 range, the Skyliner had a complex mechanism which folded the front of the roof and retracted it under the rear decklid. No hydraulic mechanisms were used as in regular convertibles of the era. The Skyliner top has seven reversible electric motors (only six for 1959 models &lt;ref&gt;Ford Motor Company, 1959 Ford Car Shop Manual, 3rd Edition, page 502&lt;/ref&gt;), four lift jacks, a series of relays, ten limit switches, ten solenoids, four locking mechanisms for the roof and two locking mechanisms for the trunk lid,&lt;ref name="willson1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Willson |first=Quentin |title=The Ultimate Classic Car Book |year=1995 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=0-7894-0159-2 |url-access=registration|url= https://archive.org/details/ultimateclassicc00quen}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a total of {{convert|610|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} of wiring.&lt;ref name=plaque&gt;Owner's plaque, 50th Anniversary Draggins carshow, shot 3 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The large top took up vast amounts of trunk space, limiting the car's sales (however, unlike what most people believe{{fact|date=March 2017}}, the mechanism had decent reliability).&lt;ref name="willson1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="langworth1982"&gt;{{cite book|last=Langworth |first=Richard |title=Great Cars from Ford |year=1982|isbn=0-89009-537-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stuff&gt;{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1957-1959-ford-fairlane-skyliner.htm/printable |title=1957–1959 Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=2007-07-20 |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production totaled 20,766 units in 1957, declining to 14,713 in 1958 and to 12,915 in 1959.&lt;ref name="stuff"/&gt; An electric clock was standard.&lt;ref name="flory2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Flory, Jr.|first=J.

[[File:1959 Ford Galaxie Skyliner.JPG|thumb|1959 Ford Galaxie Skyliner with both the Galaxie and Fairlane 500 badges]]

During the 1959 model year the [[Ford Galaxie|Galaxie]] series was added to Ford’s full-size range and the Skyliner model was absorbed into that series.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunnell402&gt;John Gunnell, The Standard Catalog of American Cars 1945 to 1975, Revised 4th Edition, page 402&lt;/ref&gt; Although the 1959 Galaxie was designated as a separate series,&lt;ref name=Gunnell402/&gt; Galaxies carried both “Fairlane 500” and “Galaxie” badging, on the rear and sides respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1959_Ford/1959_Fords_Mailer/dirindex.html|title=1959 Ford brochure |website=oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It came with the standard {{convert|292|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} 2-barrel {{convert|200|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} V8 engine.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt;

The design attracted more attention than sales; the option was expensive, suspected to be unreliable, and took up almost all the trunk space when retracted. It required the roof to be made shorter than the other Fords, and the trunk to be larger. This was because the design was originally to be a [[Continental Mark II|Continental coupe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rmsothebys.com/sp14/sam-pack-collection/lots/1957-ford-fairlane-500-skyliner-retractable-hardtop/1071339 |title=Lot 115 - 1957 Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner Retractable Hardtop |publisher=Rmsothebys.com |date=2014-11-15 |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0s98D99c1tsC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=ford+skyliner+was+supposed+to+be+a+lincoln |page=56 |title=The Lincoln Story: The Postwar Years |first=Thomas E. |last=Bonsall |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2003 |isbn=9780804749411 |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projected losses of the retractable roof Continental resulted in a decision to restyle the vehicle, from the bottom of the windows down, as a member of the Fairlane 500 family because it could attract more buyers as a Ford with more reasonable retail price compared to adding extra costs to the already expensive retail price of a Lincoln Continental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ateupwithmotor.com/model-histories/ford-skyliner/ |author=Aaron Severson |title=Raising the Roof: The Ford Skyliner ‘Retrac’ |publisher=Ate Up With Motor |date= |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solid roof pillar of the Skyliner is similar to the appearance of [[Ford_Thunderbird_(second_generation)|2nd generation Ford Thunderbirds]] of 1958-1960.

Although the actual mechanical differed, the Skyliner's retractable roof design was adopted for the [[Lincoln Continental]] convertibles of 1961-67.

Two manual transmissions, a three-speed and three-speed with overdrive were available, as well as three-speed [[Ford-O-Matic]] automatic transmission. Starting in 1958, [[Cruise-O-Matic]] was added, which provided a second "drive" range ("D2"), allowing for an intermediate gear start.&lt;ref name=plaque/&gt;

The '''Ford Escape''' is a [[crossover (automobile)|compact crossover vehicle]] sold by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] since 2000 over four generations.

Ford released the original model in 2000 for the 2001 [[model year]]—a model jointly developed and released with [[Mazda]] of Japan—who took a lead in the engineering of the two models and sold their version as the '''Mazda Tribute'''. Although the Escape and Tribute shared the same underpinnings constructed from the [[Ford CD2 platform]] (based on [[Mazda G platform#GF|Mazda GF underpinnings]]), the only panels common to the two vehicles were the roof and floor pressings. Powertrains were supplied by Mazda with respect to the base [[inline-four engine]], with Ford providing the optional [[V6 engine|V6]]. At first, the twinned models were assembled by Ford in the US for North American consumption, with Mazda in Japan supplying cars for other markets. This followed a long history of Mazda-derived Fords, starting with the [[Mazda B-Series|Ford Courier]] in the 1970s. Ford also sold the first generation Escape in Europe and China as the '''Ford Maverick''', replacing the [[Nissan Terrano II|previous Nissan-sourced model]]. Then in 2004, for the 2005 model year, Ford's luxury [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] division released a rebadged version called the '''Mercury Mariner''', sold mainly in North America. The first iteration Escape remains notable as the first SUV to offer a [[hybrid vehicle drivetrain|hybrid drivetrain]] option, released in 2004 for the 2005 model year to North American markets only.

Mainstream production of the first generation Escape/Tribute ended in late 2006. For Asia-Pacific markets, both received respective facelifts in 2006 and had production fully transferred to [[Ford Lio Ho]] in Taiwan. Extended production of the Mazda lasted until 2010, with the Ford lingering on until 2012.

Second generations of the Ford Escape, Mercury Mariner, and Mazda Tribute were released in 2007 for the 2008 model year, but mostly restricted to North America. In other markets, the first generation models were either replaced by updated first series versions built in Taiwan, and/or by the unrelated [[Mazda CX-7]] (2006) and [[Ford Kuga]] (2008). The North American second generations were merely reskins of the first, with carry-over mechanicals, but with restyled exterior panels and a redesigned interior. Unlike the collaborative approach taken with the previous model, this time the design and engineering was carried out by Ford. A hybrid option was again available. The Mercury version lasted until late 2010, withdrawn from the market as part of the closure of the Mercury brand, with Mazda's Tribute ending production in late 2011. Ford ended manufacture of the second series Escape in 2012.

Ford released a third generation in 2012 for the 2013 model year, again, limited to North America. This time, rather than issuing an indigenous, albeit Mazda-derived model, Ford rebadged the Europe-designed [[Ford Kuga]]. Although still manufactured in the US, and fitted with slightly different powertrains, the third generation Escape is fully aligned with the Kuga as per the "One Ford" plan of having only one vehicle per segment internationally.

The first generation of Ford Escape was released in 2000 for the 2001 model year. It was jointly developed with [[Mazda]], in which Ford owned a controlling interest, and was released simultaneously with the Mazda Tribute. Both are built on the [[Ford CD2 platform]], in turn based on the [[Mazda G platform#GF|Mazda GF platform]].

At the time, larger sport-utility vehicles tended to use [[pickup truck]]-based, [[body-on-frame]] designs. Other car makers, [[Jeep]], [[Toyota]] and [[Honda]] had been offering smaller [[unibody]] designs, the [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)]], [[RAV4]] and [[CR-V]] respectively. [[Beam axle|Solid rear axles]] were commonly used on the full-sized truck-based SUVs and Jeep Cherokee due to their ability to carry heavy loads at the expense of a comfortable ride and good handling. Ford and Mazda decided to offer a car-like, [[unibody]] design with a fully [[independent suspension]] and [[rack and pinion]] steering similar to the RAV4 and CR-V, the Escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edmunds.com/ford/escape/2001/road-test.html |title=2001 Escape First Drive |website=[[Edmunds.com]] |date=January 1, 1999 |accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not meant for serious off-roading, a full-time [[all-wheel-drive]] (AWD) system supplied by [[Dana Holding Corporation|Dana]] was optional, which included a [[Locking differential|locking center differential]] activated by a switch on the dashboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Dana Gets 4WD Contract for Ford/Mazda SUVs |journal=Autoparts Report |date=April 25, 2000 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0UDO/is_22_13/ai_63676658 |accessdate=April 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AWD system normally sends most of the power from the engine to the front wheels. If slipping is detected at the front, more power will be sent to the rear wheels in a fraction of a second. The four wheel drive system was a newer version of Ford's "Control Trac" 4x4 system, dubbed the Control Trac II 4WD in the Escape. This system allowed the front wheels to receive 100% of the torque until a slip was detected. Using a Rotary Blade Coupling, the rear wheels could be sent up to 100% of the power in fractions of a second. When switching the system from "Auto" to "On," the front and rear axles are locked at a 50/50 split; the reaction time necessary to engage the rear wheels is reduced via an integrated bypass clutch. The Control Trac II system allows for a four-wheel drive vehicle without the use of a center differential. The entire braking system was built by [[Continental AG|Continental Teves]], including the [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] and various related suspension components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Continental Teves Supplies Brake System To Ford Escape/Mazda Tribute |journal=Autoparts Report |date=June 2, 2000 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0UDO/is_2000_June_2/ai_63676728 |accessdate=April 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Complete knock down|CKD]] production began in 2002 at Ford Lio Ho Motor Co. in Taiwan for various Asian markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Dana Corp.

In North America, it slotted below the larger, truck-based [[Ford Explorer|Explorer]] in Ford's lineup, but was larger than the small SUV offerings from [[Honda CR-V|Honda]] and [[Toyota RAV4|Toyota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jamieson |first=Scott |title=Escaping debt: a reasonably priced alternative to full-sized pickups and SUVs, the Ford Escape has all the power and comforts required |journal=Canadian Forest Industries |date=August 2001 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3764/is_200108/ai_n8957516 |accessdate=April 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is technically a crossover vehicle, it is marketed by Ford as part of its traditional [[SUV]] lineup (Escape, Explorer, Expedition) rather than its separate crossover lineup (Edge, Flex).

[[File:Ford Escape XLT interior.jpg|thumb|left|Right-hand drive interior]]

From 2001 to 2004, the Ford Escape was sold in Europe under the Maverick name, and replaced a rebadged version of the [[Nissan Mistral|Nissan Mistral/Terrano II]]. Only two versions were made, the 2.0&amp;nbsp;L Zetec [[Straight-4|inline 4]] engine with [[manual transmission]] and 3.0&amp;nbsp;L Duratec [[V6]] with [[automatic transmission]], both using gasoline as fuel. The absence of a diesel version did not help sales and the vehicle was temporarily discontinued in late 2003. However, the Maverick, in the UK for example, was only available in XLT trim. Plus, the dashboard was not the same as the US Escape; it was instead taken from the Mazda Tribute. The Maverick was reintroduced in 2005 in certain European markets with the Duratec V6 engine. It was announced that the Maverick would be assembled in Russia for the Russian market. As of 2006, the Maverick was no longer sold in Europe, leaving Ford without a compact SUV until the 2008 [[Ford Kuga]] was introduced. The Maverick was primarily designed for on-road use – sold with normal road tires, and to be used with [[front-wheel drive]] most of the time.

Crash-test results for the Escape have been mixed. In the New Car Assessment Program administered by the USA-based [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]], the car received five out of five stars for driver protection and four out of five stars for passenger protection in a {{convert|35|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} frontal impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Car Assessment Program: 2001 Ford Escape |publisher=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration |year=2001 |url=http://www.safercar.gov/portal/site/safercar/menuitem.db847bd57e3dc1f885dfc38c35a67789/?vgnextoid=c95df2905bf54110VgnVCM1000002fd17898RCRD&amp;model=6698 |accessdate=April 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SUV received five stars for both driver and rear passenger in the side impact test. In the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]'s {{convert|40|mph|km/h||abbr=on}} frontal offset test, 2001–2004 Escapes received a score of "Marginal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IIHS-HLDI: Ford Escape |publisher=IIHS-HLDI |year=2001 |url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=2 |accessdate=April 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the side impact crash test, vehicles equipped with the optional side air bags received a score of "Good" in the {{convert|31|mph|km/h||abbr=on}}, while those without the optional air bags received a score of "Poor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IIHS-HLDI: Ford Escape |publisher=IIHS-HLDI |year=2003 |url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=244 |accessdate=April 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Escapes are equipped with a passive 'Immobiliser' called SecuriLock. This feature includes an 'RFID' chip embedded in the key, which the car reads each time the driver inserts the key. If the key doesn't provide a valid confirmation signal, the vehicle does not run, even if the key is perfectly cut to match the original. Theft, injury, and collision losses reported to insurance companies for the Escape are among the lowest in its class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Injury, Collision, &amp; Theft Losses 2001–2003 |publisher=HLDI |date=September 2004 |url=http://www.iihs.org/research/hldi/ictl_pdf/ictl_0904.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=April 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;North America
In the United States, all Escapes included standard equipment such as power windows, power door locks, [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS), keyless entry, a folding rear-bench seat, 16-inch wheels, and air conditioning. In addition, an Escape buyer could choose from one of several different trim levels that were available, which included:

'''XLS''' (2001–2007): As the most basic trim level of the Escape, the XLS included: the 2.0-liter ''Zetec'' (2001–2004) and the 2.3-liter ''DuraTec'' (2005–2007) engines, a five-speed manual transmission, 15-inch steel wheels, an AM/FM stereo with cassette and CD players (later, a six-disc, in-dash CD changer) and four speakers, high-back front bucket seats, and cloth-and-vinyl seating surfaces. Options include 15- or 16-inch alloy wheels, the 3.0-liter V6 engine (2001–2004), and a four-speed automatic transmission (some of which was available as the '''XLS Popular Group''').

'''XLT''' (2001–2007): As the top-of-the-line trim level of the Escape in 2001, and the most popular trim level of the Escape throughout its entire run (2001–2007), the XLT added the following equipment to the base XLS trim level: 16-inch alloy wheels, cloth seating surfaces, and an enhanced interior. Options included an AM/FM stereo with a six-disc, in-dash CD changer (which later became standard equipment on all Escapes), the 3.0-liter V6 engine, a four-speed automatic transmission, a power sunroof, leather-and-vinyl-trimmed seating surfaces, and the seven-speaker premium audio system with amplifier and rear-mounted subwoofer.

'''XLT Sport''' (2002–2007): The XLT Sport was one of the more popular trim levels of the Escape from 2002 to 2007. It added equipment to the standard XLT equipment: the V6 engine, four-speed automatic transmission, sport interior trim, and 16-inch machined alloy wheels. Options were the same as the standard XLT trim level.

'''Limited''' (2002–2007): As the top-of-the-line trim level of the Escape from 2002–2007, the Limited trim level added the following equipment to the XLT Sport trim level: an AM/FM stereo with six-disc in-dash CD/MP3 changer, the seven-speaker premium audio system with amplifier and rear-mounted subwoofer, low-back front bucket seats, leather-trimmed seating surfaces, dual power heated front bucket seats, a security system, color-keyed exterior trim, luxury interior trim, and a unique front grille. Options were limited, but included a power sunroof.

'''Hybrid''' (2005–2007): Based on the midrange XLT trim level, the Hybrid included: the 2.3-liter ''DuraTec'' inline-four engine with an electric motor, power front bucket seats, low-back front bucket seats, enhanced partially-recycled cloth seating surfaces, and unique 16-inch alloy wheels. Options included a powered sunroof, a unique integrated GPS navigational system with hybrid information system, [[Sirius Satellite Radio]], the seven-speaker premium audio system with amplifier and rear-mounted subwoofer, leather-trimmed seating surfaces, and a "two-tone" exterior paint scheme, with silver-painted lower exterior trim and front and rear bumpers.

[[File:2005-'07 Ford Escape.JPG|thumb|right|2004–2006 Ford Escape (ZB)]]
The Escape and Tribute were updated in February 2004 for the 2005 model year with a new base engine (the 2.3&amp;nbsp;L {{nowrap|[2261 cc, 140 cu in]}} [[Ford Duratec engine#Duratec 23|Duratec 23]]), which replaced the Zetec 2.0&amp;nbsp;L {{nowrap|(1983 cc, 121 cu in)}} {{convert|127|hp|abbr=on}} 4-cylinder. The most powerful engine remained the {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on}} Duratec 3.0 L {{nowrap|(2976 cc, 181 cu in)}} V6, with new engine mounts. Ford also added advanced airbag and seatbelt safety systems, an intelligent AWD system, and exterior minor changes, which included a redesigned front bumper. The 2005 model year was the first with an automatic transmission available on the base four-cylinder models. The automatic shifter was moved from the column to the console on all models equipped with automatic transmissions. Ford also deleted the recline feature on the rear seats to improve the safety of occupants in the rear seats in the case of a rear crash.

A revamped ZC Escape designed in Taiwan went on sale in the second half of 2006 for the Asian and Pacific markets (except [[South Korea]], where the North American-market Escape is sold).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://autoincar.blogspot.com/2007/09/ford-thailand-has-launched-revised.html |title=Ford Thailand has launched a revised Escape suv |work=AUTO in CAR |publisher=Autoincar.blogspot.com |date=September 27, 2007 |accessdate=May 2, 2009}} {{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major external changes included a redesigned front bumper, grille, headlights and hood, and rear bumper, as well as [[LED]] taillights.

On the inside, changes included a floor-mounted automatic-transmission shifter, in place of the column shifter, as well as a redesigned center stack containing audio and climate controls. Climate control is automatic on all models except the XLS. The Limited model also featured full color-coded bumpers, wheel arches and side moldings, as well as side mirrors with integrated LED indicators. Rear drum brakes have been replaced by disc brakes all round.

The 3.0&amp;nbsp;L V6 has been modified to reduce fuel consumption by over 10%,{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} while the 2.3&amp;nbsp;L 4-cylinder has improved midrange torque and an electronic throttle, as well as a slight increase in power to {{convert|109|kW|abbr=on}}. Both engines had been certified to meet [[Euro III]] emission regulations. A four-speed automatic carried over and was the sole transmission choice. Two different four-speed automatic transmissions were used,  [[Ford CD4E transmission|CD4E]] for 3.0&amp;nbsp;L V6 and [[Mazda G4A-EL transmission|GF4AX-EL]] for 2.3&amp;nbsp;L 4-cylinder.

The ZD Escape went on sale in mid-2008, bringing numerous changes. In Australia, the V6 engine was dropped, leaving only the 2.3-liter four-cylinder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brogan |first=Matt |date=August 25, 2008 |url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/15622/2008-ford-escape-xlt-review/ |title=2008 Ford Escape XLT Review |publisher=CarAdvice |accessdate=May 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model range was also simplified, with only a single specification available. Changes to the body included an all-new front bumper, grille, headlights and bonnet, featuring an enlarged Ford emblem set upon a three-bar chrome grille. At the rear, new, slimmer tail lights were featured, which were arranged horizontally, rather than vertically. In addition, the B-pillar was now painted black, rather than body-colour. Compared with the previous model, all external bumpers, mirrors, and cladding were painted the same colour as the body (previously, this was only available on the upscale Limited model). Equipment levels have also improved. Compared to the base model ZC Escape, the ZD included standard side airbags, automatic climate control, 16" alloy wheels, and mirrors with integrated indicators. Unlike most other competitors in its class, curtain airbags and electronic stability control were not available.

In 2009, another facelift of the ZD Escape brought about a new grille and front bumper. Chrome trim was completely removed from the grille, replaced with a smaller, black honeycomb grille as the last ever Ford Escape. In its final years, it was sold side by side with its successor, [[Ford Kuga]] until the Kuga replaced it in 2013.

;2000–2004
[[File:2001-2004 Mazda Tribute Classic V6 wagon (2007-12-12).jpg|thumb|left|2000–2004 Mazda Tribute]]

The Tribute made its debut at the 2000 [[Los Angeles Auto Show]] as a compact crossover SUV, a segment pioneered by the [[Toyota RAV4]] in 1994. It was the first SUV offered by Mazda since the [[Navajo|Mazda Navajo]], a rebadged two-door [[Ford Explorer]] that Mazda retired after the 1994 model year. In Japan, Mazda had an SUV called the [[Suzuki Escudo|Mazda Proceed Levante]], a rebadged [[Suzuki Escudo]], but the Tribute was Mazda's first original SUV. The Ford plant in [[Claycomo, Missouri]] assembled Tribute for the North American market, alongside Ford Escape. The [[Hofu Plant|Mazda plant]] in [[Hofu]], Japan and the [[Ford Lio Ho]] plant in [[Taiwan]] assembled Tribute for their respective markets.

The 2001–2006 Mazda Tribute was available as front- or four-wheel drive and featured a plain-looking but comfortable roomy interior, decent handling and car-like ride. The Tribute and Escape debuted in 2000, offering front or [[all wheel drive]] and a choice of a [[Transversely mounted engine|transversely mounted]] 2.0&amp;nbsp;L Ford Zetec [[Ford engines|4-cylinder]] engine with 129&amp;nbsp;[[horsepower#PS|PS]] (95&amp;nbsp;kW)/183&amp;nbsp;[[Newton metre|N·m]] (135&amp;nbsp;[[foot-pound force|lb·ft]]), or 3.0&amp;nbsp;L [[Ford Duratec]] [[V6]] with 203&amp;nbsp;PS (150&amp;nbsp;kW)/265&amp;nbsp;N·m (195&amp;nbsp;lb·ft). The 2.0&amp;nbsp;L 4-cylinder engine had [[Timing belt (camshaft)|Timing belt]] driven [[Camshaft]]s, while the 3.0&amp;nbsp;L [[Duratec#Duratec 30|Duratec]] [[V6]] featured a maintenance-free timing chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samarins.com/reviews/tribute.html |title=2001–2011 Mazda Tribute |website=Samarins.com |accessdate=May 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:05-07 Mazda Tribute .jpg|thumb|2005–2007 Mazda Tribute (US)]]

;2004–2006
Both the Escape and Tribute were refreshed in 2004 for the 2005 model year. The base engine became the Mazda 2.3&amp;nbsp;L [[Mazda MZR engine|MZR]] [[straight-4|4]] with 153&amp;nbsp;PS (114&amp;nbsp;kW)/206&amp;nbsp;N·m (152&amp;nbsp;lb·ft), and the top remained the 3.0&amp;nbsp;L [[Duratec#Duratec 30|Duratec]] [[V6]], now with torque down to 261&amp;nbsp;N·m (193&amp;nbsp;lb·ft). In North American-built models, a floor-mounted [[automatic transmission]] shifter replaced the column shifter. However, Japanese-built models continued with a column shifter. Mazda decided to halt production after the 2006 [[model year]]

Mazda Japan released a limited version, the Mazdaspeed Tribute, in the year 2004 with a 2.3-liter MZR engine that has 220 PS (164.05&amp;nbsp;kW)/ 254 N·m (195&amp;nbsp;lb·ft) that is utilized by a column shifter. However, Mazda Japan decided to end its production in 2005.

;2006–2008 (Asia-Pacific)
[[File:2007 Mazda Tribute (MY06) V6 wagon (2010-09-19).jpg|thumb|2006–2008 Mazda Tribute (Australia)]]

A significantly face-lifted version of the Tribute was released in the second half of 2006 for [[Asia Pacific]] markets. The updated Tribute featured a larger, bolder grille, with an enlarged Mazda emblem, as well as restyled front bumper and headlights. Side mirrors featured integrated indicators.

On the inside, changes included a new floor-mounted automatic-transmission shifter, in place of the old column shifter (Asia-Pacific model only; US-built Tribute gained the floor shifter in 2005). The dash was updated with a brand-new radio and automatic climate control with digital read-out, on certain models. Mechanically, the rear drum brakes were replaced by disc brakes. Engines remain the same, but the [[V6]] has been modified to reduce fuel consumption by over 10%, while the [[Straight-4|4-cylinder]] has improved mid-range torque and an electronic throttle. Both engines had been certified to meet [[Euro III]] emission regulations.

Starting from 2006, Mazda stopped selling and producing Tribute in Japan, and replaced it with the similar-sized [[Mazda CX-7|CX-7]]. In 2008, Mazda Australia also discontinued the Tribute, the absence of the Tribute being filled by the Mazda CX-7 introduced in the previous year. For other Asia-Pacific markets, the production of Tribute was shifted to the [[Ford Lio Ho]] plant in [[Zhongli District|Zhongli]], [[Taiwan]], which also produces Tribute's twin, Ford Escape, for Asia-Pacific markets. This arrangement continued until early 2010, when the Tribute for the Asia-Pacific markets ceased production, being fully replaced by the CX-7 imported from Japan.

=== Mercury ===
{{multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 220
| image2 = 2005-07 Mercury Mariner.jpg | caption2 = Mercury Mariner
}}
Introduced in 2004 for the 2005-model-year refresh of the Ford Escape in the US, Ford's [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] division released a luxury version called the Mercury Mariner. The Mariner sits above the Escape in the Ford-Mercury-Lincoln hierarchy. The Mariner is Mercury's first car-based SUV, and is slotted below the [[Mercury Mountaineer|Mountaineer]] in the lineup. The Mariner was officially offered in the US, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE. The Mercury includes stylistic differences, such as a two-tone interior, turn signal repeaters borrowed from the European-market Ford Maverick (the Escape's name in Europe), monotone cladding, and the signature [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] "waterfall" front grille. Unlike its counterparts, a manual transmission was not part of the powertrain lineup. The Mariner was the first Mercury with a [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]] since the [[Mercury Cougar#Seventh generation|Mercury Cougar]] was dropped in 2002. For 2006, the lineup was expanded with the introduction of the Mariner Hybrid. Sales ended after the 2007 model, replaced by a second generation, again a rebadged Ford Escape.

On September 7, 2006, Ford delivered a special "Presidential Edition" Mercury Mariner Hybrid to former President [[Bill Clinton]]. Its custom features include: LED lighting, 110-volt outlet, rear bucket seats, center console &amp; rear seat fold-out writing desks, personal DVD players for each seat, refrigerator, increased rear seat legroom. There have also been several undisclosed security modifications made to the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/AUTOS/09/07/clinton_hybrid/index.html |publisher=CNN |title=Clinton to get custom hybrid SUV |date=September 7, 2006 |accessdate=November 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mariner Hybrid [[powertrain]] was identical to its sibling, the Ford Escape Hybrid. It was launched to the U.S. market in 2006 and was discontinued in 2010 (in the second generation) with the rest of the brand. The Mariner hybrid sold a total of 12,300 units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1076382_green-car-death-list-2012-models-to-which-we-bid-adieu |title=Green-Car Death List: 2012 Models To Which We Bid Adieu |author=John Voelcker |publisher=Green Car Reports |date=May 22, 2012 |accessdate=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the Ford Escape Hybrid, the Mariner Hybrid is a "full" hybrid electric system, meaning the system can switch automatically between pure electric power, pure gasoline engine power, or a combination of electric battery and gasoline engine operating together, for maximum performance and efficiency at all speeds and loads. When braking or decelerating, the Mariner's hybrid system uses regenerative braking, where the electric drive motor becomes a generator, converting the vehicle's momentum back to electricity for storage in the batteries. With {{Convert|155|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, the Mariner Hybrid has nearly the same acceleration performance as the conventional {{Convert|200|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} [[V6]] Mariner. Again, just like the Escape Hybrid, it gets a respectable average of {{convert|34|mpgUS|L/100 km mpgimp}} and is sometimes said to be the most fuel efficient [[sport utility vehicle]] on the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.automoblog.net/2008/11/11/2009-mercury-mariner-hybrid-review/ |title=2009 Mercury Mariner Hybrid Review |publisher=Automoblog.net |accessdate=January 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:05-07 Ford Escape Hybrid .jpg|thumb|2005–2007 Ford Escape Hybrid]]

The Ford Escape Hybrid and Mercury Mariner Hybrid are the [[gas-electric hybrid vehicle|gasoline-electric hybrid]] powered versions that launched in the U.S. in 2004 for the 2005 model year.  Assembled in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], it was the first hybrid SUV produced for sale and the first hybrid from an American manufacturer (alongside the [[Chevrolet Silverado#Hybrid|Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra Hybrids]] during the same model year).  According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the first-generation Ford Escape Hybrid is 70% more efficient than the regular Escape.  While the Mercury Mariner was also offered as a hybrid, the option was not available on the Mazda Tribute.  

Escape hybrid versions can be identified by the "Hybrid" badges located on the front driver's and passenger's doors as well as near the right tailgate. In addition, the driver's side window in the cargo area is smaller to accommodate a ventilation slot for the high voltage battery. There was also a "Special Appearance Package" available as an option on the 2005–2007 Hybrid models. This package replaced the traditional lower cladding of the Escape with a silver finish. Standard equipment on the Escape Hybrid includes: an eight-way [[power seat|power adjustable driver's seat]], dual-zone automatic [[air conditioning]], [[cruise control]], a six-[[Compact Disc player|CD]] stereo, 16-inch [[alloy wheels]], power door locks with remote [[keyless entry]], and [[power windows]].

Ford built 17,000 Escape Hybrids in the second half of 2004, four times as many as it had originally planned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electricdrive.org/index.php?tg=articles&amp;topics=7 Hybrid Sales Figures/Tax Credits for Hybrids] Electric Drive Transportation Association.

==== Drivetrain technology ====
The Escape Hybrid uses hybrid technology similar to that used in the [[Toyota Prius]]. Ford engineers realized their technology may conflict with patents held by Toyota, which led to a 2004 patent-sharing accord between the companies, licensing Ford's use of some of Toyota's hybrid technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB107880303676250060 |title=Wall Street Journal Online – ''Toyota to License Hybrid Patents For Use by Ford'' – MARCH 9, 2004 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=March 9, 2004 |accessdate=August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in exchange for Toyota's use of some of Ford's diesel and direct-injection engine technology.&lt;ref name="Detroit News - Aug 8, 2005"&gt;[http://www.cars.com/go/news/Story.jsp?section=news&amp;subject=recent&amp;story=080805storyaDN&amp;referer= Cars.com – ''Ford Slams Toyota on Hybrids''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308210807/http://www.cars.com/go/news/Story.jsp?section=news&amp;subject=recent&amp;story=080805storyaDN&amp;referer= |date=2012-03-08 }} – Reported by Christine Tierney, Detroit News, August 8, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Ford maintains that Ford received no technical assistance from Toyota in developing the hybrid powertrain, but that some hybrid engine technologies developed by Ford independently were found to be similar to technologies previously patented by Toyota, so licenses were obtained.&lt;ref name="Detroit News - Aug 8, 2005" /&gt; [[Aisin Seiki Co.|Aisin Seiki Co.

[[File:2006 Mercury Mariner Hybrid engine.jpg|thumb|Engine compartment]]

The Escape Hybrid is a [[full hybrid]], meaning the system can switch automatically between pure electric power, pure gasoline engine power, or a combination of electric battery and gasoline engine operating together, for maximum performance and efficiency at all speeds and loads. When braking or decelerating, the Escape's hybrid system uses [[regenerative braking]], where the electric drive motor becomes a generator, converting the vehicle's momentum back to electricity for storage in the batteries. The Escape Hybrid's 133 [[horsepower]] (99&amp;nbsp;kW) Atkinson cycle gasoline [[Straight-4|I4]] engine and electric motor combine to give {{Convert|155|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, which gives the Hybrid Escape nearly the same acceleration performance as the conventional {{Convert|200|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} [[V6]] Escape due to the electric motor's torque being available from zero rpm.

The hybrid is said to give approximately 75% greater efficiency, the FWD version has EPA ratings of 30 mpg and 28 highway, with combined 29 mpg. The AWD version EPA ratings 28 city and 26 highway, combined 27 mpg &lt;sub&gt;-U.S.&lt;/sub&gt; in city traffic, and has demonstrated it can travel 400–500 miles (644–805&amp;nbsp;km) on a single {{convert|15.0|U.S.gal|L impgal|adj=on}} mpg&lt;sub&gt;-U.S.&lt;/sub&gt; (7.6L-8.1 L/100&amp;nbsp;km; 35–37&amp;nbsp;mpg&lt;sub&gt;-imp&lt;/sub&gt;) on the highway. To obtain these mileage figures, the owners manual states that pure gasoline, not ethanol blends, must be used.  In 2006, Ford showed an Escape that could run on E85 fuel.

Unlike conventional vehicles, hybrids often achieve better figures in the city because they do not waste power idling and can recover some power when stopping (by using [[regenerative braking]]) that would be wasted in a conventional vehicle.

=== Recalls ===

==== Subframe failure ====

On April 2, 2014 Ford announced another recall on 386,000 Ford Escapes and Mazda Tributes for model years 2001-2004 for Escapes manufactured October 22, 1999, through January 23, 2004 for Canada and The northern salt belt states.These states include, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia. For subframe rust that can result in the lower control arm mount breaking or detaching from the subframe, resulting in a loss of steering control and the risk of crash, Dealers will install a crossbrace reinforcement to any vehicle affected by the recall. However, if the Vehicle can't be repaired, Ford will buy back the vehicles from their owners and will offer them an alternative vehicle for transportation. Model years 2005-2007 are not affected.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2014/04/07/ford-recall-fusion-escape/7427299/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://jalopnik.com/almost-400-000-old-ford-escape-suvs-recalled-1560352974&lt;/ref&gt;

The second generation Ford Escape debuted at the 2006 [[Los Angeles International Auto Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061129/FREE/61129001/1064/cara_submit |title=Ford toughens Escape for 2008 |publisher=AutoWeek.com |accessdate=November 29, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929105215/http://www.autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20061129%2FFREE%2F61129001%2F1064%2Fcara_submit |archive-date=September 29, 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The North American-market Escape and its Mazda Tribute and Mercury Mariner siblings were redesigned to stay competitive with other new compact SUVs, however most of the internals have been carried over for the 2008 model year. The Escape still uses the [[Ford CD2 platform|CD2 platform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/GeneralFuture/articleId=109656 |title=2008 Ford Escape gets new look |publisher=[[Edmunds.com]] |accessdate=March 16, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211015853/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/GeneralFuture/articleId%3D109656 |archivedate=December 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford also included an electronic stability control system standard on the 2008 Escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=116798/ |title=Ford To Make Stability Control Standard by 2009 |publisher=[[Edmunds.com]] |accessdate=September 13, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504191817/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId%3D116798/ |archivedate=May 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The updated Escape received some styling cues from the [[Ford Explorer|Explorer]], [[Ford Edge|Edge]], and [[Ford Expedition|Expedition]]. Changes include a new grille with larger headlamps in the front fascia, while the sides were revised with cleaner lines and rounder wheel arches. The interior is also completely redesigned, including the newest standard Ford family navigation system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060419/AUTO03/604190322/1149 |title=Sneak Peek: 2008 Ford Escape |work=[[Detroit News]] |accessdate=April 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 Escape and its [[Mercury Mariner#Second generation|Mercury Mariner]] sibling were the first vehicles to feature Ford's pull-drift steering mode, an enhancement made possible by applying software control to the [[Electric Power Steering]] (EPS) system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=30019 |title=Ford Builds on Electric Power Steering Technology To Enhance Drift Mode, Enable More Features &amp;#124; Ford Motor Company Newsroom |publisher=Media.ford.com |date=March 12, 2009 |accessdate=May 2, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 23, 2010, it was announced that Ford would end production on the second generation Escape in 2011 and move production to its Louisville Assembly Plant in Louisville, Kentucky, where it was slated to be succeeded by a Taiwanese version of its European CUV counterpart, the [[Ford Kuga]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2010/06/23/report-ford-to-halt-missouri-escape-production-in-2011?icid=sphere_blogsmith_inpage_autoblog "Report: Ford to halt Missouri Escape production in 2011"] from Autoblog (June 23, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

A new concept version for the Asian market, called the ''Ford Escape Adventure Concept'', was revealed at the 2007 [[Tokyo Motor Show]]. It features a revised front and rear fascia, incorporating Ford's three-bar grille styling theme and restyled LED tail lamps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paultan.org/archives/2007/10/24/tokyo-2007-live-ford-escape-adventure-concept/ Paultan.org – TOKYO 2007 LIVE: Ford Escape Adventure Concept] – October 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2.3&amp;nbsp;L Duratec 23 was replaced by a new 2.5&amp;nbsp;L {{nowrap|(2488 cc, 152 cu in)}} Duratec 25,&lt;ref name="burgess09"/&gt; which boosted standard power to {{convert|171|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|171|lbft|abbr=on}} of torque, while increasing fuel economy by 1 mpg (~2L/100&amp;nbsp;km) on both urban and extra-urban cycles. The optional 3.0&amp;nbsp;L Duratec 30 V6 was thoroughly updated, resulting in a {{convert|40|hp|abbr=on}} increase, bringing power output to {{convert|240|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|223|lbft|abbr=on}} of torque. The Duratec 30 also sees a {{convert|1|mpgus|abbr=on}} fuel economy improvement. The "Escape" badge is entirely removed from the front doors.

The Hybrid is also upgraded to use the 2.5&amp;nbsp;L (albeit still using the [[Atkinson cycle]] for better fuel economy). Efficiency improved to {{convert|34|mpgus|abbr=on}} city and {{convert|31|mpgus|abbr=on}} highway according to the USEPA. The 2.5&amp;nbsp;L engine brings the Hybrid's power output up by {{convert|22|hp|abbr=on}} when the electric motor is added in.

Other mechanical changes include a new {{convert|18.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} rear stabilizer bar, revised suspension tuning, upgrades to the 3.0&amp;nbsp;L V6 that brought power to 240&amp;nbsp;hp,&lt;ref name="burgess09"/&gt; and a new exhaust system on all Escapes. The braking system for the Hybrid versions has been revised with a vacuum assist unit that reviewers have said give the brakes a consistent feel over the entire travel of the brake pedal.&lt;ref name="burgess09"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://apps.detnews.com/apps/autoreviews/index.php?id=30578 |author=Burgess, Scott |title=Ford Escape adds power, refinement |date=May 28, 2008 |work=The Detroit News |accessdate=September 1, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130208033001/http://apps.detnews.com/apps/autoreviews/index.php?id=30578 |archivedate=February 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous versions of the Hybrid were reported to have a slightly mushy brake feel, primarily due to the fact that for the first part of the brake travel and braking the system is regenerating power instead of engaging the brake pads against the rotors. However, the brakes, when tested, gave the Escape extremely long stops.

Also in 2009, [[Ford Sync|Ford's SYNC]] system is standard on the Hybrid, Hybrid Limited, and conventional Limited models, and optional on the XLS and XLT.

The Escape underwent some minor aerodynamic changes for 2009, including a revised front chin spoiler and rear tire spoilers. Along with the addition of rear tire spoilers is an optional 17" chrome-clad wheel equipped with a new Michelin "Low-Rolling-Resistance-Tire", slightly increasing ground clearance and improving traction over the standard 16" wheels and tires. Another new feature is Ford's Easy-Fuel capless fuel filling system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=27548- media.ford.com Press Release] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525174153/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=27548- |date=May 25, 2011 }} – February 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2009 the Escape was among the four Ford vehicles, along with the Focus, F-Series and Ranger, to benefit the most from the [[Cash for Clunkers]] program, where it showed a 49 percent increase in sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/Auto-sales-post-best-month-of-apf-4058866656.html?x=0&amp;.v=24 |title=Auto sales post best month of year but could slow |publisher=Yahoo!

In 2009 for the 2010 model year, the Escape will add three new features that will be standard on all trims: Ford's MyKey, trailer sway controls and Integrated Spotter Mirror for better blind spot viewing. Everything else added in the 2008 and 2009 model years will be carried over, but the optional orders have been renamed to Rapid Specification Codes (100s for XLS, 200s for XLT, and 300s for Limited).

New optional features for 2010: active park assist (APA) is a new feature available since mid-2009 as an option on the 2010 Ford Escape Limited (currently only optional on the Ford Flex, Lincoln MKT, and Lincoln MKS). Active Park Assist will detect an available parallel parking space and automatically steer the vehicle into the space (hands free) while the driver controls the accelerator, gearshift and brakes. The system will visually and audibly instruct the driver to park the vehicle. Active Park Assist system uses sensors on the front and rear of the vehicle to guide the vehicle into a parking space. Rear-view camera system – uses an exterior camera embedded in the rear of the vehicle that sends images to a video display in the rearview mirror or the navigation system screen to help enhance visibility directly behind the vehicle when it is in reverse.

No cosmetic changes were made for the 2011 model year. The only minor change is the standardization of SYNC Traffic &amp; Directions on any models coming equipped with Sync.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conceptcarz.com/z18486/Ford-Escape.aspx 2011 Ford Escape] from conceptcarz (July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no cosmetic or equipment changes for the 2012 model year. The third-generation Escape was unveiled at the 2012 North American International Auto Show in Detroit.

Previously unavailable [[Electronic Stability Control]] system became standard on the second generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/esc/esc.aspx |title=IIHS-HLDI |publisher=Iihs.org |accessdate=November 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407160743/http://www.iihs.org/ratings/esc/esc.aspx |archivedate=April 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] [[crash test]]s the Escape along with its cousins, the Mercury Mariner and the Mazda Tribute, are rated "Good" in both frontal and side impact crash tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=1022 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Ford Escape |publisher=Iihs.org |date=October 21, 2010 |accessdate=November 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=943 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Ford Escape |publisher=Iihs.org |date=October 21, 2010 |accessdate=November 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are rated "Good" for rear crash protection as well&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/head_restraints/headrestraints.aspx?ford |title=Head restraints: Ford |publisher=Iihs.org |accessdate=November 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209030759/http://www.iihs.org/ratings/head_restraints/headrestraints.aspx?ford |archivedate=December 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and were given the "Top Safety Pick" award until 2010.

[[File:08 Mazda Tribute.jpg|thumb|Mazda Tribute]]

In 2007 for the 2008 model year, the Tribute was significantly revamped, like its Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner siblings. Originally set to be renamed the [[Mazda CX-5]], the vehicle kept the Tribute name. The changes were significant, but fell short of a "clean sheet" redesign, as the vehicles remained on the [[Ford CD2 platform|CD2 platform]], and kept the old 2.3&amp;nbsp;L [[Mazda MZR engine|MZR]] [[straight 4|I4]], and 3.0&amp;nbsp;L [[Ford Duratec engine#Duratec 30|AJ]] [[V6]] engines. Visible changes include all new sheet metal and interior. The interior was significantly upgraded using all new components and higher quality materials, and was generally praised by automotive journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060419/AUTO03/604190322/1149 |title=Sneak Peek: 2008 Ford Escape |work=[[Detroit News]] |accessdate=April 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike the first generation of the Tribute, which had unique exterior and interior from its siblings, the new model only differs from its siblings in the "nose" (front fenders, hood, and front fascia), tail lights and detailing. Notable changes to the exterior include higher belt line, and more pronounced wheel arches. Overall the car was to look larger and more substantial than the previous model. As a cost-saving measure, the rear brake was reverted to [[drum brake]], with predictable criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/previews/13141/first-drive-2008-mazda-tribute-s-touring.html |title=2008 Mazda Tribute s Touring – First Drive Review |publisher=[[Car and Driver]] |accessdate=January 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edmunds.com/mazda/tribute/2009/review.html |title=2009 Mazda Tribute Review |accessdate=January 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 Mazda Tribute (non-hybrid) was first unveiled at the 2007 [[Montreal International Auto Show]], and the 2008 Mazda Tribute went on sale in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=d08b99a1-df2d-4c1e-ab70-814788edf7b9 |title=New CX-9 is Mazda's latest crossover |work=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]] |accessdate=January 21, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324203955/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=d08b99a1-df2d-4c1e-ab70-814788edf7b9 |archivedate=March 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new addition was the Hybrid model, which was previously only available on the Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner.

The Tribute received additional major changes to improve performance for the 2009 model year, mostly by way of mechanical upgrades. Most significantly, all new engines replaced the increasingly outmatched 2.3L [[Inline-four engine|I4]] and 3.0L V6. Mazda's new MZR 2.5L I4 replaced the 2.3L, boosting horsepower to {{convert|171|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|171|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4000 rpm.&lt;ref name=2009specs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mazdausamedia.com/content/2009-tribute |title=2009 Tribute |publisher=MazdaUSAMedia |accessdate=August 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite increased horsepower, fuel economy also increased by {{convert|1|mpgus|abbr=on}} on both urban and extra-urban cycles. The optional 3.0&amp;nbsp;L ([[Ford Duratec engine#Duratec 30|AJ]]) [[V6]] was thoroughly updated, resulting in a {{convert|40|hp|abbr=on}} increase, bringing power output to {{convert|240|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|223|lbft|abbr=on}} of torque. It also sees a 1 mpg improvement. The Tribute Hybrid was dropped after the 2009 model year.

Another significant change was the switch to Ford's new [[Ford 6F transmission|6F]] 6-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]], which became standard on all V6 equipped models and optional on the I4. As well, new front and {{convert|18.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} rear stabilizer bars were added for 2009 to improve ride handling after complaints about diminished performance following the 2008 changes. Others changes included redesigned seats, daytime running lamps, optional steering mounted audio controls, and other additional features. The Tribute was discontinued in November 2011 at the end of the 2011 model year, replaced by the [[Mazda CX-5]] for 2012.

=== Mercury ===
[[File:2nd Mercury Mariner -- 03-30-2012.JPG|thumb|2008–2010 Mercury Mariner]]

For the 2008 model year the Mariner was significantly updated with a new look although it remained on the [[Ford CD2 platform]] used by the previous generation. The first 2008 Mercury Mariner was unveiled at the South Florida International Auto Show on October 6, 2006. The changes included a new seats, headlights, taillights, a new liftgate, a higher beltline and new doors and wheels. The interior was also significantly updated with higher quality materials and more refined features. The engines remained the same but the 3.0&amp;nbsp;L Duratec [[V6]] has been modified to reduce fuel consumption by 10%.

The 2009 Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner were unveiled at the 2008 Washington Auto Show. Sporting a 2.5-liter engine and 6-speed automatic transmission that replaced the four-speed [[automatic transmission]], the new powertrain improved the EPA fuel economy by 1 mile per gallon and increased power by 11% to {{convert|170|hp|0|abbr=on}}. Also, the existing 3.0-liter Duratec V6 was bumped from {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on|0}} to {{convert|240|hp|abbr=on|0}}. The new engine was also the new basis for Ford's hybrid models, including the Ford Escape Hybrid and Mercury Mariner Hybrid. "For every eight Escape and Mariner vehicles we sell, one of them is a hybrid, and the appeal is growing," says Sue Cischke, Ford senior vice president, Sustainability, Environment and Safety Engineering.

For the 2010 model year, the Mariner added Ford's MyKey and trailer sway controls as standard on all trim levels. The Mariner engine has a [[Flexible-fuel vehicle|Flex-Fuel]] option on all models—meaning they can use E85 fuel or regular unleaded only on the optional V6 engine. Ford has also done away with the Euro-style turn signal repeaters for this model year. For the 2011 model year, the Mariner featured [[HD Radio]] as a standard, but continued with the same features as the 2010 models. This version of the Mariner was its last, as Ford discontinued the Mercury brand due to declining sales. Ford ended production of the Mariner in October 2010. The last one rolled off the assembly line on October 5, 2010.

[[File:2nd Ford Escape Hybrid -- 04-29-2011 1.jpg|thumb|2009–2012 Ford Escape Hybrid]]

The second generation Ford Escape Hybrid received some minor styling tweaks inside and out. The major cosmetic changes included new bumpers, grille, headlights and taillights to match Ford's new edge style. But the drivetrain was essentially the same mechanically but has had extensive software modifications.&lt;ref name="cars.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cars.com/go/crp/research.jsp?makeid=14&amp;modelid=8592&amp;year=2008&amp;section=reviews |title=2008 Ford Escape Hybrid Reviews by Cars.com Experts and Consumers |publisher=Cars.com |accessdate=July 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2009, a larger, more powerful engine was introduced, together with a revised suspension, addition of stability control, the debut of "Sync" voice-control system and a capless fuel filler system.&lt;ref name=Edmunds2009test/&gt; The batteries and other hybrid components in a 2009 Escape hybrid added about 136&amp;nbsp;kg (300&amp;nbsp;lbs) to the vehicle.

The second generation Escape Hybrid was offered in two levels of specification, an undesignated ''base'' model and the more expensive "Limited" trim. The ''base'' included: a 60/40 split-fold rear bench seat, ''[[electronic stability control|AdvanceTrac]]'' with roll stability control, and a single-disc four-speaker CD/MP3 stereo with [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] compatibility. The "Limited" adds: a chrome front grille, heated front seats, a six-way power driver's seat and full leather upholstery, [[rear park assist]], ambient lighting, and 16-inch six-spoke alloy wheels. For the 2009 model year, [[Ford SYNC]] became standard on both Hybrid trims and the Ford Escape Hybrid replaced the "ESCAPE" badges on doors with "''HYBRID''," while relocating the logo for Ford hybrid models from near the driver's side doors next to the "''HYBRID''" text. 2010 models saw the addition of [[MyKey]], trailer sway controls, and integrated spotter mirror for better blind spot viewing. New optional extras are active park assist and a rear-view camera.

Three companies have converted Ford Escape Hybrids to [[plug-in hybrid|plug-in]] under a contract with the [[New York State Energy Research and Development Authority|NYSERDA]] and delivered them in 2007: Electrovaya of [[Toronto]] Canada, [[Hymotion]] also of Toronto Canada, [[Hybrids Plus]] of Boulder Colorado, United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.calcars.org/calcars-news/620.html |title=NYS Governor Announces Winners for PHEV Conversions |publisher=Calcars.org |accessdate=August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ford]] developed a research Escape Plug-in Hybrid and delivered the first of a fleet of 20 to [[Southern California Edison]] (SCE) in December 2007 to begin road testing. This project is a collaboration aimed to explore the future of [[plug-in hybrid]]s and evaluate how the vehicles might interact with the home and the utility's electrical grid.

This plug-in version of the Escape Hybrid runs on gasoline or [[E85]] and is also part of the demonstration fleet Ford developed in a partnership with Southern California Edison and the [[Electric Power Research Institute]].&lt;ref name=USDoE&gt;[http://www.ford.com/about-ford/news-announcements/press-releases/press-releases-detail/pr-ford-motor-company-delivers-28424 Ford Motor Company – Press Release – Ford Motor Company Delivers Flexible Fuel, Plug-In Vehicle to Department of Energy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622032409/http://www.ford.com/about-ford/news-announcements/press-releases/press-releases-detail/pr-ford-motor-company-delivers-28424 |date=June 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the E85 version and the conventional gasoline engine version use a 10 [[kwh]] [[lithium-ion battery]], which allows for a {{convert|30|mi|adj=on}} range at {{convert|40|mph}} or less. When the battery's charge drops to 30%, the vehicle switches to its four-cylinder engine, assisted by the batteries, operating as a regular [[hybrid electric vehicle]]. The vehicle has a display system that shows the driver how efficient the vehicle is at any given time. If the vehicle uses its engine and is running in traditional hybrid mode, [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] is rated at {{convert|88|mpgU.S.}} in the city and {{convert|50|mpgU.S.}} on the highway.&lt;ref name=USDoE/&gt;&lt;ref name=HC032009/&gt;

On August 2009 Ford delivered the first Escape Plug-in equipped with intelligent [[vehicle-to-grid]] (V2G) communications and control system technology to [[American Electric Power]] of [[Columbus, Ohio]]. This technology allows the vehicle operator to program when to recharge the vehicle, for how long and at what utility rate. The battery systems communicate directly with the electrical grid via smart meters provided by utility companies through wireless networking.&lt;ref name="Autoblog.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/08/18/ford-announces-electric-vehicle-to-grid-communications-system |title=Ford announces electric vehicle-to-grid communications system |publisher=Autoblog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the two years since the demonstration program began, the fleet of Escape Plug-ins has logged more than {{convert|75000|mi|km}}, and Ford plans to equip all 21 plug-in hybrid Escapes with the vehicle-to-grid communications technology.&lt;ref name="Autoblog.com"/&gt;

The Ford demonstration vehicles and Hybrids Plus conversions are similar. The conversion involves the replacement of the original [[NiMH battery]], located on the floor of the trunk, with a larger capacity [[Li-ion battery]], in the same location and substantially the same volume as the original battery. The Electrovaya and Hymotion conversions retain the original battery, and augment its capacity with a Li-ion battery that occupies a significant portion of the trunk. In all cases, the conversion also involves the addition of a charger and of a power plug.

The fourth generation Ford Escape made its official debut on April 2, 2019, scheduled to go sale in the third quarter of 2019 as a 2020 model. It will be built at the [[Louisville Assembly Plant]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. It will also serve as the next generation Ford Kuga for countries outside North America. In China, the fourth generation Escape has a slightly restyled front fascia compared to the North American version, and would be sold alongside the previous generation, which was sold as the Ford Kuga.&lt;ref name="twitter.com"&gt;https://twitter.com/Ford/status/1111221475527327744&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fordauthority.com/2019/04/this-is-the-all-new-2020-ford-escape/ “This is the All New 2020 Ford Escape”] from Ford Authority (April 2, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Details===
[[File:2020 Ford Escape SEL EcoBoost AWD, rear 11.22.19.jpg|thumb|Rear view]]
The fourth-generation Escape has a sleeker look and appears more aerodynamic; is slightly wider, longer, and lower, and is more than 200 pounds lighter due in part to greater use of high-strength steel. It also has sliding second-row seats for more legroom. There will be four new engine-transmission combinations including a plug-in gas-electric hybrid that can go 30 miles on electricity, as well as a conventional hybrid and two turbocharged engines mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission.  The gasoline refueling port and door also shifts from the right rear to the left rear of the vehicle.

The engine, a turbocharged 1.5-liter inline three-cylinder, makes 180 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. It is paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission with front-wheel drive or optional all-wheel drive. An available turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine makes 250 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque. The Escape Hybrid, returning after an extended absence, and all new Plug-in hybrid are powered by a 2.5-liter gasoline inline-four that runs on the more efficient Atkinson cycle, along with two electric motors and a planetary gearset that combines the two power sources and allows for gear-ratio changes, essentially operating as a continuously variable automatic transmission. The standard hybrid's battery pack is rated at 1.1 kilowatt-hours, while the plug-in hybrid's is significantly larger, at 14.4 kWh; both are lithium-ion packs that fit under the floor. Combined horsepower for the standard hybrid is 198 horsepower, while the plug-in sits at 209 combined horsepower. It will have S, SE, SE Sport, SEL, and Titanium trim levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a26996233/2020-ford-escape-photos-info/|title=The 2020 Ford Escape Looks to Fill a Car-Shaped Hole in the Lineup |last=Caparella|first=Joey|work=[[Car and Driver]]|date=April 2, 2019|accessdate=April 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a27006951/2020-ford-escape-hybrid-plug-in-photos-info/ |title=2020 Ford Escape Revives the Hybrid and Adds a Plug-In Variant |last=Caparella|first=Joey|work=[[Car and Driver]]|date=April 2, 2019|accessdate=April 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/ford-hopes-revamped-escape-can-recapture-lost-suv-buyers/2019/04/02/54f7c3ea-5556-11e9-aa83-504f086bf5d6_story.html?noredirect=on "Ford hopes revamped Escape can recapture lost SUV buyers"] From ''[[The Washington Post]]'' (April 2, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="twitter.com"/&gt;

The '''Ford Comuta''' was an experimental [[electric vehicle]] designed by [[Ford]] in the 1960s. The vehicle was powered by four 12-[[volt]] 85-Ah [[lead batteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Ford Tempo''' and its twin, the '''Mercury Topaz''', are [[compact car]]s that were produced by the [[Ford Motor Company]] for [[model year]]s 1984 to 1994. They were downsized successors to the boxy [[Ford Fairmont]] and [[Mercury Zephyr]] twins. The Tempo and Topaz were part of a rejuvenation plan by Ford to offer more environmentally friendly, fuel efficient, and more modern styled models to compete with the European and Japanese imports. While the car sold well, its innovation and aerodynamic design paved the way for the even more groundbreaking [[Ford Taurus (first generation)|Ford Taurus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=the Auto Editors of Consumer Guide |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/ford17.htm |title=Ford Tempo and Taurus |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=2007-06-11 |accessdate=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tempo and Topaz were replaced for 1995 by the [[Ford CDW27 platform|"world car" platform]] sold in North America as the [[Ford Contour|Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique]].

Although built on a different platform, the aerodynamic [[Ford Sierra]] was somewhat of a European counterpart to the Tempo. It replaced the boxy, rear-wheel-drive [[Ford Cortina]] while the Tempo did the same for the Fairmont in North America. The Sierra too was succeeded by Ford's world car platform in the form of the [[Ford Mondeo (first generation)|Ford Mondeo]].

==Development==
The design and life of the Tempo began in the late 1970s as Ford was gearing to build towards a more ergonomic, more efficient, and more aerodynamic design philosophy. The new design philosophy rested in part due to the aging [[Ford Pinto]] and [[Ford Maverick (Americas)|Ford Maverick]], and two oil embargoes which led to a rise in more fuel-efficient import vehicle sales. Taking note of this, Ford set out to revolutionize the automotive industry, and would later lay the groundwork for three revolutionary vehicles: The 1983 [[Ford Thunderbird (ninth generation)|Thunderbird]] (and its [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] counterpart, the [[Mercury Cougar|Cougar]]), the 1984 Tempo (and its Mercury counterpart, the Topaz), and the yet-to be released [[Ford Taurus (first generation)|Taurus]] (and its Mercury counterpart, the [[Mercury Sable|Sable]]). The Tempo and Topaz would be based on a stretched version of the front-wheel-drive platform used on the [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]], but with a radical new body. Being based on the Escort meant the Tempo and Topaz, unlike its Fairmont and Zephyr predecessors, were [[front-wheel drive]]. By making them front-wheel drive, interior space was much larger than if they had been [[rear-wheel-drive]]. The transaxle designs also borrowed heavily from the Ford Escort. However, there were few common components due to the Tempo and Topaz's larger size.

In December 1978, wind tunnel testing began on the Tempo, with more than 450 hours of testing resulting in more than 950 different design changes. As part of these changes, the Tempo and Topaz both featured a 60° windshield, matching that of the new Thunderbird and Cougar. Also new were the aircraft-inspired door frames, which originally appeared on the Thunderbird/Cougar. These door frames wrapped up over the edge of the roof which improved sealing, allowed for hidden drip rails, and cleaned up the A-pillar area of the car significantly. The rear track was also widened, creating more aerodynamic efficiency. The front grille was laid back more and the leading edge of the hood was tuned for aerodynamic cleanliness. Wheels were pushed out to the edges of the body, decreasing areas where air turbulence would be created. The rear of the cars were treated to just as many changes. The rear window was laid down at 60 degrees as well, and the trunk lid was raised higher than the side windows. This allowed the air to flow off the car more smoothly, and allowed for greater fuel efficiency. From the side view, this raised trunk created a wedge look to the car which was especially prominent on the two-door coupe versions.

All of these changes created a coefficient of drag (Cd) of 0.36 for the 2-door car (0.37 for the 4-door), which was equal to the Cd of the new "Aero" [[Ford Thunderbird (ninth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]]. The final design of the cars was reached so that the car looked good on every trim level, not just the top-of-the-line as some of the competition had done. When the Tempo was released in 1983 as a 1984 model, it became an instant hit, with more than 107,000 two-door models and more than 295,000 four-door models being sold in the first year alone. Initial advertising featured a Tempo sedan performing a loop on a stunt track. The commercials touted the Tempo as being "America's all new aerodynamic sedan" and listed features such as "the world's most advanced automotive computer", called [[Ford EEC#EEC-IV|EEC-IV]], that claimed to have the ability to monitor up to seven vital engine functions, and noted the interior to be roomier in the rear seat than a [[Mercedes-Benz W123|Mercedes-Benz 300D]]. Other ads featured the slogan "Pick up the Tempo of your life!"

[[File:Ford Tempo rear (14919514953).jpg|thumb|left|Rear view]]
The first generation Tempo and Topaz were released in 1983&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dole|first1=Charles|title=Ford goes on the offensive - with Tempo and Topaz|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1983/0603/060331.html|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=6 March 2018|date=3 June 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; as 1984 models, and equaled the length of a [[Chevrolet Cavalier]] at the time, to which it was a response.  The Ford Fairmont, which was last produced in 1983, was more directly replaced by the [[Ford LTD (Americas)#Fox-platform .281983-1986.29|Ford LTD]], which was introduced for the 1983 model year.

Despite the Fairmont (at 105.5-inch wheelbase and 193.8-inch length) being sized relatively larger than [[General Motors]]' [[front-wheel drive]] [[Chevrolet Celebrity]] [[mid-size car]] (at 104.8-inch wheelbase and 188.3-inch length) and having a similar length to the Fairmont's predecessor, the [[Ford Maverick (Americas)|Maverick]] (at 109.9-inch wheelbase and 193.9-inch length), the Tempo had been intended as the [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] and [[Coupé|coupe]] versions of the [[Ford Escort (North America)|Ford Escort]], and both vehicles were in similar classes, similar to how [[Volkswagen]]'s sedan and coupe answer to the [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]] hatchbacks would be the [[Volkswagen Jetta|Jetta]].

[[File:1987 Mercury Topaz Sedan.jpg|thumb|left|200px|1987 Mercury Topaz sedan]]

The Tempo was Ford's first [[compact car]] downsizing, just four years after GM downsized its compact cars in 1979 for the 1980 model years; two and a half years after Chrysler's compact K-cars were introduced. The front [[windshield]] and rear window were both set at 60° angles, with the trunk of the car being placed higher than the side windows to allow for greater fuel efficiency and air flow. The four-door Tempo used rear quarter windows in the C-pillars while the four-door Topaz received a more formal C-pillar arrangement without rear quarter windows. The front of the car featured a set of two sealed-beam halogen headlamps recessed in chrome "buckets" and the grille in between the headlights featured four horizontally thin rails each swept back to allow for greater air flow into the engine compartment and over the hood. The Tempo shared much of its design language with the European [[Ford Sierra]], launched a year earlier.

The first generation Tempo came standard with a new 2.3&amp;nbsp;L [[Ford HSC engine|HSC]] inline four-cylinder gasoline engine with a one-barrel carburetor, with an optional Mazda-built [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] diesel engine. Mated to either of these engines were the choice of a standard four-speed [[Ford IB transmission|IB4]] or optional five-speed [[Ford MTX transmission#MTX-III|MTX-III]] [[manual transmission]] (which was the standard, and only option for the diesel engine variant), or the optional three-speed [[Ford ATX transmission|FLC]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] with a floor-mounted shift lever.  In late 1985, the five-speed manual became standard and the four-speed was discontinued. In addition, a slight modification was made to the five-speed transmission, moving the "reverse" position on the gear shift knob from right beside first gear to the opposite bottom corner. This was done to decrease the possibility of mistakenly shifting into reverse rather than first gear during takeoff. The instrument panel featured a new, easier to read gauge layout, with all switches and controls placed within easy reach of the driver. In early 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/10/05/Ford-offering-airbags-to-fleet-buyers/3065846903749/|title=Ford offering airbags to fleet buyers|website=UPI|accessdate=10 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Tempo became the first production American automobile to feature a driver's side airbag as a supplemental restraint system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/newsroom/release_display.cfm?release=14062 |title=Today in Ford History: Jan. 7 |work=Media.Ford.com |date=2007-01-07 |accessdate=2007-03-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040917172037/http://media.ford.com/newsroom/release_display.cfm?release=14062 |archivedate=September 17, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Ford entered a contract with the [[General Services Administration]] and the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] to supply 5,000 airbag-equipped Tempos. Half also received a special windshield designed to minimize lacerations to passengers, and all were early recipients of the [[Automotive lighting#Stop lamp|high-mounted brake lights]] that became required by law in 1986.&lt;ref name=whp27&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Wheels (magazine)|Wheels]] | ref = Wh0684 | title = Fords get an air-bagging | first = Ron | last = Wakefield | page = 27 | date = June 1984 | publisher = Murray Publishers | location = Sydney, Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ford Tempo 2 -- 10-31-2009.jpg|thumb|left|1986–1987 Ford Tempo sedan]]

In October 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1986/876530/ford_tempo_lx_4-door_2_3l_efi.html|title=Detailed specs review of 1986 Ford Tempo LX 4-door 2.3L EFi offered since October 1985 for North America U.S.|website=www.automobile-catalog.com|accessdate=10 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Tempo and the Topaz saw numerous moderate design changes for 1986 which coincided with the release of the then-new and revolutionary 1986 [[First-generation Ford Taurus|Taurus]]. While generally considered the same car, the front and rear end styling was where the changes were most evident. The standard rectangular sealed-beam halogen headlamps were replaced with new, plastic composite designs which only required replacing the bulb itself. These new headlights were flush-mounted to match the redesigned front corner lights and a freshly restyled grille, which also closely matched that of the Taurus (the Topaz received a pseudo-lightbar grille styled after the [[Mercury Sable|Sable]]). For the rear end, the trunk and taillights were slightly restyled, giving the car a sharper look. Replacing the carburetor on the 2.3&amp;nbsp;L four-cylinder engine was a new [[Fuel injection#Throttle body injection|Central Fuel Injection]] (CFI) system (the carbureted version was still available in Canada until 1987). New was an optional "LX" luxury trim, replacing the GLX. Other changes and improvements included the addition of automatically retracting front seat belt shoulder straps, and the addition of a new all-wheel-drive model. The Tempo AWD included special badging, interior badges. Other available features included power lumbar support, four-way power driver's seat and a cassette player.

From 1985 to 1987, there was also the Sport GL, which included unique interior and exterior styling cues, an HSO (High Specific Output) version of the 2.3 L HSC engine (slightly more power), alloy wheels, tachometer, and a quicker gear ratio for the 5-speed manual transaxle (3.73 final drive). It was badged simply as "GL", however the Sport GL was more easily recognizable because it lacked the GL's chrome front and rear bumpers. For 1987, the Topaz received a standard all-wheel drive system for the GS-AWD and LS-AWD trim levels. This all-wheel drive system (developed exclusively for the Tempo and Topaz) was available for model years 1987 to 1991.

Trim levels for the first generation Tempo are as follows:
* L   (entry level model)
* GL  (mid-level and by far the best-selling model{{cn|date=March 2018}})
* LX  (introduced for 1986 as the luxury model, replacing the GLX)
* GLX (1984 and 1985 model year only)
* AWD (1987 model year only, the only MY all-wheel drive was available for the coupe)

Trim levels for the first generation Topaz are as follows:

* L (stripped down base model available for the 1984 model year)
* GS (Topaz equivalent of the Tempo GL, mid-range model)
* GS-AWD (Topaz GS with all-wheel drive as standard, 1987 model year only)
* LS (luxury/high end trim level)
* LS-AWD (Topaz LS with all-wheel drive as standard, 1987 model year only)
* XR5 (sport performance model available for 1987 model year only; all XR5s were coupes)

The Tempo and Topaz sedans received a major redesign for 1988, whereas the coupes were instead facelifted, all arriving in November 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u8wDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=mercury+topaz+1988+%22november+1987%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eBfV_ZgfWO&amp;sig=ACfU3U0j0eNo7HDcvpNNsBB7GeSefcwkDw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi9t7eGvcTgAhXvpYMKHUA7AbEQ6AEwD3oECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=mercury+topaz+1988+%22november+1987%22&amp;f=false|title=Ebony|first=Johnson Publishing|last=Company|date=1 November 1987|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|accessdate=10 June 2019|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1988/1890080/mercury_topaz_lts.html|title=Detailed specs review of 1988 Mercury Topaz LS Sport offered since November 1987 for North America U.S.|website=www.automobile-catalog.com|accessdate=10 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The changes gave the Tempo and Topaz an even more similar look to the Taurus and Sable, respectively. On the front end of the Tempo, a completely restyled grille featured three thin horizontal chrome bars with a Ford oval in the center, with two composite flush-mounted rectangular headlamps with restyled front turn signal housings on either side. On the Tempo GLS, this chrome grille was blacked out, and they received a blacked-out "D" pillar. For the rear, the taillights received a major rework and were now completely flush-mounted. A restyled rear quarter window was designed to match and blend evenly with the completely restyled rear door trim. The Topaz was differentiated from the Tempo by a more formal rear window, a waterfall grille, more upscale wheels, and solid red tail-lights.

[[File:Ford Tempo Coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1988–1991 Ford Tempo coupe]]

The interior of both the sedan and coupe models saw a brand new instrument panel design, with a central gauge cluster (now with a standard engine temp gauge), and more ergonomic driver controls. Fan and windshield wiper controls were now mounted on rotary-style switches on either side of the instrument panel, and the HVAC controls received a new push-button control layout. Other changes included reworked interior door panels. A driver's side airbag continued as an option, a rarity then for an economy level car. On Tempo LX and AWD, the interior received chrome and wood trim on the dashboard and doors. Topaz models featured the tachometer-equipped gauge cluster and a front center armrest standard.[[File:92-94 Mercury Topaz GS.jpg|200px|thumb|left|1992–1994 Mercury Topaz GS sedan]]

The 1991 model year (the last year of the 1988 restyled look) saw the discontinuation of the all-wheel drive Tempo and Topaz, as well as the now Canadian market exclusive entry-level Tempo L. For 1992, the Tempo and Topaz saw a minor restyle; the Tempo gained body-colored side trim (replacing the black and chrome trim) as well as full body-colored bumpers. The three bar chrome grille on the Tempo was also replaced with a new, body-colored monochromatic grille, while the Topaz's chrome grille was replaced with a new non-functional light-bar.

[[File:Ford-Tempo-Coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1992–1994 Ford Tempo coupe]]

Also for 1992, the 3.0 L ''[[Ford Vulcan engine|Vulcan]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] engine, borrowed from the Taurus and Sable, was introduced as an option for the GL and LX models, and was the standard engine on the GLS. The 1992 model year would be the last year of the GLS, as it was discontinued (along with its Topaz counterpart) in 1993. This left the Tempo with only two trim level options, GL and LX. 1992 also brought about a slightly redesigned gauge cluster, with tachometers now reading up to 7,000 RPM instead of the previous 6,000 RPM. Also, a fuel door indicator was added to the fuel gauge (an arrow pointing to the side of the car where the fuel door was located). 1992 was the only year for American models to have an available 120 MPH speedometer (GLS, XR5 and LTS models only); all other model years read to 85 MPH. 1994 was the last model year for the Ford Tempo (and Mercury Topaz), with production halting in the first quarter of 1994.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Trim levels for the second generation Ford Tempo are as follows:

*L (entry level model, discontinued in 1991)
*GL (mid-level model)
*AWD (although advertised by Ford as a separate trim level, the AWD model was actually built on an LX body, as evidenced by the body code. Discontinued in 1991)
*LX (luxury model, only available as a four-door sedan)
*GLS (replaced Sport GL as the performance oriented model, discontinued in 1992)

Trim levels for the second generation Mercury Topaz are as follows:

* GS (Topaz equivalent of the Tempo GL, mid-range model, available between November 1987 and 1994)
* GS-AWD (Topaz GS with all-wheel Drive as standard, available between November 1987 and 1991)
* LS (luxury/high end trim level, discontinued after 1992)
* LS-AWD (Topaz LS with all-wheel drive as standard, available between November 1987 and 1991)
* XR5 (sport performance model available from November 1987 to 1992, only available as a coupe; came with the 3.0 L V6 engine as standard for 1992)
* LTS (four-door variation of the XR5, 'LTS' stood for Luxury Touring Sedan, available from November 1987 to 1992)

==End of production==
In 1994, Ford introduced the [[Ford Mondeo (first generation)#Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique|Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique]] as replacements for the Tempo and Topaz, sharing corporate resources of [[Ford of Europe]]. While highly innovative in its early years, and even though it was a strong seller for nearly its entire lifetime, by the early 1990s the Tempo and the Topaz were seen as an aging platform. They also lacked an automatic transmission with overdrive when compared to newer 4-speed automatics. It was also to be the last year for the 2.3 L ''HSC'' engine, which was built by Ford specifically for the Tempo and Topaz. Also, it was to be the last year for the 3-speed FLC automatic transmission; although it was slightly redesigned, given overdrive, and was used on the Ford Escort and Mercury Tracer. With all of these factors, Ford stopped production of the Tempo on March 25, 1994, when the last one rolled off the Claycomo, Missouri assembly line. It was succeeded by the Ford Contour, a derivative of the European [[Ford Mondeo]]. It came with a jump in price: the most expensive 1994 Tempo (a loaded LX sedan with a V6) was about US$12,900 ($20,784 in 2016 dollars), while a base model 1995 Contour (GL with four-cylinder engine and manual transmission) was $13,990 ($22,540 in 2016 dollars). The last Ford Tempo and Topaz rolled off the Oakville, Ontario, Canada assembly line on May 20, 1994.

The new-for-1995 [[Ford Windstar]] was then built at the [[Ontario]] plant that formerly built the Tempo and Topaz, while Kansas City turned over to Ford Contour/Mercury Mystique production (shared with a plant in [[Hermosillo, Mexico]]). Today, the [[Ford Fusion (Americas)| Ford Fusion]] occupies the same market niche that the Tempo and Topaz once did.

==Production figures==
The Ford Tempo was a massive sales success for Ford. It was one of the top ten best selling cars in the US, usually in the top five, during its entire production. Through 1984, Ford sold a total of 531,468 examples of the Tempo and Topaz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tempotopaz.com/main/index.php?name=Sections&amp;req=viewarticle&amp;artid=18&amp;page=1 |title=1984 – Tempo-Topaz Introduction |work=Tempo Topaz Car Club of North America |accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; nearly 100,000 more units than the best-selling [[Toyota Camry]] of today.

The North American version of the '''Ford Granada''' is a range of sedans that was manufactured and marketed by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]].  Introduced for the 1975 model year as the intended successor as the [[Ford Maverick (Americas)|Ford Maverick]], the Granada was sold through the 1982 model year across two generations.  Sharing its name with the [[Ford Granada (Europe)|flagship sedan of Ford of Europe]], the Granada was slotted above the Maverick (and the [[Ford Fairmont|Fairmont]] that replaced it) as a [[Compact executive car|luxury compact vehicle]], expanding the segment in the United States.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Dammann, George ''90 Years of Ford" (Osceola, WI: Crestline Series b MBI Publishing Company, 1993), p.474.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The first generation of the Granada was a [[Compact car|compact]] sedan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolnversailles.com/Granada/MT0974_03.htm|title=Motor Trend - Sep 1974|accessdate=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;, marketed alongside the Mercury Monarch and Lincoln Versailles.  Introduced for 1981, the second generation of the Granada became a mid-size sedan, marketed alongside the Mercury Cougar.  For the 1983 model year, the Granada underwent a mid-cycle revision, taking on the Ford LTD nameplate; the model line was ultimately replaced by the [[Ford Taurus (first generation)|Ford Taurus]] for 1986.

In total, over two million examples of the Ford Granada were produced for the U.S. market.&lt;ref name="gmvprod"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmv-registry.com/21869.html|title=Production &amp; Registry Totals|work=The Granada-Monarch-Versailles Registry|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530224826/http://www.gmv-registry.com/21869.html|archivedate=2009-05-30|url-status=dead|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first generation was produced by [[Mahwah Assembly]] and [[Michigan Assembly Plant|Michigan Assembly]] with the second generation produced by [[Atlanta Assembly]] and [[Chicago Assembly]].

== Background ==
While originally intended to replace the Ford Maverick, design work for the Ford Granada predated the 1973 fuel crisis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dammann, George ''90 Years of Ford" (Osceola, WI: Crestline Series b MBI Publishing Company, 1993), p.468.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lincolnversailles.com/Granada/RT_FG2.htm|title=1975 Ford Granada and Mercury Monarch|website=www.lincolnversailles.com|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969, Ford began research predicting the emergence of the luxury compact segment, driven by gasoline prices, multiple-vehicle families, and urban traffic.  In 1970, Ford began design work on a prototype vehicle, later becoming the production Granada.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In what would later become a central theme of the marketing of the Granada, Ford benchmarked the [[Mercedes-Benz W114|Mercedes-Benz 280 (W114)]], using it as a basis for styling and dimensions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  As an alternative, Ford considered importing [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Ford Granada]] produced by Ford of Europe; it was rejected as cost-prohibitive.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lincolnversailles.com/Granada/RT_FG3.htm|title=1975 Ford Granada and Mercury Monarch|website=www.lincolnversailles.com|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

To expand its sales potential of fuel-efficient automobiles, the Ford Granada was redeveloped before its launch, becoming an additional compact model line.  While not intended as a direct competitor for European luxury sedans (such as Mercedes-Benz or BMW), Ford intended for the Granada to be sold to buyers either downsizing from a larger intermediate or full-size car while wanting to retain the same comfort and convenience features along with buyers seeking to upgrade from a lower-content compact car.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lincolnversailles.com/Granada/RT_FG6.htm|title=1975 Ford Granada and Mercury Monarch|website=www.lincolnversailles.com|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{Infobox automobile

== First generation (1975–1980) ==
The first generation of the Granada was introduced for the 1975 model year, slotted between the Maverick and the Torino within the Ford product line.  Originally intended as the successor for the Maverick, the development of the Granada was heavily influenced by the [[1973 oil crisis]].  In response to increased demand for compact-segment automobiles, Ford continued the production of Maverick (through the 1977 model year); the Granada was repackaged as a premium vehicle in its segment.     

In its most basic form, the Ford Granada offered few standard features over the Maverick (including manual steering, non-power brakes, and a column-shifted manual transmission).  To allow for a high degree of owner customization, the option list for the Granada was long, adding many features traditionally included on the Ford Gran Torino and Ford LTD.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Chassis ===
The Ford Granada derives its rear-wheel drive chassis from the 1960–1965 Ford Falcon (effectively giving the model line mechanical commonality with the first-generation Ford Mustang and Mercury Cougar). Retaining the use of [[Unit body construction|unibody construction]], the Granada was equipped with coil-spring front suspension; it was equipped with a leaf-sprung live rear axle (in contrast to larger Ford sedans).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lincolnversailles.com/Granada/RT_FG4.htm|title=1975 Ford Granada and Mercury Monarch|website=www.lincolnversailles.com|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both versions of the Ford Granada have a 109.9 inch wheelbase, derived from the four-door Ford Maverick.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  While the Granada was largely a clean-sheet design, the forward part of the floorpan of the Maverick was adopted into the unibody structure, along with elements of the steering gear and suspension.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The standard brakes for the Ford Granada were front disc (11-inch rotors) and rear drums (10-inch).  Four-wheel disc brakes were offered as an option, offered with an optional anti-lock system (marketed as "anti-skid" brakes), powered by a central hydraulic system.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The Ford Granada was equipped with a 200 cubic-inch inline-six engine as standard, with a 250 cubic-inch inline-six as an optional engine.  Shared with the Maverick, the 302 Windsor V8 was offered as an option; the 351 Windsor V8 was an option solely for the Granada.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lincolnversailles.com/Granada/RT_FG5.htm|title=1975 Ford Granada and Mercury Monarch|website=www.lincolnversailles.com|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A three-speed manual (column-shifted or floor shifted) was standard, with a three-speed automatic offered as an option (standard on the 351 V8); a four-speed manual was introduced in 1976.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Body ===
The first-generation Ford Granada was offered as a four-door sedan and two-door coupe.  In a major shift away from the [[Coke bottle styling|Coke-bottle styling]] of the Ford Maverick, the Granada adopted a combination of both U.S. and European design elements.  The roofline of the four-door sedan was heavily influenced by Mercedes-Benz, along with the proportion of the taillamps and grille.  The two-door was given a separate roofline; the trapezoidal door window with an [[opera window]] in the B/C-pillar was a design feature later used in the Ford Thunderbird, Ford Fairmont Futura coupe, Ford LTD 2-door, Ford LTD II and all of their Mercury badged counterparts.

While designed independently from the U.S. Ford Granada, the European Ford Granada Mark II (produced from 1977 to 1982) would adopt similar design features as its four-door U.S. counterpart, including the roofline and rear fascia. For 1978, the exterior of the Ford Granada underwent a mid-cycle revision, concentrating on the front fascia. In addition to a revised grille design, the round headlamps were replaced by rectangular units stacked above the turn signal lenses (to more closely match the design of the Ford LTD II and the Mercedes-Benz W114).  The rear fascia was given revised taillamp lenses and revised center panel trim if optionally equipped. In the interest of aerodynamics, the sideview mirrors were changed from rectangular to oval.

=== Trim ===
In addition to the unnamed base-trim level produced during model years 1975 to 1980, Ford offered the first-generation Ford Granada in three additional trim levels during its production.  In a break from Ford nomenclature, two Ford Granada trim levels shared names with their Mercury Monarch equivalent.

During model years 1976 to 1977, the Granada was sold in a ''Sports Coupe'' trim (the Monarch equivalent was the Monarch S).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://gmv-registry.com/generic481.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-01-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928204453/http://gmv-registry.com/generic481.html |archive-date=2007-09-28 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://gmv-registry.com/generic488.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-01-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928204441/http://gmv-registry.com/generic488.html |archive-date=2007-09-28 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to cosmetic upgrades (styled steel wheels, exterior striping, bucket seats, and interior trim) the Sports Coupe was given heavy-duty suspension and larger front brakes.&lt;ref&gt;''Street Rodder'', 1/85, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1977½ variation on the Granada Sports Coupe, produced from May 1977 through the end of the model year, featured blacked-out molding, modified trim, taillights, and color selections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://gmv-registry.com/generic489.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-01-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928204400/http://gmv-registry.com/generic489.html |archive-date=2007-09-28 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a replacement for the Sports Coupe, Ford introduced the ''Ford Granada ESS'', produced from 1978 to 1980 (Mercury also sold a Monarch ESS).  Distinguished by its blacked-out exterior trim, the Granada/Monarch ESS featured bucket seats with a floor-mounted shifter as standard equipment (though a bench seat was optional).  The ESS option included standard color-keyed wheelcovers (styled-steel wheels were optional) and unique opera-window louvres for coupes.  As part of the marketing for the ESS trim line, Ford visually compared the Granada to the [[Mercedes-Benz W123]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bionic Disco|title='78 Ford Granada 'Mercedes Comparison' Commercial (1977)|date=2016-04-30|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzIVJlOPwxQ|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jalopnik.com/362733/can-you-tell-the-1978-granada-from-a-20000-mercedes-280se|title=Can You Tell The 1978 Granada From a $20,000 Mercedes 280SE?|last=Martin|first=Murilee|work=Jalopnik|access-date=2018-07-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top trim level of the Granada was the ''Granada Ghia'' (shared with both its European counterpart and the Mercury Monarch).  Externally distinguished by a vinyl roof,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the Ghia features an upgraded interior; with either cloth or leather seats offered as options, along with a wood-trimmed dashboard.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Ford did not offer its own equivalent of the 1975 to 1976 Mercury Grand Monarch Ghia;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://gmv-registry.com/generic483.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-01-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928204447/http://gmv-registry.com/generic483.html |archive-date=2007-09-28 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; the trim line was repackaged as the [[Lincoln Versailles]] for 1977.

For the 1981 model year, the second-generation Granada was introduced,&lt;ref name="RT82"&gt;{{cite journal|editor-last=Hogg|editor-first=Tony|title=1981 Buyer's Guide|journal=Road &amp; Track's Road Test Annual &amp; Buyer's Guide 1981|issue=January–February 1981|page=98|ref=81bg}}&lt;/ref&gt; slotted between the Ford Fairmont and the Ford LTD in the Ford product line.  To modernize the chassis underpinnings of the product line, the Granada returned as a compact/mid-size product line, derived from the Ford Fairmont.

While far less extensive than the downsizing applied to the 1979 full-size Ford LTD, the footprint of the Granada would decrease in size itself, as it shed approximately an inch in length, four inches in width and wheelbase, and approximately 300 pounds of curb weight (depending on powertrain).

For the 1983 model year, as part of a major realignment of the Ford and Mercury product lines, the Granada nameplate was withdrawn.  As part of a mid-cycle revision, the model line effectively continued as the [[Ford LTD (Americas)#Fourth generation (1983–1986)|Ford LTD]], with the full-size product line becoming the [[Ford LTD Crown Victoria|LTD Crown Victoria]].  Following the 1986 model year, the mid-size Ford LTD was replaced by the [[Ford Taurus (first generation)|Ford Taurus]].

=== Chassis ===
The second-generation Ford Granada is based on the rear-wheel drive [[Ford Fox platform]], sharing its wheelbase with the Ford Fairmont and Mercury Zephyr.

In the shift from the Ford Falcon chassis (dating from 1960) to the Fox chassis, the suspension and steering systems were modernized.  In line with all Fox-platform vehicles, the second-generation Granada used [[MacPherson strut]] front suspension (replacing short/long-arm suspension), with a coil-sprung live rear axle (replacing leaf springs).  A rack-and-pinion steering system was introduced, replacing the previous recirculating-ball system.  While the four-wheel disc brake and anti-lock brake systems were discontinued, the Granada gained power brakes as standard equipment.

The second-generation Ford Granada adopted several engines from the Ford Fairmont, sharing a 2.3&amp;nbsp;L [[Ford Pinto engine#2.3 OHC|Lima]] inline-4 as a standard engine and a 3.3L inline-six (the Ford 200 six, under metric displacement) as an option.  For 1982, the inline-six was replaced by a 3.8&amp;nbsp;L [[Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)|Ford Essex V6]].  Downsized to 4.2 L, the Windsor V8 shifted from the Fairmont to the Granada.  While an automatic transmission was standard for all engines, the 2.3L engine was available with a 4-speed manual transmission.&lt;ref name="RT82" /&gt;

=== Body ===
The second-generation Ford Granada was offered in three body styles.  For 1981, the Granada was introduced as a four-door sedan and a two-door sedan (replacing the previous coupe).  For 1982, a five-door station wagon was introduced (transferring the body style from the Fairmont line).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of American Cars}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a break from the previous generation (a stand-alone model line), the second-generation shared many visible design elements with the Ford Fairmont (including the doors).  To differentiate the Granada from the Fairmont, Ford restyled the roofline (adding a formal notchback configuration on both two-door and four-door versions) and styled the front and rear fascias in line with larger Ford vehicles. &lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Trim ===
The second-generation Ford Granada was offered in three trim levels,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tocmp.com/brochures/Ford/1981/Granada/pages/Granada03_jpg.htm|title=Car Brochures - 1981 Ford Granada / Granada03.jpg|website=www.tocmp.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in line with other Ford vehicles of the 1980s (including the Ford Escort and the later Ford Tempo and Ford Taurus).   The base trim was the Granada L, with the mid-level Granada GL.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tocmp.com/brochures/Ford/1981/Granada/pages/Granada12_jpg.htm|title=Car Brochures - 1981 Ford Granada / Granada12.jpg|website=www.tocmp.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Effectively replacing both the Granada ESS and Ghia, the Granada GLX was the top trim level.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

===Blue oval return===

As a minor historical note the 1982 Ford Granada was among the first U.S. Ford vehicles to mark the return of the Ford blue oval exterior emblem. Although stamped on door threshold trim on Ford-division (and [[Lincoln Mark series|Continental Mark series]]) cars for many years, the blue oval had been absent on vehicle exteriors in North America since the 1930s. The blue oval had remained in wide use as the company corporate logo in sales literature, advertisements, owners manuals and on dealership signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://autouniversum.wordpress.com/2010/11/15/automotive-logos-ii-fords-mid-century-indulgence-of-iconography/|title=Automotive Logos: Ford's Mid-century Indulgence of Iconography|last=|first=|date=|access-date=22 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1976, the blue oval emblem saw a return on cars and trucks produced by [[Ford of Europe]] and [[Ford Australia|Ford of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ford.ie/experience-ford/history-and-heritage#trademark|title=Ford History and Heritage – The Ford Trademark|access-date=23 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 1983, only the Ford Fairmont (in its final model year) and [[Ford Thunderbird (ninth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]] (produced with its own exterior emblems) were left without the blue oval emblem in North America.

== Variants ==
During its 1975-1982 production, the North American Ford Granada was also marketed by the Lincoln-Mercury, with the division selling three counterparts of the model line.  The first generation was sold as the [[Mercury Monarch]] and [[Lincoln Versailles]]; the second generation by Mercury as the [[Mercury Cougar#Fifth generation (1980–1982)|Mercury Cougar]] (replacing the Monarch).

[[File:1979 Lincoln Versailles (37175844975).jpg|thumb|1979 Lincoln Versailles]]

=== Mercury Monarch (1975–1980) ===
Introduced alongside the Ford Granada in 1975, the Mercury Monarch was slotted above the mechanically-similar Mercury Comet.  Nearly externally identical to the Granada, the Monarch received its own grille, fascia trim, and interior trim.  The trim nomenclature was common between both lines, with both offered in top-level Ghia trim.

As a Mercury-exclusive model, the Grand Monarch Ghia was marketed as a junior version of the (far larger) Mercury Grand Marquis, including virtually every available feature as standard equipment.  For 1977, the Grand Monarch Ghia was repackaged as a Lincoln, becoming the Lincoln Versailles.  

=== Mercury Cougar (1981–1982) ===
For 1980, the Mercury Cougar was downsized from the intermediate Torino chassis to the mid-size Fox chassis; the model line was pared down solely to the Cougar XR7 coupe.  The redesign was poorly received in the marketplace, as sales of the 1980 Cougar collapsed (falling nearly 65%).  In response, as with the previous generation, Mercury expanded the Cougar to a full model range, as the Cougar replaced the Monarch for 1981.  In addition to the XR7 coupe, the 1981 model line added two-door and four-door notchback sedans derived from the Granada.  For 1982, the Cougar adopted a five-door station wagon (from the Zephyr model line).  

While distinguished from the Cougar XR7/Thunderbird by its shorter wheelbase, the Cougar sedan/wagon differed little from its Ford counterpart.  As with the Granada, the Cougar was fitted with a formal notchback roofline to differ the model line from the Fairmont/Zephyr; as with the Monarch, it was styled with its own grille, taillamps, and badging.    

In a first for Mercury, the 1980-1982 Cougar was the first model line to use the GS/LS trim nomenclature, used through the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s.    

For 1983, the Cougar was split into two model lines.  The Cougar XR7 underwent a complete redesign of the exterior, retaining the Cougar nameplate.  The Cougar sedan/wagon underwent a less extensive mid-cycle revision, adopting the Mercury Marquis name (which shifted to the mid-size segment); the Marquis was ultimately replaced by the [[Mercury Sable]] for 1986.

=== Lincoln Versailles (1977–1980) ===
For 1977, Lincoln-Mercury repackaged the Mercury Grand Monarch Ghia (a personal car of Henry Ford II) as the [[Lincoln Versailles]].  The first Lincoln in 17 years not to use the Continental nameplate, the Versailles was developed in response to the [[Cadillac Seville]] compact/mid-size luxury sedan.  In line with its Cadillac counterpart, while the smallest Lincoln ever produced at the time, the Versailles was the highest-price vehicle sold by the division, undergoing a strict quality-control regimen during assembly and including nearly all available features as standard equipment.  In a first for the American automobile industry, the Lincoln Versailles was assembled with clearcoat paint and halogen headlamps.        

Alongside the later [[Cadillac Cimarron]], the Lincoln Versailles is viewed among the most controversial examples of [[Rebadging|badge engineering]] in the automotive industry.  While sold in the same Lincoln-Mercury showroom as the Mercury Monarch, the Versailles was priced nearly as high its Mercury counterpart; with the exception of its headlights and Continental-tire trunklid, the Versailles was nearly indistinguishable from the Monarch (itself, nearly identical to a Granada).    

Selling far under sales projections, the Versailles was withdrawn early in the 1980 model year.

The '''[[Ford Ranger]] sold in the Americas''' is a range of [[Pickup truck|pickup trucks]] manufactured and marketed by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in North and South America.  Introduced in early 1982 for the 1983 model year, the Ranger is currently in its fourth generation.  Developed as a replacement for the Mazda-sourced [[Ford Courier]], the model line has been sold across the Americas; [[Ford Motor Argentina|Ford of Argentina]] began production of the Ranger for South America in 1998.  Through its production, the model line has served as a close rival to the [[Chevrolet S-10]] and its [[Chevrolet Colorado]] successor (and their GMC counterparts), with the Ranger as the best-selling compact truck in the United States from 1987 to 2004.&lt;ref name="American Ford Ranger"&gt;[http://www.carautoportal.com/ford/ford-ranger.php Ford Ranger] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524113338/http://www.carautoportal.com/ford/ford-ranger.php|date=May 24, 2011}} – Accessed March 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;    

From 2012 to 2018, Ford retired the Ranger model line in North America, concentrating on its full-size F-Series trucks.  For the 2019 model year, Ford introduced a fourth generation of the Ranger (after a seven-year hiatus).  The first mid-size Ranger in North America, the fourth-generation Ranger is derived from the global Ranger T6 (to fulfill North American design requirements).  

During the production of the first three generations, the Ranger was produced at [[Louisville Assembly Plant|Louisville Assembly]] ([[Louisville, Kentucky]]), [[Edison Assembly]] ([[Edison, New Jersey]]), and [[Twin Cities Assembly Plant]] ([[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]); the final 2012 Ranger was also the final vehicle produced at the facility.  The current fourth-generation Ranger is manufactured by Ford at [[Wayne Stamping &amp; Assembly]] ([[Wayne, Michigan]]).  Ford of Argentina has produced Rangers in its [[General Pacheco]] facility since 1998; since 2012, the facility has produced the global Ranger T6.

== Development ==
=== Ford Courier (1972–1982) ===
{{Main|Ford Courier}}
[[File:1975 Ford Courier, right side view.jpg|left|thumb|1975 Ford Courier]]
For the 1972 model year, the Ford Courier was introduced as the first compact pickup truck sold by Ford.  Following the rise of the compact truck segment during the 1960s, Ford entered into a partnership with Mazda to market the [[Mazda B-Series#Ford Courier|Mazda B1800]] in North America; the Courier would become the first of several jointly manufactured vehicles between the two companies from the 1970s into the 2000s.  Along with minimizing the risk for Ford of developing a vehicle in an unfamiliar market segment, the partnership provided Mazda with critically needed funds.&lt;ref name="WC85y"&gt;{{Citation|last=Yamaguchi|first=Jack K.|title=Japan: Lucrative Contraction|journal=World Cars 1985|page=49|year=1985|editor-last=Lösch|editor-first=Annamaria|location=Pelham, NY|publisher=The Automobile Club of Italy/Herald Books|isbn=0-910714-17-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;        

While sharing the cab and chassis with its Mazda counterpart, to increase its sales potential in North America, the Courier adapted design elements of the [[Ford F-Series (fifth generation)|Ford F-Series]], with twin round headlamps, silver grille, and "FORD" lettering on the hood above the grille.  In 1977, the Courier and B1800 (later B2000) were redesigned with a larger cab, redesigned pickup bed, and tailgate.  While closer in appearance to its Mazda counterpart, the Courier was given signal/parking lamps inset in the grille (rather than the bumper); an optional 2.3L Ford engine was not available the Mazda pickups.            

From 1972 to 1982, the Ford Courier was manufactured alongside the Mazda B-Series in [[Hiroshima|Hiroshima, Japan]].  To avoid the 25% [[Chicken tax]] on imported trucks, both vehicles were imported as [[Chassis cab|cab-chassis trucks]] (taxed at 4% tariff).  Following their importation to United States, pickup-truck beds shipped separately from Japan were installed before shipment to dealers.      

=== Project Yuma (1976–1982) ===
In 1976, Ford commenced development on "Project Yuma" as a replacement for the Courier.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/ranger/2019/2019-ford-ranger-first-look-review/|title=2019 Ford Ranger First Look: Welcome Home|date=January 14, 2018|work=Motor Trend|access-date=January 20, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.motortrend.com/news/1983-ford-ranger-feature-flashback/|title=Feature Flashback: 1983 Ford Ranger - Motor Trend|date=July 24, 2017|work=Motor Trend|access-date=January 25, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Clark, Jim|date=December 1981|title=Development of the Ranger|url=http://www.therangerstation.com/resources/pdf_documents/ranger.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Mini-Truck|pages=26–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to designing the first domestically-produced compact truck, another key factor driving  the $700 million project was compliance with the fuel economy standards of the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;  At the launch of the project in 1976, Ford predicted that for the company to properly comply with 1985 [[CAFE]] standards, nearly 50% of pickup trucks sold in the United States would require a 4-cylinder engine.&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;  In 1976, compact trucks held a 5% share of pickup truck sales, with Ford predicting an expansion to 50% by 1985, equaling nearly a million sales per year.&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt; 

Project Yuma was centered around quality and fuel efficiency.&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;  At the beginning of the project, Ford researched additional elements that were valued by potential compact truck buyers.&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;  Along with flexibility for both work and personal use, Ford found that buyers desired additional interior room, including three-across seating, comfortable seats, and headroom and legroom for a six-foot tall driver; other minor details were discovered such as five-bolt wheels and a larger ashtray.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;

During design, the body underwent extensive [[wind tunnel]] testing, to meet a planned 20 MPG fuel efficiency target (on its own, the standard front bumper spoiler added 1 MPG)&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;; its 0.45 drag coefficient&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; bested that of the two-door Ford Mustang.  To further improve fuel economy, the Ranger increased the use of high-strength steel and other lightweight materials, including a magnesium clutch housing, aluminum [[transfer case]] (for four-wheel drive), and a magnesium clutch/brake pedal bracket.&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;  To further save weight, the design of the front suspension was computer-optimized, rendering the front stabilizer bar optional.&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;  Though narrower than the F-Series and other full-size competitors, the cargo bed of the Ranger was given the capability to  transport a four-foot wide sheet of material (considered an industry measure of space in pickup truck bed design) through the use of recesses to insert supports across the bed, allowing such material to be placed above the wheel wells.&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;  

The [[1979 oil crisis|1979 fuel crisis]] nearly doomed the Yuma/Ranger project, as it occurred between launch of the 1979 [[Ford LTD (Americas)|Ford LTD]] and 1980 [[Ford F-Series (seventh generation)|Ford F-Series]].  After selling nearly one million F-Series trucks in 1978, in 1980, Ford had yet to gain a profit from its [[Ford F-Series (seventh generation)|redesign of the F-Series]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Ford President [[Donald Petersen|Don Petersen]] kept the compact truck project alive for several reasons.  By 1980, [[General Motors]] was developing its own domestically-produced compact truck, with the  [[Chevrolet S-10|Chevrolet S-10/GMC S-15]] providing a potential competitor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Peterson also felt, if equipped correctly, buyers would pay nearly the same for a compact truck as a full-size truck (such as the F-100).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   

Around 1980, the Project Yuma truck took on the Ford Ranger name, adopting the name of the mid to upper-level trim used by the Ford F-Series and Bronco since 1965.   In anticipation of the compact truck line, 1981 marked the final use of the Ranger trim for the F-Series and Bronco (replaced by XLS for 1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.therangerstation.com/articles/ford-ranger-name-history/|title=Ford Ranger Name History  : The Ranger Station|website=www.therangerstation.com|language=en-US|access-date=October 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.therangerstation.com/articles/history-of-the-ford-ranger/|title=History of the Ford Ranger  : The Ranger Station|website=www.therangerstation.com|language=en-US|access-date=October 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
The Ranger was produced at the [[Louisville Assembly Plant]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] from 1982 to 1999. From 1993 to 2004, production also was sourced from [[Edison Assembly]] in [[Edison, New Jersey]]. For its entire production run until 2011, the Ranger was produced at [[Twin Cities Assembly Plant]] in [[St Paul, Minnesota]]. The final 2012 Ranger produced on December 16, 2011, ended 86 years of production at Twin Cities Assembly as well as the production of all compact pickups in the United States.

In 2008, Ford made its first plans to end production of the Ranger in North America; although its high productivity spared it from [[The Way Forward]], Twin Cities Assembly (built in 1925) was the oldest Ford factory worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/for-st-paul-ford-plant-end-of-line-is-dec-19/132015583/|title=For St. Paul Ford plant, end of line is Dec. 19|work=Star Tribune|access-date=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ford later extended the closure date of the factory to 2011, but in June 2011, a final closure date was announced.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/business/132015583.html/|title=Report: For St. Paul Ford plant, end of line is Dec. 19|date=June 22, 2011|publisher=Autoblog|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624175529/http://www.autoblog.com/2011/06/22/u-s-ford-ranger-production-ending-this-december/|archivedate=June 24, 2011|url-status=|accessdate=June 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Twin Cities was the sole production location of the Ranger in North America (from 1982), its closure brought the production of the Ranger to an end after 29 model years.  The 2011 model year was the final model year for retail sales, with a shortened 2012 model year for fleet sales; the final North American-market Ranger (a white SuperCab Sport produced for pest-control company [[Orkin]]) was produced on December 16, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_19564573|title=St. Paul Ford plant sees final truck off the line|last=Williams|first=Chris|date=December 6, 2011|work=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63z8ZyYEn?url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_19564573|archivedate=December 16, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Over its production life, the chassis and suspension of the Ranger would be used for several compact Ford trucks and [[sport-utility vehicle]]s. During the 1990s and 2000s, Mazda adopted a badge-engineered version of the Ranger, for their B-Series nameplate (the reverse of the Ford Courier produced by Mazda).

In 2015, as part of contract negotiations with the United Auto Workers, leaked reports over the future of the [[Michigan Assembly Plant]] included the potential decision of replacing [[Ford Focus]] and [[Ford C-Max]] production with an American-market version of the global Ranger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2015/08/25/ford-ranger/32373741/ "Ford plans to build Ranger at Michigan Assembly"] from [[Detroit News]] (August 25, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with the revival of the Ranger nameplate, the UAW negotiations also included a potential revival of the Ford Bronco SUV.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-26/ford-said-to-weigh-returning-bronco-ranger-production-to-u-s- "Ford Said to Weigh Return of Bronco, Ranger Output to U.S."] from Bloomberg News (August 26, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[North American International Auto Show#2017|2017 North American International Auto Show]], Ford confirmed the return of the Ranger and Ford Bronco, with the Ford Ranger as a 2019 model-year vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fordauthority.com/2017/01/ford-ranger-bronco-returning-to-north-america-ford-confirms/|title=Ford Ranger, Bronco Returning To North America, Ford Confirms|date=January 9, 2017|work=Aaron Brzozowski|publisher=Ford Authority|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Ranger rolled off the [[Louisville Assembly Plant|Louisville]] assembly line on January 18, 1982.&lt;ref name="Wards83"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 1983|publisher=Ward's Communications, Inc|year=1983|editor=Stark, Harry A|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While initially slated for a traditional autumn release, to more closely compete with the introduction of the [[Chevrolet S-10]], Ford advanced the launch of the 1983 Ranger several months, with the first vehicles reaching showrooms in March 1982.&lt;ref name="Wards82"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 1982|publisher=Ward's Communications, Inc|year=1982|editor=Stark, Harry A|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Initially sold alongside its Courier predecessor, the first 1983 Ranger was priced at $6,203 ($16,570 in 2018)&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;.  While far smaller in exterior size than the F-Series, 4x4 Rangers offered a payload of 1,600 pounds&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edmunds.com/ford/ranger/history.html|title=Ford Ranger History|last=|first=|date=|work=Edmunds|access-date=October 15, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809111334/https://www.edmunds.com/ford/ranger/history.html|archive-date=August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;, matching or exceeding the F-100 in payload capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/FMC%20Trucks-Vans/1982%20Trucks/1982%20Ford%20Pickup%20Brochure/image11.html|title=1982 Ford Pickup Brochure|last=Ristic-Petrovic|first=Dusan|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=October 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 1984, the [[Ford Bronco II]] two-door SUV was introduced.  Similar in size to the 1966–1977 Bronco, the Bronco II used a shortened version of the Ranger chassis, along with much of its interior components.

For the 1989 model year, the Ranger underwent a major mid-cycle revision to improve its exterior aerodynamics and interior ergonomics.  For 1991, the [[Ford Explorer]] SUV was derived from the facelifted Ranger, sharing its front fascia, chassis, and interior components.      

=== Chassis specification ===
The first-generation Ranger uses a body-on-frame chassis design; while using a chassis developed specifically for the model line, the Ranger adopts many chassis design elements from the F-Series.&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;  Along with traditional leaf-spring rear suspension, the Ranger is fitted with [[Twin I-Beam]] independent front suspension. To minimize [[Unsprung mass|unsprung weight]], the Twin I-Beams were constructed of stamped high-strength steel (rather than forged steel).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;

Rear-wheel drive was standard, with part-time four-wheel drive as an option (never offered in the Courier).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;   Dependent on configuration, the Ranger was produced in three wheelbases: 107.9 inches (6-foot bed), 113.9 inches (7-foot bed), and 125 inches (SuperCab, introduced in 1986).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  

For 1989, rear-wheel anti-lock brakes became standard.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Powertrain ====
From 1983 to 1992, the first-generation Ranger was powered by 2.0L and 2.3L versions of the Ford [[Ford Pinto engine|''"Lima"'']] inline-4, the 2.8L, 2.9L, and 4.0L Ford [[Ford Cologne V6 engine|''Cologne V6'']], the 3.0L Ford [[Ford Vulcan engine|''Vulcan V6'']], and four-cylinder diesel engines sourced from Mazda (Perkins) and Mitsubishi.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dieselhub.com/rigs/ford-ranger-diesel.html|title=Ford Ranger Diesel History - 2.2L Perkins &amp; 2.3L Mitsubishi Diesels|website=www.dieselhub.com|language=en-US|access-date=October 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two long-running engines associated with the Ford light trucks made their debut in the first-generation Ranger; the twin spark-plug version (with distributorless ignition) of the Pinto engine was introduced in 1989, remaining in use through 2001.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/bymodel/1988_Ford_Ranger_Pickup.shtml|title=1988 MPG ratings|accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1990, the 4.0L Cologne V6 was introduced; in modified form, the engine was used through the 2012 model-year discontinuation of the Ranger in North America.  

A four-speed manual transmission was standard on all engines for 1983 and 1984, with a five-speed manual as an option; a three-speed automatic was offered on 2.3L and 2.8L engines.  For 1985, the five-speed manual became the standard transmission, with a four-speed automatic offered on non-diesel Rangers.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  For 1989, the Mazda [[Mazda M5OD transmission|M5OD-R1 transmission]] became the standard transmission.

=== Body design ===
Slightly larger than the Courier, the first-generation Ranger was approximately 18 inches shorter and 11 inches narrower than an equivalently configured F-100/F-150.&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;  While proportioned similar to the Chevrolet S-10 and Japanese-sourced compact trucks, adopted exterior design elements from the F-Series, including its twin headlamps, chrome grille, tailgate lettering, taillamps, and cab proportions.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  In line with the Courier, the Ranger was offered with two pickup bed sizes; a standard 6-foot length and an extended 7-foot length.  In 1986, a third configuration was introduced, as the Ranger SuperCab extended cab was introduced.  Stretched 17 inches behind the front doors for additional cab space, the SuperCab was offered with the 6-foot bed length; four-wheel drive SuperCabs were sold only with V6 engines.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  

During its production, the first-generation Ranger was offered with several seating configurations.  A three-passenger bench seat was standard, with various types of bucket seats offered (dependent on trim level).  As part of the 1989 mid-cycle update, a 40/60 split-bench seat was introduced.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The SuperCab was offered with a pair of center-facing jump seats, expanding capacity to five.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  

From 1983 to 1988, the interior saw few major revisions. In 1986, the instrument cluster was revised, allowing the fitment of a tachometer.  To streamline production, the Ranger shared interior components with other Ford vehicles, sharing the steering column, door handles, and window controls from the Ford Escort, Ford F-Series, and Ford Bronco; nearly the entire driver's compartment of the Ford Bronco II was directly sourced from the Ranger.  

For 1989, the Ranger underwent a mid-cycle redesign with new front fenders, a restyled hood and grille, and flush-mounted composite headlamps (with larger marker lamps).  To further improve aerodynamics, the front bumper was redesigned and enlarged to fit more closely with the front fenders.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The interior was given a redesign, including new door panels, new seats, and an all-new dashboard (introducing a glovebox).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  To improve ergonomics, the instrument panel was redesigned for improved legibility, with automatic transmission Rangers receiving a column-mounted gearshift; manual-transmission versions saw the removal of the key-release button from the steering column.    &lt;gallery mode="packed" caption="1983–1992 Ford Ranger"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Trim ===
The first-generation Ranger was marketed in five trim levels: '''S''', '''Ranger''', '''XL''', '''XLS''', and '''XLT'''.  Intended largely for fleet sales, the Ranger S (introduced in 1984&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;) was offered with virtually no available options.  While still largely a work truck, the Ranger XL offered color-keyed trim, floor mats, and chrome bumpers.  The XLS was marketed as the sportiest version of the Ranger, offering bucket seats, blackout trim, and tape stripe packages (essentially the successor to the 1970s "''Free Wheeling''" trims) while the XLT was offered with two-tone exteriors, chrome exterior trim, and upgraded interior trim.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  

The Ranger STX was introduced in 1985 for Ranger 4x4s on the West Coast of the United States, becoming fully available for 1986.  Offering a "sport" suspension and larger tires, the STX was denoted by the offering of a bucket-seat interior and model-specific two-tone paint scheme.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  

*''S'' - Included: Vinyl upholstery, tachometer (only on 4x4 models), halogen headlamps, black foldaway mirrors, and manual transmission.
*''Sport'' - Added: power steering, tachometer on 4x2 and 4x4 models, rear step bumper, an AM stereo with digital clock or an AM/FM stereo with cassette player and clock, and aluminum rims.
*''Custom'' - same as S.
*''XLT'' - Added: cloth upholstery, sliding rear window, chrome rear step bumper, and deluxe wheel trim.
*''STX'' - Added: tachometer on 4x2, floor console, fog lamps, an AM/FM stereo with clock, and sport cast aluminum rims.

==== Ranger GT ====
Following an initial late 1986 introduction in California, Ford marketed the Ranger GT option package from 1987 to 1989.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.therangerstation.com/articles/ford-ranger-gt-history/|title=Ford Ranger GT History  : The Ranger Station|website=www.therangerstation.com|language=en-US|access-date=October 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marketed as a "sport pickup", the Ranger GT was offered only for regular-cab two-wheel drive Rangers.  Powered by a 140 hp 2.9L V6 (paired with either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission)&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;,  the Ranger GT was equipped with front and rear [[Anti-roll bar|anti-roll bars]], a limited-slip differential, and performance tires.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  Initially offered for short-bed Rangers, the Ranger GT package became available for long-bed two-wheel drive Rangers.  

The Ranger GT was available in either red, white, or blue paint colors; chrome trim was painted body color.  In 1988, the exterior was modified, with a ground effects package, including a redesigned body-color front bumper, allowing for integrated fog lamps.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;      

For 1990, the Ranger GT was discontinued; a one-off prototype was constructed in 1989 by the Ford Truck Public Affairs office, using a V6 from a [[Ford Taurus SHO]] and a 5-speed transmission from a Mustang GT.&lt;ref name="SHORanger"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamilton|first=Frank|title=SHO Down: Have you stomped in a Ford lately?|journal=Minitruckin'|issue=Spring 1990|pages=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SHORanger2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rockledge.home.comcast.net/~rockledge/RangerPictureGallery/SHO/SHORanger.pdf|title=SHO Ranger article copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723045856/http://rockledge.home.comcast.net/~rockledge/RangerPictureGallery/SHO/SHORanger.pdf|archivedate=July 23, 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=August 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a ten-year production run, Ford introduced the second generation of the Ranger for the 1993 model year with much of its chassis carried over from previous generation.  Sharing no body panels with its predecessor, the redesigned Ranger shifted from a smaller-proportioned F-Series to a more aerodynamic design, no longer sharing its front fascia with the Ford Explorer.  For the first time in the compact segment, the Ranger offered a stepside-style bed with the Ranger Splash.

For the 1994 model year, Ford commenced production of the Ranger for Mazda, who began to sell the model line as the B-Series pickup truck (effectively in reverse of the 1972-1982 agreement that produced the Ford Courier).  

For 1995, the second-generation Ranger underwent a mid-cycle revision; in 1996, the model line became the first compact pickup to offer dual airbags.      

=== Chassis specification ===
The second-generation Ranger carried much of its chassis design from its predecessor, with a leaf-sprung rear suspension and a [[Twin I-Beam]] independent front suspension.  Two wheelbases were carried over from the previous generation: 107.9 inches (short bed), 113.9 inches (long bed), with the SuperCab lengthened to 125.2 inches (0.2 inches longer).

Rear-wheel drive remained standard, with four-wheel drive as an option; a [[Dana 35#Independent front suspension (IFS) Dana 35 axle|Dana 35 TTB]] front axle was used.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.therangerstation.com/stock-ranger-specifications/the-ford-ranger-4wd-system/|title=The Ford Ranger 4WD System : The Ranger Station|language=en-US|access-date=April 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With four-wheel drive Rangers, a manually-shifted transfer case was standard; a "Touch Drive" electronically-shifted transfer case was an option, using automatic-locking front-wheel hubs.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;     

For 1995, the front brakes were revised, adopting two-piston brake calipers from the Ford Explorer; four-wheel anti-lock brakes were standardized on Rangers with 4-wheel drive and/or the 4.0L V6.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Powertrain ====
The standard engine on the second-generation Ranger was again the 2.3L inline-4 (retuned to 98 hp).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  The 2.9L V6 was retired, with the Ranger sharing two optional V6 engines with the Aerostar.  The 140hp 3.0L V6 became standard on STX trim and SuperCab 4x4s (retuned to 145 hp in 1995).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The 160 hp 4.0L V6 (also shared with the Explorer) remained an option.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;   

The Mazda [[Mazda M5OD transmission|M5OD]] 5-speed manual remained the standard transmission for all three engines.  In 1995, the [[Ford A4LD transmission|A4LD]] 4-speed automatic was replaced by two electronically-controlled transmissions: the lighter-duty 4R44E (for the inline-4 and 3.0L V6) and the heavier-duty 4R55E (for the 4.0L V6).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  In 1997, the latter was replaced by the 5-speed 5R55E automatic, marking the first 5-speed automatic of an American manufacturer.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Body design ===
The second-generation Ranger saw major changes centered around the exterior, sharing no body panels with its predecessor.  In line with the Aerostar and Explorer, the Ranger adopted more aerodynamic body contours, with flush-mounted door glass, a lower hoodline, taller and wider doors (exterior rain gutters were eliminated, in line with the [[Ford Taurus (first generation)|Ford Taurus]]); sideview mirror brackets were eliminated.  In a major departure from other compact pickup trucks, the cab was widened nearly three inches, matching the mid-size [[Dodge Dakota]] in width.  

The interior of the second-generation underwent a smaller degree of change (compared to the exterior).  While the seats and door panels were new, the dashboard was nearly carryover from 1989-1992.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  For 1994, the instrument panel saw the introduction of a six-digit odometer; the doors saw the addition of side impact guard beams.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  In a functional change, the 1994 Ranger adopted [[R134a|R134a Freon]] (CFC-free) air conditioning.          

For 1995, the Ranger underwent a mid-cycle revision for the exterior and interior.  Distinguished by a revised grille (common for both rear-wheel drive and 4x4 Rangers), the 1995 Ranger shared its dashboard with the second-generation Explorer, with more ergonomic controls and a [[ISO 7736|double DIN]] [[head unit|radio head unit]].  Alongside the introduction of a standard driver-side airbag, a power-operated driver seat became an option (for SuperCab Rangers).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  For 1996, a passenger side airbag was introduced as an option; to allow the use of a child safety seat, a key-operated lockout was supplied with the airbag option.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;    

As with the first generation, the second-generation Ranger was offered in three basic body styles: a standard cab with 6 or 7-foot bed lengths, or a SuperCab extended cab (with short bed).  In 1992, Ford introduced the first FlareSide bed for the Ranger with the Splash trim (see below); in 1996, the FlareSide bed became an option for all short-bed Rangers.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  In a break from its predecessor, rear-wheel drive and 4x4 Rangers were fitted with different grille designs, with a 6-hole design for 2WD models; 4x4 models were given a single-slot design.  For 1995, all Rangers adopted a four-hole grille.&lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Trim ===
The second-generation Ranger largely carried over the trim lines from its predecessor.  The base Ranger S (meant largely for fleets) was discontinued, with the XL becoming the standard Ranger trim.  Alongside the standard XL was the XL Sport, Splash, XLT, and STX.  For 1995, the STX trim became exclusive to 4x4 Rangers.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
[[File:97XLT.jpg|thumb|1997 Ranger XLT (Power Mirrors) ]]

*''XL'' - Included: Vinyl upholstery, bench seat, tinted glass, tachometer on 4x4, and steel rims. 
*''XL Sport'' - Added: sport tape stripe.
*''XLT'' - Added: Floor consolette, cloth upholstery, an AM/FM stereo with clock, and full-faced steel wheels.
*''STX'' - Added: cloth upholstery, captains chairs with floor console, power steering, an AM/FM stereo with cassette player and clock, and tachometer.

==== Ranger Splash ====
[[File:Ford Ranger Splash 3.0L 1995 (37099340112).jpg|thumb|1995 Ford Ranger Splash (regular cab)]]
Introduced for the 1993 model year, the Ranger Splash was a sub-model of the second-generation Ranger.  Alongside the FlareSide pickup bed, the Splash was fitted with a lowered suspension (1 inch in rear, 2 inches in front for 2WD versions); all versions were fitted with 4x4 Ranger grilles.  The monochromatic exterior was fitted with special vinyl "Splash" decals on the sides and the tailgate.  

Rear-wheel drive Splashes were fitted with chrome steel wheels while 4x4 versions were fitted with aluminum wheels.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

}}For the 1998 model year, a third generation of the Ranger made its debut.  While visually similar to the previous generation, extensive upgrades were made to the chassis, suspension, and drivetrain.  In line with the larger F-150 and Super Duty trucks, Super Cab Rangers gained rear-hinged doors for 1999, becoming the first model line in the compact truck segment to do so.

Several variants of the Ranger are derived from this generation.  Ford of Argentina introduced a crew-cab variant of the Ranger for South America in 1998; the [[Ford Ranger EV]] was the first electric vehicle produced by Ford in the United States.  The [[Ford Explorer Sport Trac]] mid-size pickup truck shared its wheelbase (and some components) with the Ranger.

The 2011 model year was the final model year for sales of the Ranger in North America; following a short run of 2012 production exclusively for fleet sales, the final vehicle was produced by Twin Cities Assembly on December 15, 2011; the 2012 Ranger Sport SuperCab 4x4 was the final vehicle produced by the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.twincities.com/2011/12/15/at-fords-st-paul-plant-its-quitting-time/|title=At Ford’s St. Paul plant, it’s quitting time|date=2011-12-15|website=Twin Cities|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chassis specification ===
The third-generation Ranger received a redesigned frame; replacing full-length C-channel construction, the frame rails forward of the firewall became fully boxed.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.therangerstation.com/articles/history-of-the-ford-ranger/|title=History of the Ford Ranger  : The Ranger Station|website=www.therangerstation.com|language=en-US|access-date=October 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coinciding with the larger two-door cab, wheelbases were lengthened, with the model line offered in 111.6 inches (two-door, 6-foot bed), 117.6 inches (two-door, 7-foot bed), and 125.9 inches (2+2 door SuperCab, 6-foot bed).&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edmunds.com/ford/ranger/history.html|title=Ford Ranger History|last=|first=|date=|work=Edmunds|access-date=October 15, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809111334/https://www.edmunds.com/ford/ranger/history.html|archive-date=August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the two previous generations, a rear-wheel drive configuration was standard; on four-wheel drive, front-wheel hubs were vacuum-locked from the dashboard.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt;  From 2001 onward, the vacuum-locked front hubs were replaced by front hubs that were permanently engaged to the front axle.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.therangerstation.com/stock-ranger-specifications/the-ford-ranger-4wd-system/|title=The Ford Ranger 4WD System : The Ranger Station|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 1995 Ford Explorer and 1997 Ford F-150, the third-generation Ranger abandoned the long-running Twin I-Beam front suspension, introducing a [[Double wishbone suspension#Short%20long%20arms%20suspension|short/long-arm (SLA)]] configuration.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;  To further improve handling, recirculating-ball steering was replaced by a rack-and-pinion steering configuration.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt;

==== Powertrain ====
From 1998 to 2001, the standard engine for the Ranger was again a 2.5L inline-4 (retuned to 117 hp), with an optional 3.0L V6 and 4.0L V6.  During the 2001 model year, the 2.5L engine (dating to the 1970s) was retired and replaced by a 2.3L engine (later used by the [[Ford Focus (first generation)|Ford Focus]]).  The same year, the Ranger adopted the overhead-cam version of the 4.0L V6 (originally introduced in the Explorer).  Following the 2008 model year, the 3.0L "Vulcan" V6 ended production, with the Ranger becoming the sole vehicle offered with the engine.

For all five engines, the third-generation Ranger was offered with a Mazda-produced 5-speed manual transmission as standard equipment; in 2001, the 4.0L V6 was paired with the ''[[Mazda M5OD transmission|M5OD-R1HD]]'' manual transmission.  The 2.5L I4 was offered with an optional 4-speed automatic along with the 3.0L V6; in 2001, a 5-speed automatic became an option for the 2.5L I4, 3.0L V6, and 4.0L V6.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

=== Body design ===
In contrast to its 1993 redesign, the third-generation Ranger saw relatively conservative changes to its appearance.  To increase interior space on standard-cab Rangers, the cab was expanded over 3 inches rearward (through a longer wheelbase).&lt;ref name=":64"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.therangerstation.com/articles/history-of-the-ford-ranger/|title=History of the Ford Ranger  : The Ranger Station|website=www.therangerstation.com|language=en-US|access-date=October 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through the deletion of Twin I-Beam suspension, designers were able to lower the hoodline&lt;ref name=":64" /&gt;, which was introduced with new fenders and a grille (sharing design influences from the [[Ford F-Series (tenth generation)|1997 F-150]]).    With the exception of a passenger-airbag lockout switch, the interior saw little change since its 1995 redesign.

The third-generation Ranger saw several updates through its production.  For 2001, the front fascia was redesigned with a new grille and headlamps; the amber turn signals were deleted from the taillamps.  For 2004, the grille was enlarged (in the style of the [[Ford F-Series (eleventh generation)|F-150]]); for the first time since 1995, the interior saw several revisions, with new front seats (to meet updated federal safety requirements) and a new instrument panel and steering wheel.&lt;ref name=":64" /&gt;  2005 marked the final year for the FlareSide bed option.

For 2006, the Ranger received its final update (as the model line was planned for a 2008 discontinuation&lt;ref name=":64" /&gt;).  The grille was restyled into a "3-slot" configuration (in line with the F-Series), adding clear-lens headlamps and parking lamps; the sideview mirrors were replaced with a rectangular design. The rear of the Ranger underwent several changes, with larger taillamps and a Ford Blue Oval centered in the tailgate.  For the first time since 1989, the Ranger fender badging was redesigned (with a larger design).

For the 2010 model year, Ford introduced optional graphics packages for the Ranger, installed by dealers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2009/12/19/fancy-a-camouflage-f-150-graphics-for-entire-ford-lineup-coming/ "Fancy a camouflage F-150? Graphics for entire Ford lineup coming soon" from Autoblog.com (December 18, 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The extended-length bed was removed from retail sale, becoming exclusive to the XL Fleet model.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edmunds.com/ford/ranger/2010/review/|title=2010 Ford Ranger Review &amp; Ratings|website=Edmunds|language=en-us|access-date=2019-12-16}}

=== Trim ===
At its launch, the third-generation Ranger was marketed with the XL and XLT trims; the long-running STX trim level was discontinued and the Splash trim was discontinued after 1998.  For further differentiation between the XL and XLT, for 1999, Ford introduced Sport and Off-Road variants of each trim&lt;ref name=":74"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edmunds.com/ford/ranger/history.html|title=Ford Ranger History|last=|first=|date=|work=Edmunds|access-date=October 15, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809111334/https://www.edmunds.com/ford/ranger/history.html|archive-date=August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (effectively replacing the Splash and STX, respectively); a low-content XL Fleet model was also offered.

For 2001, the Ranger Edge was introduced, with the FX4 and Tremor following in 2002.  For 2005, the Ranger Tremor was deleted and the STX returning; the Ranger Edge effectively became the Ranger Sport for 2006.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.therangerstation.com/articles/ford-ranger-edge-2001-2005/|title=Ford Ranger Edge (2001-2005) : The Ranger Station|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several adjustments were made to the Ranger trims during the late 2000s.  After 2007, the STX was discontinued, with 2009 serving as the final year for the FX4 (produced in 2010 for Canada).  From 2010 onward, the XL, XLT, and Sport were offered; the latter two included [[Sirius XM Radio|Sirius]] radio as an optional feature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=2123&amp;item_id=5790&amp;press_section_id=2870 2011 Ford Ranger] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007092408/http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=2123&amp;item_id=5790&amp;press_section_id=2870|date=October 7, 2012}} from media.ford.com (July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ranger Edge (2001-2005) ====
[[File:Ford Ranger Edge.jpg|thumb|2004-2005 Ford Ranger Edge]]
For 2000, Ford introduced the ''XL Trailhead'' option, offering the suspension and higher ride height of a 4x4 Ranger on a rear-wheel drive vehicle.&lt;ref name=":64" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":74" /&gt;  For 2001, the option became the Edge trim level for the Ranger; slotted between the XL and XLT.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Distinguished by a monochromatic exterior&lt;ref name=":74" /&gt;, Edge also served as a successor to the 1990s Splash trim.  To expand the trim offering, Ford introduced the Edge Plus (combining several XLT features with the Edge), along with a 4x4 variant with the 4.0L V6&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (as the Edge already was produced with the front suspension and tires of the 4x4).

Following the 2005 model year, the Ranger Edge was repackaged as the Ranger Sport (as Ford shifted the Edge nameplate to a mid-size CUV); the Sport would be produced through the 2012 model year.

==== Ranger FX4 (2002-2009) ====

}}

From 2002 to 2009. the Ranger FX4 was offered as the flagship of the Ranger model line, produced with heavy-duty off-road components.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.therangerstation.com/stock-ranger-specifications/ford-ranger-fx4-off-road-and-level-ii-by-the-years/|title=Ford Ranger FX4 Off-Road and Level II – By The Years : The Ranger Station|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Introduced as the Ranger FX4 for 2002, the off-road option package came standard with the 4.0L V6, including a manual transfer case, 31-inch all-terrain tires on 15-inch Alcoa wheels, a [[Ford 8.8 axle|Ford 8.8 rear axle]] with a [[limited-slip differential]] and three [[Skid plate|skid plates]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;   The interior was given two-tone bucket seats (leather seats becoming optional in 2006) with heavy-duty rubber floor mats.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

For 2003, the FX4 model line was expanded, as Ford introduced the Ranger FX4 Off-Road; the previous FX4 became the FX4 Level II.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Intended as a lower-cost version, the FX4 Off Road does not have the Torsen limited-slip rear axle, Bilstein shocks, or Alcoa wheels on 31-inch tires; instead, the FX4 Off-Road uses off-the-shelf Ford components.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  To distinguish the two model lines, the FX4 Off-Road was given a chrome grille and front bumper (for 2006, the Off-Road received a body-color grille).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  While the Level II was never sold with a FlareSide bed option, the configuration was offered on the Off-Road for 2003 and 2004.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

For 2008, Ford consolidated the two FX4 model lines, withdrawing the Level II.  While retaining the FX4 Off-Road name, the new model line adopted a number of features from the Level II, including three skid plates, a Torsen differential (as an option), heavy-duty shocks (Rancho units replacing Bilsteins), and two-tone bucket seats with heavy-duty rubber flooring.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  After the 2009 model year, the FX4 was discontinued in the United States (2010 for Canada).

According to Ford, 17,971 Level IIs were built from 2002 through 2007 (including the 2002 FX4); 45,172 FX4 Off Roads were built from 2003 to 2009.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}

==== Ranger Tremor (2002-2004) ====
For the 2002 model year, the Ranger Tremor was introduced as an option package.&lt;ref name=":64" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.therangerstation.com/articles/2002-ford-ranger-tremor/|title=2002 Ford Ranger Tremor : The Ranger Station|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In line with the 1990s Ranger Splash, the Tremor was largely an appearance option package, with its content centered around a high-end audio system).&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;  Including a 485-watt 4-speaker stereo system, the Tremor included a cassette/CD player, white-gauge instruments, monochromatic exterior, badging, and 16-inch wheels.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

For 2003, the Tremor became a stand-alone trim level, lasting through 2004.

=== Safety ===
The Ranger was the first small pickup to introduce dual airbags as safety features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/16/business/air-bags-in-ford-trucks.html|title=Air Bags in Ford Trucks|date=June 16, 1994|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It received an "acceptable" frontal crash test rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety when they were first tested in 1998, while many of its competitors received "marginal" or "poor" ratings at that time. The exception was the [[Toyota Tacoma]], which also got an "acceptable" rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=97|title=IIHS-HLDI: Ford Ranger regular cab|date=November 18, 2009|publisher=Iihs.org|accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/earliermodels.aspx?class=75|title=IIHS-HLDI: Small pickups – Earlier Models|publisher=Iihs.org|accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 model year brought the addition of front seat combination head and torso airbags to improve passenger safety in a side-impact collision&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; and earned "good" rating through the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]'s side impact test. Also, [[electronic stability control]] was added for the 2010 models as standard equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=1236|title=IIHS-HLDI: Ford Ranger extended cab|date=February 4, 2010|publisher=Iihs.org|accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Roof Strength Test conducted by [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]], the 2010 Ranger earned an ''Acceptable'' rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/roof/detailsbyclass.aspx?75|title=Roof strength evaluations: Small pickups|publisher=Iihs.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407200204/http://www.iihs.org/ratings/roof/detailsbyclass.aspx?75|archivedate=April 7, 2010|accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fourth generation (2019-present)==
{{main|Ford Ranger (fourth generation)}}
[[File:White Ford Ranger.jpg|thumb|2020 Ford Ranger XLT SuperCrew 4x4|alt=]]For the 2019 model year, the [[Ford Ranger (fourth generation)|fourth-generation Ranger]] was introduced, going on sale in January 2019.&lt;ref name="2018production"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2018/10/22/ford-starts-making-ranger-week/1697681002/|title=Ford's product onslaught starts with Ranger return|last=Thibodeau|first=Ian|date=October 22, 2018|work=The Detroit News|access-date=November 25, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Returning after an eight-year hiatus (2012 production was not marketed for retail sale), the fourth-generation Ranger became the first of the model line produced as a mid-size pickup.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Developed from the [[Ford Ranger (T6)|Ranger T6]] designed by Ford Australia, the Ranger underwent several design changes to its frame and bumpers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;    

Along with its shift in size segments, the fourth generation marks several firsts for the Ranger in North America.  The two-door standard-cab configuration is no longer produced; all examples are SuperCabs or SuperCrews.  While Ford Argentina produced crew-cab Rangers during the 1990s and 2000s, this is the first Ranger offered with four full doors in the United States and Canada (effectively succeeding the [[Ford Explorer Sport Trac]]).  For the first time, no V6 engine nor any manual transmission is offered; a 2.3L turbocharged inline-4 and a 10-speed automatic is the sole powertrain offering (as of 2020 production).   

The fourth-generation Ranger is produced by Ford at its [[Michigan Assembly Plant]] in [[Wayne, Michigan]]. 

== Variants ==
=== Ford Ranger EV (1998–2002) ===
[[File:GSFRChargeDoorQuarter.jpg|thumb|Ford Ranger EV]]
The first [[battery electric vehicle]] produced by Ford in North America, the [[Ford Ranger EV]] was produced from 1998 to 2002.  Originally fitted with [[lead-acid batteries]], [[Nickel metal hydride battery|Nickel metal hydride (NiMH)]] batteries were introduced for 1999.  While using the frame of a 4x4 Ranger, the Ranger EV was rear-wheel drive with a rear-mounted driveline.  It is also the only rear-wheel drive American-produced Ford fitted with a [[de Dion tube|de Dion]] rear suspension.  Externally, the Ranger EV is primarily distinguished from a standard Ranger by its grille; the Ranger EV has a grille-mounted charging port on the right third of its grille.   

During its production, 1,500 Ranger EVs were produced; as with most electric vehicles of the 1990s, it was offered exclusively through lease.  While most fleet-leased Ranger EVs were returned to Ford after the end of the lease and dismantled, some Ranger EVs leased by individuals were purchased and remain in use.

=== Mazda B-Series/Mazda Truck (1994–2010) ===
For 1994, [[Mazda North American Operations|Mazda North America]] ended imports of the B-series from Japan, entering into an agreement with Ford to market a rebadged version of the Ranger as the B-series in the United States and Canada.  For Mazda, whose 1986-1993 B-series had struggled in North America, the new B-series was a variant of one of the highest-selling compact trucks.  In addition, selling a truck produced in the United States allowed Mazda to entirely circumvent the 25% "chicken tax".   

While Mazda continued sales of the previous-generation B-series for global markets, for the United States and Canada, the B-series adapted the body configurations and powertrains as the Ranger; two-wheel drive and 4x4 versions were offered.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  As with previous generations, badging was related to engine displacement; versions with the 2.3L inline-four were the B2300, the 3.0L V6 as the B3000, and the 4.0L V6 as the B4000.  

To distinguish Ford and Mazda trucks from one another, stylists gave the B-series its own front fascia and pickup truck bed; the extended cab (Cab Plus) was styled with blacked-out and chrome window trim.  At its launch, Mazda sold the B-series in two trim lines, SE and LE (equivalent to Ranger XL and XLT, respectively).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  For 1997, the trim levels were revised, as the LE was dropped in favor of SE-5 and SE-5+; for 1998, SX became the base trim, with SE becoming the highest trim.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  For 2002, the B-series was renamed '''Mazda Truck''', though all fender badging denoting engine size remained.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  

During its production, the B-series/Truck largely followed the development of the Ranger in its body and chassis.  For 1997, Mazda dropped the B3000 (separately from Ford); the model returned for 1998.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  For 1998, the B-series underwent the same body and chassis redesign as the Ranger, with a new front fascia, redesigned pickup bed (with vestigial fenders), and a larger-displacement standard engine (creating the B2500).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  During 1998, rear-hinged doors were added to Cab Plus models, a first in the pickup truck segment (alongside SuperCabs of the Ford Ranger and F-Series).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  For 2001, the B2300 returned (with a Ford Duratec DOHC engine) and the B4000 received a SOHC 4.0L V6 engine.  

As the B-series became the Mazda Truck for 2002, it underwent its final exterior update, introducing a centered Mazda badge to the grille.  After 2007, the B3000 was discontinued (as production of the 3.0L Vulcan V6 ended within a year).  As Mazda North America began to shift away from pickup truck sales, the Mazda Truck was withdrawn from the United States after the 2009 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.thecarconnection.com/marty-blog/1035480_b-series-b-seeing-you-mazda-leaves-u-s-pickup-market|title=B-Series, B-Seeing You: Mazda Leaves U.S. Pickup Market|author=Bengt Halvorson|date=September 21, 2009|publisher=The Car Connection|accessdate=October 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sold in Canada for 2010, the final Mazda Truck rolled off the Twin Cities Assembly Plant assembly line on December 11, 2009.

=== South American production (1996-2011) ===

[[File:Ford Ranger 2.3 XLT 2009 (25453700488).jpg|alt=|thumb|2009 Ford Ranger 2.3 XLT double cab ]]
[[File:Ford Ranger 2.3 XL 2012 (37099348822).jpg|alt=|thumb|2012 Ford Ranger 2.3 XL double cab ]]
In 1995, Ford began exports of the Ranger from the United States to [[Argentina]]; initial exports started with two-door SuperCab equipped with the 4.0-liter gasoline ''[[Ford Cologne V6 engine|Cologne]]'' V6. As demand increased, Ford made the decision to produce it locally in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina at the [[Ford Motor Company of Argentina|Ford General Pacheco Assembly Plant]] for the local market and subsequently for the rest of Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711015834/http://www.fordperu.com/html/ford_ranger_peru.html|title=Ford Ranger Peru|date=2011-07-11|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Rangers produced at General Pacheco were built in 1996, with Ford offering single cab versions with gasoline engines.  By November 1997, supply was increased with both diesel and gasoline engines, [[two-wheel drive|two-wheel]] and [[four-wheel drive]], and different levels of equipment.  After two years of local production, Ford of Argentina introduced a redesigned version of the Ranger for 1998.  Featuring the same updates as its counterpart in the United States, a new four-door [[crew cab|double cab]] body variant exclusive to South America made its debut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blogdecoches.com.ar/ford-f-100-la-pick-up-mas-vendida-en-la-historia-argentina/ Ford Pick up history in Argentina] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706080721/http://www.blogdecoches.com.ar/ford-f-100-la-pick-up-mas-vendida-en-la-historia-argentina/|date=July 6, 2011}} (in Spanish) – Accessed March 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  As Ford was developing the functionally similar Ford Explorer Sport Trac at the time, the double-cab Ford Ranger was not produced or marketed in the United States or Canada.

Starting in 1998, Ford began to phase out the Ford Courier name on its Mazda-produced compact pickups sold globally in favor of the Ranger nameplate (though the Courier remained in use in Australia). Consequently, exports of the North American-produced Ranger were primarily limited to South America, including Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.&lt;ref name="American Ford Ranger" /&gt;  To better match the needs of local buyers, Ford of Argentina offered three different turbodiesel powertrain options, including a 2.5-liter [[List of Ford engines#4 cylinder|turbocharged four-cylinder]] [[diesel engine|diesel]] with 115 hp (85 kW) starting in 1998, a 2.8-liter with 135 hp (99 kW) starting in 2002 and a 3.0-liter with {{convert|163|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|280|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque mated to an [[Eaton Corporation|Eaton]] ''FSO-2405-A'' five-speed manual transmission starting in 2004.

The 2001 exterior facelift given to North American Rangers was not carried over to South American versions, with the 1998 front bodywork remaining until the 2003 model year. For 2004, both versions were given the same grille (though Argentine-produced versions were designed with projector-style headlamps).  Following a US$156.5 million upgrade to the General Pacheco factory in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.automotiveworld.com/WAM/content.asp?contentid=62775 Ford to invest US$156.5m in Pacheco facility]- Accessed March 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; several upgrades were made to the South American Ranger; a number of them would diverge the model from its US counterpart. For 2008, the Ranger received a makeover with a grill and headlights similar to the 2006 North American version; bed extenders became available for all boxes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mundoautomotor.com.ar/web/2007/11/30/ford-ranger-2008/Ford Ranger 2008] (in Spanish) – Accessed March 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2010, Ford of Argentina gave the Ranger its largest facelift since 1992.  Exclusive to South America, the update replaced the hood, front fenders and bumper with a more aggressive design; to allow for a more aggressive stance, large wheel arches were included.  For the first time, the Ranger adopted the Ford three-bar corporate grille; the door handles were redesigned, shifting to a loop-style design.  The interior was largely unchanged, as were the powertrain offerings.  A new option (for Argentina and Brazil) included an engine powered by [[compressed natural gas]], making it the first pickup truck to offer a factory-built [[natural gas vehicle]] (NGV) commercially available in those countries.&lt;ref name="presentó la nueva Ford Ranger 2010"&gt;[http://www.iprofesional.com/notas/85309-Llega-a-la-Argentina-la-nueva-Ford-Ranger-2010.htmlFord presentó la nueva Ford Ranger 2010] (in Spanish) – Accessed March 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://espaciocoches.com/2009/06/ford-ranger-2010-mercosur-primeras-imgenes-y-datos.html Ford Ranger 2010 (Mercosur), primeras imágenes y datos] (in Spanish) – Accessed March 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Ford of Argentina replaced the US-derived Ranger with the larger [[Ford Ranger (T6)|Ranger T6]]. Designed by Ford of Australia, the Ranger T6 consolidated the Ford- and Mazda-based versions of the Ranger onto a single platform sold globally, introduced to North America for 2019.

The '''Ford Freda''' was a [[Rebadged|badge engineered]] version of the 8-seater [[Mazda Bongo|Mazda Bongo Friendee]] [[Multi-purpose vehicle|minivan]], introduced to the [[Japan]]ese partner home market by the [[America]]n automaker [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in 1995. 

Most examples of this vehicle are automatics (there are a few manual versions), and are available in 2WD (SGL3) and 4WD (SGL5) versions. 2.5 turbo diesels are common in [[Japan]], although V6 petrol engines are starting to appear. Later (post 99) models are a different shape and have different engines. [[Air conditioning]] (often with [[climate control]]), and Electronic Blinds are fitted as standard.

==Camping Versions==
Some Bongo Friendee/Fredas have Mazda factory-fitted kitchen units, but many others are imported and converted to [[camper van]]s in the United Kingdom. All have fold-down seats downstairs to make a double bed, and on many models there is also an elevating roof where you can sleep two more. Flat-top versions (or "Bongolows") are also available.

===Production===
The Ford Figo is manufactured at Ford's plant in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. The 100,000th Ford Figo produced for the Indian market was delivered 15 months after its launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zigwheels.com/news-features/news/ford-celebrates-100000-figo-sales/8833/1|title=Zigwheels - Ford Celebrates 100,000 Figo Sales|accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 200,000th Figo was sold during August 2012, after 29 months of production,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardekho.com/india-car-news/ford-india-registers-16-growth-in-august-2012-8637.htm|title=Ford Celebrates 200,000 Figo Sales|accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the 300,000th Figo was made in first week of August 2013, after 41 months of production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india.ford.com/about/media/newsroom/result?article=1249043932129 300,000th Ford Figo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907031753/http://www.india.ford.com/about/media/newsroom/result?article=1249043932129 |date=7 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Braking and handling===
The Ford Figo has ventilated discs at front and drum rear brakes. The top variant comes with an [[Anti-lock braking system]] (ABS) with [[Electronic brakeforce distribution]] (EBD) which enhances the safety of the car by helping it stop in emergency situations.

===Safety===
During a crash, the Figo's engine automatically falls from the bonnet area to prevent the car from catching fire. Dual front airbags are available on a premium package.

===Awards===
The Figo has been awarded 20 Indian auto industry awards, more honours than any other car in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardekho.com/india-car-news/ford-figo-is-the-most-awarded-car-in-india-in-2010-3702.htm|title=Ford Figo is the Most Awarded Car in India in 2010|accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorbeam.com/cars/ford-figo/ford-figo-win-20-awards/|title=Ford &amp; Figo Win 20 Awards|accessdate=2012-09-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925062649/http://www.motorbeam.com/cars/ford-figo/ford-figo-win-20-awards/|archive-date=25 September 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ford Figo was voted the 2011 Indian Car of the Year by a panel of leading automotive magazine editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2010-12-16/news/27601097_1_ford-figo-ford-india-year-award|title=Ford Figo wins 2011 Indian Car of the Year Award|accessdate=2012-09-06 | work=The Times Of India|date=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also named runner-up in the 2011 South African Car of the Year Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carmag.co.za/news/sa-car-of-the-year-2011-its-a-tie/ |title=SA Car of the Year 2011: It's a tie! |publisher=Car magazine|date=2011-03-09 |accessdate=2013-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketing controversy===
A series of Ford Figo print ads were created by [[J. Walter Thompson|JWT India]], including a caricature of former Italian Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]] in the driver's seat with three scantily clad women sitting gagged and bound in the trunk, a [[Paris Hilton]] caricature winking from the driver's seat while [[Kim Kardashian]] and two others are gagged in the boot, and a caricatured [[Michael Schumacher]] with [[Sebastian Vettel]], [[Lewis Hamilton]] and [[Fernando Alonso]] lookalikes gagged in the back. All three featured the same tagline: "Leave your worries behind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anant Rangaswami |url=http://www.firstpost.com/business/how-jwt-scam-ads-got-ford-india-in-a-mess-673822.html |title=How JWT scam ads got Ford India in a mess |publisher=Firstpost.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The print ads were not approved by Ford, but were used as speculative renderings to promote the agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Laura Stampler |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/awful-ford-figo-ad-silvio-berlunsconi-gagged-women-2013-3 |title=Silvio Berlusconi With A Trunk Full Of Tied-Up Women: Worst Ford Ad Ever? |publisher=Businessinsider.com |date=2013-03-21 |accessdate=2013-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; JWT breached trust and used an approval from Ford to use other poster ads made for Ford as a tacit approval to enter the adverts into the GoaFest 2013 Advertising awards and adsoftheworld.com. Ivan Razl of adsoftheworld.com confirmed that the ads were removed according to the rules of the website as the letter was only a generic approval and the said ads were not approved, which was confirmed to him by JWT. After the publication of the ads, Ford responded by stating that the posters were contrary to the standards of professionalism and decency within Ford and its agency partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Welsh |first=Jonathan |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/drivers-seat/2013/03/23/ford-apologizes-for-offensive-berlusconi-figo-ads/ |title=Ford Apologizes for Offensive 'Berlusconi' Figo Ads |publisher=Blogs.wsj.com |date=2013-03-23 |accessdate=2013-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; JWT India's parent, [[WPP plc]], apologized for the adverts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Philip |first=Siddharth |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-25/ford-apologizes-after-mock-ads-of-berlusconi-tying-up-women.html |title=Ford Apologizes After Mock Ads of Berlusconi Tying Up Women |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2013-03-25 |accessdate=2013-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the incident, JWT India chief creative officer and managing partner Bobby Pawar and Blue Hive creative director Vijay Simha Vellanki resigned; and a further ten employees were reported to have been laid off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thirani Bagri |first=Neha |url=http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/01/indias-ad-industry-shaken-after-ford-figo-controversy/ |title=India's Ad Industry Shaken After Ford Figo Controversy|publisher=nytimes.com |date=2013-04-01 |accessdate=2013-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equipment===
Equipment highlights for the Figo include the MyFord Dock, first introduced on the Figo Aspire, which allows occupants to easily charge their smart-devices and also use the same for navigation.&lt;ref name="New Ford Figo launched in India"/&gt;

===Colours/Colors===
The second gen Ford Figo is offered with 7 paint options.&lt;ref name="New Ford Figo launched in India"/&gt;

===Recalls===
Ford India issued a statement saying that they had initiated a voluntary recall for approximately 42,300 units of the new Figo and the Figo Aspire owing to problems in the Restraint Control Module (RCM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.ndtv.com/news/ford-recalls-over-40-000-units-of-figo-and-figo-aspire-1398020 |title=Ford Recalls Over 40,000 Units of Figo and Figo Aspire |work=ndtv.com |date=2015-04-22 |accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The software issue on the RCM can result in airbags not deploying in certain collisions. This may lead to loss of life. Ford stated that they will be carrying out software upgrade on the RCM on all affected vehicles across the country, free of cost. The recall applied to Figo and Figo Aspire units manufactured since the launch of both the vehicles until 12 April 2016.

===Production Volumes===
Ford India initially targeted 20,000 units / month of average output for Figo and Figo Aspire from the [[Sanand]], [[Gujarat]] plant. However reports&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/cnbc-tv18-comments/ford-cuts-production-targetwakeslow-figo-aspire-sales_6254981.html |title=Poor Figo, Aspire sales tests Ford's multi-product India plan |work=moneycontrol.com |date=2015-04-18 |accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicated that Figo hatchback's sales declined by 60 per cent between October 2015 and March 2016, while the Figo Aspire's sales went down 74 per cent from its launch in August 2015 and March 2016. This led to slash in production to 10,800 units a month.

=== {{anchor|Freestyle}} Freestyle===
In 2018, a CUV variant of the Figo was introduced, known as the Ford Freestyle. It is slotted between the Figo hatchback and the [[Ford EcoSport|EcoSport]]. It is available with a 1.2-litre petrol engine and a 1.5-litre diesel engine. Both engines are mated to a 5-speed manual transmission. The starting price is Rs 5.81 lakh. It is available in the following trims: Ambiente, Trend+, Titanium and Titanium+.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/auto/ford-freestyle-india-price-engine-features-variants/story/275662.html |title=Ford Freestyle launched in India: Price, engine, features and variants explained |date=2018-04-27 |accessdate=2018-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Designed and engineered by [[Ford Australia|Ford of Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/business/companies/meet-the-factory-workers-in-thailand-that-will-take-our-jobs-once-australias-car-manufacturing-industry-closes/news-story/576545b39f5ce34f014defcce8135da5|title=Meet the factory workers in Thailand that will take our jobs once Australia’s car manufacturing industry closes|date=1 Oct 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph (Sydney Australia)|publisher=News Corp. Australia|last2=Sainsbury|first2=Michael|last1=Dowling|first1=Joshua|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the current generation consolidated worldwide production of the Ranger onto a single platform, replacing the [[Ford Ranger (Americas)|1998-2012 Ranger]] (of North/South America)&lt;ref name="pickuptrucks.com_t6_debuts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.pickuptrucks.com/2010/10/first-look-all-new-2011-ford-ranger-t6-global-pickup-truck-debuts.html|title=First Look: All-New 2011 Ford Ranger "T6" Global Pickup Truck|last=Levine|first=Mike|publisher=PickupTrucks.com|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Mazda BT-50|Mazda-derived Ford Ranger]] sold in Latin America, Europe and Asia-Pacific regions. First unveiled at the [[Australian International Motor Show]] in Sydney in October 2010, the Ranger T6 has been produced since the summer of 2011.

Initially excluded from sale in the United States and Canada, Ford commenced sales of the Ranger T6 in these two markets in January 2019. Although a mid-size truck, the model line is again slotted below the Ford F-150 in the Ford truck range.  Outside of North America, Mazda sells a restyled version of the Ranger as the Mazda BT-50 pickup truck.  Alongside the upcoming [[Ford Bronco]], the third generation [[Ford Everest]] SUV and [[Troller T4]] (from 2014) off-road vehicle are derived from the Ranger T6.

The Ford Ranger is produced across several facilities worldwide.  First produced by the [[AutoAlliance Thailand|AutoAlliance]] facility in [[Rayong|Rayong, Thailand]], production is also sourced from [[Ford Motor Argentina|Ford Argentina]] in [[General Pacheco|General Pacheco, Argentina]], [[Nigeria]] and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="truck_trend_t6_ranger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trucktrend.com/features/news/2010/163_news101014_new_global_ford_ranger/index.html|title=New Global Ford Ranger Unveiled, Still Not Planned for U.S.|last=Kong|first=Benson|publisher=Truck Trend|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  North American production is sourced from the [[Michigan Assembly Plant]] in [[Wayne, Michigan]].

== Overview ==
Following its 2006-2011 predecessor in the mid-size segment, the Ford Ranger T6 is produced in three body styles worldwide.  A two-door (single-cab) is standard, with a cargo capacity of {{convert|1.21|m3|cuft|order=flip}}.  A cargo capacity of {{convert|1.82|m3|cuft|order=flip}} is offered with a four-door extended cab (SuperCab in North America), or a four-door crew cab (SuperCrew in North America).  Along with the standard pickup truck, the Ranger is also offered as a chassis cab, effectively taking the place of the Ford Falcon cab-chassis.

All four-door Rangers have the same ground clearance, whether two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive; two-door versions are offered with a "Hi-Rider" option in two-wheel drive configuration, giving them the same ground clearance as 4x4 versions.  Hi-Rider versions (including the Wildtrak) have water-fording clearance of {{convert|800|mm|in|abbr=on|order=flip}}, while standard-height Rangers have clearance of {{convert|600|mm|in|abbr=on|order=flip}}.  The Ranger T6 has a rated towing capacity of {{convert|3500|kg|lb|abbr=on|order=flip}}; versions with the 2.2L Duratorq diesel have a payload capacity of {{convert|1333|kg|lb|abbr=on|order=flip}}.

In 2015, the Ford Ranger T6 underwent a mid-cycle redesign, with the front fascia adopting elements of [[Ford Kinetic Design]].&lt;ref name="GearHeads.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gearheads.org/the-new-2016-ford-ranger/|title=New Ford ranger}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In place of the rectangular three-bar grille, the Ranger adopted a slightly oval grille with a single center bar, allowing further differentiation between the Ranger and the mechanically similar [[Ford Everest]] SUV.

== Trim levels ==
The global Ranger T6 follows traditional Ford truck trim level nomenclature, offering XL, XLS, and XLT trim levels.  Based on its four-wheel drive versions, Ford offers the Ford Ranger FX4 and the Ford Ranger Wildtrak, with model-specific exteriors. The North American version of the Ranger T6 shares the same nomenclature, with XL, XLT, and Lariat; the FX4 is offered as an option package for 4x4 vehicles.

=== Wildtrak ===
In certain global markets, including Australia, Ford released the Ford Ranger Wildtrak as a special edition of the Ranger.  Based on the four-wheel drive crew-cab, the Wildtrak was equipped with a 3.2L Duratorq diesel engine with a manual or automatic transmission.  To visually distinguish the model, the Wildtrak was equipped with a model-specific grille (painted dark grey), model-specific 18-inch wheels, and other exterior and interior trim.  Marketed in a colour exclusive to the trim (Pride Orange), the Wildtrak was also offered in several other colours.

=== Raptor ===
[[File:Ford Ranger Raptor at IAA 2019 IMG 0548.jpg|thumb|Ford Ranger Raptor display in Frankfurt, Germany.]]
Unveiled by Ford in Thailand in 2018, the Ford Ranger Raptor is an 2019 production model.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;https://paultan.org/2018/02/12/first-look-2018-ford-ranger-raptor-in-thailand/&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to the larger F-150 Raptor, the Ranger Raptor is a high-performance truck optimized for off-road driving.  Marking the debut of the 210hp 2.0L [[EcoBlue]] bi-turbo diesel engine in the Ranger paired to a 10-speed automatic transmission, the Raptor is equipped with standard four-wheel drive and upgraded chassis and suspension.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  As with the F-150 Raptor, the grille of the Ranger Raptor replaces the Ford Blue Oval with "FORD" in block letters. In October 2018, Ford confirmed that the Ranger Raptor would not be available in North America, citing that the Ranger Raptor is designed specifically for markets where the F-150 Raptor is not available; Ford also noted that demand for the F-150 Raptor in the U.S. outpaces supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ford-ranger-raptor-not-for-us/|title=Ford Ranger Raptor remains a no-go in the US|last1=Krok|first1=Andrew|publisher=Road Show by CNET|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==
The Ranger T6 is equipped with six airbags (seven, in EU-market models).  Along with dual front and side airbags, the Ranger is equipped with curtain airbags; European versions are equipped with a driver-side knee airbag.  Along with standard anti-lock brakes, the Ranger is equipped with [[emergency brake assist]].  The twin-piston {{convert|302|mm|in|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} by {{convert|32|mm|in|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} front brake rotors are joined by {{convert|270|mm|in|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} by {{convert|55|mm|in|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} rear drums (on two-wheel drive Rangers) and  {{convert|295|mm|in|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} by {{convert|55|mm|in|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} rear drums (on Hi-Rider and all 4x4 Rangers).

Australia XLT and WildTrak variants have the optional Tech Pack for $800. This includes Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Keeping Aid, Lane Departure Warning, Automatic High Beams, Front windscreen mounted camera and a radar placed on in the front right side of the grille.

==Variants==

=== Ford Everest ===
{{main|Ford Everest}}
Ford revealed the concept for the next-generation Ford Everest in August 2013. The Everest SUV features [[Ford Kinetic Design|Kinetic Design]] cues similar to the [[Ford EcoSport|EcoSport]], [[Ford Kuga|Kuga]]/[[Ford Escape|Escape]], and [[Ford Edge|Edge]].&lt;ref name="next_gen_ford_edge_ma"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vijayenthiran|first=Viknesh|title=2015 Ford Edge Previewed By 2013 L.A. Auto Show Concept|url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1088603_2015-ford-edge-previewed-by-2013-l-a-auto-show-concept|publisher=Motor Authority|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle is offered in both rear-wheel drive and four-wheel drive, mated either to the 2.2-L or 3.2-L Duratorq, depending on the market.

A minor facelift in 2018 provided a refreshed front, a new 2.0 bi-turbo diesel from the Ranger Raptor, Autonomous Emergency Braking, and a 10-speed auto with the 2.0.

Presently, no plans exist to offer the Everest outside of the Asia-Pacific and South African markets; in North America, the Everest overlaps with the [[Ford Explorer|Explorer]], [[Ford Expedition|Expedition]], and [[Ford Flex|Flex]] in size and cost as well as seating, cargo, and towing capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glon|first=Ronan|title=Ford previews Australia-bound Everest SUV|url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/ford-everest.html|work=Left Lane News|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Everest-AutoBlog"&gt;{{cite web|last=Turkus|first=Brandon|title=Ford Australia debuts Ranger-based Everest SUV concept|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2013/08/13/ford-australia-debuts-ranger-based-everest-suv-concept/|work=AutoBlog|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the Philippines, the Everest is sold alongside the Explorer and Expedition Max.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Philippines--SUVs|url=http://www.ford.com.ph/suv|publisher=Ford Philippines|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, the Ford Everest is manufactured by [[Jiangling Motors]], at Jiangling's [[Nanchang]] factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JMC manufacturers the Ford Everest for the Chinese market|url=http://chinaautoweb.com/2015/08/jiangling-ford-starts-rolling-out-the-everest-suv-in-nanchang/|work=Chinaautoweb.com|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In India, Ford markets the Everest as the Ford Endeavour. A military version is marketed as the Arquus Trapper. The Ford Everest is used as the base for the French VT4, the successor of the old PT4, based on a Mercedes chassis.

=== Ford Bronco (2021) ===
{{main|Ford_Bronco#Sixth_generation_(2020,_to_commence)|l1=Ford Bronco (sixth generation)}}
Alongside the North American revival of the Ford Ranger, Ford is reintroducing the Ford Bronco SUV.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tk6iShyuM3M Ford NAIAS 2017: Official Press Conference Livestream]&lt;/ref&gt;  Scheduled for the 2021 model year,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2015/08/25/ford-ranger/32373741/ "Ford plans to build Ranger at Michigan Assembly"] from [[Detroit News]] (August 25, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; the Bronco will be a mid-size SUV based on the Ranger and slotted below the standard-length Expedition and above the Explorer in the Ford model line.  While mechanically derived from the Ranger T6, Ford chief technical officer Raj Nair stated that the 2021 Bronco would be its own unique vehicle and would not be an adaptation of the existing Ford Everest SUV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carscoops.com/2017/01/ford-boss-raj-nair-says-new-bronco-will.html|title=Ford Boss Raj Nair Says New Bronco Will Be ‘Completely Unique’ From Everest, But Will Share Chassis|last1=Halas|first1=John|publisher=Carscoops|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== JMC Yuhu ===
[[File:JMC Yuhu China 2017-03-22.jpg|thumb|JMC Yuhu]]
{{main|JMC Yuhu}}
[[Jiangling Motors]] (the automotive joint-venture affiliate of Ford in China) has assembled the [[JMC Yuhu]] since August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaautoweb.com/2015/08/jiangling-ford-starts-rolling-out-the-everest-suv-in-nanchang/|title=Jiangling Ford Starts Rolling Out the Everest SUV in Nanchang|date=19 August 2015|work=Chinaautoweb.com|accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A mid-size pickup based upon a proprietary platform, the exterior of the Yuhu is derived loosely upon both the Ranger and the Mazda BT-50.

=== Mazda BT-50 ===
{{main|Mazda BT-50}}
Developed in tandem with the Ford Ranger T6, the [[Mazda BT-50#Second generation (UP; 2011–2015)|Mazda BT-50]] is mechanically identical to the Ranger, using the 2.2L and 3.2L Duratorq diesels (as the rebranded MZ-CD engines).  In the reverse of Mazda truck tradition in global markets, the second-generation BT-50 was developed by Ford. As the BT-50 was styled using the work of a separate design team, the two vehicles share almost no common body panels, with the exception of the roof stamping and the window glass.

While the global Ford Ranger is entering production for the United States and Canada for the 2019 model year, Mazda North America has no current plans to market any version of the Mazda BT-50 in North America.

=== Troller T4 ===
[[File:Troller.jpg|thumb|Troller T4 (pre-redesign)]]
The [[Troller T4]] is an [[off-road vehicle]] produced in Brazil by Ford subsidiary [[Troller Veículos Especiais S/A]] that has been produced since 2004.  Using a similar body and chassis configuration as the [[Jeep Wrangler]] and [[Land Rover Defender|Land Rover]], in 2014, Troller modernized the T4, replacing the entire chassis with a version of the Ranger frame shortened to fit the T4 body.

== North American production (2019–present) ==
{{Main|Ford Ranger (fourth generation)}}
[[File:2020 Ford Ranger.jpg|thumb|2020 Ford Ranger SuperCrew XLT]]
For its 2011 launch, the Ford Ranger T6 replaced previous generations of the Ranger worldwide, consolidating designs developed by Ford and Mazda.  A notable exception included the United States and Canada, as Ford exited the compact truck segment entirely.  

During the early 2010s, Ford concentrated its light truck design resources in North America on its F-Series trucks, with its [[Ford F-Series (thirteenth generation)|2015 redesign]] including an aluminum-intensive body and introducing direct-injection and turbocharged engines in an effort to improve fuel economy.  Outside of North America, the F-Series trucks were not as widely marketed as the Ranger (excepting Mexico, the Caribbean, and the Middle East&lt;ref name="Ford Middle East"&gt;[http://www.me.ford.com/en/are/all-vehicles Ford Middle East All Vehicles (English)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ford Mexico"&gt;[http://www.ford.mx/camiones Ford Mexico Trucks (Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt;); along with their larger size and taxes on engine displacement, in global markets, the F-Series were met with a lack of diesel engines (F-150) and factory [[Right- and left-hand traffic|right-hand drive]] capability.&lt;ref name="autoblog_end_of_us_ranger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2010/09/20/u-s-spec-ford-ranger-to-officially-end-production-in-2011-ford/|title=U.S.-spec Ford Ranger to officially end production in 2011, Ford explains why|last=Bowman|first=Zach|publisher=Autoblog|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

After an eight-year market hiatus, Ford introduced the [[Ford Ranger (fourth generation)|fourth generation-Ranger]] for North America for 2019.&lt;ref&gt;https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/01/14/an-american-favorite-reinvented--new-ford-ranger-brings-built-fo.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The first mid-size Ranger sold in North America, the Ranger T6 underwent several design modifications to accommodate US crash standards (and increase its payload), with the 2019 Ranger receiving fully-boxed frame rails.  Externally, the front fascia was restyled to allow for a separate steel front bumper.  All fourth-generation Rangers are built on the Hi-Rider chassis; SuperCab (2+2 doors) and SuperCrew (4 doors) configurations are sold.  Exclusive to North American production, the Ranger is powered by a 270hp 2.3L EcoBoost inline-4, paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission.{{Clear}}

The '''Ford Pinto''' is a [[subcompact car]] that was manufactured and marketed by Ford Motor Company in North America, sold from the 1971 to the 1980 model years.  The smallest American Ford vehicle since 1907, the Pinto was the first subcompact vehicle produced by Ford in North America.

The Pinto was marketed in three body styles through its production: a two-door fastback sedan with a trunk, a three-door hatchback, and a two-door station wagon.  [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] offered rebadged versions of the Pinto as the '''Mercury Bobcat''' from 1975 to 1980 (1974–1980 in Canada&lt;ref&gt;Mays, James C. ''Ford and Canada: 100 Years Together'' (Montréal: Syam Publishing, 2003). p.116.&lt;/ref&gt;). From 1974 to 1978, the [[Ford Mustang (second generation)|Ford Mustang II]] shared a common platform with the Pinto and Bobcat, though with a different unibody and powertrain assortment.  For the 1981 model year, the Pinto was replaced by the [[Ford Escort (North America)|Ford Escort]], as Ford moved its product line towards front-wheel drive. Over 3 million Pintos were produced over its 10-year production run, outproducing the combined totals of its domestic rivals, the Chevy Vega and the AMC Gremlin. The Pinto and Mercury Bobcat were produced at [[Edison Assembly]] 1n Edison, New Jersey, [[St. Thomas Assembly]] in Southwold, Ontario, and [[San Jose Assembly Plant|San Jose Assembly]] in Milpitas, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/03/25/HOG2UHS4701.DTL|title=Lofty ambition / Developer revs up former Ford factory in Richmond for real live-work spaces|last=Smith|first=Charles|date=March 25, 2006|work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Since the 1970s, the safety reputation of the Pinto has been surrounded by controversy.  Its fuel-tank design attracted both media and government scrutiny after several deadly fires related to the tanks rupturing in rear-end collisions. A subsequent analysis of the overall safety of the Pinto suggested it was comparable to other 1970s subcompact cars.  The safety issues surrounding the Pinto and the subsequent response by Ford have been cited widely as a [[business ethics]] as well as [[tort reform]] case study.

==Background==

[[File:Gremlin-Pinto-Vega in 2010.JPG|thumb|left|First-generation American subcompacts, left to right: AMC Gremlin, Ford Pinto, Chevrolet Vega]]

American automakers had first countered imports such as the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] with vehicles [[compact car]]s including the [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]], [[Ford Maverick (Americas)|Ford Maverick]], [[Chevrolet Corvair]] and [[Plymouth Valiant]], although these cars featured six-cylinder engines and comprised a larger vehicle class. As the popularity of smaller Japanese imports from [[Toyota]] and [[Datsun]] increased throughout the 1960s, Ford North America responded by introducing the [[Ford Cortina|Cortina]] from [[Ford of Europe]] as a [[captive import]]. American automakers soon introduced their own subcompacts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=SHEREFKIN|first1=ROBERT|title=Ford 100: Defective Pinto almost took Ford's reputation with it Read more: http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/ford-100-defective-pinto-almost-took-fords-reputation-it#ixzz4wdHFnN3Y|url=http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/ford-100-defective-pinto-almost-took-fords-reputation-it|website=Autoweek|accessdate=October 26, 2017|date=June 17, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  led by the [[AMC Gremlin]], which arrived six months before the Pinto, and the [[Chevrolet Vega]], introduced the day before the Pinto.

Named for the [[Pinto horse|pony]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Ford keeps using horse names for cars|url=https://www.jenningsforddirect.co.uk/car-guides/history-of-ford-cars/why-ford-keeps-using-horse-names-for-cars/5099/|publisher=Jennings Ford Direct|accessdate=October 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Pinto was introduced on September 11, 1970. It was a completely new platform, but utilized a powertrain from the European-specification [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Escort]]. Ford Chairman [[Henry Ford II]] himself purchased a 1971 Runabout (hatchback) to use as one of his personal cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2003}} pages 262–231&lt;/ref&gt;

== Product development ==
[[File:Ford Pinto at Studio 1970 (3597548009).jpg|left|thumb|Ford Pinto design proposal, 1970]]
Initial planning for the Pinto began in the summer of 1967, was recommended by Ford's Product Planning Committee in December 1968, and was approved by Ford's Board of Directors in January 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Danley|2005}}: Initial planning on the Pinto, a second-generation subcompact, began in 1967&amp;nbsp;... In January 1969, in a victory for Iaccoca, Ford's Board approved the recommendation of the Product Planning Committee (December 1968) to produce the Pinto.&lt;/ref&gt; Ford President [[Lee Iacocca]] wanted a 1971 model that weighed under 2,000 pounds and that would be priced at less than [[US$]]2,000. The Pinto product development, from conception through delivery, was completed in 25 months, when the automotive industry average was 43 months, the shortest production planning schedule in automotive history at the time. Some development processes usually conducted sequentially were conducted in parallel. [[Machine tooling]] overlapped with product development, which froze the basic design. Decisions which threatened the schedule were discouraged;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gioia|1992}}: The Pinto was brought from inception to production in the record time of approximately 25 months (compared to the industry average of 43 months), a time frame that suggested the necessity for doing things expediently. In addition to  the time pressure, the engineering and development teams were required to adhere to the production "limits of 2000" for the diminutive car: it was not to exceed either $2000 in cost or 2000 pounds in weight. Any decisions that threatened these targets or the timing of the car's introduction were discouraged. Under normal conditions design, styling, product planning, engineering, etc., were  completed prior to production tooling. Because of the foreshortened time frame, however, some of these usually sequential processes were executed in parallel. As a consequence, tooling was already well under way (thus "freezing" the basic design)&amp;nbsp;...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=md1992&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Helms |first1=Marilyn M. |last2=Hutchins |first2=Betty A. |year=1992 |title=Poor quality products: Is their production unethical? |journal=Management Decision |volume=30 |issue=5 |page=35 |quote=When a decision was made to produce the Pinto, it was given the shortest production planning schedule in history. Tooling went on at the same time as product development so, when testing revealed a serious defect with the gas tank, the $200 million Pinto tooling machines were almost completely built. The directive came from the top, President Lee Iacocca, who emphasized that the Pinto was not to weigh an ounce over 2,000lb and not cost a cent over $2,000 and that safety was not a priority, because "safety doesn't sell". |doi=10.1108/00251749210015661}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wojdyla|2011}}: The genesis of the Ford Pinto came sometime in 1968, when Ford's then-president Lee Iaccoca decided that his company would not sit idly by as new Japanese competitors dominated the small-car segment. He pushed the board to greenlight the Pinto program, and by August 1968 the program was underway. It would have aggressive targets: no more than 2000 pounds, not a penny over $2000 and a delivery deadline of just 25 months, a record at the time and still impressive today.&lt;/ref&gt; the attitude of Ford management was to develop the Pinto as quickly as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wojdyla|2011}}: But at the time, management's attitude was to get the product out the door as fast as possible.&lt;/ref&gt; Iacocca ordered a rush project to build the car, and the Pinto became known internally as "Lee's car".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sherefkin|2003|}}: Iacocca ordered a rush program to build the Pinto&amp;nbsp;... The Pinto quickly became known as "Lee's car." He demanded that it weigh no more than 2,000 pounds and sell for $2,000&amp;nbsp;... Iacocca was in a hurry. He wanted the car in showrooms for the 1971 model year. That meant one of the shortest production planning periods in modern automotive history: just 25 months, when the normal time span was 43 months. That also meant that the Pinto's tooling was developed at the same time as product development.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pinto's bodywork was styled by Robert Eidschun.&lt;ref name=bbw20091030/&gt;

Offered with an [[inline-4]] engine and [[bucket seats]] the Pinto's mechanical design was conventional, with [[unibody]] construction, a longitudinally mounted engine in front driving the rear wheels through either a [[manual transmission|manual]] or [[automatic transmission]] and [[live axle]] rear end. Suspension was by unequal-length [[control arm]]s with front [[coil spring]]s; the live rear axle was suspended on [[leaf spring]]s. The rack and pinion steering optionally had [[Power steering|power assist]], as did the brakes.&lt;ref name="Pinto2000"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pinto 2000 Coupe|url=http://pintopage.fordpinto.com/Pinto%202000%20Coupe.htm|accessdate=April 29, 2016|agency=Super Stock Magazine|date=December 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production history==

On September 11, 1970, Ford introduced the Pinto under the tagline ''The Little Carefree Car.''&lt;ref name=sdcmeet&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HJNYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RPgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5900%2C2733608 |work=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=(Washington) |agency=(advertisement) |title=Meet Ford's new Pinto.

After structural design on alternate body styles encountered obstacles,&lt;ref name="birth"/&gt; Ford offered the Pinto solely as a two-door sedan, with entry level models priced at $1,850, undercutting GM's [[Chevrolet Vega]] and directly targeting imported models&amp;nbsp;– which included such new competitors as the [[Mazda Familia|Mazda 1200]] in 1971, the [[Subaru Leone|Subaru DL]] in 1972, and the [[Honda Civic (first generation)|Honda Civic]] in 1973.&lt;ref name=Motor197008&gt;{{cite magazine|authorlink=Karl Ludvigsen (Charles Bulmer -Ed)|title = Quart in a Pinto|magazine=[[The Motor (magazine)|The Motor]]|volume=3558|pages=26–27|date=August 26, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pinto had sold over 100,000 units by January 1971,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1971-1980-ford-pinto3.htm|title=1971-1980 Ford Pinto|publisher= HowStuffWorks.com|date=2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 352,402 for the entire 1971 production run; 1974 saw the most Pintos produced in a single model year, with 544,209 units.&lt;ref name="Ford 2007"&gt;''Standard Catalog of Ford'', 4th edition, 2007, by John Gunnell.

===1971–1973===
[[File:Ford Pinto (1910839183).jpg|left|thumb|1971–1972 Ford Pinto sedan with enclosed trunk]][[File:Ford Pinto runabout (1).jpg|thumb|1973 Pinto Runabout,&lt;br&gt;noting view of rear hatch]]
The Ford Pinto went on sale on September 11, 1970 in one body style, a fastback sedan with an enclosed trunk.  A hatchback became available on February 20, 1971, debuting at the [[Chicago Auto Show]].&lt;ref name="birth"&gt;{{cite web|title = Birth of the Ford Pinto | publisher = Howstuffworks.com | url = http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1971-1980-ford-pinto.htm/printable| date = 2007-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, the Pinto brochure came with a paper cutout Pinto that one could fold to make a 3D model.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures.com"/&gt; Marketed as the ''Runabout,'' the hatchback went on sale five days later, priced at $2,062.&lt;ref name="birth"/&gt; The hatch itself featured exposed chrome hinges for the liftgate and five decorative chrome strips, pneumatic struts to assist in opening the hatch, a rear window approximately as large as the sedan's, and a fold-down seat&amp;nbsp;– a feature which became simultaneously an option on the sedan. The hatchback model matched the sedan in all other dimensions and offered {{convert|38.1|cuft|m3}} of cargo space with its seat folded.&lt;ref name="birth"/&gt; By 1972, Ford redesigned the hatch itself, with the glass portion of the hatch enlarged to almost the entire size of the hatch itself, ultimately to be supplemented for 1977–1980  with an optional rear hatch that was entirely glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/40/f2/60/40f2609e7d16248e91a8a72ae8715d90--ford-pinto-ford-maverick.jpg|title=1980 Ford Pinto Brochure|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 30, 1970, less than two months after introduction, 26,000 Pintos were recalled to address a possible problem with the accelerator sticking on once engaged at more than halfway.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1978}}: Soon after the Pinto was introduced, 26,000 were recalled because accelerators were sticking.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ford Recalls 26,000 Pinto Cars |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=October 31, 1970 |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1970/10/31/page/10/article/ford-recalls-26-000-pinto-cars |accessdate=March 6, 2016 |quote=Ford Motor Co. announced today it is recalling 26,000 early production models of its 1971 Pinto equipped with the 1600 cubic centimeter engine because of an accelerator problem&amp;nbsp;...

On February 24, 1972,&lt;ref name="birth"/&gt; the Pinto station wagon debuted with an overall length of {{convert|172.7|in|mm|abbr=on}} and {{convert|60.5|cuft|m3}} of cargo volume.&lt;ref name="birth"/&gt; The first 2-door Ford station wagon since the 1965 Falcon, the Pinto wagon was equipped with flip-open rear quarter windows.  Along with front disc brakes, the 2.0L engine was standard equipment. A ''Pinto Squire'' wagon featured faux wood side paneling similar to the full-size [[Ford Country Squire|Country Squire]].&lt;ref&gt;http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---May/1972-Ford-Pinto-Brochure-Rev/1972-Ford-Pinto-Rev--08-09&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1972 Ford (USA) Pinto Station Wagon|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/make/ford_usa/pinto/pinto_station_wagon/1972.html|publisher=automobile-catalog.com|accessdate=October 26, 2017 |editor=Pawel Zal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in February 1972, the Sprint Decor Group was made available for the Pinto for one model year only. The Sprint Decor Group included white exterior paint with blue accent paint and red pin-striping, a blacked out grille,&amp;nbsp;color-keyed wheels with bright trim rings and hubcaps, white sidewall tires and color-keyed dual sport mirrors. The interior included red, white and blue cloth and vinyl bucket seats, full carpeting and a deluxe steering wheel. The Sprint Decor Group was offered simultaneously on the Maverick and Mustang.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pintopage.fordpinto.com/72%20Pinto%20Sprint%20Package.htm|title=1972 Ford Pinto Sprint|access-date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For the 1973 model year, more appearance options were offered. There was a new Sport Accent Group offered in white exterior paint with a choice of two-tone orange or avocado accent paint, matching vinyl roof and a deluxe interior with wood-tone trim. There was also a new Luxury Decor Group with bright exterior dress up mouldings, black bumper rub strips and deluxe interior with wood-tone trim. New slotted forged aluminum wheels were offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1973_Ford/1973%20Ford%20Pinto%20Brochure/index1.html|title=1973 Ford Pinto Brochure|access-date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1974–1978===
[[File:1974 Ford Pinto two-door wagon, rear left.jpg|left|thumb|1974 Ford Pinto station wagon]]
In 1974, to meet federal regulations, [[5 mph bumper]]s were added to both the front and rear.  Unlike most 1970s cars, the addition of larger bumpers to the Pinto did not necessitate major changes to the bodywork.  While the underpowered Kent engine was dropped, the optional OHC engine was expanded to 2.3L; in various forms this engine powered a variety of Ford vehicles for 23 years.  In 1974, Mercury began selling a rebadged version of the Pinto called Bobcat as a Canada-only model. 544,209 units sold; 1974 became the most popular model year for the Pinto.&lt;ref name="Ford 2007"/&gt; Steel-belted tires, an anti-theft alarm system, and metallic glow paint were optional.&lt;ref&gt;http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---March/1974-Ford-Pinto-Brochure-Rev/1974-Ford-Pinto-Rev--10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, in a move to better compete with the AMC Gremlin, Ford introduced the 2.8L V6; while far less powerful than the Gremlin, the V6 gave the Pinto a feature unavailable in the Chevrolet Vega.  Sales of the Mercury Bobcat were expanded to Lincoln-Mercury dealers in the United States; it was sold as a hatchback and station wagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2003}} pages 286-290&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1976 Ford Pinto (9912822385).jpg|thumb|1976 Ford Pinto Runabout]]

As a minor styling update for 1976, the Pinto received the egg-crate grille and chrome headlamp bezels recycled from the Canada-only 1974 Mercury Bobcat. For one model year only, two new option packages were offered. One was the sporty new Stallion appearance package with black out trim and black two-tone accent paint offered in red, yellow, silver and white body colors. This option package was shared with the Mustang II and Maverick. The other new option package was the Runabout Squire which featured wood-grain vinyl bodysides like the Squire wagon. The interior received the optional Luxury Decor Group which featured new low back vinyl or plaid cloth bucket seats with matching door trim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://paintref.com/cgi-bin/brochuredisplay.cgi?year=1976&amp;manuf=Ford&amp;model=Pinto&amp;smod=&amp;page=1&amp;scan=1|title=1976 Ford Pinto Brochure|last=|first=|date=|website=Paintref.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Turbo Pinto (14430994634).jpg|thumb|1977–1978 Ford Pinto Runabout with optional all glass hatch]]
For the 1977 model year, the Pinto received its first significant styling updates with slanted back urethane headlamp buckets, parking lamps  and grille. The tail-lamps were revised except for the wagons. Runabouts offered an optional all glass rear hatch for the first time. Pinto wagons were given a new option package. Dubbed the ''Pinto Cruising Wagon'', it was the [[sedan delivery]] version of the Pinto styled to resemble a small [[conversion van]], complete with round side panel "bubble windows" and a choice of optional vinyl graphics.&lt;ref name="Lewis 2003"&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2003}} pages 289-303&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford offered new sporty appearance packages similar to those found on the Chevrolet Vega and AMC Gremlin but were strictly cosmetic upgrades that added nothing to vehicle performance.&lt;ref name="Lewis 2003"/&gt;

In 1978, the Pinto was no longer the smallest Ford sold in the U.S., as the company introduced the [[Ford Fiesta|Fiesta]].  Nearly two feet shorter than the Pinto, the German-designed Fiesta was the first front-wheel drive car sold by Ford in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2003}} pages 304-309&lt;/ref&gt;

===1979–1980===

For the 1979 model year, the Pinto saw its last significant styling update.  Shedding its original Maverick-like styling, the Pinto took on the look of the modern Fairmont with rectangular headlamps, inboard vertical parking lamps and a taller slanted back grille. Except for the wagons, the tail-lamps were revised. The interior was updated with a new rectangular instrument cluster and modified dash-pad for vehicles without the  optional sports instrumentation. The variety of sports appearance packages was revised, some with new graphics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2003}} pages 310-315&lt;/ref&gt;

1980 marked the end of the Pinto's production run.  For 1980, the V6 engine was discontinued, leaving the 2.3L as the sole engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lamm|first1=Michael|title=PM Owners Report: Ford Pinto|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TM8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=mercury%20bobcat%201974&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q=mercury%20bobcat%201974&amp;f=false|work=Popular Mechanics|agency=Popular Mechanics Magazine|date=August 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ford Pinto|url=http://pintopage.fordpinto.com/Production%20Figures.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powertrain==
Except for 1980, the Pinto was available with a choice of two engines. For the first five years of production, only four-cylinder inline engines were offered. Ford changed the power ratings almost every year.&lt;ref name="catalog"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gunnell, John A.  |author2=Lenzke, James T.|year=1995|title=Standard Catalog of Ford Cars, 1903–1990|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=0-87341-140-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, the {{convert|2.3|l|cuin}} ''[[Ford Pinto engine#2.3 OHC|OHC]]'' I4 engine was introduced. This engine was updated and modified several times, allowing it to remain in production into 1997. Among other Ford vehicles, a turbocharged version of this engine later powered the performance-based [[Ford Thunderbird#Ninth generation (1983–1988)|Thunderbird Turbo Coupe]], [[Ford Mustang SVO|Mustang SVO]], and the European-built [[Merkur XR4Ti]].&lt;ref name="catalog"/&gt;

Initial Pinto deliveries in the early years used the English {{convert|1600|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} and German {{convert|2000|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} engines tuned for performance (see below). The 2,000&amp;nbsp;cc engine used a two-barrel carburetor where just one bore was bigger than that used on the Maverick. With the low weight (not much above {{convert|2000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}) and the SOHC engine it accelerated from 0 to 60mph in 10.8 seconds. With the advent of emission control requirements, Ford moved from European-sourced to domestically-sourced engines, using new or modified designs. New safety legislation affected bumpers and other parts, adding to the weight of the car and reducing performance.  [[Horsepower#Society of Automotive Engineers|Revised SAE standards]] in 1972 dropped the Pinto's {{convert|1.6|l|cuin|abbr=on}} engine to {{convert|54|bhp|kW|abbr=on}}&amp;nbsp;– and the {{convert|2.0|l|cuin|abbr=on}} engine to {{convert|86|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1971-1980-ford-pinto.htm|title=HowStuffWorks "The Birth of the Ford Pinto"|author1=THE AUTO EDITORS OF CONSUMER GUIDE|publisher=How Stuff Works|date=2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mercury Bobcat (1974–1980)==
[[File:Mercury Bobcat Runabout 1978 (15482996372).jpg|thumb|1975–1978 Mercury Bobcat Runabout]]

Lincoln-Mercury dealers marketed a [[badge engineering|rebadged variant]] of the Pinto, as the Mercury Bobcat, beginning with model year 1974 in Canada produced in all of the same body styles. It was styled with a unique egg-crate grille and chrome headlamp bezels. The rear featured modified double width tail-lamps for sedan and Runabout models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.autolit.com/Store/1974-mercury-bobcat-brochure-canada.html|title=1974 Mercury Bobcat Brochure Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1975, the Bobcat was added to the U.S. market and sold initially in upgraded levels of trim as the Runabout hatchback and Villager wagon. Lesser-trimmed versions were offered in subsequent model years. The Bobcat was never offered as a two-door sedan with an enclosed trunk for the U.S. market. All Bobcats were restyled with a domed hood and a taller vertical bar grille styled to look like senior Mercury models. Throughout all the model years Bobcats were given various appearance options similar to the Pinto's. 

[[File:Mercury Bobcat Pincat.JPG|thumb|1979–1980 Mercury Bobcat Runabout]]

For 1979, the Bobcat received a major restyling featuring a slanted back front end with rectangular headlamps and a larger vertical bar grille. Except for the wagons, the tail-lamps were revised. The base instrument cluster received a new rectangular design with a modified dash pad.

Production of the Bobcat ended in 1980 to make way for its replacement, the [[Mercury Lynx]]. In total, 224,026 Bobcats were produced from 1975 to 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flory|first1=J.

==Reception and criticism==
Upon release the Pinto was received with both positive and negative reviews.  ''[[Road &amp; Track]]'' faulted the suspension and standard [[drum brake]]s, calling the latter a "serious deficiency", but praised the proven 1.6&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Ford Kent engine|Kent]]'' engine, adapted from European Fords. The larger ''[[GM 2300 engine|2300]] inline-4'' found in the Chevrolet Vega was an innovative, brand new design using an aluminum alloy block and iron head, but needed more development work as initially released. ''Super Stock Magazine'' found the fit and finish to be "superior" and were impressed with the car overall.&lt;ref name=Pinto2000/&gt;  ''[[Car and Driver]]'' found the Pinto, when equipped with the larger 2.0L engine and front disc brakes, to be a nimble and powerful commuter car with good visibility and sports-car feel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chevrolet Vega vs Ford Pinto|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/chevrolet-vega-vs-ford-pinto-archived-comparison|accessdate=April 12, 2016|work=Car and Driver Magazine|date=Nov 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A review of the 1974 Pinto with an automatic transmission by ''Car and Driver'' was not as favorable noting significant decreases in mileage and acceleration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ford Pinto Runabout: The secret to small-car success cannot be found in an options list |url=http://pintopage.fordpinto.com/Road%20Test.htm|work=Car and Driver Magazine|date=June 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy surrounding the Pinto has resulted in inclusion in retrospective automotive lists.  In 2004, ''[[Forbes magazine|Forbes]]'' included the Pinto among its fourteen ''Worst Cars of All Time,'' saying "When people talk about how bad American small cars created an opportunity for the Japanese to come in and clean house in the 1970s and '80s, they are referring to vehicles like this."&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web |title=The worst cars of all time |magazine=[[Forbes]] |first=Dan |last=Lienert |url=https://www.forbes.com/2004/01/23/cx_dl_0126featslide_7.html |date=January 27, 2004 |accessdate=March 6, 2016 |quote="You don't want to talk about the Pinto," said a Ford official. "Leave that one in the cemetery." Apparently, Ford has not forgotten the lawsuits and the public relations disasters forged by its Pinto hatchback and sedan. The Pinto's famous safety flaw, of course, was that it was prone to blowing up if rear-ended. When people talk about how bad American small cars created an opportunity for the Japanese to come in and clean house in the 1970s and '80s, they are referring to vehicles like this (and see Chevrolet Vega, second slide).}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] included the Pinto in ''The Fifty Worst Cars of All Time'', citing the Pinto's "rather volatile nature. The car tended to erupt in flame in rear-end collisions."&lt;ref name=time20070907&gt;{{cite news |last=Neil |first=Dan |authorlink=Dan Neil |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1658545_1658498_1657866,00.html |title=1971 Ford Pinto – The 50 Worst Cars of All Time|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=September 7, 2007 |quote=Of course the Pinto goes on the Worst list, but not because it was a particularly bad car — not particularly — but because it had a rather volatile nature.

Conclusion? Let 'em burn.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fuel system fires, recalls, and litigation ==

The safety of the design of the Pinto's fuel system led to critical incidents and subsequently resulted in a recall, lawsuits, a criminal prosecution, and public controversy.  The events surrounding the controversy have been described as a "landmark narrative".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: The Pinto story has become a landmark narrative" (Nichols 1997:324), a definitive story used to support the construction of amoral corporate behavior as a pervasive social problem. This narrative was first stated publicly by investigative journalist Mark Dowie (1977) in a scathing Pulitzer Prize-winning exposé, "Pinto Madness," published in ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;  Former UCLA law professor Gary T. Schwartz describes the associated legal case as "mythical" due to several significant factual misconceptions and their impact on the public's understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}: Having reflected on these invocations of the Ford Pinto case, I have arrived at two general observations. One is that several significant factual misconceptions surround the public's understanding of the case. Given the cumulative force of these misconceptions, the case can be properly referred to as "mythical."&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ford Pinto has been cited and debated in numerous business ethics&lt;ref name="Bazerman"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ethical Breakdowns |work=[[Harvard Business Review]] |first1=Max H.|last1=Bazerman|first2=Ann E.|last2=Tenbrunsel |url=https://hbr.org/2011/04/ethical-breakdowns |accessdate= February 28, 2015 |date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Douglas Birsch"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ford Pinto Case|date=October 25, 1994 |first=Douglas|last=Birsch}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[tort reform]]&lt;ref name="tort"&gt;{{cite news| title = Case: Lee Iacocca's Pinto: A fiery failure
|newspaper = [[USA Today]]| first=Chris| last=Woodyard| date=March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kitman"&gt;{{cite news| title = Don't Like Government Regulation? How'd You Like Another Pinto?| publisher = Cartalk.com| first=Jamie| last=Kitman| date=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; case studies.

The placement of the car's fuel tank was the result of both conservative industry practice of the time as well the uncertain regulatory environment during the development and early sales periods of the car.  Ford was accused of knowing the car had an unsafe tank placement then forgoing design changes based on an internal cost-benefit analysis.  Two landmark legal cases, ''[[Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.]]'' and ''[[Indiana v. Ford Motor Co.]]'', resulted from fatal accidents involving Pintos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: Conventional wisdom holds that Ford Motor Company decided to rush the Pinto into production in 1970 to compete with compact foreign imports, despite internal pre-production tests that showed gas tank ruptures in low-speed rear-end collisions would produce deadly fires.  This decision purportedly derived from an infamous seven-page cost-benefit analysis (the "Grush/Saunby Report" [1973]) that valued human lives at $200,000.  Settling burn victims' lawsuits would have cost $49.5 million, far less than the $137 million needed to make minor corrections.  According to this account, the company made an informed, cynical, and impressively coordinated decision that "payouts" (Kelman and Hamilton 1989:311) to families of burn victims were more cost-effective than improving fuel tank integrity.  This description provides the unambiguous foundation on which the media and academics have built a Pinto gas tank decision-making narrative.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholarly work published in the decades after the Pinto's release have examined the cases and offered summations of the general understanding of the Pinto and the controversy regarding the car's safety performance and risk of fire.  These works also reviewed misunderstandings related to the actual number of fire related deaths related to the fuel system design, "wild and unsupported claims asserted in ''Pinto Madness'' and elsewhere",&lt;ref name="Danley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Danley|first1=John R|title=Polishing Up the Pinto: Legal Liability, Moral Blame, and Risk|journal=Business Ethics Quarterly|date=2005|volume=15|issue=2|pages=205–236|doi=10.5840/beq200515211}}&lt;/ref&gt; the facts of the related legal cases, ''Grimshaw vs Ford Motor Company'' and ''State of Indiana vs Ford Motor Company'', the applicable safety standards at the time of design, and the nature of the NHTSA investigations and subsequent vehicle recalls.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuel system design===
The design of the Pinto fuel system was complicated by the uncertain regulatory environment during the development period.  The first federal standard for automotive fuel system safety, passed in 1967, known as Section 301 in the [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards]], initially only considered front impacts.  In January 1969, 18 months into the Pinto's development cycle, the NHTSA proposed expanding the standard to cover rear-end collisions.  The proposed standard was based on a 20&amp;nbsp;mph moving-barrier rear impact test. Ford publicly announced it supported the standard. In August 1970, the month the Pinto went into production, the NHTSA changed the proposal to a more stringent 20&amp;nbsp;mph fixed-barrier standard which car companies were to meet in 18 months. The fixed-barrier standard was seen by the auto industry as a significant increase in test severity. At the same time the NHTSA announced a long-term goal of setting a 30-mph fixed-barrier standard.&lt;ref name=Rossow&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rossow |first1=Mark |title=Ethics: An Alternative Account of the Ford Pinto Case|publisher=Continuing Education and Development Inc. |date=2015 |quote='Fixed-barrier' meant that the vehicle was moving (towed backwards) into a stationary barrier&amp;nbsp;... The 20-mph fixed barrier standard was greeted with uniform opposition from the auto industry because it was a much more severe test than the moving-barrier standard.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: pg 36, 43&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the confusion related to the various proposed standards and an expectation that the NHTSA would not select the more stringent 30&amp;nbsp;mph fixed-barrier standard, Ford elected to voluntarily meet the 20&amp;nbsp;mph moving-barrier standard for all cars by 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: In the design stage (1967–1970), no company or government standard on rear-end fuel tank integrity existed to guide the engineers, but their actions were consistent with the taken for granted, industry-wide tradition of building lower levels of [[crashworthiness]] into small cars. This situation changed in the marketing stage (post 1970). Shortly after the 1971 model year Pintos were released, Ford adopted an internal20 mile-per-hour moving barrier standard for the 1973 model year-the only manufacturer to do so (Gioia 1996; Strobel 1994). The extant legal/regulatory environment reinforced engineers' beliefs that this standard was quite reasonable" since it was the "same one recommended at that time by the federal General Services Administration; the Canadian equivalent of the GSA; the Society of Automotive Engineers; and a private consulting firm hired by NHTSA&amp;nbsp;..." and by NHTSA itself in 1969 (Strobel 1980:205). This standard would constrain future debates by certifying the Pinto as safe" to Ford's subunit charged with evaluating potential recallable safety problems.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}:In August 1970, 1971 model-year Pintos began coming off the assembly line. Just a few days later, NHTSA-which had never acted on its earlier proposal-advanced a more demanding set of proposed regulations. Three months later, Ford officials decided that for purposes of the 1973 model year, Ford would adopt, as its own internal objective, the regulations that NHTSA had suggested in 1969. In order to respond to NHTSA's more recent proposal, Ford engineers, with actual Pintos now available, stepped up the crash-testing process, and identified a. number of design modifications that might imp:rove the Pinto's performance. In October 1971, Ford officials decided against incorporating any of these modifications into current Pintos; rather, it would wait until NHTSA clarified its position. In 1973, NHTSA promulgated its fuel-tank standard but ruled that this standard would apply only to 1977 models.  Ford adopted a 20&amp;nbsp;mph moving-barrier standard for all 1973 cars.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ford and other automobile manufacturers objected to the more stringent fuel system safety standard and filed objections during the required comment periods of the proposed regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Strobel|1979}}: Ford then joined other automakers in an aggressive lobbying campaign that was successful in delaying and softening proposed federal standards on how strong fuel systems must be to resist rupture an potential explosion.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pinto's design positioned its fuel tank between the rear axle and the rear bumper, a standard practice in US subcompact cars at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gioia|1992}}: The tank was positioned between the rear bumper and the rear axle (a standard industry practice for the time).&lt;/ref&gt; The Pinto's vulnerability to fuel leakage and fire in a rear-end collision was exacerbated by reduced rear "crush space", a lack of structural reinforcement in the rear, and an "essentially ornamental" rear bumper (though similar to other manufacturers).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}:Page 1015 and Footnote 9, "The court of appeal opinion referred to the Pinto's bumper as the flimsiest of any American car. Grimshaw, 119 Cal. App. 3d at 774, 174 Cal. Rptr. at 360. Mark Robinson, Jr., co-counsel for the plaintiffs, is emphatic that this reference is correct. Telephone interview with Mark Robinson, Jr. (Sept. 12, 1990) [hereinafter Robinson Interview). In the later criminal case, however, Byron Bloch, a prosecution witness, stated in cross-examination that the Pinto's bumper was about the same as those of the Gremlin, Vega, and Dodge Colt. See L. STROBEL, supra note 5, at 157 ("I would say they were all bad.")."&lt;/ref&gt;  Crash testing, conducted in 1970 with modified Ford Mavericks, as part of a response to NHTSA proposed regulations, demonstrated vulnerability at fairly low crash speeds.  Design changes were made, but post-launch tests showed similar results.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Danley|2005}}: A few months later Ford began crash-testing modified Mavericks in part to prepare a response to NHTSA's proposed regulations.  The results demonstrated vulnerability of fuel-integrity at fairly low speeds and some modifications were made. In August of 1970, the first model year Pinto, the 1971, went into production. Post-production testing revealed similar results. Still, there were no federal performance standards at the time and the proposed regulations addressed only front-end collisions.&lt;/ref&gt; These tests were conducted to develop crash testing standards rather than specifically investigating fuel system integrity.  Though Ford engineers were not pleased with the car's performance, no reports of the time indicate particular concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: engineers in the design stage were still trying "to find out how to conduct crash tests" (Feaheny 1997; see also Lacey 1986:613). For example, an internal Pinto test report dated November, 1970 listed as its objective "To develop a test procedure to be used to provide baseline data on vehicle fuel system integrity" (NHTSA C7-38-Al.5, Final Test Report #T-0738). In this test, a Pinto sedan exhibited "excessive fuel tank leakage" when towed rearward into a fixed barrier at 21.5 miles per hour, considered roughly equivalent to a car-to-car impact at 35 miles per hour.  Nothing in this, or any other, Ford test report indicates that participants felt cause for concern or organizational action. Although some Ford engineers were not especially pleased, they felt that the data were inconclusive or the risks acceptable (Feaheny 1997; Strobel 1980), or they kept their concerns to themselves (Camps 1997). Some felt that cars would rarely be subjected to the extreme forces generated in a fixed-barrier test in real-world collisions (Feaheny 1997; Devine 1996). NHTSA apparently agreed and ultimately replaced the proposed fixedbarrier test with a less-stringent moving-barrier test in its final standard (U.S. Department of Transportation 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;
Ford also tested several different vehicle modifications which could improve rear impact performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gioia|1992}}: Ford had in fact crash-tested 11 vehicles; 8 of these cars suffered potentially catastrophic gas tank ruptures. The only 3 cars that survived intact had each been modified in some way to protect the tank.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the engineer's occupational caution and aversion to "unproven" solutions as well as a view that the crash test results were inconclusive resulted in the use of a conventional fuel tank design and placement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: Occupational caution encouraged engineers to view many design adjustments that improved test performance as "unproven" in real-world accidents (Devine 1996; Feaheny 1997; Schwartz 1991; Strickland 1996; Strobel 1980). Engineers, who typically value "uncertainty avoidance" (Allison 1971:72 ), chose to stick with an existing design rather than face uncertainties associated with novel ones (Devine 1996; Strobel 1980). One series of tests, for instance, showed that Pintos equipped with pliable foam-like gas tanks would not leak in 30 mile-per-hour crashes. But some engineers feared that such a tank might melt and disagreed with others who felt it was safer than the existing metal design (Devine 1996, see also Strobel
1980). Other engineers believed that rubber bladders improved performance in tests, but anticipated problems under real-world conditions (Strobel 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}: As for additional design proposals brought forward by the plaintiffs, several of them-for example, a bladder within the gas tank, and a "tank within the tank"-concerned somewhat innovative technology that had never been utilized in actual auto production. At trial, there was testimony that a bladder would have been feasible in the early 1970s, but also rebuttal testimony that a bladder was at this time beyond the bounds of feasibility.&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of an above-the-axle tank location was considered safer by some, but not all, at Ford.  This placement was not a viable option for the hatchback and station wagon body styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: Ford whistle-blower Harley Copp's argument-that the Pinto would have been safer had its
gas tank been placed above the axle rather than behind it-is often cited in Pinto narratives as an example of safety being sacrificed to profits, or at least trunk space, in the design stage (Cullen, Maakestad and Cavender 1987; Dowie 1977; Strobel1994). Yet Copp did not reach this conclusion until 1977 (Strobel1980). And other engineers were considerably less certain about it, even though the above-the-axle design did perform better in one set of crash tests. The engineer overseeing the Pinto's design, Harold MacDonald (whose father died in a fuel tank fire when his Model A Ford exploded after a frontal collision with a tree), felt that the above-the axle placement was less safe under real-world conditions because the tank was closer to the passenger compartment and more likely to be punctured by items in the trunk (Strobel1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1973, field reports of Ford Pintos consumed by fire after low-speed rear-end collisions were received by Ford's recall coordinator office.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gioia|1992}}: I began to construct my own files of incoming safety problems. One of these new files concerned reports of Pintos "lighting up"  (in the words of a field representative) in rear-end accidents. There were actually very few reports, perhaps because component failure was not initially assumed. These cars simply were consumed by fire after apparently very low speed accidents.&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on standard procedures used to evaluate field reports, Ford's internal recall evaluation group twice reviewed the field data and found no actionable issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: When Gioia became Recall Coordinator, he inherited about 100 active recall campaigns, half of them safety-related. As with most jobs, the enormous workload required him to use standard operating procedures" (SOPs) to organize and manage information for decision making (d. Kriesberg 1976:1102). SOPs increase organizational efficiency by operating as cognitive scripts that transform decision-making opportunities into largely predetermined action patterns. Existing SOPs required that, to be "recallable," problems needed either high frequency or a directly traceable causal link to a design defect. When reports began to trickle in to Gioia that Pintos were "lighting up" in relatively low speed accidents, and after viewing the burned wreckage of a Pinto, he initiated a meeting to determine if this represented a recallable problem. His work group voted unanimously not to recall the Pinto because the weak data did not meet SOP criteria (Gioia 1996). The work group was unaware of any cost-benefit analyses or Pinto crash test results. Reports of Pinto fires continued to trickle in, and eventually Gioia did become aware of, and concerned about, the crash test results. Again he wondered if the Pinto had a recallable problem, so he initiated a second meeting to convince his co-workers that crash tests showed a possible design flaw. But others again saw no design flaws—after all, the Pinto met internal company standards, and no contradictory external standard existed. The work group conceived the tank leak "problem" not as a defect, but as a fundamental and unalterable design feature: the car's small size, the use of light metals, and unibody construction produced a tendency for Pintos (and others in its class) to "crush up like an accordion" in rear-end collisions (Gioia 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cost–benefit analysis, the Pinto Memo ===

In 1973, Ford's Environmental and Safety Engineering division developed a [[cost–benefit analysis]] entitled ''Fatalities Associated with Crash Induced Fuel Leakage and Fires'' for submission to the NHTSA in support of Ford's objection to proposed stronger fuel system regulation.&lt;ref name=PintoMemo&gt;{{cite report |title=Fatalities Associated With Crash Induced Fuel Leakage and Fires |first1=E.S. |last1=Grush |first2=C.S. |last2=Saundy |publisher=Ford Environmental and Safety Engineering |url=http://www.autosafety.org/wp-content/uploads/import/phpq3mJ7F_FordMemo.pdf |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document became known as the "Pinto Memo".  Cost–benefit analysis was one tool used in the evaluation of safety design decisions accepted by the industry and the NHTSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gioia|1992}}: The National Highway Traffic Safety Association (NHTSA, a federal agency) had approved the use of cost-benefit analysis as an appropriate means for establishing automotive safety design standards.&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis compared the cost of repairs to the societal costs for injuries and deaths related to fires in cases of vehicle rollovers for all cars sold in the US by all manufacturers.  The values assigned to serious burn injuries and loss of life were based on values calculated by NHTSA in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Danley|2005}}: In calculating the benefits, the analysis used a figure of $200,000 per life.  NHTSA had developed this figure in 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the memo Ford estimated the cost of fuel system modifications to reduce fire risks in rollover events to be $11 per car across 12.5 million cars and light trucks (all manufacturers), for a total of $137 million.  The design changes were estimated to save 180 burn deaths and 180 serious injuries per year, a benefit to society of $49.5 million.

In August 1977, having been provided with a copy of the memo by ''[[Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.]]'' plaintiffs before trial,&lt;ref name=Frank&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frank|first1=Ted|title=Rollover Economics: Arbitrary and Capricious Product Liability Regimes|work=American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: Based on information given to it by lawyers preparing cases against Ford, the Center for Auto Safety petitioned NHTSA in the mid-1970s to investigate the Pinto's rear-end design. According to material presented on the Center's website, Dowie's article is based on that information, made available to him by the Center (www.autosafety.org). "Pinto Madness" is still available on the ''Mother Jones'' website along with a video clip showing a Pinto catching fire after being rear-ended. In an interview with Gary T. Schwartz of the ''[[Rutgers Law Review]]'', Copp asserted that he was also a major source of the information for the ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' story, Schwartz, "The Myth of the Ford Pinto Case," 1027, n.53&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Dowie's investigative article "Pinto Madness", published in ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' magazine, emphasized the emotional aspects of the Grush–Saundy memo and implied Ford was callously trading lives for profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}:The Mother Jones article is suffused with an outrage at companies that apply a pernicious cost-benefit analysis in order to achieve "corporate profits".&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mother Jones'' article also erroneously claimed that somewhere between 500 and 900 persons had been killed in fires attributed to the Pinto's unique design features.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}: According to the Mother Jones article, as of 1977, somewhere between 500 and 900 persons had been killed in fires attributed to the Pinto's unique design features&lt;/ref&gt;

The public understanding of the cost–benefit analysis has contributed to the mythology of the Ford Pinto case.  ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine said the memo was one of the automotive industry's "most notorious paper trails."&lt;ref name=time20070907/&gt; A common misconception is that the document considered Ford's tort liability costs rather than the generalized cost to society and applied to the annual sales of all passenger cars, not just Ford vehicles. The general misunderstanding of the document, as presented by ''Mother Jones,'' gave it an operational significance it never had.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}:To sum up, the Ford document has been assigned an operational significance that it never possessed, and has been condemned as unethical on account of characterizations of the document that are in significant part unwarranted. Of course, the condemnation of Ford's report is linked to the condemnation imposed by the public on the Pinto itself. The common belief is that the Pinto, on account of its fuel-tank design, was a "firetrap." The Mother Jones article derived emotional power from its presentation of the Pinto as a "firetrap,'' a "death trap," and a "lethal car."47 The combination of that article, the verdict in the Ford Pinto case, the NHTSA initial determination, and the Pinto recall clearly conveyed this sense of the Pinto-as-firetrap to the general public.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: Dowie (1977) accurately explains in part of his Mother Jones article that Ford employees wrote this document as part of an ongoing lobbying effort to influence NHTSA (24, 28). But his readers have relied exclusively on his other claim, that it was the "internal" (20, 24) memo on which Ford based its decision to market the dangerous Pinto and settle the few inevitable lawsuits (31).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NHTSA investigation ===

In April 1974, the [[Center for Auto Safety]] petitioned the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) to recall Ford Pintos to address  fuel system design defects after reports from attorneys of three deaths and four serious injuries in rear-end collisions at moderate speeds.&lt;ref name=Graham&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graham|first1=John D.|editor1-last=Huber|editor1-first=Peter W.|editor2-last=Litan|editor2-first=Robert E.|title=Does liability promote the safety of motor vehicles?|journal=The Liability Maze: The Impact of Liability Rules on Innovation and Safety|date=1991|page=132|publisher=Brookings Institution|location=Washington DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Business Ethics: A Stakeholder and Issues Management Approach |first=Joseph W. |last=Weiss |publisher=Berrett-Koehler Publishers |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-62656-141-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NHTSA found there was not enough evidence to warrant a defect investigation.&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}:pg 41&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 1977, Dowie's "Pinto Madness" article was published, leveling a series of accusations against Ford, the Pinto and the NHTSA. These included that Ford knew the Pinto was a "firetrap", and said that Ford did not implement design changes because Ford's cost–benefit analysis document showed that paying out millions in damages in lawsuits was more profitable than the design changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dowie|1977}}: Ford knows the Pinto is a firetrap, yet it has paid out millions to settle damage suits out of court, and it is prepared to spend millions more lobbying against safety standards&amp;nbsp;... Ford waited eight years because its internal "cost-benefit analysis," which places a dollar value on human life, said it wasn't profitable to make the changes sooner.&lt;/ref&gt;  The day after the article's release consumer advocate [[Ralph Nader]] and the author of the ''Mother Jones'' article held a news conference in Washington DC on the alleged dangers of the Pinto's design.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dardis|Zent|1982}}: On August 10, 1977, Ralph Nader and Mark Dowie held a press conference to notify the public that unnecessary deaths and injuries were being suffered as a result of the faulty design of the pre-1977 model year Pinto.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the same day, Nader and the Center for Auto Safety re-submitted their petition to the NHTSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Center for Auto Safety|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwartz in a ''[[Rutgers Law Review]]'' article said the NHTSA investigation of the Pinto was in response to consumer complaints and noted the ''Mother Jones'' article included a clip out "coupon" that readers could mail to the NHTSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}:Pg 1019, Schwartz noted, "The Mother Jones article had encouraged consumers to write to NHTSA and demand a recall of earlier Pintos. Responding to the wave of consumer complaints it received, NHTSA began a recall proceeding relating to 1971–1976 Pintos." Also see footnote 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Lee and Ermann note that the ''Mother Jones'' labeling of the Pinto as a "firetrap" and accusations that the NHTSA was buckling to industry pressure as well as the public interest created by sensationalized new stories "forced a second Pinto investigation and guaranteed that the NHTSA would be under the microscope for its duration."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}:By 1977, the social context had changed. Dowie's (1977:18) article had labeled the Pinto a "firetrap" and accused the agency of buckling to auto-industry pressure. Public interest generated by the article forced a second Pinto investigation and guaranteed that NHTSA would be under a microscope for its duration.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 11, 1977, the day after the Nader and ''Mother Jones'' press conference, the NHTSA initiated an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dardis|Zent|1982}}: On August 11, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) began an investigation of the claims.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 8, 1978, the NHTSA informed Ford of their determination that the Pinto fuel system was defective.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1978}}: But NHTSA, a Department of Transportation agency, informed Ford on May 8 about results of the new investigation, which concluded that Pintos had a safety defect.&lt;/ref&gt; The NHTSA concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;1971–1976 Ford Pintos have experienced moderate speed, rear-end collisions that have resulted in fuel tank damage, fuel leakage, and fire occurrences that have resulted in fatalities and non-fatal burn injuries&amp;nbsp;... The fuel tank design and structural characteristics of the 1975–1976 Mercury Bobcat which render it identical to contemporary Pinto vehicles, also render it subject to like consequences in rear impact collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dardis|Zent|1982}}: In May 1978, NHTSA determined that pre-1977 model year Ford Pintos were subject to "fuel tank damage, Fuel leakage and fire occurrences which had resulted in fatalities and non-fatal burn injuries" when impacted at "moderate speeds," and that the "fire threshold" in those vehicles was reached at closing speeds of 30–35 MPH.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Investigative Report: Alleged Fuel Tank and Filler Neck Damage in Rear-end Collisions of Subcompact Cars Passenger Cars, 1971–1976 Ford Pinto, 1975–1976 Mercury Bobcat |publisher=Office of Defects Investigation, [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] |date=May 1978 |url=http://www.autosafety.org/wp-content/uploads/import/ODIPinto.pdf |accessdate=March 5, 2016 |quote=Based upon the information either developed or acquired during this investigation, the following conlcusions have been reached: 1971–1976 Ford Pintos have experienced moderate speed, rear-end collisions that have resulted in fuel tank damage, fuel leakage, and fire occurrences that have resulted in fatalities and non-fatal burn injuries.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

NHTSA scheduled a public hearing for June 1978, and NHTSA negotiated with Ford on the recall.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1978}}: A spokesman for NHTSA said that his agency and Ford began a "process of negotiation" after May 8 that led to Ford's announcement in Detroit yesterday.&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
Lee and Ermann noted that NHTSA used a worst-case test to justify the recall of the Pinto, rather than the regular 1977 rear impact crash test. A large "bullet car" was used instead of a standard moving barrier. Weights were placed in the nose of the car to help it slide under the Pinto and maximize gas tank contact. The vehicle headlights were turned on to provide a possible ignition source. The fuel tank was completely filled with gasoline rather than partially filled with non-flammable [[Stoddard solvent|Stoddard fluid]] as was the normal test procedure. In a later interview, the NHTSA engineer was asked why the NHTSA forced a Pinto recall for failing a 35&amp;nbsp;mph test given that most small cars of the time would not have passed. "Just because your friends get away with shoplifting, doesn't mean you should get away with it too."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: NHTSA engineer Lee Strickland was assigned to determine if Pinto (and Chevrolet Vega) tank problems warranted a mandatory recall. Strickland's work group held the Pinto and Vega to a higher standard than other cars (Strickland 1996). It dispensed with the usual moving barrier. Instead, it intentionally selected a large and particularly rigid "bullet car" to hit the Pinto's rear end. It weighed down the bullet car's nose to slide under the Pinto and maximize gas tank contact. It also turned on the bullet car's headlights to provide a ready source of ignition. And it completely filled gas tanks in both cars with gasoline rather than the non-flammable Stoddard fluid normally used. Strickland justified these actions as approximating real-world worst-case circumstances (Davidson 1983; NHTSA C7-38; Strickland 1996). For NHTSA, the tests seemed an unqualified success: two 1972 Pintos burst into flame upon impact. In the summer of 1978 NHTSA announced that the Pinto gas tank represented a safety defect, leading to the largest recall campaign in automobile history at that time (NHTSA C7-38; Strickland 1996). Ford agreed to "voluntarily" recall 1971–1976 Pintos. Other small cars sold during the 19 70s were not recalled, even though most were comparable, or in the case of the AMC Gremlin probably less safe (Schwartz 1991; NHTSA C7-38; Swigert and Farrell 198081:180). Their manufacturers successfully defended them as acceptable risks (see Wallace 1978). When we asked why NHTSA forced a Pinto recall for failing the 35 mile-per-hour test, although most small cars could not withstand such a test, Strickland ( 1996) analogized that, "Just because your friends get away with shoplifting, doesn't mean you should get away with it too."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Matthew T|title=The Ford Pinto Case and the Development of Auto Safety Regulations, 1893—1978|journal=Business and Economic History|date=1998|volume=27|issue=2|pages=390–401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) ultimately directed Ford to recall the Pinto. Initially, the NHTSA did not feel there was sufficient evidence to demand a recall due to incidents of fire. The NHTSA investigation found that 27 deaths were found to have occurred between 1970 and mid-1977 in rear-impact crashes that resulted in fire.  The NHTSA did not indicate if these impacts would have been survivable absent fire or if the impacts were more severe than even a state of the art (for 1977) fuel system could have withstood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}: Relying on a variety of external sources (including Ford), NHTSA indicated that it was aware of thirty-eight instances in which rear-end impact on Pintos had resulted in fuel-tank leakage or fire; these instances, in turn, resulted in twenty-seven deaths and twenty-four nonfatal burn injuries.66 The NHTSA report also incorporated the data internally provided by NHTSA's own Fatal Accident Reporting System ("FARS"), which had begun operation in 1975. FARS data showed that from January 1975 through the middle of 1977, seventeen people had died in accidents in which Pinto rear-end collisions resulted in fires. 67 In comparing NHTSA's figure of twenty-seven deaths for 1971–77 with the FARS figure of seventeen for 1975–77,68 one should keep in mind that the number of Pintos on the road was increasing every year in a cumulative way. The NHTSA figure of twenty-seven fatalities hence seems roughly in the ballpark by way of suggesting the number of people who had died in Pinto rear-end fires. In setting forth this number, however, NHTSA made no effort to estimate how many of these deaths were caused by the Pinto's specific design features. Many fire deaths undeniably result from high-speed collisions that would induce leakage even in state-of-the-art fuel systems;69 moreover, cars in the subcompact class generally entail a relatively high fatality risk.70 Yet the NHTSA report did not compare the performance results of the Pinto to the results of other cars then on the road, including other subcompacts.&lt;/ref&gt;  In their analysis of the social factors affecting the NHTSA's actions, Lee and Ermann note that 27 is the same number of deaths attributed to a Pinto transmission problem which contributed to collisions after the affected cars stalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}:Beginning in the late 1970s, claims consistent with "Pinto Madness" readily gained public acceptance, but credible contradictory claims did not (e.g., Davidson 1983; Epstein 1980). For instance, Dowie's "conservative" estimate of 500 deaths (1977:18) was accepted, while NHTSA's report that it could document only 27 Pinto fire-related deaths (NHTSA C7-38; Frank 1985) was ignored. A transmission problem that also caused 27 Pinto deaths (and 180 on other Ford products [Clarke 1988]) never became a social problem. Similarly, publics accepted claims of safety errors leveled by Harley Copp, a Ford engineer who was apparently overseas when early crucial decisions were made (Camps 1997; Strobel 1980), but ignored other safety-conscious Pinto engineers who believed windshield retention was a more important safety problem (Camps 1997), and lack of safety glass caused more deaths (Feaheny 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;  They also note that the NHTSA had two primary incentives in proving a defect existed in the Pinto's fuel system design.  The administration was pressured by safety advocates (Center for Auto Safety) as well as the public response.  It was also being forced into action due to the ways in which both the courts and executive branch were limiting the ability of the NHTSA to address systematic auto safety issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: By the time of its Pinto investigation, NHTSA had essentially abandoned its original mission of forcing industry-wide safety improvements, in favor of investigating and recalling specific cars (Mashaw and Harfst 1990). NHTSA had two primary incentives in reinforcing the extant Nfocal organization" imagery of the Pinto narrative. First, NHTSA was pressured by specific organizations in its network (e.g., the Center for Auto Safety) and members of the public (see NHTSA C7-38) to take action on the Pinto's gas tank. Second, other network actors (e.g., courts, the Nixon administration, the auto industry) had increasingly limited NHTSA's ability to address systemic auto safety issues.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recall===

Though Ford could have proceeded with the formal recall hearing, fearing additional damage to the company's public reputation the company agreed to a "voluntary recall" program.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Danley|2005}}: Ford could have refused to recall and have chosen instead to defend the Pinto's design in the formal recall hearings at NHTSA." While this tactic could easily have delayed any forced recall for months, if not for more than a year, the cost of the publicized hearings to Ford's reputation could have been substantial, even if Ford had been successful in the end. Ford agreed to "voluntarily recall" the Pinto in June 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 9, 1978, days before the NHTSA was to issue Ford a formal recall order, Ford recalled 1.5 million Ford Pintos and Mercury Bobcats, the largest recall in automotive history at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}: the Pinto was the subject of the largest recall in automobile history at the time.&lt;/ref&gt; Ford disagreed with the NHTSA finding of defect, and said the recall was to "end public concern that has resulted from criticism of the fuel systems in these vehicles."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1978}}: In a prepared statement, Ford vice President Herbet L. Misch said: "Ford informed NHTSA that it does not agree with the agency's initial determination of May 8 that an unreasonable risk of safety is involved in the design of these cars&amp;nbsp;..." Misch said Ford decided to offer the modifications "so as to end public concern that has resulted from criticism of the fuel systems in these vehicles".&lt;/ref&gt; The Ford recall placed a polyethylene shield between the tank and likely causes of puncture, lengthened the filler tube, and improved the tank filler seal in the event of collision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/1975/FORD/PINTO|title=1975 FORD PINTO|website=NHTSA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal cases ===
Approximately 117 lawsuits were brought against Ford in connection with rear-end accidents in the Pinto.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sherefkin|2003}}: Ford customers filed 117 lawsuits, according to Peter Wyden in The Unknown Iacocca.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two most significant cases were ''Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Company'' and ''State of Indiana v. Ford Motor Company''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Danley|2005}}:Two important legal cases were central.  One was a civil trial that began in August 1977 in Orange County California, Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Company. The other was a case involving criminal reckless homicide in Indiana.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.'' ====
''[[Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.]]'', decided in February 1978, is one of two important Pinto cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Danley|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1972 Pinto driven by Lily Gray stalled in the center lane of a California freeway.  The car was struck from behind by a vehicle initially traveling at 50&amp;nbsp;mph and impacted at an estimated between 30 and 50&amp;nbsp;mph, resulting in a fuel tank fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}:The Pinto was then struck by a car, which had originally been traveling at about fifty miles per hour but which had braked down to a speed of perhaps thirty miles per hour at the point of impact.9 ... [footnote 9]For reasons quite beyond the court's control, its opinion must be treated cautiously as a source of actual facts. Because the defendant was appealing a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, the court was under an obligation to view all the evidence in a way most favorable to the plaintiffs and essentially to ignore evidence in the record that might be favorable to the defendant. See id. at 773, 820, 174 Cal. Rptr. at 359, 388.  In fact, Ford's basic position at trial-which the court's opinion at no point mentions was that the approaching car (a Ford Galaxie) had not slowed down at all, and had struck the Gray car at a speed in excess of 50 miles per hour. There was an enormous amount of evidence at trial supporting each of the parties' factual claims as to the
Galaxie's closing speed. Had the jury accepted Ford's speed estimate, there would not have been much of an issue of crashworthiness: for the plaintiffs' position throughout trial was that even a state-of-the-art fuel system could not maintain integrity in a 50 mile-per hour collision.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gray died at the time of the impact.  The passenger, Richard Grimshaw, was seriously burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Danley|2005}}: pg 208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}:pg 1016&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiff's bar collaborated with ''Mother Jones'' and The Center for Auto Safety to publicize damning information about Ford prior to trial.&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Ermann|1999}}:
Based on information given to it by lawyers preparing cases against Ford, the Center for Auto Safety petitioned NHTSA in the mid-1970s to investigate the Pinto's rear-end design. According to material presented on the Center's website, Dowie's article is based on that information, made available to him by the Center (www.autosafety.org). "Pinto Madness" is still available on the Mother Jones website along with a video clip showing a Pinto catching fire after being rear-ended. In an interview with Schwartz, Copp asserted that he was also a major source of the information for the Mother Jones story, Schwartz, "The Myth of the Ford Pinto Case," 1027, n.53&lt;/ref&gt;  The jury awarded $127.8 million in total [[damages]]; $125 million in [[punitive damages]] and $2,841,000 in compensatory damages to passenger Richard Grimshaw and $665,000 in compensatory damages to the family of the deceased driver, Lily Gray.

Jurors have a tendency to compare the often very small per-unit safety cost with the costs borne by the injured victim.

The fact that these costs would also have been incurred for thousands of consumers who were not injured will not loom as large, as Judge Easterbrook emphasized. Thus, there is a tendency to exhibit "hindsight bias" rather than to consider the expected costs and expected benefits at the time of the safety decision.|jstor=1229473|hdl=1803/6556}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The case is also cited as an example of irrational punitive damage awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Viscusi|first1=W.

From a deterrence standpoint, it confounds understanding to permit such vast uncertainty as to the level of the expected penalty.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}: Hence, there was nothing clearly wrong in subjecting Ford to liability for harms resulting from that latter category of fires. The punitive damage award in the Ford Pinto case is, however, much more difficult to justify. To a large extent it rested on the premise that Ford had behaved reprehensibly when it balanced safety against cost in designing the Pinto. However, the process by which manufacturers render such trade-off design decisions seems not only to be anticipated but endorsed by the prevailing risk-benefit standard for design liability. Accordingly, the Pinto jury's decision that punitive damages were appropriate-a decision that was affirmed by the trial judge and the court of appeal-raises serious questions about the operational viability of the risk-benefit standard itself.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Indiana v. Ford Motor Co.'' ====

On August 10, 1978, three teenage girls of the Urlich family of [[Osceola, Indiana]], were killed when the 1973 Pinto they were in was involved in a rear-end collision. The driver had stopped in the road to retrieve the car's gas cap which had been inadvertently left on the top of the car and subsequently fell onto the road. While stopped the Pinto was struck by a Chevrolet van.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Epstein|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ford sent the Urlichs a recall notice for the Pinto in 1979. A grand jury indicted Ford on three counts of reckless homicide. ''Indiana v. Ford'' was a landmark in product liability law as the first time a corporation faced criminal charges for a defective product, and the first time a corporation was charged with homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Becker|Jipson|Bruce|2002}}:There is little doubt about the importance of State of Indiana v. Ford Motor Company from a legal standpoint. This case was the first time criminal charges were bought against an American corporation for faulty product design. According to attorney Malcolm Wheeler (1981, p. 250), "[n]ewspapers referred to it as the most important economic case of the century&amp;nbsp;..." The notion that a corporation could be held accountable for its criminal actions was a novel legal concept at the time. Wheeler was not alone in his estimation of the case as influential. Because of the application of criminal law to corporate behavior, others have referred to this litigation as "unprecedented" (Welty, 1982) and as a "landmark case" (Clinard, 1990; Frank &amp; Lynch, 1992; Hills, 1987; Maakestad, 1987). Maakestad (1987, p. 7) stated that the case "[r]eestablished an important precedent: In certain cases involving human health and safety, corporations and their executives could be required to submit not only to the scrutiny and sanctions of traditional federal regulatory agencies, but to state criminal courts as well."&lt;/ref&gt; If convicted, Ford faced a maximum fine of $30,000 under Indiana's 1978 reckless homicide statute.&lt;ref name=csm19800314&gt;{{cite news |title=Pinto verdict lets US industry off hook |first=Charles E. |last=Dole |newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=March 14, 1980 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1980/0314/031435.html |accessdate=March 3, 2016 |quote=An Indiana farm country jury in the 10-week landmark trial found Ford "not guilty" in the deaths of three teen-age girls whose 1973-model Pinto exploded when a speeding van struck it in the rear Aug. 10, 1978.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ford's legal defense was vastly more ambitious than the effort mounted in the Grimshaw case.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}}:In August 1978-half a year after the verdict in the tort case-a 1973 Pinto was involved in a fatal crash in Ulrich, Indiana. Indiana public officials decided to prosecute Ford for the crime of reckless homicide. Because the reckless homicide statute had been enacted only in 1977, Ford could not be prosecuted for the reckless design of the Pinto; rather, the prosecution needed to show a reckless post-1977 failure by Ford to repair or warn. Largely because of the narrowness of the resulting issue, at trial the prosecution was not able to secure the admission of internal Ford documents on which it had hoped to build its case. Ford's defense effort in this criminal case was vastly more ambitious than the effort the company had previously mounted in defending itself against Grimshaw's tort claim. In March 1980 the Indiana jury found Ford not guilty. The jury seemed ambivalent about the Pinto, but concluded that Ford had avoided recklessness in the conduct of its recall program.&lt;/ref&gt;  The effort was led by [[James F. Neal]] with a staff of 80 and a budget of about $1 million; the [[Elkhart County]] Prosecuting Attorney had a budget of about $20,000 and volunteer law professors and law students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=February 4, 1980 |volume=13 |number=5 |title=A Local D.A.

Gremlin.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 Ford was found not guilty.&lt;ref name=csm19800314/&gt; In 1980 a civil suit was settled for $7,500 to each plaintiff.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Becker|Jipson|Bruce|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Automotive News]]'' in 2003, the indictment was a low point in Ford's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sherefkin|2003}}: The low point for Ford came in 1979 when Indiana authorities charged the automaker with reckless homicide in a criminal trial.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some saw the suit as a landmark for taking a corporation to task for their actions while others saw the case as frivolous.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Becker|Jipson|Bruce|2002}}:Two main perspectives emerged after the Pinto trial as to how the case outcome would affect future uses of criminal law against corporations for product liability issues. One viewpoint was stated by thenpresident of the National District Attorneys Association, Robert Johnson, Sr. He is quoted as saying "We'll see more prosecutions like this&amp;nbsp;... A psychological barrier has been broken, and the big corporations are now vulnerable" (Bodine, 1980, p. 3). The popular idea was that corporate malfeasance would be curtailed if corporations were held accountable for their actions. Thus, the feeling among some legal commentators was that the Pinto case represented a fundamental shift in how the criminal courts would perceive corporations.&amp;nbsp;... Another perspective was that the case was completely frivolous. Commenting on civil litigation, Harry Philo, then president-elect of the Association of American Trial Lawyers of America, commented that "In my opinion, the Pinto case was a completely irrelevant prosecution" (Stuart, 1980, p.4). However, he also stated that "[t]he verdict won't deter civil lawsuits" (Mleczko, 1980, llA).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Epstein|1980}}:The important point here is that neither the drama of the case nor its outcome should be allowed to obscure the essential legal and institutional issues. On the record, this criminal prosecution should never have been brought at all.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002, Malcolm Wheeler, a lawyer working with the Ford defense team, noted that the case was a poor application of criminal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Becker|Jipson|Bruce|2002}}:The very fact that there has not been another product liability criminal prosecution since that case tells you one major impact of the case was&amp;nbsp;... [that] it said the criminal law is a very, very poor tool to use for product litigation.  It's just not appropriate&lt;/ref&gt; The case also impacted how Ford handled future product liability cases both legally and in the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Becker|Jipson|Bruce|2002}}:Paul Weaver worked for the Ford Motor Company from 1978 to 1980 in the corporation's public affairs staff preparing company positions on public policy issues. He criticized Ford for how it dealt with the controversy surrounding the Pinto. According to Weaver (1988, p.94), "[t]he design of its [Pinto's] fuel system was essentially the same as that of other cars of its size and generation" and "Pintos had about the same rate of death from fire due to rear-end collision as other small cars." His assertion is that the Pinto was not unusual compared to similar models. Weaver admits that "[w]e should simply have told the truth about the car" and "[w]e did not fight to vindicate ourselves." Thus, by refusing to mount a major publicity campaign, Ford gave the impression that it was guilty.&amp;nbsp;... These remarks add an interesting dimension to the Pinto case in that one of the clear lessons was to confront issues raised about defective products. This concern illustrates that after the Pinto case, corporations became much more willing and adept at handling images stemming from poor design. In other words, the Pinto case made corporations much more willing to wage public relations battles over design and production flaws.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in 2010, the award "signaled to the auto industry that it would be harshly sanctioned for ignoring known defects."&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;

UCLA law professor Gary T. Schwartz, in a ''[[Rutgers Law Review]]'' article (see ''Section 7.3 NHTSA Investigation'' above), studied the fatality rates of the Pinto and several other small cars of the time period.  He noted that fires, and rear-end fires in particular, are very small portion of overall auto fatalities.  At the time only 1% of automobile crashes would result in fire and only 4% of fatal accidents involved fire, and only 15% of fatal fire crashes are the result of rear-end collisions.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1991"&gt;{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}} Footnote pg 1029&lt;/ref&gt;  When considering the overall safety of the Pinto, Schwartz notes that subcompact cars as a class have a generally higher fatality risk.  Pintos represented 1.9% of all cars on the road in the 1975–76 period.  During that time the car represented 1.9% of all "fatal accidents accompanied by some fire." Implying the car was average for all cars and slightly above average for its class.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}} pg 1031&lt;/ref&gt;  When all types of fatalities are considered, the Pinto was approximately even with the AMC Gremlin, Chevrolet Vega, and Datsun 510.  It was significantly better than the Datsun 1200/210, Toyota Corolla and VW Beetle.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1991"/&gt;  The safety record of the car in terms of fire was average or slightly below average for compacts, and all cars respectively.  This was considered respectable for a subcompact car.  Only when considering the narrow subset of rear-impact, fire fatalities for the car were somewhat worse than the average for subcompact cars.  While acknowledging this is an important legal point, Schwartz rejects the portrayal of the car as a firetrap.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwartz|1991}} pg 1033&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ford Windstar''' (later the '''Ford Freestar''' and '''Mercury Monterey''') is a [[minivan]] that was produced and sold by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]].  The replacement for the [[Ford Aerostar]], the Windstar adopted the front-wheel drive configuration of the [[Chrysler minivans]].  From the 1995 to 2007 model years, three generations of the model line were sold, with the final generation renamed as the Ford Freestar.    

Unrelated to the Nissan-developed [[Mercury Villager]], the Windstar was marketed without a Lincoln-Mercury counterpart.  As part of the 2004 launch of the Ford Freestar, Mercury introduced its first Ford-produced minivan in a revival of the Mercury Monterey nameplate.     

Following a decline in sales across the minivan segment in the mid-2000s, the Freestar and Monterey were discontinued after the 2007 model year with no direct replacement.  In North America, the model line was functionally matched by the 7-passenger 2008 [[Ford Taurus X]] wagon/CUV; in Mexico, the Freestar was replaced by the Ford Transit/Tourneo.  In 2014, Ford reentered the segment as the [[Ford Transit Connect]] compact MPV gained 7-passenger seating in North America.        

During its production, the Ford Windstar/Freestar and the Mercury Monterey were sourced from [[Oakville Assembly]] ([[Oakville, Ontario]]).  In total, 1,984,232 were produced (1,704,786 Windstars, 246,493 Freestars, and 32,953 Montereys).  

==Development==
In 1985, Ford launched the Aerostar minivan with some degree of success; while it outsold the Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari, Volkswagen Vanagon, and its Japanese competition, it consistently remained in second place in terms of sales in the minivan segment.  To better compete with Chrysler, Ford decided its next minivan would adopt the same front-wheel drive layout popularized by Chrysler.

Codenamed ''"WIN88"'', development of the front-wheel drive minivan commenced in 1988 with a projected 1993 introduction (for the 1994 model year).  By 1989, design work was well underway, with a concept design theme being settled on by December 1989.  In 1990, the WIN88 exterior design by Camilo Pardo was frozen for scheduled 1993 production, with prototypes being tested from early 1991. Trademarks were filed for the Windstar name at the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|USPTO]] on April 13, 1992, with development ending in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1989-12-07/topic/8912062887_1_aerostar-minivan-mercury|title=Ford To Replace Aerostar For 1994|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AOQDAAAAMBAJ|title=Popular Mechanics|last=Magazines|first=Hearst|date=1 May 1991|publisher=Hearst Magazines|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While developed by the Ford truck division (the designers of the Aerostar and Econoline/Club Wagon), the Windstar was designed predominantly by a [[Women in engineering in the United States|women-led engineering]] and design team.  Intended nearly exclusively for family use, the design team considered design scenarios from the perspective of pregnant women, women wearing skirts and high heels, and adopted family-friendly design features (reconfigurable cupholders, auxiliary stereo controls).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/195071732|title=Windstar designed with a woman's touch|author=Prodis, Julia|date=March 25, 1994|work=Associated Press|accessdate=February 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ford Windstar was released in March 1994 as a 1995 model, preceding the launch of the [[Chrysler minivans (NS)|third-generation Chrysler minivans]] by over a year, enabling Ford to cut into Chrysler minivan sales significantly.  While the competing model lines roughly benchmarked each other, the Windstar was sold only as an equivalent to the long-wheelbase "Grand" Chrysler vans, with Lincoln-Mercury selling the smaller, unrelated [[Mercury Villager]] (jointly developed with Nissan).

From the 1995 to 1997 model years, the Windstar was sold concurrently with its Ford Aerostar predecessor; initially slated for discontinuation following the 1994 model year, continued consumer and dealer demand for the Aerostar led Ford to market both vehicles.  For its first year on the market, the Windstar was priced above both the Aerostar and the Mercury Villager.  By 1997, however, the Villager's base price had surpassed the Windstar's by several hundred dollars, and top-of-the-line Villager ''Nautica'' models were priced some $6,000 [[USD]] higher.

In what would later become a design [[wikidata:Q1398885|faux pas]], this generation of the model line was marketed without a driver-side [[Sliding door (car)|sliding door]], a feature popularized by the introduction of third-generation Chrysler minivans.  During its development, Ford claimed its focus groups did not identify it as an important feature{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}; previously, vans (of all sizes) with a driver-side sliding door had sold poorly in the United States.

=== Chassis specification ===
The first generation Ford Windstar is codenamed WIN88, sharing the front-wheel drive [[Ford DN5 platform|DN5 platform]] with the [[Ford Taurus (first generation)|first-generation Ford Taurus]] and Mercury Sable.  Using a 120.7-inch wheelbase (nearly 15 inches longer than the Taurus), the Windstar replaced the integrated frame-rail design of the Aerostar with full unibody construction.  The front suspension used MacPherson struts, while the rear suspension was a beam axle using coil springs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cars.com/reviews/indystar-coms-view-1420689122547/|title=IndyStar.com's view|date=February 27, 1994|website=cars.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;; air suspension was an option.

Front brakes were discs, with rear drum brakes&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/195071732|title=Windstar designed with a woman's touch|author=Prodis, Julia|date=March 25, 1994|work=Associated Press|accessdate=February 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;; anti-lock braking was standard.  In 1996, four-wheel disc brakes were introduced as an option (when ordered with traction control or the towing package).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818032509/http://www.edmunds.com/ford/windstar/|title=Ford Windstar|date=2011-08-18|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to the Aerostar, 15-inch wheels were fitted to the first-generation Windstar (except the 1998 Limited).

==== Powertrain ====
The Windstar shared its powertrains with the Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable.  For its 1995 launch, the 3.8L V6 was the sole engine, producing 155 hp; a 150 hp 3.0L V6 was introduced as the standard engine in October 1995.  For 1996, the 3.8L V6 saw its output increased to 200 hp.

=== Body design ===
To compete more closely with the Chrysler minivans, Ford designers shifted from a "one-box" design to a "two-box" configuration; influenced somewhat by the Mercury Villager, the Windstar had a distinct hoodline and passenger compartment.  Benchmarked in size against the long-wheelbase "Grand" Chrysler minivans&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, the Windstar was given a longer wheelbase than the Aerostar and both the second and third-generation Chrysler minivans; only a long-wheelbase version was marketed.

In what would be a preview of the [[Ford Taurus (second generation)|1996 Ford Taurus]], the Windstar was designed with an oval rear window, though adopting several design elements of the Mercury Villager/Nissan Quest.  While far more vertically-oriented, the curved dashboard of the Windstar shares influences of the multi-tiered design used by the [[Lincoln Mark VIII]].

For 1996, chrome was added to body-side molding (LX trim).  For 1997, no exterior changes were made, with the base-trim model renamed the 3.0L.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== 1998 revision ====
The first-generation Windstar underwent few revisions during its production.  For 1996, chrome was added to the body-side molding (for the LX trim).  After a shortened 1997 model year (lasting from October 1996 to January 1997), the 1998 Windstar was introduced.  Coinciding with a mid-cycle revision, to compete with the introduction of driver-side sliding doors, Ford widened the driver-side door, calling it the "King Door," and added an optional tilting/sliding driver seat.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The front fascia underwent a facelift, adopting a trapezoidal grille and redesigned headlamps (with amber turn signal lenses); the optional fog lamps were moved out of the lower intake of the grille.  The rear saw mild revisions, with revised tailgate badging, with larger model script and the centering of the Ford Blue Oval over the license plate).  On all trim levels, new wheel covers and alloy wheel designs were introduced; the body side moldings were restyled, with the GL and LX sharing the same design.

The interior saw a minor revision, coinciding with the addition of the tilt-slide driver's seat; while the dashboard remained unchanged, head restraints were added to the rear bench seats (already on rear bucket seats).  Largely to make up for the retirement of the Aerostar Eddie Bauer, a "Northwoods" appearance package was offered for the GL and LX, offering leather (LX) or cloth/vinyl (GL) seats, gold-trimmed wheels, and luggage rack, and a two-tone exterior.

==== Features ====
While adopting the front-wheel drive form factor similar to the Chrysler minivans, the Windstar adopted several design features from the Ford Aerostar and Mercury Villager, including rear-seat audio controls, rear air conditioning and middle-row bucket seats; a digital instrument panel was coupled with a trip computer, automatic headlamps, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror.  Shared with Ford sedans, the Windstar offered a keyless entry system (using a door-mounted keypad) along with an alarm system.

In contrast to its lack of a driver-side sliding door, the Windstar introduced several features to the minivan segment, including a door lock control from the rear door and a wide-angle mirror in the overhead console allowing a view of the rear passenger compartment.

=== Trim ===
In line with the Aerostar and the Econoline/Club Wagon, the Windstar was sold as both a passenger van and as a cargo van.  In place of using the XL/XLT nomenclature used by Ford trucks and vans, the Windstar adopted the model nomenclature used by the majority of the Ford car lineup.  For retail sales, the base trim Windstar was the GL, with the Windstar LX as the flagship model.

For 1998, the Limited trim was introduced, distinguished by its monochromatic exterior and five-spoke 16-inch chrome wheels; wood interior trim was added.  Slotted above both the LX and the Mercury Villager LS, the Windstar was offered with all optional features from the LX as standard.

* Cargo Van (1995-1998)
* Windstar (1996)
* Windstar 3.0L (1997-1998) - replaced unnamed base model, and included: 7 passenger seating, cloth bucket front seats, all-season tires with 15" hubcaps, air conditioning, power locks, power windows with automatic drivers side window, power mirrors, and an AM/FM radio with four speakers.
* Windstar GL (1995-1998) - Added: 3.8L V6 engine, all-season tires with 15" hubcaps or optional 15" alloy wheels, manual driver's seat, speed/tilt control steering wheel, and an AM/FM radio with four speakers. Package 473A added high-capacity air-conditioning with an auxiliary heater, overhead console, tinted windows and a luggage rack.
* Windstar LX (1995-1998) - Added: two-tone paint, rear storage bin, 15" cast alloy rims, puddle lights, tachometer, adjustable front seats with power sliding driver's seat, an AM/FM radio with cassette player and four speakers, and a pocket for a map behind the passenger seat.
* Windstar Limited (1998) - Added: Front fog lamps, 16" cast aluminum rims, high-capacity rear air conditioner and heater, automatic headlamps, auto-dim mirrors, overhead console, leather seats, keyless entry, security alarm, a premium AM/FM stereo with cassette player and four speakers, and second-row audio controls with headphone jacks.

===Safety===
The 1995–1998 Ford Windstar, which was tested as a 1995 model received a "Good" (5-stars)&lt;ref&gt;http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---April/1997-Ford-Cars-and-Trucks-Brochure-Rev/1997-Ford-Cars-and-Trucks-Rev--16-17&lt;/ref&gt; rating from the IIHS in all marks, in which the driver survives the accident without any injuries.

=== Problems ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}During and after its production, this generation of the Windstar would become known for several notable reliability issues. The 3.8&amp;nbsp;L [[V6]] [[Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)|Essex engine]] in 1995 models was susceptible to headgasket failure, as it was in its [[Ford Taurus|Taurus]] and [[Mercury Sable|Sable]] stablemates. However, the Windstar's problem was exacerbated by a tighter [[Internal combustion engine|engine]] bay and higher loads, the van being 700 [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] heavier.  In response, Ford extended the warranty on the headgasket to 100,000 miles on most Windstars with this engine.  The 3.0&amp;nbsp;L [[V6]] [[Ford Vulcan V6 engine|Vulcan]] engine was not susceptible to headgasket failure, as it was a completely different engine design.

The Windstar was paired with an [[Ford AXOD transmission|AX4S]] transaxle, which was prone to internal failure. The transmission suffered from cracked forward and reverse clutch pistons. These transmission failures were most susceptible with the 3.8L engine, as the transmission could not handle the extra torque and the extra vehicle weight.

The Windstar was also plagued with various suspension woes. The front springs were prone to breaking in specific markets where extreme cold and heavy salt use in winter months occurred.{{clear}}

Released in the summer of 1998 as an early 1999 model, the Ford Windstar was given a complete redesign.  As one of the first Ford vehicles in North America to adopt the [[New Edge]] styling language, the redesign also was distinguished by the addition of a driver's side sliding door.   

While retaining mechanical commonality with the Taurus/Sable, Ford shifted the Windstar to a dedicated chassis architecture, introducing the [[Ford V platform]].  Several major features made their debut, including front seat-mounted side airbags on vans with VINs starting with 2FMDA, dual power-sliding doors, and rear reverse sensors.

=== Year-by-year changes ===
*'''2000''': The ''Limited'' model returned as the most luxurious model. A [[VCR]]-based rear-seat entertainment system featuring a flip-down [[LCD]] screen was a new option on ''SE'', ''SEL'', and ''Limited'' models.
*'''2001''': Slight cosmetic changes were made to front and rear fascias for '01. ''LX'' became the base model, and a new ''SE Sport'' model joined the lineup. The smaller 3.0&amp;nbsp;L was gone, leaving the 3.8&amp;nbsp;L as the sole engine choice. Models with 2nd row bucket seats now got their own center console. Front-seat side airbags became standard on ''Limited''s. The chrome grille on the SE and SEL models was redesigned. The steering wheel was updated to a more modern style, with the blue Ford Logo placed in the center.  The transmission was updated to the [[Ford AXOD transmission|4F50N]].
*'''2002''': Dual sliding doors became standard on all models.

The 2002 Windstar was the most dependable minivan on the market in the JD Powers dependability survey at three years in service in the 2005 survey.  The Windstar beat out the Toyota Sienna and the Honda Odyssey for these honors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jdpower.com/corporate/news/releases/pdf/2005089.pdf |title=Not Found |publisher=JDPower.com |accessdate=2010-12-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011135359/http://www.jdpower.com/corporate/news/releases/pdf/2005089.pdf/ |archivedate=2010-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''2003''': The last year of the Windstar; no major changes were made in anticipation of a 2004 redesign.  In a new marketing strategy, the upcoming third-generation Windstar was rebranded as the [[Ford Freestar]]. The last Ford Windstar was produced on July 25, 2003.

=== Trim levels ===
[[File:01-03 Ford Windstar Sport.jpg|thumb|2001–2003 Ford Windstar SE Sport]]In 1999, Ford began a shift in trim levels that would be seen in many of its American-market sedans through the 2000s.  In place of the GL, the LX was the new base model, with the SE and SEL making their debut as the highest trim levels, respectively.

Although all versions of the Windstar wagon were sold with 7-passenger seating, LX-trim Windstars are equipped with 2nd-row bench seats; SE and SEL-trim examples are equipped with 2nd-row bucket seats.
*''Cargo Van'' (1999–2003)
*base (1999–2000) Included: 7-passenger seating, air conditioning, power mirrors, power doors, power locks and windows with automatic driver's side window, "sleeping baby mode" lights, sliding door locks, 15" steel wheels with hubcaps, and an AM/FM stereo.
*''LX''  (1999–2003) Included: 7 passenger-seating, air conditioning, keyless entry, 15" hubcaps, and an AM/FM radio with cassette player and clock, and overhead console. LX Deluxe added 16" alloy rims, an auxiliary climate control with rear controls, and adjustable pedals. 
*''SE''  (1999–2003) Added: cloth seats, premium AM/FM radio with cassette player (later, a single CD/cassette player) and clock, and 6-way driver's seat.
*''SE Sport'' (2001–2003)
*''SEL''  (1999–2003) Added: automatic headlamps, heavy-duty maintenance battery, leather seats, auto-dimming rear-view mirror, message center, two-tone bumpers, and a premium AM/FM stereo with a single-CD/cassette player.

=== Recalls ===
==== Rear axle ====
In August 2010, Ford issued a voluntary recall of 575,000 Windstar minivans for rear axle problems. This recall followed an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration which had begun in May 2010. The NHTSA preliminary evaluation stated the design of the rear axle beam, an inverted "U" channel design, appeared to provide a collection point for road slurry.  In states which used lots of road salt, corrosion progressively weakened the axle until it fractured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/27/ford-recalling-575000-windstar-minivans-for-rear-axle-problem/ | work=The New York Times | first=Christopher | last=Jensen | title=Ford Recalling 575,000 Windstar Minivans for Rear Axle Problem | date=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The states covered by the recall were Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia and Wisconsin, as well as Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/15/death-preceded-safety-agencys-warning-on-ford-windstar/ | work=The New York Times | first=Christopher | last=Jensen | title=Death Preceded Safety Agency's Warning on Ford Windstar | date=2010-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, 27,000 of the minivans from Virginia were added to the axle recall, bringing the overall total to more than 600,000 vehicles between the U.S. and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2012/05/ford-windstar-rear-axle-recall-surpasses-600000-units.html|title=Ford Windstar Rear Axle Recall Surpasses 600,000 Units » AutoGuide.com News|date=9 May 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A class action lawsuit was filed against Ford Motor Company in May 2010 proceeding Ford's recall.&lt;ref name="uscourts.gov"&gt;http://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents/opinions/13d0548p.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This lawsuit was filed by Plaintiff Aaron Martin against Defendant Ford Motor Company. In this lawsuit, documents were introduced which showed Ford's testing of the Benteler Axle in March 1998 resulted in failure of two out of the eleven axles tested. In August 1998, Ford determined the cause of this failure was improper heat treating. In September 1998, the axle manufacturer Bentley Automotive agreed with Ford's findings. In October 1999, Ford's internal documents show lab testing proved the axle life could be doubled by heat treating, but would require initial retooling cost and result in $3.45 piece cost increase. No changes were made until March 2003.&lt;ref name="uscourts.gov"/&gt;

==== Subframe corrosion ====
In March 2011, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Ford announced another Ford Windstar recall over corrosion concerns. 425,288 of the model year 1999–2003 Windstar vans originally sold or currently registered in some cold weather states are part of the recall. The problem involves rusting of the subframe. Most of the corrosion occurs on the passenger side of the subframe. If the subframe collapses while driving, the vehicle could potentially lose all steering control and end up in an accident. According to the NHTSA action #PE10026, some Ford Windstar owners had their drive axle detach from the transmission. Ford is offering alternative transportation to owners if their vehicle is unsafe to drive. If the minivan can't be repaired, Ford will repurchase the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.insideline.com/ford/windstar/1999-03-ford-windstar-minivans-recalled.html | title = 1999–'03 Ford Windstar Minivans Recalled | publisher = [[Edmunds.com|Edmunds]] | date = 2011-01-28 | accessdate = 2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IIHS crash test results ===
The 1999–2003 Ford Windstar received an "Acceptable" rating by the IIHS for fair structural performance, moderate injuries to the left foot, and fair dummy control. Although most redesigned vehicles outperform their predecessors to cut down insurance costs and possible injuries to the driver, this generation Windstar did not perform as well as its first generation predecessor. The NHTSA graded the minivan an overall rating of 5 stars in both the frontal and side impact tests.

[[File:2004 Ford Freestar SE, rear 3.11.20.jpg|thumb|left|Ford Freestar]]
For the 2004 model year, the third generation Ford Windstar was released; as part of a mid-2000s rebranding of the Ford car model line with nameplates starting with the letter "F", the Windstar was renamed the '''Ford Freestar'''.

Sharing the V platform with the 2000-2003 Ford Windstar, the primary initiative of the $600 million redesign focused on driveline reliability, an issue that had plagued the Windstar since its 1994 introduction.  In its development, the Freestar saw the addition of heavier-duty drive axles, larger wheel bearings, and the standardization of four-wheel disc brakes.  The 3.0L and 3.8L V6 engines were both retired, in favor of two new engines.  In the United States (only), the Freestar was powered by a 193&amp;nbsp;hp 3.9L V6 (shared with the Ford Mustang) while an optional 201&amp;nbsp;hp 4.2L V6 (the base engine of the Ford E-150) was standard for Canada and export vans.  The 3.9L and 4.2L V6 engines were both enlarged versions of the long-running 3.8L V6.  As part of the initiative to improve driveline reliability, the 4-speed automatic transmission saw upgrades for improved shifting and reliability.

In the redesign, the Ford Freestar saw a minor exterior facelift.  While retaining much of the roofline of the previous-generation Windstar, in a shift away from New Edge design language, the Freestar adopted styling elements from several Ford vehicles, including the [[Ford Explorer]], [[Ford Taurus X|Ford Freestyle]], and [[Ford Five Hundred]].  Shifting from the trademark curved dashboard of the previous Ford Windstar, the Ford Freestar adopted a flat dashboard, sharing many design elements with the then-upcoming Ford Five Hundred.  In line with a number of competitive minivans, the Ford Freestar introduced a third-row seat that folded flat into the floor.

=== Trim levels ===
The Freestar carried much of the trim lineup from the Windstar, with two exceptions.  The "LX" and "Sport" trim levels were dropped in favor of the "SES" and "S" trims.
*''S'' (2004-2005) Included: cloth upholstery, 3.9L V6 engine, 16" steel rims with hubcaps, keyless entry, an AM/FM stereo, power locks, power windows with automatic driver's side window, adjustable pedals, power points, and manual sliding doors.
*''SE''  (2004–2007) Included: 3.9L V6 engine, three-row seating, air conditioning (on 2006-2007 models), an AM/FM radio with single-CD player and digital clock and four speakers, power mirrors, locks and windows, tinted rear windows, keyless entry, and 16" steel rims with hubcaps.
*''SES'' (2004-2005) Added: 16" sport alloy rims, tri-zone air conditioning, and power driver's seat. 
*''SEL''  (2004–2007) Added: 4.2L V6 engine, 6-way power driver's seat, overhead console, leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls, an AM/FM stereo with single-CD and cassette players (cassette removed in 2006) and clock, rear seat audio controls, high-capacity air-conditioning, and 16" alloy rims. 
*''Limited'' (2004–2007) Added: 3rd row reading lights, an AM/FM stereo with single CD/Cassette players (later, AM/FM stereo with single-CD player with speed-sensitive volume and rear audio controls), analog clock, turn signal mirrors, message center, power-sliding doors, automatic climate control, and 17" alloy rims (later, 16" clad alloy rims).

=== IIHS crash test results ===
The 2004–2007 Ford Freestar received a "Good" rating in the offset frontal crash test from the IIHS and outperformed the 1999–2003 Ford Windstar, but resulted in moderate injuries only on the head and neck. In the side-impact tests, it received a "Poor" rating without the optional side airbags for poor structural performance, potential head and neck injuries, and high forces on the driver's torso, but fared better with the side airbags, earning an overall "Acceptable" rating, but resulted in a moderate head and neck injury to the driver.

=== Mercury Monterey ===
{{For|the 1950–1974 full-size car|Mercury Monterey}}
[[File:MercuryMonterey.jpg|thumb|Mercury Monterey|alt=]]
For the 2004 model year, the Ford Windstar/Freestar gained a Mercury counterpart with the introduction of the '''Mercury Monterey''', replacing the [[Mercury Villager]].  In line with Ford introducing "F" nameplates during the early 2000s, Mercury revived a historic "M" nameplate for its minivan (the Monterey name was used from 1950 to 1974).  In line with the Freestar, the Monterey adopted design elements from other Mercury vehicles, including the Mountaineer and Montego.  Larger than the Villager, it was marketed as a competitor to the [[Buick Terraza]] (which replaced the [[Oldsmobile Silhouette]]) and the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]].     

In line with the later Mariner, Milan, and Montego, three trim levels were offered for the Monterey: Convenience, Luxury, and Premier.  Features such as power-sliding doors and a rear-seat DVD player were available on Luxury and Premier trim lines.  Unique to the Premier was the option of heated and cooled front seats, a class exclusive at the time.  The Monterey was offered solely with the 4.2 L V6 engine.  

Sales of the Monterey fell far under projections, driven primarily by an overall decline of the minivan segment in North America.  In total, 32,195 examples were sold over its three-year production run.  

{{-}}

== Replacement ==
After selling far under sales projections, Ford discontinued the Freestar and Monterey after the 2007 model year. The final Monterey was produced by Oakville Assembly on August 25, 2006; the final Freestar was produced on December 29, 2006.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

In Mexico and export markets, Ford largely replaced the Freestar by the [[Ford Transit#Fifth generation (2006–2013)|V185 Ford Transit/Tourneo]] (front-wheel drive).  In North America, Ford became the first American manufacturer to withdraw from the minivan segment entirely, with Ford shifting towards tall station wagons, with the [[Ford Taurus X|Ford Taurus X (Freestyle)]] marketed as a 7-passenger vehicle by Ford; in 2009, the Taurus X was replaced by the [[Ford Flex|Flex]].             

For 2010, Ford began imports of the [[Ford Transit Connect]] compact MPV.  While imported in passenger-van configuration, most sales were intended for cargo-van users.  As part of a 2014 redesign, the Transit Connect gained a 7-passenger configuration; though offered with a 120-inch wheelbase (nearly identical to the Windstar/Freestar/Monterey), most other dimensions of the second-generation Transit Connect LWB more closely match the extended-length Aerostar in size.

The '''Ford C-Max''' (stylized as '''Ford C-MAX''' and previously called the '''Ford Focus C-Max''') is a [[compact MPV|compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV)]] produced by the [[Ford Motor Company]] since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=25711 |title=New Ford C-Max production begins in Saarlouis, Germany |publisher=Media.ford.com |accessdate=2010-10-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525173914/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=25711 |archivedate=2011-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Ford Grand C-Max''' has a longer [[wheelbase]].

Ford introduced the C-Max in the United States as its first [[Hybrid vehicle|hybrid-only]] line of vehicles, which includes the '''C-Max Hybrid''', released in September 2012, and the '''C-Max Energi''' [[plug-in hybrid]], launched in October 2012. Although the C-Max was initially available only in Europe, the first generation was partially available in New Zealand.

C-Max Mk I was the first product to use the [[Ford C1 platform]], also used by the [[Ford Focus (second generation, Europe)|Ford Focus Mk II]] and the compact MPV [[Mazda Premacy|Premacy/Mazda5]]. Its internal code name is C214.

It seats five passengers and has a large amount of cargo space, which can be increased by folding the rear seats flat. Some models feature diagonally sliding outer rear seats. It also shares the control blade independent rear suspension from the Focus.

===Engines and transmissions===
The available [[inline-four engine|four-cylinder engines]] are the same as the Focus.&lt;br /&gt;
'''1.6 L''' [[Ford Sigma engine|Duratec]] was the basic engine for C-Max, 1.6 L Ti-VCT Duratec was also available.&lt;br /&gt;
'''1.8/2.0 L''' [[Ford Duratec engine|Duratec HE]] are the rest of available petrol engines&lt;br /&gt;
'''1.6/2.0 L''' [[Ford Duratorq engine|Duratorq]] Ford/PSA made diesels were available along with Ford's 1.8 L [[Ford Endura-D engine|Endura]] engine which is upgraded and named Duratorq&lt;br /&gt;

===Facelift===
In December 2006, the facelifted version of the C-Max was revealed at the 2006 [[Bologna Motor Show]] and went on sale in late spring 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=24947&amp;make_id=trust Ford Motor Company - Press Release - Ford Previews New C-Max At Bologna Motor Show] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125214513/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=24947&amp;make_id=trust |date=January 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-facelift version of the car (2003–2007) was called the Ford Focus C-Max. The name change to C-Max is attributable to Ford's MPV strategy of creating a 'Max' branded line of MPVs, starting with the [[Ford S-Max]], launched in 2006.

The facelift brought the car in line with Ford's 'Kinetic Design' design language, evidenced through its twin trapezoidal grilles, large wheel arches and angular headlights. However, as the car does not have a bodyshell originally designed for 'Kinetic Design,' Ford officially states that the car contains only 'elements' of the design language.

Alongside the third generation [[Ford Focus (third generation)|Ford Focus Mk III]], the second generation C-Max (C344) is built on Ford's new [[Ford C1 Platform|Global C platform]]. The appearance is inspired by the [[Ford Iosis#Iosis MAX|Iosis Max]] concept, shown at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show. In addition, Ford added a long wheelbase, seven-seat [[minivan]] variant of the C-Max, the Ford Grand C-Max&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/news/autoexpressnews/234878/new_focus_on_horizon.html|title=New Focus on horizon|publisher=autoexpress.co.uk|date=2009-03-30|accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vehicle was unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paukert |first=Chris |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/09/03/ford-teases-new-five-seat-c-max-people-mover-ahead-of-frankfurt/ |title=Ford teases 2011 five-seat C-Max people mover ahead of Frankfurt debut |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=2009-09-03 |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early European models include 5 seats, and 7-seat models entered the market at the end of 2010 (except Russia, where there is only the 7-seat model). At the 2011 [[North American International Auto Show]], Ford announced a 7-seat C-MAX for the North American market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abuelsamid |first=Sam |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/09/15/all-new-2011-ford-focus-to-debut-at-detroit-auto-show/ |title=All new 2011 Ford Focus to debut at Detroit Auto Show |publisher=Auto blog.com |date=2009-09-15 |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this model was cancelled prior to launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Korzeniewski |first=Jeremy |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2011/06/09/ford-cancels-seven-passenger-c-max-for-north-america-focuses-so/ |title=Official: Ford cancels seven-passenger C-Max for U.S., focuses solely on Hybrid and Energi models |publisher=Auto Blog |date=2011-06-09 |accessdate=2011-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford unveiled the Ford C-Max Energi [[plug-in hybrid]] and the C-Max Hybrid at the 2011 [[North American International Auto Show]]. Like the conventional C-Max, the C-Max Energi and Hybrid are five-seat only. They replace the [[Ford Escape|Ford Escape Hybrid]] and [[Mercury Mariner|Mercury Mariner Hybrid]] since Ford discontinued the [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] brand after the 2011 [[model year]] and the Escape Hybrid after the 2012 year model. The C-Max is Ford's first hybrid-only line of vehicles. Both the plug-in and hybrid version designs are based on the European gasoline- and diesel-powered versions.&lt;ref name="SFC101212"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/C-Max-Hybrid-A-Ford-challenges-Prius-3915780.php|title=C-Max Hybrid: A Ford challenges Prius|date=2012-10-12|work=[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]|author=Ann M. Job|accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The C-Max Hybrid was released in the United States in September 2012 as a 2013 [[model year]],&lt;ref name="USales0912" /&gt; followed by the release of the plug-in Energi version by mid October 2012.&lt;ref name="EnergiSales"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plugincars.com/fords-evs-starting-slow-and-waiting-market-125120.html|title=Ford's Electric Cars: Starting Slow, and Waiting for the Market|date=2012-11-02|publisher=PluginCars.com|author=Jim Motavalli|accessdate=2012-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production of the C-Max Energi in the United States ended in September 2017, while Hybrid production ended in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motortrend.com/news/ford-discontinues-c-max-production-for-u-s-market/ |title=Ford will discontinue C-Max production for U.S. market |publisher=Motor Trend |date= |accessdate=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features===
The new Mk III platform is the first in its class to support [[Torque Vectoring]] Control (TVC).&lt;ref name="fordfan1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordfan.de/fordcars/fordhighlights/ford-grand-c-max_3014/der-neue-ford-c-max-im-detail_2469/index.html |title=Ford Grand C-MAX / FordHighlights / FordCars / Ford Fan Site |publisher=Fordfan.de |date=2010-09-15 |accessdate=2011-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The redesigned C-Max features flat folding third row seats, a hands free power lift gate, rear view camera, park assist, and panoramic sunroof. HD Radio, Sirius XM, Sync, dual-zone climate control system, and navigation system come as standard or as available options on the different trim lines.

The aerodynamics ([[drag coefficient]], ''c&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'') of the car has been improved, being 0,30 for the 5 seater and 0,32 for the Grand C-Max.&lt;ref name="fordfan1"/&gt;

===Conventional engines and transmissions===
Like the previous C-Max, the new C-Max also comes with a range of petrol and diesel [[inline-four engine|four-cylinder engines]] which are shared with the Focus:
* '''1.0 L''' [[Ford Ecoboost engine|Ecoboost]] comes available in two states of tune, alongside the 1.6 - 100&amp;nbsp;hp and 125&amp;nbsp;hp guises.
* '''1.6 L''' [[Ford Sigma engine|Duratec Ti-VCT]] is available in three spec, 85PS, {{Convert|105|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and 125PS

The gasoline-electric hybrid model base pricing starts at {{USD|24,995}}, including destination and delivery.&lt;ref name=WP0712/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nadaguides.com/Cars/2017/Ford/C-Max-Hybrid/SE-FWD/Pricing|title=New 2017 Ford C-Max Hybrid SE FWD MSRP Prices|website=NADAguides|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Specifications ====
[[File:Ford C-Max Hybrid Automobile on Display at the Entrance to the Ford Michigan Assembly Plant.JPG|thumb|left|Ford C-Max Hybrid on display at the entrance to Ford's [[Wayne Stamping &amp; Assembly]] plant]]
The front-wheel drive hybrid has a 2-liter four-cylinder [[Atkinson cycle]] engine mated to an electric motor and a 1.4 [[kWh]] [[lithium-ion battery]] for total power output of 188&amp;nbsp;hp (140&amp;nbsp;kW). The top speed in [[all-electric mode]] of {{convert|65|mph|abbr=on}} and the car's top speed in hybrid mode is {{convert|115|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=SFC101212/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC070812/&gt;&lt;ref name=Specs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ford.com/cars/cmax/specifications/engine/ |title=2013 C-MAX Specifications - Engine |author=Ford Motor Co. |publisher=Ford |accessdate=2012-10-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929044650/http://www.ford.com/cars/cmax/specifications/engine/ |archive-date=2012-09-29 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hybrid has a maximum cargo volume of {{convert|52.6|cuft|L|abbr=on}} with rear seats folded flat, and {{convert|24.5|cuft|L|abbr=on}} in the cargo area behind the rear seats, providing more room than the regular Prius liftback, but less cargo room than the [[Prius v]], which provides {{convert|67.3|cuft|L|abbr=on}} with the rear seats folded.&lt;ref name=SFC101212/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford.com/cars/cmax/specifications/capacities/|title=2013 C-MAX Specifications - Capacities|author=Ford Motor Co.|publisher=Ford|accessdate=2012-10-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123024831/http://www.ford.com/cars/cmax/specifications/capacities/|archive-date=2014-01-23|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hybrid''' is offered in two trims:

The '''SE''' features [[eco-friendly]] cloth seating surfaces, [[Ford SYNC]] system with A/M-F/M stereo with single-disc CD/MP3 player, [[USB]] and [[Jack (connector)|auxiliary]] input jacks, six speakers, a multi-informational gauge cluster and color display screen, keyless entry, alloy wheels, and split-folding rear bench seat, plus a security alarm.

For the 2017 model year, the SEL trim level on both the C-Max Hybrid and Energi will be renamed to the Titanium trim level and also all the 2017 Ford C-Max Hybrids and plug-in Energis are expected to have restyled headlights and taillights.

The '''Energi Plug-In Hybrid''' is only available in '''SEL''' trim. But for the 2017 model year the C-Max Energi is also available on the SE trim level.

==== EPA ratings ====
Ford's design aimed for the C-Max Hybrid to deliver better [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] than the [[Toyota Prius v]].&lt;ref name=GCC121411/&gt; Ford had reduced its estimated fuel economy twice, once in 2013 and again in 2014, with the second revision placing fuel economy below the Prius V.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.cars.com/kickingtires/2014/06/fords-revised-mileage-figures-match-what-weve-observed-mostly.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[US Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) initially rated the hybrid model at {{convert|47|mpgus|abbr=on}} with the same rating for combined/city/highway cycles. These ratings allowed the C-Max Hybrid to improve the fuel economy of the Toyota Prius v by 3 mpg&lt;sub&gt;-US&lt;/sub&gt; on the city cycle, by 7 mpg&lt;sub&gt;-US&lt;/sub&gt; on the highway cycle and by 5 mpg&lt;sub&gt;-US&lt;/sub&gt; combined.&lt;ref name=GCC070812&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2012/08/cmax-20120807.html|title=Ford C-MAX Hybrid EPA-rated at 47 mpg city, 47 mpg highway; plug-in Energi version offers 85 mph top electric speed |author=Ford Media|publisher=Green Car Congress|date=2012-08-07|accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after criticism and lawsuits about worse-than-expected real-world fuel economy, in August 2013 Ford voluntarily lowered the EPA ratings and issued customer rebates.

Ford boosted the on-road fuel efficiency of its three 2013 model year hybrids through changes in the cars' vehicle control software in an effort to improve customer satisfaction. The upgrade was offered free of charge to existing owners of these hybrids. Some of the changes include:&lt;ref name=Upgrade&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1085595_2013-ford-c-max-fusion-hybrids-to-be-modified-to-boost-mpg-in-real-world-use|title=2013 Ford C-Max, Fusion Hybrids To Be Modified To Boost MPG In Real-World Use |author=John Voelcker |publisher=Green Car Reports|date=2013-07-17|accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Increasing the maximum pure electric speed from {{convert|62|to|85|mph|abbr=on}}, allowing increased use of electric-only mode on the highway
* Optimizing the use of Active Grille Shutters to reduce aerodynamic drag under more driving and temperature conditions including cold weather, during air conditioner use and when the engine coolant temperature is higher
* Reducing the electric fan speed as a function of coolant temperature to minimize the fan’s energy consumption
* Shortening engine warm-up time by up to 50% to enable electric-only driving and engine shutdown at stops sooner after cold starts
* Optimizing the climate control system to minimize use of the air conditioning compressor and reduce the energy used in cold weather operation.

====Fuel economy controversies====
{{update|section|date=June 2014|The section is missing the fuel economy downgrade that took place in June 2014}}

In December 2012, [[Motor Trend]] reported that [[Consumer Reports]] and Green Car Reports have found that the 2013 Ford C-Max Hybrid and [[Ford Fusion Hybrid#Second generation|2013 Ford Fusion Hybrid]], which share the same powertrain, do not deliver their triple {{convert|47|mpgus|abbr=on}} EPA ratings in real-world use.&lt;ref name=MT1212&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wot.motortrend.com/we-hear-2013-ford-fusion-hybrid-2013-ford-c-max-hybrid-dont-achieve-epa-fuel-economy-ratings-300391.html#axzz2FqEZN68f|title=We Hear: 2013 Ford Fusion Hybrid, C-Max Hybrid Don't Achieve EPA Fuel-Economy Ratings |author= Jake Holmes|work=[[Motor Trend]]|date=2012-12-04|accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CR1212&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.consumerreports.org/cars/2012/12/video-tests-show-2013-ford-fusion-c-max-hybrids-dont-live-up-to-47-mpg-claims.html|title=Tests show Ford Fusion, C-Max hybrids don't live up to 47-mpg claims|author=Consumer Reports|publisher=[[Consumer Reports]]|date=2012-12-06|accessdate=2012-12-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414134501/http://news.consumerreports.org/cars/2012/12/video-tests-show-2013-ford-fusion-c-max-hybrids-dont-live-up-to-47-mpg-claims.html|archive-date=2013-04-14|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GCR1112&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1080580_ford-hybrids-fuel-economy-failing-to-live-up-to-epa-ratings|title=Ford Hybrids' Fuel Economy Failing To Live Up To EPA Ratings? |author=John Voelcker|publisher=Green Car Reports|date=2012-11-20|accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After running both vehicles through Consumer Reports real-world tests, the magazine found that C-Max hybrid achieved a combined fuel economy average of {{convert|37|mpgus|abbr=on}}, with {{convert|35|mpgus|abbr=on}} and {{convert|38|mpgus|abbr=on}} for city and highway.&lt;ref name=CR1212/&gt; Green Car Reports found that the C-Max delivered {{convert|37|mpgus|abbr=on}} over {{convert|50|mi|abbr=on}} of mixed freeway and urban driving, and {{convert|40|mpgus|abbr=on}} over {{convert|240|mi|abbr=on}} mostly at freeway speeds.&lt;ref name=GCR1112/&gt;

Consumer Reports concluded that the overall fuel economy for the C-Max Hybrid is off by 10 mpg, representing a deviation of about 20%. The consumer magazine said that their overall fuel economy results are usually close to the EPA's combined-mpg estimate, and among current models tested, more than 80% fall within 2 mpg margin. The largest discrepancy the magazine has previously found was 7 and 6 mpg for the [[Toyota Prius C]] and the [[Toyota Prius (XW30)|Prius hatchback]], respectively.&lt;ref name=CR1212/&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT1212/&gt; Ford responded in a statement, saying that, "''Early C-MAX Hybrid and Fusion Hybrid customers praise the vehicles and report a range of fuel economy figures, including some reports above 47 mpg. This reinforces the fact that driving styles, driving conditions, and other factors can cause mileage to vary''."&lt;ref name=LAT1212&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-ford-inflated-fuel-economy-20121206,0,1964927.story|title=Consumer Reports says Ford Fusion, C-Max don't achieve MPG claims |author=Jerry Hirsch|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2012-12-06|accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DT1212/&gt;

A few days later the Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) said it would review claims that two new Ford hybrid vehicles were not delivering the advertised 47 mpg. Linc Wehrly, Director of Light-duty Vehicle Center Compliance Division at EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] commented that hybrids had far more variability in miles per gallon than conventional vehicles. All vehicles are run through the same EPA fuel-efficiency test but the test is not administered by the EPA; instead the automakers conduct the test and EPA often conducts reviews. Most vehicles's real-world gas mileage is less than the EPA sticker number, and can often be 20% less than depending on speed, temperature and other factors. The EPA explained that with hybrids the gap was much wider, as high as 30%.&lt;ref name=DT1212&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20121208/AUTO0102/212080368#ixzz2FwSbbWeI|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130122141818/http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20121208/AUTO0102/212080368%23ixzz2FwSbbWeI#ixzz2FwSbbWeI|url-status=dead|title=EPA will review Ford C-Max, Fusion 47 mpg claims|author=David Shepardson and Karl Henkel|work=[[The Detroit News]]|date=2012-12-08|accessdate=2012-12-24|archive-date=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem lay with EPA's rules that allowed automakers to group similar vehicles and apply the same ratings, which Ford did with the Fusion hybrid and C-Max hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woodyard|first=Chris|title=Ford lowers C-Max hybrid's mpg rating, offers rebates|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/08/15/ford-cmax-mp/2660371/|work=USA Today|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford Motor Co. officials said the real-world fuel-efficiency in the C-Max Hybrid depended on driving style and other factors, and that the company did not expect the car's fuel efficiency numbers to change, as they followed EPA's test guidelines. Ford said they we re working closely with the EPA to determine if changes were needed for the industry relative to hybrid vehicle testing. They  explained that several factors could affect hybrid fuel economy more than that of regular gasoline engines, including speed (as the difference between 75&amp;nbsp;mph and 65&amp;nbsp;mph could produce a 7-mpg difference in fuel economy); outside temperature (the difference between 40&amp;nbsp;°F and 70&amp;nbsp;°F could result in a 5 mpg difference); and vehicle break-in (a 5 mpg difference could occur from the difference 0 miles to 6,0 miles).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20121214/AUTO0102/212140426#ixzz2FwWJSPE7|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130121123808/http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20121214/AUTO0102/212140426%23ixzz2FwWJSPE7#ixzz2FwWJSPE7|url-status=dead|title=Ford stands behind fuel efficiency numbers for C-Max Hybrid|author=KARL HENKEL|work=[[The Detroit News]]|date=2012-12-14|accessdate=2012-12-24|archive-date=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2012/12/cmax-20121215.html|title=Ford's math on hybrid fuel economy; standing by the C-MAX EPA ratings, acknowledging large real-world variance|publisher=Green Car Congress|date=2012-12-15|accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the criticism and lawsuits, in July 2013 Ford announced it would boost the on-road fuel efficiency of the C-Max and its other two 2013 hybrids through changes in the vehicle control software, in an effort to improve customer satisfaction.&lt;ref name=Upgrade/&gt; In August 2013, the carmaker voluntarily reduced the official EPA ratings in August 2013.&lt;ref name=NewEPArating/&gt; They also announced they would issue rebates to some 32,000 C-Max owners who would be notified by mail. The payment would be {{USD|550}} to U.S. customers who purchased C-Maxes, and {{USD|325}} to customers who had leased them.&lt;ref name=NewEPArating/&gt;

After the Ford announcement, the EPA stated that it will update the test procedures used to assign fuel economy ratings to cars "''to ensure that the requirements keep pace with industry trends and innovations in advanced high-efficiency vehicles''." Ford used the Fusion Hybrid test to generate the fuel economy label for the C-Max Hybrid following EPA's rules. These, which date to the 1970s, specify that automakers can use the same fuel economy numbers for similar-size vehicles equipped with the same engines and transmissions. The EPA requires automakers to test the fuel economy of the biggest-selling model in a specific category. In its midsize hybrid class, Ford tested the Fusion sedan version because it was the top seller, and Ford was allowed to apply the {{convert|47|mpgus|abbr=on}} achieved with the Fusion Hybrid in combined, city and highway driving to the C-Max hybrid. Ford has no plans to change the fuel economy ratings on the 2013 Fusion hybrid.&lt;ref name=NewEPArating/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/business/us-to-bring-gas-mileage-rules-to-era-of-hybrids.html?ref=automobiles&amp;_r=1&amp;|title=U.S. to Bring Gas Mileage Rules to Era of Hybrids |author=Bill Vlasic|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2013-08-15|accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Specifications ====
The C-Max Energi was designed with total 188&amp;nbsp;hp (140&amp;nbsp;kW) in hybrid mode delivered by a 2.0-liter [[Atkinson cycle]] four-cylinder gasoline engine plus an electric motor powered by a 7.6 [[kWh]] [[lithium-ion battery]] pack, which is smaller and lighter than [[Nickel–metal hydride battery|nickel metal hydride batteries]] used in previous Ford generation hybrids.&lt;ref name=Specs/&gt;&lt;ref name=HC1012/&gt; The electric drivetrain can produce a peak power of 68&amp;nbsp;kW, limited by the size of the electric motor and the power delivery capability of the battery pack, and delivers a total system power of 195&amp;nbsp;hp (150&amp;nbsp;kW) in [[charge-depleting]] mode (EV mode).&lt;ref name=Specs/&gt; The C-Max Energi is capable of reaching a top electric-only speed of {{convert|85|mph|abbr=on}}, exceeding the [[Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid]] by more than {{convert|20|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=GCC070812/&gt; The top speed in hybrid mode is {{convert|115|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Specs/&gt;

The C-Max Energi uses a [[regenerative braking]] system capable of capturing and reusing more than 95% of the braking energy normally lost during the braking process. The charging time for the C-Max Energi is 7 hours with a 120 volt charger, and 2.5 hours with a 240 volt charger. The charge port has a LED light ring like the [[Ford Focus Electric]] and is located on the driver’s side and near the front of the car. The light ring illuminates to indicate charge status. The battery is covered by an eight years or {{convert|100000|mi|abbr=on}} component warranty.&lt;ref name=Specs/&gt;&lt;ref name=HC1012/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC0712&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2012/07/cmaxenergi-20120720.html|title=Ford expects 95 MPGe combined fuel economy, 20-mile all electric range from C-MAX Energi plug-in hybrid|author=Ford media (press release)|publisher=Green Car Congress|date=2012-07-20|accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford equipped the C-Max Energi with a button mounted in the center stack that enables drivers to choose an electric-only driving mode, and allows the driver to switch vehicle operation between three modes: electric-only driving without gasoline engine power ("EV Now" setting); normal hybrid mode where the powertrain blends electric and gasoline engine power as appropriate ("EV Auto" setting); or a battery-saving mode that reserves the battery power for later use ("EV Later" setting).&lt;ref name=GCC070812/&gt; Like the [[Ford Fusion Hybrid]], the C-Max Energi comes with a SmartGauge with EcoGuide that provides in-vehicle customizable displays, including instantaneous fuel economy readings and coaching functions to help drivers understand and optimize their fuel efficiency. The plug-in hybrid also features ECO Cruise which saves energy by relaxing acceleration compared to standard [[cruise control]].&lt;ref name=Specs/&gt;&lt;ref name=HC1012/&gt;

The '''Ford Transit Bus''' was a [[midibus|medium-duty]] [[transit bus]] produced by [[Ford Motor Corporation|Ford]] from 1936 to 1947. The engine was originally placed at the front, but a rear-engine version replaced the original design in 1939. Ford constructed the chassis, which were then fitted with bodies constructed by the [[Union City Body Company]] of [[Union City, Indiana]]. Canadian versions were built from chassis fabricated in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] and bodies produced by Brantford Coach &amp; Body, from 1941 to 1943.&lt;ref name=MCA&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ford Buses|journal=[[Motor Coach Age]]|date=March–April 1992|volume=45|issue=3–4|pages=24–31|publisher=[[Motor Bus Society]]|issn=0739-117X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Front-engine model==
The first Transit Bus was a prototype that Ford loaned to Detroit Street Railways (DSR), of [[Detroit, Michigan]], in June 1936.  After DSR placed an order for 500, Ford began series production, and deliveries began on November 27, 1936 (which Ford considered to be within its "1937" model year).&lt;ref name=MCA/&gt;  The front-engine or forward-control, design used a {{convert|157|in|cm|adj=on}} chassis, Ford model 70, and had a {{convert|141|in|cm|adj=on}} wheelbase.&lt;ref name=MCA/&gt;  An 85&amp;nbsp;hp, 221-cubic-inch [[Ford flathead V8 engine|Ford "flathead" V-8 engine]] was used. Under a new model-numbering scheme, the 70 chassis was renumbered 81-B in the 1938 model year and 91-B in 1939.&lt;ref name=MCA/&gt; 

Around 1,000 of the original Transit Bus model were built under the standard production arrangement, with bodies built by Union City. However, some customers preferred to use bodies built by other companies, and it is estimated that around 200 buses were built under this arrangement.  Strictly speaking, these were not "Transit Buses", but used the same Ford chassis – model 70, 81-B or 91-B, depending on model year – that Ford was using for its Transit Bus model.&lt;ref name=MCA/&gt;  Of the approximately 1,000–1,200 front-engine Transit Buses built, DSR alone was the purchaser of 750.&lt;ref name=MCA/&gt;

==Rear-engine model==
In early 1939, Ford redesigned the Transit Bus as a rear-engine model, to improve performance through better weight distribution.  At the same time, the redesign used a new, larger V-8 engine: a 95&amp;nbsp;hp, 239-cubic-inch model.  A prototype bus was built in February 1939, and series production began in October 1939 (in the 1940 model year).&lt;ref name=MCA/&gt;  The rear-engine model had a slightly longer wheelbase, {{convert|148.5|in|cm|adj=off}}.  The standard, two-door version had 27 passenger seats. The bodies continued to be supplied by the Union City Body Company. Other manufacturers were no longer building bodies for Ford Transit Buses by this time, only Union City.&lt;ref name=MCA/&gt;

Approximately 12,500 rear-engine Ford Transits were built during their eight-year production run, from 1939 to 1947.&lt;ref name=MCA/&gt; Along with Detroit, major customers were the [[Capital Transit Company]] of Washington D.C.; the [[Philadelphia Transportation Company]]; [[Chicago Surface Lines]]; San Antonio, Texas; [[the Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light Company]]; the [[Dallas Railway &amp; Terminal Company]], Dallas, Texas; the [[Toronto Transportation Commission]] and [[Boston Elevated Railway]]. The [[Public Service Railway|Public Service Interstate Transportation Company]] of New Jersey had the largest fleet, with a total of 586 new and seven secondhand units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Gary |date=July–August 1977 |title=Ford Transit |journal= Model Coach News |issue=5 |pages=5–7 |location= Somerville MA |publisher=Gary Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Gary |date=October–November 1982|title=Remembering the little Fords |journal= Model Transport |issue=2 |pages=41–43 |location=Chicago |publisher=Don Wolters Design Advertising}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_12207-Ford-Transit-09-B-1939.html |title=1939 Ford Transit (09-B) |author="Yvon52" |date=14 November 2006 |work=Internet Movie Cars Database |accessdate=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, the Transit Bus was rebranded as the Universal Bus in Ford's marketing, but remained commonly known as the Transit Bus. Postwar demand was high, and 4,800 buses were sold during 1946 and 1947.  However, production ended in September 1947. Changes in Ford's production and distribution arrangements fostered the designing of a replacement model, designated the 8MB, the prototype chassis for which was also built in September 1947.&lt;ref name=MCA/&gt;

The Kuga went on sale in the first half of 2008, and was built at Ford's plant in [[Saarlouis]], Germany. In the United Kingdom, emphasising the car's premium market aspirations, only high end Zetec and Titanium specifications are offered. The combined fuel consumption is {{convert|44.1|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus|abbr=on}} and the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions are 169 g/km.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.kugaownersclub.co.uk/News/Ford-Kuga-4x4-goes-on-sale-in-June-from-20-495.asp Ford Kuga Press Release (UK)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120223434/http://www.kugaownersclub.co.uk/News/Ford-Kuga-4x4-goes-on-sale-in-June-from-20-495.asp |date=20 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Worldwide markets ===
A report from 20 July 2007 indicated Ford executives were considering the prospects of sales in North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motorauthority.com/cars/ford/ford-kuga-and-c-max-destined-for-us/ Ford Kuga and C-Max destined for US?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629112155/http://www.motorauthority.com/cars/ford/ford-kuga-and-c-max-destined-for-us/ |date=29 June 2008 }} - Motor Authority&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was later scrapped, after it was determined the car could not be sold both competitively priced and at a profit in the United States, due to the current dollar euro [[exchange rate]].

On 24 July 2008, [[WDIV-TV]] announced that Ford was reconsidering bringing the Kuga to North America after all. On 22 October 2009, news leaked that Ford would build the Kuga at its Louisville plant, possibly as the 2012 [[Ford Escape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freep.com/article/20091022/BUSINESS0102/91022076/1319/Ford-to-build-European-small-SUV-in-Kentucky |title=Ford to build European small SUV in Kentucky |date=July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026194713/http://freep.com/article/20091022/BUSINESS0102/91022076/1319/Ford-to-build-European-small-SUV-in-Kentucky |archivedate=26 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June 2010, Ford announced it would end production of the second generation Escape in 2011 in anticipation of the Kuga's North American launch as the next-generation Escape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2010/06/23/report-ford-to-halt-missouri-escape-production-in-2011?icid=sphere_blogsmith_inpage_autoblog "Report: Ford to halt Missouri Escape production in 2011"] from Autoblog (23 June 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The Ford Kuga has also been available in Argentina since 2010; in Japan, South Africa and New Zealand since 2011; and in Australia since March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/149796/2012-ford-kuga-compact-suv-here-in-march/ |title=2012 Ford Kuga compact SUV here in March |accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A facelift was released in the end of 2010, after being revealed in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/news/autoexpressnews/254029/ford_kuga_gets_a_facelift.html |title=Ford Kuga gets a facelift &amp;#124; Spy-Shots |work=Auto Express |accessdate=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The redesigned Kuga formed the basis for the 2013 Ford Escape sold in the United States. Ford announced in May 2010 that it would build unspecified hybrids at a plant in Valencia, Spain and likely offer a hybrid option of both vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2013 Ford Kuga |url=http://newelectriccars2014.com/2013-ford-kuga/ |website=Electrical cars 2013-14 |publisher=Latest electric cars 2014 |date=30 April 2013 |accessdate=8 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108225745/http://newelectriccars2014.com/2013-ford-kuga/ |archive-date=8 November 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kuga Hybrid would be Ford's first hybrid to be sold in Europe, though it has sold over 100,000 Escape Hybrids and Mercury Mariner Hybrids in the United States since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarreports.com/blog/1047892_2012-ford-kuga-hybrid-or-will-it-be-2012-ford-escape-hybrid |title=2012 Ford Kuga |publisher=GreenCarReports |accessdate=5 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204070127/http://www.greencarreports.com/blog/1047892_2012-ford-kuga-hybrid-or-will-it-be-2012-ford-escape-hybrid |archive-date=4 December 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third generation Escape is largely identical to the Ford Kuga.&lt;ref name=aw20120514&gt;{{cite journal |last=Raynal |first=Wes |title=New Leader? |journal=[[Autoweek]] |date=14 May 2012 |volume=62 |issue=10 |pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first shown at the 2011 [[Los Angeles Auto Show]]. Two [[EcoBoost]] inline four cylinder turbocharged engines are offered. The basic engine is a 2.5 litre naturally aspirated [[inline-four engine]]. 

The new Escape is the first Ford vehicle to offer a new 1.6 litre unit. In the process of revamping the Escape's engine lineup, both the Hybrid model with its 2.5 litre [[Atkinson cycle|Atkinson]] powertrain and the 3.0 litre V6 engine have been dropped. 

Ford claims that the [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] of the new 1.6 litre EcoBoost engine will match that of the previous Ford Escape Hybrid, while the new 2.0 litre engine produces more torque than the current V6 unit. The transmission is a six speed automatic.&lt;ref name=aw20120514/&gt; 

The new generation of the Ford Escape is 10&amp;nbsp;percent more aerodynamic than the previous generation&lt;ref name="Ford Website (Scroll down to Aerodynamic Design)"&gt;{{cite web |title=2014 Ford Escape SUV |url=http://www.ford.com/suvs/escape/ |work=www.ford.com |publisher=Ford Motor Company |location=Dearborn, Michigan |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419141422/http://www.ford.com/suvs/escape/ |archivedate=19 April 2014 |accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also new for the model year of 2013 is [[MyFord Touch]], which is currently available on many Ford vehicles. The newest software version of the MyFord Touch System will offer an all new [[user interface]] and additional features.

Another new feature is the optional hands free liftgate. A person carrying the [[keyless entry]] transmitter can raise a foot under the rear bumper of the Escape to  open the tailgate.&lt;ref name=aw20120514/&gt; This feature will also be available on the [[Ford C-Max Hybrid]] later in the year, and was introduced on that vehicle in Europe.

The [[Ford C-Max Hybrid]] replaced the Escape's hybrid model. Eco friendly seat fabrics are standard on lower trim levels, as well as the vehicle's carpeting being mostly constructed from [[recycled]] plastic water bottles. This allows the new Escape to be mostly [[recyclable]] at the end of its life cycle.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The Escape was offered with [[front wheel drive]] in the S trim level, and [[front wheel drive]] or [[all wheel drive]] in the SE, SEL, and Titanium trim levels. Production of the 2013 Ford Escape began 11 April. The production of the 2012 Ford Escape ended on 28 April 2012, overlapping slightly in production with the 2013 model due to plant issues, with limited availability of the model year 2012 Ford Escape vehicles being available at Ford showrooms. 

As of May 2012, the third generation Escape became available at most dealerships across the United States, and was introduced in Canada starting June. 

The SEL trim was discontinued after the model year of 2013 but was reintroduced for the model year of 2018. For the model year of 2015 in the United States and Canada, Ford updated the standard naturally aspirated 2.5 litre four cylinder's specification to {{convert|168|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|170|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque.

On 18 November 2015, Ford unveiled a refreshened mid-cycle update of the Escape, which went on sale in the beginning of 2016. The refresh added an Edge inspired front fascia while tweaking the rear end that now sports reshaped LED taillights and a newly adopted two slat, hexagonal grille. The interior is also adjusted slightly in the cabin area and on the steering wheel. 

The Sync 3 infotainment system is added as a new feature, along with a new smartphone app called Sync Connect, which allows owners to remotely monitor their vehicle, check fuel levels, lock and unlock doors, and start the engine. The 2.5 and 2.0 EcoBoost engine line up were joined by a new {{convert|179|hp|abbr=on}} 1.5 litre, turbocharged four cylinder option, replacing the 1.6L.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2015/11/18/2017-ford-escape-la-2015/ "2017 Ford Escape gets all edgy for LA"] from ''Autoblog'' (18 November 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford engineers promise additional refinement to the 2017 Escape, particularly as evidenced by extremely low road and wind noise levels. The doors and B pillars are insulated, the front wheel wells lined and acoustic glass used for the side windows. There are also new seals for the windshield and hood. The new Escape showcased a number of new to it features from little things like faster charging USB ports to an app that lets drivers unlock the vehicle and start the engine through a smartphone. 

Dubbed Sync Connect, this feature helps to locate the vehicle in a crowded parking lot, check the fuel level and alert the owner when service is due. A number of driver assist features will be available: enhanced park assist, lane-keeping, forward collision warning and adaptive cruise control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Scott-AutoFile |url=http://www.autofile.ca/en-ca/car-reviews/first-look-at-the-2017-ford-escape |title=First look at the 2017 Ford Escape |publisher=Autofile.ca |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production of the facelifted 2017 Ford Escape started on 18 March 2016, at the [[Louisville Assembly Plant]] in Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2016/03/18/2017-escape.html |title=2017 Escape debuts new SYNC 3 with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto; new quality checks improve Ford's best-selling SUV |publisher=Ford |location=[[Louisville, Kentucky]] |date=18 March 2016 |access-date=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recall===
In March 2017, Ford recalled 692,700 2014 Escapes because of faulty door latches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krisher|first1=Tom|title=Ford recalls 570,000 vehicles for engine fire risk, door latch trouble|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/ford-recalls-570000-vehicles-for-engine-fire-risk-door-latch-trouble/article34471584/|accessdate=1 April 2017|work=The Globe and Mail|agency=AP|date=29 Mar 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fire hazard===
=====Ford Escape: North America=====
In December 2012, Ford recalled over 70,000 Escapes in the United States and Canada with 1.6 litre engines that may overheat and cause fires, after twelve reports of fire in Escapes were reported to Ford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford recalls 2013 Escape, Fusion: Potential fires in 89,000 cars with 1.6-liter engine|url=http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/ford-recalls-2013-escape-fusion-potential-fires-89000-cars-16-liter-engine|website=Autoweek|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, Ford recalled over 160,000 Escapes with 1.6 EcoBoost engines because of oil and fuel leaks that could lead to engine fires, after 13 fires caused by leaks were reported to Ford; the recall also covered about 12,000 to correct fuel lines installed incorrectly that could become chafed and leak gas.&lt;ref name=FPseventhrecall&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krisher|first1=Tom|title=Ford recalls hot-selling Escape SUV for seventh time after oil and gas leaks linked to 13 fires|url=http://business.financialpost.com/news/transportation/ford-escape-recall|accessdate=1 April 2017|work=The Financial Post|agency=AP|date=27 Nov 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, Ford recalled 2014 Escapes with 1.6 EcoBoost engines because of a risk of engine fires caused by a “lack of coolant circulation”. The recall partly contributed to a charge of US$300 million by Ford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lynch|first1=Jim|title=Ford recalls 230,000 cars over potential engine fires|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2017/03/29/ford-recall/99771750/|accessdate=1 April 2017|work=The Detroit News|date=29 Mar 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ford recalls 440,000 vehicles for fire risk, door latch trouble|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/ford-recalls-1.4045491|accessdate=1 April 2017|agency=AP|publisher=CBC|date=29 Mar 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford South Africa identified the mechanism leading to the majority of fires as overheating caused by a lack of coolant circulation, which could lead to cracking of the [[cylinder head]], resulting in an oil leak and subsequent fire in the engine compartment.&lt;ref name="recall-iol-20170116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ncc-20170116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="combustible-mg"/&gt; The proposed solution would be first to replace and check affected components and systems, and later to improve the cooling and warning systems.&lt;ref name="recall-iol-20170116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="settle-201804" /&gt;

===== New Zealand =====
Television New Zealand reported that a Ford Kuga Titanium 2013 burst into flames in December 2016.  The incident is being investigated by Ford NZ. Ford NZ say that the models being investigated in South Africa were built between 2012 and 2014 and fitted with a 1.6L EcoBoost engine. They also say there are differences between the models sold in South Africa and those sold in New Zealand. 

Until the investigation into the New Zealand incident has been completed, no decision can be made about recalling the 1,300 cars of the same model sold in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/had-rip-car-seat-and-just-got-him-in-time-auckland-woman-reveals-terrifying-close-call-after-her-bursts-into-flames|title='I had to rip the car seat out and just got him out in time' – Auckland woman reveals terrifying close call after her car bursts into flames|newspaper=1 NEWS NOW|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also has sliding second row seats for more legroom.

== Name ==
The vehicle name, Kuga, is strongly reminiscent of the [[cougar]], which was the name of another Ford division's automobile, the [[Mercury Cougar]]. The final of the Cougar from 1998 to 2002 was sold outside of the United States as the Ford Cougar.

The '''Ford Fusion''' is a four-door, five-passenger [[mid-size car|mid-size sedan]] manufactured and marketed by the [[Ford Motor Company]]. Introduced for the 2006 model year, two generations of the Fusion have been produced in gasoline, gas/electric hybrid, and gas/plug-in electric hybrid variants. The Fusion is manufactured at Ford's [[Hermosillo Stamping and Assembly]] plant in [[Sonora, Mexico]], alongside its [[badge engineering|rebadged variant]] the [[Lincoln MKZ]], and formerly the [[Mercury Milan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_24/b3937071_mz058.htm |title=Business Week June 13, 2005 |work=[[Business Week]] |date=June 13, 2005 |accessdate=January 10, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904043512/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_24/b3937071_mz058.htm |archivedate=September 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which share its [[Ford CD3 platform|CD3]] platform. Ford announced in April 2018 that it would discontinue the Fusion within a few years.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2018/04/26/ford-taurus-fiesta-fusion/553539002/&lt;/ref&gt;

Production on the first Fusions began on August 1, 2005.&lt;ref name=Wards06&gt;{{cite book |title= Ward's Automotive Yearbook 2006 |publisher=Ward's Communications, Inc |editor=Binder, Alan K. |year=2006 |page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fusion replaced the [[Ford Mondeo|Mondeo]] for the Latin American markets—except in Argentina (where the current European Mondeo is available) and in the United States and Canada (where it superseded the then mid-size Taurus and the compact [[Ford Contour|Contour]]). The Fusion is positioned between the compact [[Ford Focus (North America)|Ford Focus]] and the full-size [[Ford Taurus]].&lt;ref name="EPA FuelEconomy.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/bymanu.htm |title=Environmental Protection Agency Fuel Economy |department= FuelEconomy.com | publisher= US Department of Energy |accessdate= November 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Middle East]], this model is sold alongside the [[Ford Mondeo|Mondeo]]. Versions sold there are available only with the 2.5-liter engine. Unlike in the United States, Canada, and Latin America, no V6 engine is available in that region.&lt;ref name="DriveArabia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drivearabia.com/ultimatecarbuyerguide/usedcarspage2.php/18|title=Ultimate Car Buyer Guide|work=DriveArabia.com|accessdate=June 1, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923055258/http://drivearabia.com/ultimatecarbuyerguide/usedcarspage2.php/18|archivedate=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same is true in South Korea, where only the 2.5-liter engines (including those for the hybrid model) are available as of the 2012 model year.

The third generation line-up includes a gasoline engine option, an [[Ford EcoBoost engine|EcoBoost engine]] option, a next-generation hybrid model, and a [[plug-in hybrid]] version, the [[Ford Fusion Energi]], making the Ford Fusion the first production sedan to offer these four options. Sales of the gasoline-powered and hybrid versions began in the U.S. in October 2012 under the 2013 model. Sales in Europe and Asia, as Ford Mondeo, are expected to begin in 2015, along with South Africa, where the Fusion name will be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carmag.co.za/news/new-models/2015-ford-fusion-rings-the-changes/ 2015 FORD FUSION RINGS THE CHANGES], ''CAR'', July 15, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Deliveries of the Fusion Energi began in the U.S. in February 2013.

[[File:Washauto06 Ford fusion.jpg|thumb|left|Ford Fusion (US; pre-facelift)]]
The new Fusion was built on [[Ford's CD3 platform]], which was designed by Mazda as the [[Mazda G platform|Mazda G]] platform. The Fusion was the first production car to feature the "new face of Ford" three-bar grille. 

The Fusion was available in S, SE, and SEL trims. The base engine was the {{convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Mazda]]-designed 2.3 L ''[[Ford Duratec engine#Duratec 23|Duratec 23]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]], paired with either a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic transmission, both also designed by Mazda. SE and SEL models were also available with a {{convert|221|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.0&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Ford Duratec engine#Duratec 30|Duratec 30]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] and a 6-speed automatic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
The Fusion shares some interior parts with the otherwise unrelated Mk III [[Ford Mondeo]], such as part of the console and the seats.

The Fusion was heavily based on Mazda designs. Ford used Mazda's G platform, which Ford called the CD3 platform. In addition, the I4 engine, as well as both 5-speed transmissions, were designed by Mazda. The Fusion benefitted greatly from this, with Mazda-like handling and reliability. The Ford designed V6 was actually the only Ford designed major powertrain or chassis component within the Fusion.   

Ford's early advertising campaign for the Fusion in the United States was entitled "Life in Drive", while in Canada it was "Create a Reaction".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.createareaction.ca/app/fo/cars/fusion.do Ford Fusion Cars: Ford Canada&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, the company launched a new campaign for the Fusion titled "Fusion Challenge" (later renamed "Ford Challenge"). The American Ford Fusion emerged the winner over the [[Toyota Camry]] and [[Honda Accord]] based on the attributes of styling, reliability from Consumer Reports, handling, and “fun to drive” in head-to-head comparison tests with the Japanese sedans performed by subscribers of ''[[Car and Driver]]'' and ''[[Road &amp; Track]]'' magazines in the Washington D.C. and Los Angeles regions.

In July 2007, ''[[Motor Trend]]'' reported that Ford's [[Special Vehicle Team]] tuner group planned to release a Fusion GT in late 2009 or early 2010. Its 3.5-liter [[Ford Cyclone engine#TwinForce / EcoBoost|Eco-Boost]] V-6 would make about 340 horsepower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2008/07/07/ford-working-on-high-performance-fusion-gt-ecoboost-stang-on-h/ |title=Ford working on high-performance Fusion GT, EcoBoost 'Stang on hold |work=Autoblog |date=July 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; No such vehicle ever came to fruition.

===Model year changes===

For 2007, all-wheel-drive became available on V6 models. [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] became available as an option on the SE and SEL trims. The front passenger fold-flat seat was introduced and became standard on the SEL and SE trims. The Fusion gained front-seat side [[airbag]]s, a side air curtain, and a [[anti-theft device|perimeter alarm]] as standard features, all of which had previously been available as cost options. An [[auxiliary jack|auxiliary input jack]] for transmission from a [[portable audio player]] was added, along with some equipment modifications.{{clarify|date=October 2019}} A DVD-based navigation system became available.

For the 2008 model year, [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] and [[tire pressure monitoring system|tire pressure monitoring]] became standard features. New optional features included rear parking assist, Ford's [[Ford Sync|SYNC]] multimedia and communication system, and [[mood lighting|ambient interior lighting]]. The DVD navigation was replaced with a new generation system featuring [[voice command]]s, and for the first time navigation was available with manual transmission. Several colors were removed and some others added.{{clarify|date=October 2019}}

Two new packages were added to the options list for 2008:

* '''Sport Appearance Package''', which included such interior and exterior improvements as 18-inch machined aluminum wheels, a [[rear spoiler]], stiffer suspension, body-color [[fog lamp]] surrounds, smoke-colored grille, red seat inserts, and red stitching on leather surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=No SHO: Ford offers Sport Appearance Package for 2008 Ford Fusion |url=https://www.motortrend.com/news/2008-ford-fusion-sport-appearance-package |website=MotorTrend |publisher=MotorTrend |accessdate=May 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Moon and Tune''', which included a power [[moonroof]] and a premium eight-speaker Audiophile sound system with amplifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2008 Ford Fusion gets Sport Package |url=https://www.autoblog.com/2007/10/04/2008-ford-fusion-gets-sport-package/ |website=AutoBlog |accessdate=May 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2009, [[electronic stability control]] was added as an option. A new appearance package with blue trim became available, and revisions were made to the exterior color palette.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

===Trim levels===

For 2006-2009:
* The '''S''' was the base model, including the 2.3L [[Duratec]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]] engine, automatic transmission, manual transmission, AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD player and four speakers plus an auxiliary audio input jack (2007-2009), sixteen-inch steel wheels with plastic wheel covers, cloth seating surfaces, and keyless entry.
* The '''SE''' was the step-up model, adding sixteen inch alloy wheels, AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD/MP3 player, power front driver's seat, and a security system.
* The '''SEL''' was the top-of-the-line model, seventeen inch aluminum wheels, adding power dual front seats and later offering a standard [[Ford SYNC]] system.

In Mexico the Fusion was offered in two trim levels through 2005-06: SE and SEL, with automatic transmission only. For the 2007 model year, the S trim was introduced and a manual transmission was newly available for the S and SE trim levels. These two trims had standard 16-inch alloy wheels, while the SEL trim had 17-inch alloy wheels standard. The 2008 model year added Ford's [[Ford SYNC]] to the SEL trim. The manual transmission was discontinued after 2008 in Mexico due to poor sales. The 2009 model year was a very short one in Mexico because the 2010 Fusion arrived in dealerships by late February 2009.

====Safety concerns====
In June 2010, it was reported that [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] was investigating into floormat-related [[Sudden unintended acceleration|unintended acceleration]] in 2010 Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan. According to NHTSA's estimate, as many as 249,301 cars could be affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/driveon/post/2010/06/ford-fusion-faces-probe-over-gas-pedal-getting-caught-under-floor-mat/1 |title=Ford Fusion faces probe over gas pedal getting caught under floor mat |date=June 1, 2010 |work=USA Today |accessdate=June 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 28, 2010, the NHTSA issued a statement that the stacking of all-weather floor mats from any manufacturer on top of the factory floor mat could cause accelerator entrapment. In their press release they stated the following: "NHTSA is urging drivers of 2010 Fusions to make sure they do not stack the rubber “All Weather” floor mat on top of the secured carpeted floor mat. Further, drivers are reminded to ensure that any driver-side floor mats (whether they are the carpeted floor mat or all weather floor mat) are properly installed and restrained by the retention hooks on the floorboard. Depending on vehicle and floor mat design, it is possible for unsecured floor mats to interfere with accelerator or brake pedals in a wide range of vehicles. Therefore, NHTSA reminds all drivers of all makes and models to check the driver-side floor mats for secure installation and to follow all manufacturer instructions for installing the mats."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| title= Consumer Advisory: Owners of MY 2010 Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan Warned of Possible Stuck Accelerator Pedals |url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/About+NHTSA/Press+Releases/2010/ci.Consumer+Advisory:+Owners+of+MY+2010+Ford+Fusion+and+Mercury+Milan+Warned+of+Possible+Stuck+Accelerator+Pedals.print | date= May 28, 2010 | publisher= National Highway Traffic Safety Administration | first= Julia |last= Piscitelli | accessdate= April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 2, 2014, the NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation opened an investigation into the Electronic Power Assisted Steering (EPAS) subsystem used in Ford Fusions, Lincoln MKZs, and Mercury Milans with model years between 2010 and 2012. The investigation was opened in response to over 500 complaints where motorists reported the sudden loss of power steering while driving. An estimated 938,000 vehicles are included in the investigation. The investigation is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ODI Resume|url=http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/cs/jaxrs/download/doc/UCM463722/INOA-PE14030-2570.PDF|publisher=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|accessdate=April 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411084455/http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/cs/jaxrs/download/doc/UCM463722/INOA-PE14030-2570.PDF|archive-date=April 11, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 27, 2015, Ford issued a recall for 2011-2012 Ford Fusions, Mercury Milans, and Lincoln MKZ's made in Mexico, along with 2011-2013 Ford Taurus, Ford Flex, Lincoln MKS and Lincoln MKT's built in Chicago or Oakville.

The Fusion Hybrid qualified for a [[hybrid tax credit]] of US$3,400 prior to March 31, 2009. The credit dropped to US$1,700 if purchased by September 30, 2009, and to US$850 if purchased by March 31, 2010.

This model gets better EPA-estimated fuel economy than the [[Toyota Camry Hybrid]], the [[Nissan Altima Hybrid]], and the [[Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid]], viewed as its competitors in the mid-size ''[[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]'' segment.

''[[Consumer Reports]]'' in its December 6, 2012 publication found that the Ford Fusion Hybrid and Ford C-Max Hybrid's tested fuel economy was 20% (8 MPG) short of Ford's EPA mileage claims. After many reports from owners and media of the Ford Fusion Hybrid getting less than the stated 47 MPG city/47 MPG highway/47 MPG combined, a class action lawsuit was brought against Ford on December 26, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://green.autoblog.com/2012/12/26/ford-dealt-class-action-lawsuit-over-c-max-fusion-hybrid-mileag/ |title=Ford dealt class-action lawsuit over C-Max, Fusion hybrid mileage claims | first= Sebastian |last= Blanco | work= Autoblog | date= December 26, 2012 | accessdate= April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://mpgfraud.com/pdf/Pitkin-FILED-COMPLAINT.pdf |publisher= MPGFraud.com | title= Class Action Complaint | work=Pitkin v.

[[File:Ford Fusion Hybrid Brazil 02 2014 PRG 03.jpg|thumb|left|Ford Fusion Hybrid (Brazil)]]
The second generation Fusion was unveiled at the [[North American International Auto Show#2012|2012 North American International Auto Show]] as a 2013 model. The redesigned Fusion is built on the [[Ford CD4 platform]] and is an example of Ford's global car strategy "One-Ford", with design led by [[Ford of Europe]], started with the [[Ford Focus (third generation)|Focus]] and then the extension of [[Ford Fiesta|Fiesta]] production, which both came into North America in 2012.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The new model marks the reconvergence of Ford's mid-size platform for both Europe and the Americas  - the CDW27 program which spawned the [[Ford Contour|Ford Contour/Mercury Mystique]] and the original European [[Ford Mondeo|Mondeo]] had been the company's previous attempt at a mid-size car for the world, which was met with mixed success.

As a One-Ford project, Ford of Europe Head of Advanced design team Chris Hamilton was commissioned as lead designer based in Detroit, under the guise Exterior Chief Designer for Ford/[[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln]], with design support led from Ford of Europe studios in Germany and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=ACParis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/paris-motor-show-2012/2013-ford-mondeo-full-details-revealed-updated-gallery|title=2013 Ford Mondeo - full details revealed, updated gallery|publisher=[[AutoCar]]|first= Julian |last= Rendell|date=September 6, 2012| accessdate=September 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Test and development of localized versions was undertaken in both North America and Europe, resulting in different engine choices, automatic gearboxes, suspension settings and tires.

Like the previous generation Fusion, the final assembly takes place at [[Hermosillo Stamping and Assembly]], [[Hermosillo]], [[Sonora]], Mexico. Due to strong sales of the redesigned 2013 year model, additional capacity was added in [[Flat Rock Assembly Plant]], [[Michigan]].  The hybrid version and the [[Fusion Energi]] plug-in hybrid will continue to be assembled in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.toledoblade.com/Automotive/2013/08/30/Ford-buildinga-best-sellerin-Flat-Rock-1.html|title=Ford building a best seller in Flat Rock |author=Tyrel Linkhorn|work=[[Toledo Blade]]|date=August 30, 2013|accessdate=September 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexican assembly plant won the prized MIT, Worlds Best Automobile Plant award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Mexico auto production rates with world's best |date= September 23, 2012 |first= Joseph |last= Treviño |work= [[Arizona Daily Star]] | url=http://azstarnet.com/business/mexico-auto-production-rates-with-world-s-best/article_c2ca81ef-3125-5360-8fd6-5f67797d41d5.html |accessdate= April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe and other international markets, the engine range is similar, but the 2.5 will only be available in North America. In international markets, a three-cylinder 1.0L 123&amp;nbsp;bhp EcoBoost, claimed to produce just 125g/km of CO2 emissions; and the [[Ford Fusion Energi]] plug-in hybrid is expected to be released between 2014 and 2015.&lt;ref name=ACParis/&gt;

The second generation Fusion was built with a {{convert|122|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} longer wheelbase than the outgoing model's [[Ford CD3 platform|CD3]] platform, is {{convert|28|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} bigger overall, {{convert|18|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wider, and {{convert|31|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} taller. In contrast to the front [[double wishbone suspension]] of the first generation Fusion, at front are [[MacPherson strut]]s, and at rear is a multi-link rear suspension. Despite larger exterior dimensions, some aspects of the interior have shrunk, including the trunk, which fell slightly from {{convert|467|to|453|L|cuft|1|abbr=on}}.

The 2013 Fusion is available in S, SE, and Titanium trim levels. Ford assembled five different powertrains for the second generation, including two hybrid variants. All available engines are four-cylinder offerings, dropping the previous model's 3.0L V6 as the top tier engine choice, as part of Ford's push to phase out the aging Duratec 30, as well as the Sport package's 3.5L V6 as a performance option. In the 2017 update, the Sport model returned, powered by a 2.7L turbocharged V6.

[[File:Ford Fusion Energi SEL with badge WAS 2012 0583.jpg|thumb|2013 [[Ford Fusion Energi]] [[plug-in hybrid]]]]
The second generation Fusion introduced several driver assistance technologies based on sensors, cameras and [[radar]]. Safety features include [[Lane Keeping System]]; adjust vehicle speed to changing traffic conditions through [[adaptive cruise control]] with [[Forward Collision Warning]]; [[active park assist]] paired with a [[backup camera]]; and [[Blind Spot Information System]] (BLIS) with cross-traffic alert, which consists of sensors in both rear quarter-panels that are able to detect traffic in a driver’s [[Blind spot (vehicle)|blind spot]], providing both audible and visual warnings if traffic unseen by the driver is detected. BLIS technology enables [[Intersection assistant|rear cross-traffic alert]], aiding drivers backing out of parking space where visibility is obstructed.&lt;ref name="GCC010912"&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.greencarcongress.com/2012/01/ford-introduces-new-fusion-midsize-sedan-with-new-hybrid-and-energi-plug-in-hybrid-versions.html|title=Ford introduces new Fusion midsize sedan with new hybrid and Energi plug-in hybrid versions|author=Ford Motor Company|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]| date= January 9, 2012 |accessdate= January 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/29/new-ford-fusion-will-warn-drivers-who-drift/?ref=automobiles|title=New Ford Fusion Will Warn Drivers Who Drift|first= Paul | last= Stenquist| work=[[The New York Times]]| date= December 29, 2011 |accessdate= January 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other safety features include [[Ford Sync]], second-row [[Inflatable Safety Belt]]s, [[Auto Start-Stop]], electric power-assisted steering, and Intelligent [[All-Wheel Drive]].

For the 2014 model year the chief improvement was a new 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine option.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmunds.com/ford/fusion/2014/#overview-pod 2014 Ford Fusion], Edmunds.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The 6F and HF35 automatic transmissions are sourced from Ford's Van Dyke Transmission Plant in [[Sterling Heights, Michigan]], while the B6 manual is produced at the GETRAG FORD Transmissions GmbH facility in [[Halewood, United Kingdom]].

===2017 facelift===
Ford updated the Fusion for the 2017 model year. The facelifted version was first unveiled at the [[North American International Auto Show#2016|2016 North American International Auto Show]] on January 11, 2016.
[[File:Ford Fusion SE 2.0 EcoBoost 2017 (34956635573).jpg|thumb|right|2017 facelift]]
All Fusions received new packages, new front and rear end styling, a new rotary-controlled automatic transmission, and two new trim levels of the gasoline-powered Fusion: the high-performance '''Sport''', which marks the first time that a [[V6]] engine has been installed into a second-generation Fusion, and the '''Platinum''', which adds more luxury features onto the previously top-of-the-line Titanium trim level (the Platinum is also available for both the Fusion Hybrid and Fusion Energi models). Also new for 2017 on most Fusion models is Ford's new SYNC 3 infotainment system with [[Android Auto]] and [[Apple CarPlay]] compatibility, which replaces the [[MyFord Touch]] infotainment system that was offered on the 2016 Fusion.

Pricing starts at $22,120 for a base gas-powered Fusion S model with the 2.5 L [[Duratec]] I4 engine, and tops out at $39,120 for a top-of-the-line Fusion Energi Platinum model with a 2.0 L I4 engine and an Atkinson Cycle electric motor with EV Mode.

===2019 facelift===
Ford again updated the Fusion for the 2019 model year.  This version debuted at the [[New York International Auto Show#2018|2018 New York International Auto Show]], set to go on sale in late summer 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.autoblog.com/2018/03/20/2019-ford-fusion-updates/|title=2019 Ford Fusion has more standard features and fresh styling|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/03/20/sleeker-smarter-2019-ford-fusion.html|title=Sleeker, Smarter 2019 Fusion Is First Ford with Standard Ford Co-Pilot360 Driver-Assist Technology, Greater Plug-In Hybrid Range - Ford Media Center|website=media.ford.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:2019 Ford Fusion Hybrid SE, Blue, front left.jpg|thumb|2019 facelift]]
The 2019 Fusion adds Ford's "Co-Pilot 360" safety suite as standard on all models.  It includes automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist, blind-spot and rear-cross-traffic warning systems, automatic highbeams, and automatic wipers.

The new models have updated front and rear styling.  The 1.5 L EcoBoost engine is now standard on SE and higher models, except for the '''V6 Sport''', formerly known as Sport.  The '''SEL''' replaces the SE Luxury Package, and the Platinum is dropped, moving the Titanium up-level.  The Hybrid is no longer available in base S trim, and the Energi is available only in Titanium trim.  The Energi model's battery range will increase from 22 miles to 25 miles, and the battery may take less space in the trunk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1115817_2019-ford-fusion-energi-plug-in-hybrid-gets-25-miles-from-revised-battery|title=2019 Ford Fusion Energi plug-in hybrid gets 25 miles from revised battery|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2020 changes===

For the 2020 [[model year]], the Fusion lineup has been condensed. There are now four gasoline-only Fusion models: S, SE, SEL, and Titanium, two Fusion Hybrid models (SE and Titanium), and only one Fusion Energi Plug-In Hybrid ([[PHEV]]) model: the Titanium. The Sport, Hybrid S, and Energi SE trims have all been discontinued for 2020. All trim levels offer a higher level of standard equipment, as well as fewer options. The S trim level is powered by a 2.5L DuraTec inline four-cylinder (I4) naturally-aspirated gasoline engine. SE and SEL trims are powered by the 1.5L [[EcoBoost]] turbocharged I4 gasoline engine, and the Titanium trim level is powered by the 2.0L [[EcoBoost]] turbocharged I4 gasoline engine. All Fusion Hybrid and Fusion Energi models are powered by an [[Atkinson cycle]] naturally-aspirated 2.0L I4 gasoline engine with an electric motor, as well as a [[Continuously Variable Transmission]] (CVT). Gasoline-only Fusion models use a six-speed automatic transmission. All Fusion Hybrid and Fusion Energi models are exclusively offered with [[front wheel drive]] (FWD), while select gasoline-only Fusion models are offered with [[all wheel drive]]. 

All trim levels offer Ford's SYNC 3 touchscreen infotainment system with [[Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]] [[smartphone]] integration and [[SiriusXM]] [[Satellite Radio]] and Travel Link service, GPS navigation, and the FordPass Connect [[4G]] [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] mobile [[Wi-Fi]] hotspot as standard equipment, except for the base S, where it is available as part of the [[Ford]] CoPilot360+ Package. All models feature Ford's CoPilot360 driver assistance system, with most models also offering the Ford CoPilot360+ system. S and SE trims receive cloth seating surfaces, while SEL and Hybrid SE models receive "Active-X" leatherette-trimmed seating surfaces, and Titanium, Hybrid Titanium, and Energi Titanium receive leather-trimmed seating surfaces.

The Sport and its 2.7L twin-turbocharged [[EcoBoost]] V6 gasoline engine have been discontinued for the 2020 [[model year]].

===Safety and recall===
In 2012, Ford recalled about 90,000 2013 Ford Escape and Fusion in the U.S. and Canada with 1.6-liter engines that may overheat and cause fires after 13 reports of fire were reported to Ford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford recalls 2013 Escape, Fusion: Potential fires in 89,000 cars with 1.6-liter engine|url=http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/ford-recalls-2013-escape-fusion-potential-fires-89000-cars-16-liter-engine|website=Autoweek|accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Ford recalled 2013-2014 Ford Fusion with 1.6 ecoboost engines because of a risk of engine fires caused by a “lack of coolant circulation”. The recall partly contributed to a charge of US$300 million by Ford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lynch|first1=Jim|title=Ford recalls 230,000 cars over potential engine fires|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2017/03/29/ford-recall/99771750/|accessdate=April 1, 2017|work=The Detroit News|date=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Ford recalled 2013-15 Ford Fusion with 1.6-liter Sigma GTDI engines and B6 manual transmissions, due to potential risk of the steering wheel becoming loose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford recalls nearly 1.4 million cars, steering wheel can come loose|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/14/ford-recalls-nearly-1-point-4-million-cars-steering-wheel-can-come-loose.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 15, 2019, Ford recalled about 270,000 2013-16 Ford Fusion with the 2.5L engine and automatic transmission due to the possibility that a bushing that holds the transmission lever safety cable in place could detach from the cable, which could potentially lead to the transmission lever safety cable becoming detached from the bushing, and allowing the transmission to not remain in 'Park', even if 'Park' is selected. If the transmission shift lever safety cable becomes loose, the vehicle will falsely register that the transmission is in 'Park', and will not show a warning message or sound a warning chime upon removal of the ignition key, and could also pose a rollaway risk. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/ford/2019/05/15/ford-recall-ranger-fusion-transmission/3677845002/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
Ford initially planned to discontinue the Fusion along with its other sedans in North America in the next few years, as part of a plan to focus more on SUVs and trucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/26/605971051/ford-to-phase-out-traditional-ford-sedans-such-as-fusion-and-taurus-in-the-u-s|title=Ford To Phase Out 'Traditional Ford Sedans' Such As Fusion And Taurus In The U.S.|last=Chappell|first=Bill|date=April 26, 2018|work=National Public Radio|access-date=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fusion is expected to be the last sedan sold by Ford ([[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln]] notwithstanding), with the [[Ford Taurus (sixth generation)|Ford Taurus]] and [[Ford Fiesta]] being dropped in North America in early 2019;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autoweek.com/article/rumormill/ford-fusion-may-live|title=The Ford Fusion may live on|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Fusion will also be the last traditional car aside from the [[Ford Mustang]] offered by the Ford division.

However, a report by [[Bloomberg News]] in July 2018, citing an unnamed Ford source, is stating that Ford is reconsidering dropping the Fusion name due to strong [[brand equity]] in the name as well as dealer protests. While the sedan will still be dropped, the reports now state that the Fusion will live on as a [[Subaru Outback]]-like [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover wagon]] likely called the Fusion Active and based on the current Fusion's [[Ford CD4 platform]]. The Fusion's transformation would be similar to that of the [[Buick Regal]], which in 2018 went from being a sedan to a wagon and [[fastback]]-styled [[hatchback]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motortrend.com/news/report-ford-fusion-name-will-live-on-as-wagon-like-crossover/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/report-ford-fusion-to-live-on-as-a-subaru-outback-fighter|title=Report: Ford Fusion to Live On as a Subaru Outback Fighter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford itself would not comment on the Fusion's future.

On September 5, 2018, Ford ended all national and promotional advertising (including sales and special offers) for its entire sedan lineup, including the Fusion, whose production will continue despite its possible discontinuation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autonews.com/article/20180905/RETAIL03/180909886/ford-stops-national-ads-for-sedans-including-fusion-still-in?X-IgnoreUserAgent=1 “Ford stops national ads for sedans, including Fusion still in production”] from Automotive News (September 5, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance-oriented Fusion Sport was discontinued after the 2019 model year. Ford plans to "focus on more popular styles" of the Fusion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.autoblog.com/2019/06/04/ford-fusion-sport-discontinued-2020/&lt;/ref&gt; Sightings of a prototype, based on the Focus wagon but enlarged, have raised speculation that the Fusion will live on as a crossover/wagon equivalent based on the next generation Mondeo, and will be repositioned to compete with the Outback. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30653717/ford-fusion-wagon-spied/ “Next Ford Fusion Takes Shape as a Subaru Outback–Style Lifted Wagon”] from Car &amp; Driver (January 24, 2020)&lt;/ref&gt;

The sedan version is expected to be discontinued after the 2021 model year, effectively ending what will be left of Ford’s car lineup in North America except for the Mustang.

The Fusion also became the new body style for Ford automobiles in [[NASCAR]] beginning in 2006, replacing the [[Ford Taurus|Taurus]].&lt;ref name="Ford Racing: Ford Unveils New Face For The Chase"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordracing.com/news/detail/?article=28461|publisher=Fordracing.com|title=Ford Racing: Ford Unveils New Face For The Chase|accessdate=November 18, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929024816/http://www.fordracing.com/news/detail/?article=28461|archivedate=September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This marked the first time since the [[Ford Torino|Torino]] in 1968 that Ford introduced a new model that went racing in NASCAR at the same time as its launch.&lt;ref name=yahoonascar&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nascar/news?slug=ap-nascar-cottest&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns |title=NASCAR may move COT to full schedule in 2008 |accessdate=March 1, 2007 |first=Jenna |last=Fryer |date=February 28, 2007 |agency=Associated Press |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308000142/http://sports.yahoo.com/nascar/news?slug=ap-nascar-cottest&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns |archivedate=March 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the introduction of the [[Generation 6 (NASCAR)|Generation 6]] body design in 2013, the vehicles were updated to match the second generation Fusion. The Generation 6 body styles were also meant to closer resemble the production versions of their respective vehicles.&lt;ref name="autoblog-gen6"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford debuts Fusion NASCAR racer that edges closer to stock [w/video]|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2013/02/20/ford-debuts-fusion-nascar-racer-that-edges-closer-to-stock-w-vi/|website=Autoblog|publisher=AOL|accessdate=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftu-gen6"&gt;{{cite web|title=NASCAR switches to uncommon look|url=http://jacksonville.com/sports/racing/2013-02-14/story/nascar-switches-uncommon-look|website=Florida Times-Union|accessdate=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 17, 2018, Ford announced that the [[Ford Mustang (sixth generation)|Mustang]] will replace the Fusion in the [[2019 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2018/04/17/ford-mustang-monster-energy-series-in-2019/ |title=Ford Mustang planned for Monster Energy Series in 2019 |website=NASCAR.com |date=April 17, 2018 |accessdate=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/motorsports/a19838299/ford-mustang-to-nascar-monster-energy-cup-2019/ |title=Ford Will Replace the Fusion With the Mustang in NASCAR |author=Silvestro, Brian |magazine=[[Road &amp; Track]] |date=April 17, 2018 |accessdate=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land speed record success===
Ford announced its attempt to use a fuel cell version of the Fusion, Ford Fusion Hydrogen 999, to set a land speed record on August 10–17 during Bonneville Speed Week in 2007.&lt;ref name="Ford Fusion Hydrogen 999 Racer To Attempt Speed Record For Fuel Cell-Powered Vehicle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/newsroom/feature_display.cfm?release=25641|title=Ford Fusion Hydrogen 999 Racer To Attempt Speed Record For Fuel Cell-Powered Vehicle|accessdate=November 18, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029182139/http://media.ford.com/newsroom/feature_display.cfm?release=25641|archivedate=October 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fusion 999 project was born in early 2006 when Ford fuel cell engineering manager Mujeeb Ijaz approached [[Roush Racing]] about a project to demonstrate the performance potential of a fuel cell-powered vehicle.

Roush's team, led by Rick Darling, worked with a team of Ford engineers and technicians led by Matt Zuehlk to come up with a vehicle design that could meet the goal of exceeding {{convert|200|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} on the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]], fueled only by hydrogen.&lt;ref name="AutblogGreen: Ford's Hydrogen Fusion 999 Hits The Track For The First Time"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/07/17/video-fords-hydrogen-fusion-999-hits-the-track-for-the-first-t/|title=AutblogGreen: Ford's Hydrogen Fusion 999 Hits The Track For The First Time| accessdate= November 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 15, 2007, the vehicle set the fastest fuel cell ground vehicle speed record of {{convert|207.297|mi/h|km/h|3|abbr=on}}.

The car was driven by retired Ford engineer Rick Byrnes, a long time [[Bonneville Speedway|Bonneville racer]].&lt;ref name="AutoblogGreen: Ford Hydrogen Fusion 999 runs 207.3 MPH at Bonneville"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/08/16/ford-hydrogen-fusion-999-runs-207-3-mph-at-bonneville/|title=AutoblogGreen: Ford Hydrogen Fusion 999 runs 207.3 MPH at Bonneville|accessdate=November 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
* In a December 2005 test, ''[[Car and Driver]]'' ranked the Fusion just below the first-place [[Honda Accord]], edging out the [[Toyota Camry]] and [[Hyundai Sonata]] by only a few points.

* [[Consumer Reports]] has also given positive reviews to the Fusion, as it had to the previous Taurus. It rated the Fusion Hybrid the top domestic sedan for 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/lifestyle/content/aug2009/bw20090824_018580.htm |title=Review: 2010 Ford Fusion Hybrid/Mercury Milan Hybrid |work=BusinessWeek |last=Aston |first=Adam |date=August 25, 2009 |accessdate=October 3, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831075856/http://www.businessweek.com/lifestyle/content/aug2009/bw20090824_018580.htm |archivedate=August 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the magazine's automotive editor, Rik Paul, said, "The Ford cars outscored Honda's Accord and Toyota's Camry, the two top-selling cars in America, 'which many people view as the paradigms of reliability'," referring to the Fusion and Mercury Milan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/10/27/business/main5425543.shtml |title=Consumer Reports: Ford Is "World Class" |work=CBS News |date=October 27, 2009 |accessdate=March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer response==
According to Ford, consumer response to the 2006 Fusion had exceeded their expectations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reuters|title=GM U.S. Sales Fell 10.3% in Dec.|publisher=Fox News|date=January 5, 2006|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,180599,00.html|accessdate =November 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 30,000 sold during the first quarter of 2006. By October 2009, the Fusion became one of the top ten best-selling cars in the U.S. for the first time, as well as the best-selling car by a domestic automaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.autoblog.com/2009/11/12/ford-fusion-breaks-into-top-10-best-selling-vehicles-amid-best-y/ |last= Shunk |first= Chris |title=Ford Fusion breaks into top 10 best-selling vehicles amid best year ever |date=November 12, 2009 |work=Autoblog |accessdate=November 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article reflecting on the retirement of the Taurus however noted that whatever its faults, Ford did sell a large volume of them, and at the time production ended, the Taurus was still outselling the smaller Fusion and larger [[Ford Five Hundred]] combined, thanks to Taurus' large fleet sales. For the 2007 model year, approximately 77% of Fusion sales were retail (as opposed to fleet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2007 – MY Registrations|url=http://www.automotive-fleet.com/Statistics/StatsViewer.aspx?file=http%3a%2f%2fwww.automotive-fleet.com%2ffc_resources%2fstats%2fAFFB-cht-car-LT-reg.pdf&amp;channel=Vehicle-Research |publisher=Automotive Fleet|date=March 2008|accessdate=July 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sales mix has contributed, in part, to the Fusion's relatively high [[residual value]] compared to the Taurus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Mike|title=Ford, Lincoln and Mercury See Rising Resale Values|publisher=Ford Media|date=January 8, 2006|url=http://media.ford.com/newsroom/feature_display.cfm?release=22327|accessdate=November 18, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107102854/http://media.ford.com/newsroom/feature_display.cfm?release=22327|archivedate=January 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford also sells the Fusion in Mexico and Brazil. In Brazil, it became the highest-selling car in its class in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2008/01/17/ford-edge-headed-to-brazil/ |last= Roth |first= Dan |title=Ford Edge Headed to Brazil |work=Autoblog |date=January 17, 2008 |accessdate=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Model 48''' was an update on [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]'s [[1932 Ford|V8-powered Model 40A]], the company's main product. Introduced in 1935, the Model 48 was given a cosmetic refresh annually, begetting the [[1937 Ford]] before being thoroughly redesigned for [[1941 Ford|1941]]. The 1935 Ford's combination of price, practicality, and looks vaulted the company ahead of rival [[Chevrolet]] for the sales crown that year, with 820,000 sold.

==1935==
[[File:1935 Ford Model B Woodie.JPG|left|thumb|1935 Model B Woodie]]
The 1935 Ford was a thorough refresh on the popular [[V8 engine|V8]]-powered Ford.  The [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]] [[Ford Model A (1927)|Model A]] engine was no longer offered, leaving just the 221&amp;nbsp;CID (3.6&amp;nbsp;L) [[V8 engine|V8]] to power every Ford car and truck.  The transverse [[leaf spring]] suspension remained, but the front spring was relocated ahead of the axle to allow more interior volume. The body was lowered and new "Center-Poise" seating improved comfort.

Visually, the 1935 Ford was much more modern with the grille pushed forward and made more prominent by de-emphasized and more-integrated fenders.  A major advance was a true integrated trunk on "trunkback" sedans, though the traditional "flatback" was also offered.  Outdated body styles like the Victoria were also deleted for the year. The wooden panels were manufactured at the [[Ford Iron Mountain Plant]] in the Michigan Upper Peninsula from Ford owned lumber.

Two trim lines were offered, standard and DeLuxe, across a number of body styles including a base [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]], five-window [[coupe]], three-window coupe, Tudor and Fordor [[sedan (car)|sedans]] in flatback or trunkback versions, a convertible sedan, a woody [[station wagon]], and new '''Model 51''' truck.  [[Rumble seat]]s were optional on coupe model. An oil pressure gauge (costing $4) and two windshield wipers were optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1935_Ford/1935_Ford_Accessories/1935%20Ford%20Acc-04.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1935_Ford/1935_Ford_Accessories |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one got the optional radio, it replaced the ash tray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1935_Ford/1935_Ford_Brochure/1935%20Ford-05.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1935_Ford/1935_Ford_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chevrolet regained the sales lead at the end of 1936, but the Ford still sold extremely well.  A new club cabriolet model was introduced with a fully framed windshield and weatherproof top, and the convertible [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] gained the popular integrated trunkback design.

The look was updated with an inverted pentagonal grille with all-vertical bars beneath a prominent hood and three horizontal chrome side strips (on DeLuxe models). The V8 DeLuxe was called '''Model 68.''' A concealed horn, long a prominent part of the Ford's design, also brought the car into modern times.  The new trucks continued with the old grille.  Other major changes for 1936 were the use of pressed steel "artillery" solid wheels instead of wire wheels.

The '''Ford Model A''' (also colloquially called the '''A-Model Ford''' or the '''A''', and '''A-bone''' among [[Hot rod#Language|rodders]] and [[Custom car#Language|customizers]])&lt;ref&gt;Bianco, Johnny, "Leadfest" in ''Rod &amp; Custom'', 9/00, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[Ford Motor Company]]'s second market success after its predecessor, the [[Ford Model T|Model T]]. First produced on October 20, 1927, but not introduced until December 2,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2bcW0WDEKgMC&amp;pg=PA10 |title=Collector's Originality Guide Ford Model A |last=Schild |first=Jim |publisher=MotorBooks International |year=2009 |isbn=9781610608886 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; it replaced the venerable Model T, which had been produced for 18 years. This new Model A ([[Ford Model A (1903–1904)|a previous model]] had used the name in 1903–04) was designated a 1928 model and was available in four standard colors.

By February 4, 1929, one million Model As had been sold, and by July 24, two million.&lt;ref name="Gauld, p. 693"&gt;Gauld, p. 693.&lt;/ref&gt; The range of body styles ran from the Tudor at US$500 (in grey, green, or black)&lt;ref name="Gauld, p. 693"/&gt; to the Town Car with a dual cowl at US$1200.&lt;ref&gt;Gauld, p. 694.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1930, Model A sales hit three million, and there were nine body styles available.&lt;ref name="Gauld, p. 693"/&gt;

Model A production ended in March 1932, after 4,858,644 had been made in all body styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mafca.com/data_production.html|title=Model A Production Figures|publisher=Model A Ford Club of America|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its successor was the [[Ford Model B (1932)|Model B]], which featured an updated [[Inline-four engine|inline four-cylinder engine]], as well as the [[1932 Ford#Model 18|Model 18]], which introduced Ford's new [[Ford flathead V8 engine|flathead (sidevalve) V8 engine]].

==Features==
Prices for the Model A ranged from US$385 for a roadster to US$1400 for the top-of-the-line ''Town Car.'' The engine was a water-cooled [[Cam-in-block#L-head|L-head]] inline four with a displacement of {{convert|201|CID|l|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Cheetham"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cheetham|first1=Craig|title=Vintage Cars - The Finest Prewar Automobiles|date=2004|publisher=Grange Books|location=Rochester, United Kingdom|isbn=1840136359|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This engine provided {{convert|40|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Cheetham" /&gt; Top speed was around {{convert|65|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The Model A had a {{convert|103.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase with a final drive ratio of 3.77:1. The transmission was a conventional unsynchronized three-speed sliding gear [[Manual transmission|manual]]&lt;ref name="Cheetham" /&gt; with a single speed reverse. The Model A had four-wheel [[Mechanical brake|mechanical]] [[drum brake]]s.&lt;ref name="Cheetham" /&gt; The 1930 and 1931 models were available with stainless steel radiator cowling and headlamp housings.

The Model A came in a wide variety of styles including a [[Coupe]] (Standard and Deluxe), Business Coupe, Sport Coupe, Roadster Coupe (Standard and Deluxe), Convertible [[Cabriolet (automobile)|Cabriolet]], Convertible [[Sedan (car)|Sedan]], Phaeton (Standard and Deluxe), Tudor [[Sedan (car)|Sedan]] (Standard and Deluxe), Town Car, Fordor (five-window standard, three-window deluxe), Victoria, Town Sedan, Station Wagon, Taxicab, Truck, and Commercial.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The very rare Special Coupe started production around March 1928 and ended mid-1929. &lt;!--a source saying all of these are real would be good--&gt;

The Model A was the first Ford to use the standard set of driver controls with conventional clutch and brake pedals, throttle, and gearshift. Previous Fords used controls that had become uncommon to drivers of other makes. The Model A's fuel tank was situated in the cowl, between the engine compartment's fire wall and the dash panel. It had a visual fuel gauge, and the fuel flowed to the carburetor by gravity. A rear-view mirror was optional.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; In cooler climates, owners could purchase an [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] cast iron unit to place over the exhaust manifold to provide heat to the cab. A small door provided adjustment of the amount of hot air entering the cab. The Model A was the first car to have [[Laminated glass|safety glass]] in the windshield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1930_Ford/1930_Ford_Brochure_02/1930%20Ford-14-15.html |title=Directory Index: Ford/1930_Ford/1930_Ford_Brochure_02 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] company [[GAZ]], which started as a [[joint venture]] between Ford and the Soviet Union, made a licensed version from 1932–1936.&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956pp206-208"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=206–208}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This served as the basis for the [[FAI armoured car|FAI]] and [[BA-20]] [[Armored car (military)|armored car]]s which saw use as Soviet scout vehicles in the early stages of [[World War II]].

In addition to the [[United States]], Ford made the Model A in plants in [[Argentina]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

In Europe, where in some countries cars were taxed according to engine size, [[Ford of Britain|Ford in the UK]] manufactured the Model A with a smaller displacement engine of {{convert|2043|cc|abbr=on}}, providing a claimed output of {{convert|28|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Oswald. ''Deutsche Autos 1920-1945'' &lt;!--publisher &amp; place? and is his name Werner Oswald or Oswald Werner?--&gt; p. 416 {{ISBN|3-87943-519-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this equated to a British [[Tax horsepower|fiscal horsepower]] of {{convert|14.9|hp|kW PS|lk=on|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;Clutton, Cecil, Paul Bird and Anthony Harding. ''The Vintage Car Pocketbook'' &lt;!--publisher, place, date, &amp; page...?--&gt;; ''The Motoring Encyclopaedia'' (1935?)&lt;/ref&gt; (compared to the {{convert|24|hp|kW PS|lk=on|abbr=on}} of the larger engine) and attracted a punitive annual car tax levy of £1 per fiscal hp in the UK.  It therefore was expensive to own and too heavy and uneconomical to achieve volume sales, and so unable to compete in the newly developing mass market, while also too crude to compete as a luxury product. European manufactured Model As failed to achieve the sales success in Europe that would greet their [[Ford Model Y|smaller successor]] in Britain and Germany.&lt;ref name=AutoExpress2002&gt;{{cite journal| authorlink = David Johns (Editor in chief)| title = 0 – 100...We celebrate a century of Ford in style....| journal = Auto Express| volume = Issue 724| pages = 56–62|date = October 2–8, 2002| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development history==
From the mid 1910s through the early 1920s, Ford dominated the automotive market with its Model T. However, during the mid-1920s, this dominance eroded as competitors, especially the various General Motors divisions, caught up with Ford's mass production system and began to better&lt;!--higher quality is not "outcompeting", is it?--&gt; Ford in some areas, especially by offering more powerful engines, new convenience features, or cosmetic customization.&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956pp217-219"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=217–219}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hounshell1984pp263-264"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|pp=263–264}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sloan1964pp162-163"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sloan|1964|pp=162–163}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, features [[Henry Ford]] considered to be unnecessary, such as [[Starter motor|electric starters]], were gradually shifting in the public's perception from luxuries to essentials.

Ford's sales force recognized the threat and advised Henry to respond to it. Initially he resisted, but the T's sagging market share finally forced him to admit a replacement was needed. When he finally agreed to begin development of this new model, he focused on the mechanical aspects and on what today is called [[design for manufacturability]] (DFM), which he had always strongly embraced and for which the Model T production system was famous. Although ultimately successful,&lt;!--aside: this was clear, if unencyclopedic, before :D Feel free to remove the cmt. ;p--&gt; the development of the Model A included many problems that had to be resolved.&lt;ref name="Hounshell1984pp280-292"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|pp=280–292}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Die (manufacturing)|die stamping of parts from sheet steel]], which the Ford company had led to new heights of development with the Model T production system, was something Henry had always been ambivalent about; it had brought success, but he felt that it was not the best choice for durability. He was determined that the Model A would rely more on [[drop forging]]s than the Model T, but his ideas to improve the DFM of forging did not prove practical. Eventually, Ford's engineers persuaded him to relent, lest the Model A's production cost force up its retail price too much.&lt;ref name="Hounshell1984pp280-281"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|pp=280–281}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry's disdain for cosmetic vanity as applied to automobiles led him to leave the Model A's styling to a team led by his son [[Edsel Ford|Edsel]], even though he would take credit for it despite his son doing more of the work.

It was during the period from the mid-1920s to early 1930s that the limits of the first generation of [[mass production]], epitomized by the Model T production system's rigidity, became apparent. The era of "[[Flexible manufacturing system|flexible mass production]]" had begun.&lt;ref name="Hounshell1984pp263-301"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|pp=263–301}}, Chapter 7: Cul-de-sac: The Limits of [[Fordism]] &amp; the Coming of "Flexible Mass Production".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956pp217-231"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=217–231}}, Chapter 16: Farewell to Model T.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and media==
The Model A was well represented in media of the era since it was one of the most common cars. [[Model kit]]s remain  available from hobby shops as stock cars or [[hot rod]]s.

Several Model As have obtained particular fame. The "Mean Green Machine", a green and black 1931 Tudor Sedan, has been a staple of [[University of North Texas]] football games and special events since 1974, maintained by the spirit organization Talons since the 1980s. The [[Ramblin' Wreck]], a 1930 Sport Coupe, is the official mascot of the student body at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] and appears at sporting events and student body functions. [[Ala Kart (custom car)|''Ala Kart'']], a [[custom car|customized]] 1929 [[roadster pickup]] built by [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]], won two straight "[[America's Most Beautiful Roadster]]" awards at the [[Oakland Roadster Show]] before making numerous film and television appearances. Between October 1992 and December 1994, Hector Quevedo, along with his son Hugo, drove a 1928 Model A {{convert|22,000|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} from his home in [[Punta Arenas]], [[Chile]] to Ford headquarters in [[Dearborn, Michigan]]. The car required minimal service, including a flat tire and transmission work in [[Nicaragua]], and is now housed in the [[The Henry Ford|Henry Ford Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Cardinale, Anthony. "Chileans on a Roll in Vintage Car Trek Detroit-Bound Model A Ford Arrives Here After 21,700 Miles". ''Buffalo News''. Buffalo, N.Y.: November 30, 1994, p. A.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlie Ryan's song "[[Hot Rod Lincoln]]" featured a modified Model A. The song has been [[Cover version|covered]] several times since its original release.

The current generation '''Ford Escort''' is a [[compact car]] sold on the [[China|Chinese]] and [[Taiwan|Taiwanese]] market by the [[Ford Motor Company]]. Following its announcement in mid-2013 that they intended reviving the "Escort" name for a car based on an older version of the [[Ford Focus]],&lt;ref name='cn_2013' /&gt; Ford launched the new Escort in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnewschina.com/2015/01/05/ford-escort-launched-on-the-chinese-auto-market/|title=Ford Escort launched on the Chinese auto market|accessdate=2015-10-21|date=2015-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;__NOTOC__

==History and lineage==
Ford had used the Escort name on three earlier car lines; firstly on a [[Ford Escort (Squire-based estate)|variant of the Ford Squire]] sold in the UK 1955 to 1961, then on the better-known [[Ford Escort (Europe)|European Ford Escort]] sold from 1968 to 2001, and the [[Ford Escort (North America)|North American Ford Escort]] sold between 1980 and 2003.

In 2013, Ford announced its intention to resurrect the "Escort" nameplate on the Chinese market in 2014, with a [[compact car]] based on the then-current Ford Focus Classic, itself a version of the second generation of [[Ford Focus]]. The Chinese Escort was intended to be the technical successor of the Focus Classic and positioned under the current third generation Ford Focus. &lt;ref name='cn_2013'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnewschina.com/2013/07/25/new-ford-escort-will-hit-the-china-car-market-in-2014/ |title=New Ford Escort will hit the China car market in 2014 |publisher=CarNewsChina.com |author=Tycho de Feijter |date=2013-07-25 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When launched, the [[Ford Focus (first generation)|first generation Ford Focus]] had itself been the replacement for both the European and the North American Escort lines in their respective markets.

==Reception==

The UK magazine and website ''[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]]'' gave the Escort three out of five stars, expressing surprise that the Escort name had been revived for a market where it had no heritage and commenting that "the Escort name is from another age [and] essentially it is a cheap car cobbled together from Ford’s parts bin". They also noted that the suspension had been tweaked to suit Chinese road conditions, but stated that they did not think it seemed cheap enough for the intended market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/ford/escort|title=Ford Escort review|accessdate=2015-10-21|quote=The name is a surprising choice as none of the original Escorts were ever officially sold in China [so] there is no heritage [..] suspension settings are on the soft side to compensate for China's poor road conditions.

The '''Galpin GTR1''' (sometimes referred to as the '''Galpin Ford GTR1''') is a custom sports car based on the [[Ford GT]] developed and built by American automotive company [[Galpin Auto Sports]]. The car was unveiled at [[Pebble Beach]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ahrens|first=Ronald|title=Pebble Beach Weekend: Galpin Unveils 1,024-Horsepower Ford GTR1|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/19/pebble-beach-weekend-galpin-unveils-1024-horsepower-ford-gtr1/?_r=1|accessdate=September 2, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galpin plans to make at least six cars in 2014, with the possibility of another 18 to follow, based on demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2013/08/16/galpin-ford-gtr1-supercar-monterey-2013/ |title=Galpin Ford GTR1 supercar debuts in Monterey |publisher=Autoblog |date=16 August 2013 |first=Brandon |last=Turkus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifications==
In 2013, [[Galpin Auto Sports]] utilized the mechanical underpinnings of a Ford GT as basis to build the GTR1. The GTR1 has a 5.4L twin-turbocharged V8, capable of producing {{convert|1024|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|739|lb·ft|N·m|0|abbr=on}} of torque, which enables the car to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) in about 3 seconds, and reach an advertised top speed of {{convert|225|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="autocar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/pebble-beach/galpin-gtr1-unveiled-pebble-beach |title=Galpin GTR1 unveiled at Pebble Beach |publisher=Autocar |date=17 August 2013 |accessdate=21 September 2013 |first=Jim |last=Holder}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the GTR1 is fuelled with 100-octane fuel, the power and torque outputs are boosted to respectively {{convert|1197|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|887|lb·ft|N·m|0|abbr=on}} of torque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.windingroad.com/articles/reviews/preview-galpin-ford-gtr1/ |title=Preview: Galpin Ford GTR1 |publisher=Winding Road |date=19 August 2013 |accessdate=21 September 2013 |first=John Beltz |last=Snyder}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hand-built, all-aluminum chassis features carbon fiber detailing, and LED headlights,&lt;ref name="autocar"/&gt; and is approximately {{convert|5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wider than the standard Ford GT.&lt;ref name="carscoops"/&gt; The interior is only slightly altered from the Ford GT, but now has leather upholstery, a machined aluminum instrument cluster, and a [[McIntosh Laboratory|McIntosh]] audio system.&lt;ref name="wcf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/113081761569/galpin-gtr1-prototype-unveiled-at-pebble-beach |title=Galpin GTR1 prototype unveiled at Pebble Beach |publisher=World Car Fans |date=17 August 2013 |accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GTR1 uses 20" aluminum wheels, which are fitted with [[Pirelli]] P-Zero tires.&lt;ref name="wcf"/&gt; Carbon fiber [[disc brake]]s, with six-piston calipers and [[Reinforced carbon–carbon]] rotors are used to stop the car.

===History and development===

The [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid electric]] version of the [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Fusion]] was announced at the 2005 [[North American International Auto Show]], along with the public introduction of the original 2006 Fusion. At that time Ford announced that the hybrid version was scheduled to be introduced in early 2009 for the 2010 model year, for a [[suggested retail price]] of US$27,270.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://info.detnews.com/autosinsider/sneakpeek/index.cfm?id=26578 |title=Ford Fusion hybrid to hit auto show circuit soon |publisher=DetroitNews.com |date=August 15, 2007 |accessdate=November 18, 2007 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20071011173737/http://info.detnews.com/autosinsider/sneakpeek/index.cfm?id=26578 |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/carnews/13741/spied-2009-ford-fusion.html?al=99|title=Spied: 2009 Ford Fusion – Car News|publisher=Car and Driver|date=August 2007|accessdate=November 18, 2007|last=Gluckman|first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Fusion Hybrid and Fusion Sport officially debuted at the [[Greater Los Angeles Auto Show]] in November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9081110.034/2010-ford-fusion-hybrid-to-pace-nascar-sprint-cup |title=2010 Ford Fusion Hybrid to pace NASCAR Sprint Cup |work=WorldCarFans.com |date=November 11, 2008 |publisher=Black Falcon Media Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fusion Hybrid is manufactured at Ford's [[Hermosillo Stamping &amp; Assembly]] plant, located in [[Sonora]], Mexico.&lt;ref name=FusionSpecs2/&gt; Ford set a modest sales target of about 25,000 vehicles a year for the Fusion Hybrid and the similar [[Mercury Milan]].&lt;ref name = NYT1208&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/31/business/31ford.html?scp=2&amp;sq=Prius%20Fusion%20Hybrid&amp;st=cse|title=Ford Hybrid Emphasizes High Mileage |work=New York Times |author=Bill Vlasic|date=December 30, 2008|accessdate=June 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fusion vs Milan Hybrids.jpg|thumb|left|The Milan and Fusion hybrids share the same [[powertrain]] but feature different front and rear fascia designs, and distinct headlamps and taillights.]]
The Fusion Hybrid was made available for press testing in December 2008 and launched to the U.S. market in March 2009. During the same month two other new hybrid models also came on sale, the [[Honda Insight]] and the [[Mercury Milan Hybrid|Mercury Milan]].&lt;ref name=GreenCar0409&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/04/us-hybrid-sales-in-march-2009-down-44-yearonyear-monthly-new-vehicle-market-share-of-25.html#more|title=US Hybrid Sales in March 2009 Down 44% Year-on-Year; Monthly New Vehicle Market Share of 2.5%|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=April 3, 2009|accessdate=June 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the few days that were available to the public, Ford's new Fusion and Milan hybrids sold a combined 451 units, representing 3.0% of all Fusion and Milan models sold in March 2009.&lt;ref name=GreenCar0409/&gt;

The Fusion is the first new hybrid vehicle the Ford brand offered in five years, and is the second hybrid vehicle after the [[Ford Escape Hybrid]]. The Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan hybrids join the [[Saturn Vue|Saturn Vue Green Line Hybrid]] for Mexican-built hybrid vehicles.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The [[Lincoln MKZ Hybrid|2011 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid]], launched in the U.S. market in September 2010, shares the hybrid powertrain from the Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan hybrids, and delivers an estimated [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] of {{convert|41|mpgUS|abbr=on}}. The MKZ Hybrid offers several improvements of Ford's Smart Gauge with EcoGuide, first introduced in the 2010 Fusion Hybrid.&lt;ref name=MT0310&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/auto_shows/new_york/2010/1003_2011_lincoln_mkz_hybrid/index.html|title=2011 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid |publisher=[[Motor Trend]]|date=March 2010|author=Mike Floyd|accessdate=April 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC0310&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2010/03/mkzhybrid-20100330.html|title=Ford Introduces 2011 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid; Projected 41 mpg City|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]] |date=March 31, 2010|accessdate=April 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design and technology===

The Fusion Hybrid is a [[Hybrid vehicle drivetrains#Full Hybrids|"full" hybrid]] because both propulsion sources, an electric motor powered by a [[Sanyo]] supplied&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abuelsamid |first=Sam |url=http://www.autobloggreen.com/2008/10/30/tech-analysis-2010-ford-fusion-mercury-milan-powertrains-38-mp/2 |title=Tech Analysis: 2010 Ford Fusion/Mercury Milan powertrains, 38 mpg hybrid! – Autoblog Green |publisher=Autobloggreen.com |date=October 30, 2008 |accessdate=October 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 275 [[Volt|V]] [[nickel-metal hydride battery]], and a 2.5L [[Atkinson cycle]] [[Straight-4|I4]] 156&amp;nbsp;hp 136&amp;nbsp;ft.lbs.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} gasoline engine with intake variable cam timing(iVCT), have substantial power ratings and either can be used alone to propel the vehicle.&lt;ref name=FusionSpecs2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/images/10031/2010_Ford_Fusion_Hybrid.pdf |title=2010 Ford Fusion |publisher=[[Ford Motor Company]] |accessdate=June 6, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419095038/http://media.ford.com/images/10031/2010_Ford_Fusion_Hybrid.pdf |archivedate=April 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FusionSpecs1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordvehicles.com/cars/fusion/features/specs/|title=Fusion Especifications|publisher=[[Ford Motor Company]]|accessdate=June 6, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712044236/http://www.fordvehicles.com/cars/fusion/features/specs/|archivedate=July 12, 2009|df=mdy-all}} ''See boxes "Gas Engine Specifications (Hybrid Model)" and "Electric Motor Specifications (Hybrid Model)"''&lt;/ref&gt;  When braking or decelerating, the Fusion's hybrid system uses [[regenerative braking]], where the electric drive motor becomes a generator, converting the vehicle's momentum back to electricity for storage in the batteries. Ford claims that nearly 94 percent energy recovery is achieved by first delivering full regenerative braking followed by friction brakes during city driving.&lt;ref name=FusionSpecs2/&gt;  Under ideal conditions, Ford claims the Fusion Hybrid can cruise {{convert|2|mi}} at up to {{convert|47|mph}} on battery power alone.&lt;ref name =HbCars&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hybridcars.com/vehicle/ford-fusion-hybrid.html|title=Ford Fusion Hybrid|publisher=Hybrid Cars|accessdate=June 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once perceived as a laggard in hybrid technology, Ford now claims nearly 500 hybrid patents that allow the Fusion Hybrid to achieve 41 MPG on the highway. According to Hybridcars.com, Ford has pointed to its talented inventors, making "special mention of Ming Kuang who has helped Ford since 2000 to expand its portfolio of hybrid patents from just 10 patents when he began to 461 today." Quoted in Autotrader.com, the veteran engineer says "it's about helping make the world my children live in-and the world my children's children will live in-a better place."

===Safety===
The [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]] line-up was included in the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] 2010 "Top Safety Pick's" rating for the [[mid-size car|mid-size]] category.&lt;ref name=IIHS2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/default.aspx|title=TOP SAFETY PICKs 2010|publisher=[[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]|accessdate=June 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ConsumerR10&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.consumerreports.org/cars/2010/06/iihs-chooses-9-more-top-safety-picks.html|title=IIHS chooses 9 more Top Safety Picks|publisher=[[Consumer Reports]]|date=June 9, 2010|accessdate=June 12, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612152425/http://blogs.consumerreports.org/cars/2010/06/iihs-chooses-9-more-top-safety-picks.html|archivedate=June 12, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2010, Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan hybrids are the only two mid-size hybrid vehicles in the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2010/06/12/ford-fusion-mercury-milan-hybrids-earn-iihs-top-safety-pick/|title=Ford Fusion, Mercury Milan hybrids earn IIHS "Top Safety Pick" |publisher=AutoblogGreen |date=June 12, 2010|accessdate=June 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fact that [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] recently modified and strengthened the roof structure of the Flex, Fusion, and MKT vehicles, these 2010 ratings apply only to [[Lincoln MKZ]]s, [[Mercury Milan]] and Fusions built after April 2010.&lt;ref name=IIHS2010/&gt;

===Fuel economy and environmental performance===

The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has rated the [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] for the 2010 Fusion Hybrid at {{convert|41|mpgus}} city, {{convert|36|mpgus}} highway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordfusion.net/hybrid/ |title=2010 Ford Fusion Hybrid Information |date=January 8, 2009 |accessdate=January 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following table compares [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]], [[carbon footprint]], and petroleum consumption between the hybrid version and other [[Powertrain|drivetrains]] of the Fusion family as estimated by the EPA and the [[U.S. Department of Energy]]:

The Ford Fusion Hybrid EPA's fuel economy rating is better than the 2011 [[Toyota Camry Hybrid]] (32&amp;nbsp;miles per gallon city, 33 highway), the [[Nissan Altima Hybrid]] (35&amp;nbsp;miles per gallon city, 33 highway), and the [[Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid]] (26&amp;nbsp;miles per gallon city, 34 highway), considered its main competitors in the mid-size sedan segment. The newer 2012 [[Toyota Camry Hybrid]] LE model (43&amp;nbsp;miles per gallon city, 39 highway) now has an advantage over the 2012 Ford Fusion (41&amp;nbsp;miles per gallon city, 39 highway) by a slight margin in the city.

[[Ford Fusion Hybrid|Reduced Electric Vehicle Operation Of 2010 - 2012 Fusion Hybrid]]

Many owners complained to Ford about greatly reduced gas mileage after 9 years of operation because of reduced electric vehicle operation and increased gasoline engine operation.  Ford notified their dealers that they are investigating a fix:

'''TSB #SSM 48238 "Oct 3 2019'''  8922 - 2010-2012 Fusion HEV, 2010-2011 Milan HEV, 2011-2012 MKZ HEV - Reduced ElectricVehicle Operation

Some 2010-2012 Fusion hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), 2010-2011 Milan HEV and 2011-2012 MKZ HEV vehicles may experience reduced electric vehicle operation and increased gasoline engine operation. Do not attempt repairs at this time. Engineering is investigating, monitor OASIS for updates."

===Payback time===
According to [[Edmunds.com]], the price premium paid for the Fusion Hybrid takes 5 years to recover in fuel savings as compared to its non-hybrid sibling, and is one of the quickest payback periods among top selling hybrids as of February 2012. Edmunds compared the hybrid version priced at {{USD| 27,678}} with a comparably-equipped gasoline-powered Fusion priced at {{USD|24,493}} and found that the payback period is 6 years for gasoline at {{USD|3}} per gallon, 4 years at {{USD|4}} per gallon, and drops to 3 years with gasoline prices at {{USD|5}} per gallon. These estimates assume an average of {{convert|15,000|mi|abbr=on}} annual driving and vehicle prices correspond to Edmunds.com's true market value estimates.&lt;ref name=HybridPremium&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/industry-center/analysis/will-higher-gas-prices-boost-hybrid-ev-sales.html|title=Will Higher Gas Prices Boost Hybrid, EV Sales?|author=Michelle Krebs|publisher=[[Edmunds.com]]|date=February 28, 2012|accessdate=February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the same two vehicles, the U.S. EPA estimates the Fusion Hybrid annual fuel cost at {{USD|1,431}} while the gasoline-powered Fusion has an annual fuel cost of {{USD|2,320}}.

These screens can be configured to show different levels of driver information, including fuel and battery power levels, and average and instant [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]]. When set in tutorial mode, the instrument panel in the right side “grows” leaves and vines on-screen to reward fuel-efficient driving. The more leaves and vines that appear, the more efficient the driving behavior is and the more fuel is being saved. Long-term fuel efficiency can also be displayed as a traditional chart. The left side display shows when the car is in pure-electric mode, and shows the state of battery charge.&lt;ref name=Edmunds/&gt;&lt;ref name=FordEcoD/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carspondent/&gt;

In 2012, with the introduction of the second generation Fusion, Ford redesigned its SmartGauge with EcoGuide system giving it a newer look and new customizable MyView features. One of the new features, Brake Coach, gives instant feedback on the driver's braking habits and gives them advice to maximize the efficiency of the regenerative braking system. Other new features included, Inform, Enlighten, Engage, and Empower.

A complete redesign of the Ford Fusion lineup for the [[model year]] 2013 was unveiled at the 2012 [[North American International Auto Show]]. The new lineup includes three optional engines for the conventional [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder-only]] gasoline model, a next-generation hybrid version, and a [[plug-in hybrid]] version, the Ford Fusion Energi. The Ford Fusion became the first production sedan to offer these three powertrain options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford.com/cars/fusion/2013/?searchid=|title=2013 Fusion|author=Ford|publisher=Ford|accessdate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012 Ford announced that an auto [[start-stop system]] will be available for the 1.6-liter EcoBoost engine non-hybrid version, at a price of {{USD|295}}.

The 2013 Fusion Hybrid includes driver assistance and technologies based on sensors, cameras and radar that enable the car to see and respond. Fusion can help drivers maintain proper lane position (Lane Keeping System); adjust vehicle speed to changing traffic conditions through adaptive cruise control; active park assist to help identify suitable parking spaces and help park; and [[Blind Spot Information System]] (BLIS) with [[cross-traffic alert]], which consists of sensors in both rear quarter-panels that are able to detect traffic in a driver's [[Blind spot (vehicle)|blind spot]], providing both audible and visual warnings if traffic unseen by the driver is detected. BLIS technology enables cross-traffic alert, even aiding drivers backing out of parking space where visibility is obstructed.&lt;ref name=GCC010912/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/29/new-ford-fusion-will-warn-drivers-who-drift/?ref=automobiles|title=New Ford Fusion Will Warn Drivers Who Drift|author=Paul Stenquist|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 29, 2011|accessdate=January 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite sharing the same powertrain, the 2013/14 MKZ Hybrid is rated 4 mpg&lt;sub&gt;-US&lt;/sub&gt; combined less than its sibling the second generation [[Ford Fusion Hybrid#Second generation|Ford Fusion Hybrid]], and 6 mpg&lt;sub&gt;-US&lt;/sub&gt; less in city driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=34316&amp;id=34312|title=Compare Side-by-Side: 2014 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid FWD - 2014 Ford Fusion Hybrid FWD |publisher=www.fueleconomy.gov|author=[[U.S. Department of Energy]] and [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]|accessdate=2014-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ford Mondeo Hybrid===
The Mondeo Hybrid shares the same powertrain of the Fusion Hybrid combining a 2.0-liter gasoline engine with an electric motor and 1.4 kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery. Under the [[New European Driving Cycle]] the Mondeo is rated at {{Convert|67.3|mpgimp|abbr=on}} in combined driving, and {{Convert|100.9|mpgimp|abbr=on}} for urban driving, with {{CO2}} emissions of 99 g/km. Ford set a pricing for the Mondeo Hybrid that is competitive with Mondeo diesel powertrain variants.&lt;ref name=MondeoEU/&gt; Retail deliveries are scheduled to begin in the UK in December 2014 at a pricing starting at {{GBP|24,995}}.&lt;ref name=MondeoEU/&gt;

===Controversy over fuel economy ratings===
{{update|section|date=July 2014}}
In December 2012, [[Motor Trend]] reported that [[Consumer Reports]] and Green Car Reports have found that the 2013 [[Ford C-Max Hybrid]] and 2013 Ford Fusion Hybrid, which share the same powertrain, do not deliver their triple {{convert|47|mpgus|abbr=on}} EPA ratings in real-world use.&lt;ref name=MT1212&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wot.motortrend.com/we-hear-2013-ford-fusion-hybrid-2013-ford-c-max-hybrid-dont-achieve-epa-fuel-economy-ratings-300391.html#axzz2FqEZN68f|title=We Hear: 2013 Ford Fusion Hybrid, C-Max Hybrid Don't Achieve EPA Fuel-Economy Ratings|author= Jake Holmes|work=[[Motor Trend]]|date=December 4, 2012|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CR1212&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.consumerreports.org/cars/2012/12/video-tests-show-2013-ford-fusion-c-max-hybrids-dont-live-up-to-47-mpg-claims.html|title=Tests show Ford Fusion, C-Max hybrids don't live up to 47-mpg claims|author=Consumer Reports|publisher=[[Consumer Reports]]|date=December 6, 2012|accessdate=December 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414134501/http://news.consumerreports.org/cars/2012/12/video-tests-show-2013-ford-fusion-c-max-hybrids-dont-live-up-to-47-mpg-claims.html|archive-date=April 14, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GCR1112&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1080580_ford-hybrids-fuel-economy-failing-to-live-up-to-epa-ratings|title=Ford Hybrids' Fuel Economy Failing To Live Up To EPA Ratings? |author=John Voelcker|publisher=Green Car Reports|date=November 20, 2012|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After running both vehicles through Consumer Reports real-world tests, the magazine found that 2013 Fusion hybrid achieved a combined fuel economy average of {{convert|39|mpgus|abbr=on}}, with {{convert|35|and|41|mpgus|abbr=on}} for city and highway.&lt;ref name=CR1212/&gt; Consumer Reports concluded that the overall fuel economy for the Fusion Hybrid is off by 8 mpg, representing a deviation of about 20%. The consumer magazine said that their overall fuel economy results are usually close to the EPA's combined-mpg estimate, and among current models tested, more than 80% fall within 2 mpg margin. The largest discrepancy the magazine has previously found was 7 and 6 mpg for the [[Toyota Prius c]] and the [[Toyota Prius (XW30)|Prius liftback/fastback]], respectively.&lt;ref name=CR1212/&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT1212/&gt;

A few days later the Environmental Protection Agency said it will review claims that two new Ford hybrid vehicles are not delivering the advertised 47 mpg. Linc Wehrly, Director of Light-duty Vehicle Center Compliance Division at EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] commented that hybrids have far more variability in miles per gallon than a conventional vehicle. Most vehicles' real-world gasoline mileage is less than the EPA sticker number, and can often be 20% less than the sticker number depending on speed, temperature and other factors. The EPA explained that with hybrids the gap is much wider, as high as a 30% drop.&lt;ref name=DT1212&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20121208/AUTO0102/212080368#ixzz2FwSbbWeI|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130122141818/http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20121208/AUTO0102/212080368%23ixzz2FwSbbWeI|url-status=dead|title=EPA will review Ford C-Max, Fusion 47 mpg claims|author=David Shepardson and Karl Henkel|work=[[The Detroit News]]|date=December 8, 2012|accessdate=December 24, 2012|archive-date=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford responded in a statement, saying that, "''Early C-MAX Hybrid and Fusion Hybrid customers praise the vehicles and report a range of fuel economy figures, including some reports above 47 mpg. This reinforces the fact that driving styles, driving conditions, and other factors can cause mileage to vary''."&lt;ref name=LAT1212&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-ford-inflated-fuel-economy-20121206,0,1964927.story|title=Consumer Reports says Ford Fusion, C-Max don't achieve MPG claims |author=Jerry Hirsch|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 6, 2012|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DT1212/&gt; A Ford spokesman also said they followed EPA's test guidelines and the company is standing by the ratings as determined by the current testing protocols. Nevertheless, they are working closely with the agency to determine if any changes are needed for the industry relative to hybrid vehicle testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20121214/AUTO0102/212140426#ixzz2FwWJSPE7|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130121123808/http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20121214/AUTO0102/212140426%23ixzz2FwWJSPE7|url-status=dead|title=Ford stands behind fuel efficiency numbers for C-Max Hybrid|author=Karl Henkel|work=[[The Detroit News]]|date=December 14, 2012|accessdate=December 24, 2012|archive-date=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2012/12/cmax-20121215.html|title=Ford's math on hybrid fuel economy; standing by the C-MAX EPA ratings, acknowledging large real-world variance|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=December 15, 2012|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, Ford issued a voluntary software update for the 2013 model year Fusion, C-Max and MKZ Hybrid, that attempts to improve on the lower-than-expected MPG claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=38296 |title=Ford Further Improving On-Road Hybrid Fuel Economy and Hiring for Future, as Electrified Vehicle Share Quadruples |publisher=Ford |location=U.S. |date=July 16, 2013 |accessdate=July 24, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720011120/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=38296 |archivedate=July 20, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the changes include:
* Increasing the maximum pure electric speed from {{convert|62|to|85|mph|km/h|abbr=on|0}}, allowing increased use of electric-only mode on the highway
* Optimizing the use of Active Grille Shutters to reduce aerodynamic drag under more driving and temperature conditions including cold weather, during air conditioner use and when the engine coolant temperature is higher
* Reducing the electric fan speed as a function of coolant temperature to minimize the fan's energy consumption
* Shortening engine warm-up time by up to 50 percent to enable electric-only driving and engine shutdown at stops sooner after cold starts
* Optimizing the climate control system to minimize use of the air conditioning compressor and reduce the energy used in cold weather operation.

In August 2013, and due to the criticism and after several lawsuits about the worse-than-expected fuel economy, Ford voluntarily lowered all three EPA ratings of the C-Max Hybrid and will pay about a rebate to some 32,000 C-Max owners. The revised fuel economy ratings for combined was lowered from to {{convert|47|to|45|mpgus|abbr=on}}. Ford has no plans to change the fuel economy ratings on the 2013 Fusion hybrid, because the company used the Fusion hybrid test to generate the fuel economy label for the C-Max Hybrid following EPA's rules.&lt;ref name=NewEPArating&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130815/OEM05/130819953/ford-lowers-fuel-economy-rating-on-c-max-hybrid-to-43-mpg#axzz2c5j0FBiD|title=Ford lowers fuel economy rating on C-Max hybrid 8.5% to 43 mpg|author=Nick Bunkley, Bradford Wernle and Gabe Nelson|work=[[Automotive News]]|date=August 15, 2013|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ford Fusion Energi WAS 2017 1637.jpg|thumb|Hybrid 2.0L gasoline powered-engine (left) and inverter system controller on top of the AC electric motor.]]

In May 2016, Ford reported, based on data collected from more than 610 million miles (976 million km) logged by its electrified vehicles through its telematics system, that drivers of these vehicles run an average of {{convert|13,500|mi|abbr=on}} annually on their vehicles, with about half of those miles operating in all-electric mode. A break down of these figures show an average daily commute of {{convert|42|mi|abbr=on}} for Ford Energi plug-in hybrid drivers. Ford notes that with the enhanced electric range of the 2017 model year model, the average Fusion Energi commuter could go the entire day using no gasoline, if the car is fully charged both before leaving for work and before leaving for home. According to Ford data, currently most customers are likely charging their vehicles only at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2016/05/2060527-ford.html | title=2017 Ford Fusion Energi PHEV boosts total range to 610 miles | first=Mike | last=Millikin | publisher=[[Green Car Congress]] | date=2016-05-27 |accessdate=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013===

The introduction of the redesigned 2013 [[model year]] Fusion, with a more fuel efficient second generation powertrain, resulted in increased sales of the hybrid version, and by August 2013, sales were up 275.2% over the same period in 2012. The Fusion Energi achieved record sales in August 2013. Also during this month, the Fusion Hybrid recorded its best sales month ever in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[San Francisco]] and [[Seattle]], and its second best-selling month in [[Los Angeles]], another key hybrid market. This rapid increase in sales contributed to Ford achieving its best August [[electric drive vehicle]] sales ever.&lt;ref name=Sales082013US&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hybridcars.com/august-2013-dashboard/|title=August 2013 Dashboard|author=Jeff Cobb|publisher=HybridCars.com and Baum &amp; Associates|date=2013-09-05|accessdate=2013-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/05/mi-ford-hybrid-sales-idUSnPNDE75054+1e0+PRN20130905|title=Ford Delivers Best August Hybrid Sales Ever with C-MAX Energi and Fusion Energi Achieving Record Sales|author=Ford Press Release|work=[[Reuters]]|date=2013-09-05|accessdate=2013-09-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107185341/http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/05/mi-ford-hybrid-sales-idUSnPNDE75054+1e0+PRN20130905|archivedate=January 7, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fusion Hybrid sales increased 164.3% from 2012 and ended 2013 as the fourth top selling hybrid in the U.S. after the Prius liftback, the Prius c and the Toyota Camry Hybrid.&lt;ref name=Sales2013US/&gt;

The redesigned 2013 model year Lincoln MKZ hybrid also experienced somewhat stronger sales during 2013. In July 2013, Ford announced that for the 2014 model year MKZ hybrid it would increase the share of production allocated to the hybrid version, from 20% for the 2013 model year to 40% of the 2014 model year. The Lincoln MKZ Hybrid is popular among consumers in part because it has the same base price as the non-hybrid MKZ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20130719/AUTO0102/307170113/1148/auto01/Lincoln-double-production-MKZ-Hybrid|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130908160406/http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20130719/AUTO0102/307170113/1148/auto01/Lincoln-double-production-MKZ-Hybrid|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-09-08|title=Lincoln to double production of MKZ Hybrid|author=Karl Henkel|work=[[The Detroit News]]|date=2013-07-19|accessdate=2013-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014===

Sales of hybrid electric cars in the U.S. in 2014 declined 8.8% from 2013. Following the trend of the hybrid market, Fusion Hybrid sales were down 5.0% from 2013, and continued to rank as the fourth top selling hybrid in the U.S. Sales of Lincoln MKZ Hybrid continued its growth trend with sales up 34.3% from a year earlier.&lt;ref name=Sales2014US/&gt; The American plug-in hybrid market in 2014 was up 13.1% from 2013, while combined sales of both of Ford's Energi models (Fusion and C-Max) increased by 50.9% despite the reduction of their fuel economy ratings. Sales of the Fusion Energi were up 89.7% from 2013 while C-Mx Energi sales were up only by 17.9%.&lt;ref name=Sales2014US/&gt;

[[File:Ford Fusion Hybrid WAS 2017 1650.jpg|thumb|Frontal view of the refreshed 2017 Ford Fusion Hybrid]]

===2015===

The American hybrid electric segment continued to decline in 2015, down 15% from 2014. Following the general U.S. trend, Fusion Hybrid sales were down 30.3% from 2014, and the Fusion continued to rank as the fourth top selling hybrid in the U.S. Sales of Lincoln MKZ Hybrid fell 16.2% from a year earlier. The American plug-in hybrid market in 2015 was up 5.8% from 2014, however, sales of the Fusion Energi were down 15.6% from 2014, and C-Mx Energi sales were down by 10.0%. The Fusion Energi ranked as the second top selling plug-in hybrid in the country after the [[Chevrolet Volt]], up from third place in 2014, and passing the [[Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid]].&lt;ref name=Sales2015US/&gt;

===2017===

In 2017, after a redesign which improved efficiency, Ford Fusion Hybrid sales surged by 70.8%, making it the number two selling hybrid car in America, after the Toyota Prius Liftback, which had 12.5% more sales.&lt;ref name=Sales2017US/&gt; In contrast, the newly-released Prius Prime surged 745%, consuming all the growth in the PHEV market, and American PHEVs like the Fusion (-39.6%) and Chevy Volt (-17.7%) suffered steep declines as new PHEV models from Volvo, BMW, and Mercedes ate into American car sales.

===Total US sales===

Since 2009 a total of 356,534 units of the Fusion hybrid family, including the Energi plug-in hybrid, have been sold in the United States through December 2017.&lt;ref name=USSales2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=USSales2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sales2011US/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sales2012US/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sales2013US/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sales2014US" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sales2015US&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hybridcars.com/december-2015-dashboard/|title=December 2015 Dashboard|first=Jeff |last=Cobb |work=HybridCars.com and Baum &amp; Associates|date=2016-01-06|accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sales2016US&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.hybridcars.com/december-2016-dashboard/ |title= December 2016 Dashboard | first= Jeff | last=Cobb | work= HybridCars.com and Baum &amp; Associates | date=2017-01-05 |accessdate=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sales2017US&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.hybridcars.com/december-2017-dashboard/ |title= December 2017 Dashboard | first= Jeff | last=Cobb | work= HybridCars.com and Baum &amp; Associates | date=2018-01-04 |accessdate=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. sales by year for each model and the share of hybrids out of total model sales are shown in the following table:

The '''Ford GT''' is a mid-engine two-seater sports car manufactured and marketed by American automobile manufacturer [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] for the 2005 model year in conjunction with the company's 2003 centenary. The second generation Ford GT became available for the 2017 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stevens|first1=Tim|title=The new Ford GT is a 647-horsepower, twin-turbo, carbon-fiber sports car|url=https://www.cnet.com/products/2016-ford-gt/|website=cnet.com|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.|accessdate=12 January 2015|date=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GT recalls Ford's historically significant [[Ford GT40|GT40]], a consecutive four-time winner of the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] (1966&amp;ndash;1969), including a 1-2-3 finish in 1966.

===Development===

[[File:Ford GT prototype, 'Workhorse 1'.JPG|thumb|The first Ford GT prototype, "Workhorse 1" at the [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby American Museum]], Las Vegas, Nevada|left]]

The Ford GT began life as a [[concept car]] designed in anticipation of the automaker's centennial year and as part of its drive to showcase and revive its "heritage" names such as [[Ford Mustang|Mustang]] and [[Ford Thunderbird|Thunderbird]]. At the [[North American International Auto Show#2002|2002 North American International Auto Show]],&lt;ref name="MT2002"&gt;{{cite web|author= Jeff Bartlett |url = https://www.motortrend.com/news/ford-gt40-3/ |title = EXCLUSIVE: FORD GT40 Legendary American champion reborn |publisher = MotorTrend |date= October 21, 2002|access-date= March 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford unveiled a new '''GT40 Concept''' car. Camilo Pardo, the then head of Ford's "Living Legends" studio, is credited as the chief designer of the GT and worked under the guidance of [[J Mays]]. [[Carroll Shelby]], the original designer of the Shelby GT 500, was brought in by Ford to help develop the GT; which included performance testing of the prototype car. While under development, the project was called ''Petunia''.

The GT is similar in outward appearance to the original GT40, but is bigger, wider, and most importantly {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} taller than the original's {{convert|40|in|cm|abbr=on}} overall height; as a result, a potential name for the car was the GT44. Although the cars are visually related, structurally, there is no similarity between the modern GT and the 1960s GT40 that inspired it. After six weeks from the unveiling of the GT40 concept, Ford announced a limited production run of the car. Three pre-production cars were shown to the public in 2003 as part of Ford's centenary celebrations, and delivery of the production version called simply the Ford GT began in the fall of 2004.

As the Ford GT was built as part of the company's 100th anniversary celebration, the left headlight cluster was designed to read "100".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jalopnik.com/5249176/the-ford-gt-has-a |title=The Ford GT Has a... 100th Anniversary Clue in Its Headlight |publisher=[[Jalopnik]] |date=May 10, 2009 |accessdate=August 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Naming difficulties ===
A British company, [[Safir Engineering]], who built continuation GT40 cars in the 1980s, owned the "GT40" trademark at that time. When production of the continuation cars ended, they sold the excess parts, tooling, design, and trademark to a small [[Ohio]] based company called Safir GT40 Spares. This company licensed the use of the "GT40" trademark to Ford for the initial 2002 show car. When Ford decided to put the GT40 concept to production stage, negotiations between the two firms failed as Ford didn't have the resources to pay US$40 million demanded by the owners of the name, thus the production cars are simply called the GT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.autonews.com/article/20021021/ANA/210210778/how-ford-s-gt40-became-just-the-gt|title=How Ford's GT40 became just the GT|date=21 October 2002|author= K.

=== Production ===
The GT was produced for the 2005 and 2006 model years. The car began assembly at Mayflower Vehicle Systems in [[Norwalk, Ohio|Norwalk]], Ohio and was painted and continued assembly at [[Saleen Special Vehicles]] facility in [[Troy, Michigan|Troy]], Michigan, through contract by Ford. The GT is powered by an engine built at Ford's Romeo Engine Plant in [[Romeo, Michigan]]. Installation of the engine and [[manual transmission|transmission]] along with seats and interior finishing was handled in the [[Special Vehicle Team|SVT]] building at Ford's [[Wixom, Michigan]] plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Saleen makes changes in Ford GT team, says firings not related to program glitches |url=https://autoweek.com/article/car-news/saleen-makes-changes-ford-gt-team-says-firings-not-related-program-glitches |website=Autoweek |language=en |date=7 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 4,500 cars originally planned, approximately 100 were to be exported to Europe, starting in late 2005. An additional 200 cars were destined for sale in Canada. Production ended in September 2006 without reaching the planned production target. Approximately 550 cars were built in 2004, nearly 1,900 in 2005, and just over 1,600 in 2006, for a grand total of 4,038 cars. The final 11 car bodies manufactured by Mayflower Vehicle Systems were disassembled, and the frames and body panels were sold as service parts. The [[Wixom Assembly Plant]] has stopped production of all models as of May 31, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2007/06/01/fords-wixom-plant-heads-to-the-great-assembly-line-in-the-sky/ Fords Wixom Plant Heads to the Great Assembly Line in the Sky] autoblog.com&lt;/ref&gt; Sales of the GT continued into 2007, from cars held in storage and in dealer inventories.

[[File:Ford GT. (5245975584) (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|Ford GT (rear view)]]

When the Ford GT was first announced, the demand outpaced supply, and the cars initially sold for premium prices. The first private sale of Ford's new mid-engine sports car was completed on August 4, 2004, when former [[Microsoft]] executive [[Jon Shirley]] took delivery of his Midnight Blue 2005 Ford GT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=18864 |title=Living legend comes to life as Ford delivers first production 2005 Ford GT |publisher=Media.ford.com |date=August 4, 2004 |accessdate=June 29, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005092102/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=18864 |archivedate=October 5, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shirley earned the right to purchase the first production Ford GT (chassis #10) at a charity auction at the Pebble Beach ''Concours d'Elegance'' Auction after bidding over US$557,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://autos.msn.com/advice/article.aspx?contentid=4022580&amp;src=Home&amp;pos=EditLead |title=Ford GT Delivery – MSN Autos |publisher=Autos.msn.com |date=February 22, 2010 |accessdate=June 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529075532/http://autos.msn.com/advice/article.aspx?contentid=4022580&amp;src=Home&amp;pos=EditLead |archive-date=May 29, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Performance and engineering ===
[[File:Ford GT interior.jpg|right|thumb|The center tunnel of the ''Ford GT'' is made from two aluminum extrusions [[friction stir welding|friction stir welded]] to a bent aluminum sheet and houses the fuel tank]]

The Ford GT features many technologies unique at its time including a [[Superplastic forming|superplastic]]-formed frame, aluminum body panels, roll-bonded floor panels, a [[Friction stir welding|friction stir welded]] center tunnel, covered by a magnesium center console, a "[[Fuel tank#Ship in a bottle|ship-in-a-bottle]]" gas tank, a capless fuel filler system, one-piece panels, and an aluminum engine cover with a one-piece [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fiber]] inner panel.

Brakes are four-piston aluminum [[Brembo]] calipers with cross-drilled and vented rotors at all four corners. When the rear canopy is opened, the rear suspension components and engine are visible.

The 5.4&amp;nbsp;L [[Longitudinal engine|longitudinal]] [[Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|rear mounted]] [[Ford Modular engine#5.4 L|Modular V8 engine]] is an all-[[aluminum alloy]] engine with an [[Eaton Corporation|Eaton]] 2300 [[Rotary-screw compressor#Superchargers|Lysholm screw-type supercharger]]. It features a forged rotating assembly housed in an aluminum block designed specifically for the car. A [[dry sump]] oiling system is employed, allowing the engine to sit low in the car's frame. The [[Overhead camshaft#Dual overhead camshaft|DOHC]] [[Multi-valve#Four-valve cylinder head|4 valves]] per cylinder heads are a revision of the [[Ford Mustang SVT Cobra#1999-2001|2000 Ford Mustang SVT Cobra R]] cylinder heads (with slightly increased wall casting thickness in the exhaust port). The [[camshaft]]s have unique specifications, with more lift and duration than those found in the Shelby GT500.

=== Ford GTX1 ===
[[File:Ford GTX1 Prototype.jpg|thumb|left|Ford GTX1]]

The Ford GTX1 is an aftermarket roadster iteration of the Ford GT introduced by the company at the 2005 [[SEMA Show]]. The car was built by Mark Gerisch, owner of Gennadi design Group from Manitowoc, Wisconsin with assistance from Ford. Kip Ewing, a development engineer who had been involved in the development of the GT and conceived the idea, supervised the project. The resulting car had a chassis 10% less stiff than the standard GT but this did not impact the performance of the car.

The design was inspired by the open top GT40 which was conceived in the 1960s. The car had a modified engine cover, modified doors (with roof portions removed) and a central removal roof bar. Two roof pieces could be installed and removed when the roof bar was installed making the car a T-top, a canvas roof panel would be installed when the roof bar was removed. The car had headrests inspired from the [[Porsche Carrera GT]].

The car received a positive response at the show and customers urged Ford to build this version of the GT but the end of the production of the GT in the forthcoming year meant that it would be expensive to produce another limited variant of the car. The GTX1 was offered as a kit by the body shop adding US$38,000 to the price of a standard Ford GT. The involvement of Ford in the process meant that the warranty and other obligations on the car were unaltered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |URL=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/ford-gtx1-car-news|title=Ford GTX1|date=1 April 2006 |first=Wallace |last=Wyss |publisher=[[Car &amp; Driver]] |access-date=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 100 orders for the GTX1 were received and completed over a two-year planned production period, these including the exact copies of the SEMA show car. Other modifications on the GTX1 included race seats, a customized interior, new Wilwood brakes, a hidden rear bumper and a maximum power increase to {{cvt|700|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. The GTX1 was featured in various automotive publications along with several reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |URL=https://www.autoblog.com/2008/01/06/ford-gtx1-production-comes-to-an-end/ |title=Ford GTX1 production comes to an end |date=6 January 2008 |publisher=Autoblog |access-date=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[North American International Auto Show#2015|2015 North American International Auto Show]] and at the unveiling of the 2015 racing video game ''[[Forza Motorsport 6]]'', a new, redesigned Ford GT was shown to the public with plans for production in 2016. The car marked 50 years since the GT40 won the [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans]] and competed successfully in the [[2016 24 Hours of Le Mans]] to better celebrate the anniversary, winning the LMGTE Pro class.

=== Development ===
The development of the second generation GT at Ford was a very secretive operation–according to design director [[Chris Svensson]], "a handful of twelve people, including some key engineers, had access to the [design studio]".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.topgear.com/car-news/big-reads/inside-ford-gts-secret-design-bunker|title=Inside the Ford GT's Secret Design Bunker|last=Rix|first=Jack|date=|website=Top Gear|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This secrecy was maintained inside Ford and to the press until its 2015 unveiling at the North American Auto Show. 

The design of the new GT began with its aerodynamics package, which was closely related to the ultimate focus of the design team of creating a successful [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] race car.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Low downforce and aerodynamic efficiency were of primary importance in the development of the exterior of the car, and this drove designers to pursue a 'teardrop profile' as often seen in [[Le Mans Prototype|LMP1 cars]]. The powertrain of the new GT, therefore, became a secondary criteria to the external design and aerodynamic performance of the car. Although a V8 and even a V12 engine were both considered, it was ultimately decided to use Ford's [[Ford EcoBoost engine|EcoBoost V6]] engine due to the degrees of freedom that the compact engine gave designers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/ford-gt-return-glory-debord/|title=Inside Ford's Top-Secret Campaign to Remake the Iconic GT|last=Debord|first=Matthew|date=2017-06-09|website=Wired|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intent behind the design was for the overall look of the second generation GT to be recognizeable as a part of the GT line, which meant, for example, a cut back front nose piece, circular tail lights, and raised twin exhaust pipes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There was no explicit requirement for luxury or practicality in the design of the road car, which is the reason behind the car's negligible cargo space and spartan interior. The interior seating position was fixed to provide additional space for the bodywork and teardrop exterior shape.

=== Overview ===
Like its predecessor, the new Ford GT is only offered as a 2-door coupe with the [[Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|mid-rear layout]], for the purpose of improved stability by keeping the center of gravity near the middle. The new GT's weight distribution is 43% front and 57% rear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motor1.com/news/76658/2016-ford-gt-specs-revealed-via-forza-motorsport-6-video-game/|title=2016 Ford GT Specs Revealed Via "Forza Motorsport 6" Video Game?|last=Klein|first=Jonathon|date=2015-09-15|website=motor1.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the first generation car, the new GT has [[butterfly doors]] that no longer include a piece integrated into the roof.


==== Powertrain ====
[[File:Ford GT engine compartment -- 2018 North American International Auto Show in Detroit (39446082370).jpg|left|thumb|Engine compartment showing the EcoBoost V6]]

The car is powered by a {{convert|3496|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} [[twin-turbocharged]] [[Ford EcoBoost engine#3.5L D35 (second generation)|Ford EcoBoost V6 engine]] rated at {{convert|647|hp|kW PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|550|lbft|Nm|abbr=on|0}} of torque.&lt;ref name="foxnews" /&gt; For the 2020 model year and beyond, this power output rating was increased to {{convert|660|hp|kW PS|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1127021_2020-ford-gt-liquid-carbon-may-be-gone-as-quickly-as-it-arrived|title=2020 Ford GT Liquid Carbon may be gone as quickly as it arrived|last=Cole|first=Aaron|date=2020-02-07|website=Motor Authority|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine shares many components with the [[Ford F-Series (thirteenth generation)|F-150]]'s 3.5&amp;nbsp;L V6 engine including the cylinder heads, block and dual fuel system. Notable differences include larger turbochargers, an aluminum intake manifold, a custom dry sump lubrication system, unique camshafts and higher strength rotating and timing drive components.

The engine is paired to a [[Getrag#Transaxles|Getrag ''7DCL750'']] 7-speed [[dual-clutch transmission]], a unit found in similar applications like the [[Mercedes-AMG GT]] and [[Ferrari 458]] sports cars.

==== Chassis ====
Underpinning the new GT is a carbon fiber [[Monocoque#Road vehicles|monocoque]] bolted to aluminum front and rear [[subframe]]s covered in carbon fiber body panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1108496_2017-ford-gt-preview|title=2017 Ford GT preview|last=Bell|first=Kirk|date=2017-01-23|website=Road &amp; Track|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The windshield of the vehicle is made of [[Gorilla Glass]] manufactured by [[Corning Inc.|Corning]], which is also used for manufacturing smartphone screens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ford's GT's windshield will be Gorilla Glass, just like your smartphone screen|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/15/10235542/ford-gt-windshield-gorilla-glass|date=15 December 2015|accessdate=16 December 2015|website=theverge.com|publisher=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gorilla Glass is used to reduce the weight of the vehicle by allowing for a thinner windscreen with the same strength as a normal glass windscreen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford GT to Use Weight-Saving Gorilla Glass Windshield|url=http://www.motortrend.com/news/ford-gt-to-use-weight-saving-gorilla-glass-windshield/|website=Mortortrend.com|publisher=The Enthusiast Network|date=15 December 2015|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GT employs a four-stage external dry sump oil pump and has an oil capacity of {{convert|15.3|USqt|L}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://performance.ford.com/content/dam/fordracing/enthusiasts/Media%20Room/2017/01/2017_GT_Tech_Specs.pdf|title=2017 GT Tech Specs|work=Ford|type=pdf|accessdate=11 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Suspension ====
The new GT uses a [[Pull-rod suspension|pushrod suspension]] system, which move the primary components of the suspension inboard and provide space for the large aerodynamic elements in the bodywork of the car.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/first-drives/a31821/the-wild-engineering-that-gives-the-ford-gt-two-suspensions-at-once/|title=The Wild Engineering That Gives the Ford GT Two Suspensions at Once|last=Sorokanich|first=Bob|date=2018-01-03|website=Road &amp; Track|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suspension is hydraulically adjustable, and the ride height can drop from {{Convert|120|mm|in||abbr=|order=flip}} in comfort mode to {{Convert|70|mm|in||abbr=|order=flip}} in Track or Vmax modes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These drive modes also dynamically adjust the dampening component of the suspension, which consists of two springs stacked in series. In Track and Vmax modes, one of these springs is completely locked to increase the overall [[Spring (device)#Hooke's law|spring rate]] of the system. The car also has a front-axle lifting system for clearing road obstacles and steep entry angles.


==== Wheels ====
[[File:Ford GT at the New York International Auto Show NYIAS (40611962834).jpg|thumb|Optional carbon fiber wheels]]

The new GT is the second Ford vehicle to feature optional carbon fiber wheels, after the [[Shelby Mustang#GT350R|Shelby Mustang GT350R]]. In addition to improved strength and rigidity, these wheels weigh {{convert|2|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} less than their forged aluminum counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15347343/theyre-the-wheel-deal-ford-gt-to-offer-carbon-fiber-wheels/|title=They’re the Wheel Deal: Ford GT to Offer Carbon-Fiber Wheels|last=Fink|first=Greg|date=2016-05-17|website=Car and Driver|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wheels have a diameter of 20 inches at the front and rear, and come equipped with [[Michelin]] Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires with codes of 245/35 R 20 for the front and 325/30 R 20 for the rear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.automobile-catalog.com/tire/2018/2563970/ford_gt.html|title=2018 Ford GT tire and wheel sizes|last=|first=|date=|website=Automobile Catalog|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brakes are ventilated [[Ceramic matrix composite|carbon-ceramic]] discs made by [[Brembo]], with six-piston calipers at the front and four-piston calipers at the rear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fordauthority.com/2017/07/the-ford-gts-high-tech-brembo-brakes-feature-spotlight/|title=The Ford GT’s High-Tech Brembo Brakes: Feature Spotlight|last=Brzozowski|first=Aaron|date=2017-07-18|website=Ford Authority|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Aerodynamics ====
[[File:Edmonton Motor Show 2017 (34103928031).jpg|thumb|Rear view of flying buttresses and extended spoiler|alt=|left]]

The most prominent exterior features of the new GT are the open airflow tunnels built into the rear fenders of the car, referred to as the '[[Flying buttress|flying buttresses]]'. These large aerodynamic elements, enabled by the compact V6 engine and pushrod suspension design, channel air around the teardrop-shaped cockpit over the rear spoiler for increased downforce.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.topgear.com/car-news/supercars/heres-how-ford-gts-aero-works#1|title=Here's how the Ford GT's aero works|last=|first=|date=2017-02-09|website=TopGear|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front end of the GT features a [[Ford GT40|GT40]]-inspired cutaway nose and vents in the hood that pass oncoming air over the top of the car. The rear features a large [[Diffuser (automotive)|diffuser]] and hollow circular tail lights that expel air taken in by vents built into the flying buttresses.

The active rear spoiler of the GT can adjust and adapt to different driving conditions and modes depending on how much downforce is needed. In Track mode, a [[gurney flap]] will extend from the trailing edge of the wing to further increase downforce, and the wing will flip vertical to help stop the car under heavy braking.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Performance ===
The new GT has a claimed top speed of {{convert|216|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}}, and has a power to weight ratio of {{convert|0.43|hp|kW|2|abbr=on}} per kilogram. In steady-state cornering on a skidpad, the GT can achieve 1.11 g of lateral acceleration, and the car is capable of braking from {{convert|70|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}} to a stop in {{convert|145|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}. Independent acceleration figures are provided below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a15716810/ford-gt-full-test-of-the-blue-oval-supercar-review/|title=Ford GT Full Test: La Ford in La France!|last=Duff|first=Mike|date=2018-01-21|website=Car and Driver|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Willow Springs International Raceway]], [[Motor Trend]] test driver [[Randy Pobst]] achieved a [[hot lap]] time of 1:23.69 in a 2017 GT, which at the time made it the fourth-fastest road car tested between the [[Porsche 918 Spyder|2015 Porsche 918 Spyder]] (1:23.54) and the [[Porsche 991#911 Turbo, Turbo S and Turbo S Exclusive Series (2016–2019)|2017 Porsche 911 Turbo S]] (1:24.26).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/gt/2017/2017-ford-gt-first-test-review/|title=2017 Ford GT First Test: The Price of Priceless|last=Evans|first=Scott|date=2018-01-22|website=Motor Trend|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After suffering from mechanical issues during an earlier test by automotive magazine [[Car and Driver]], racing driver [[Billy Johnson (racing driver)|Billy Johnson]] set a lap time around [[Virginia International Raceway]] of 2:38.62 in a 2017 GT. This places it third overall in Car and Driver's testing history at the circuit, between the [[Porsche 911 GT2#991 generation|2018 Porsche 911 GT2 RS Weissach]] (2:37.8) and the [[Chevrolet Corvette (C7)#ZR1|2019 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1]] (2:39.5).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a23319884/lightning-lap-times-historical-data/|title=Lightning Lap Results 2006 to 2019: Every Car, Every Lap Time|last=|first=|date=2018-09-19|website=Car and Driver|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production ===
Production began in December 2016 and is scheduled to continue til October 2020, with a planned production rate of one car per day at [[Multimatic]]'s low-volume assembly facility in Markham, Ontario, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.multimatic.com/showcase/ford-gt-deliveries/&lt;/ref&gt; The cars produced for the 2017 and 2018 model years are allocated through [[Ford Performance]]'s vehicle allocation process. The cars produced for the 2019 model year were primarily for buyers unsuccessful in the initial selection process, and the cars produced for the 2020 model year are for new customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/future-cars/news/a31284/new-ford-gt-production-begins-december-2016/|title=Ford Will Build One GT Per Day From December 2016 to October 2020|date=2016-10-24|newspaper=Road &amp; Track|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2020 model year update ====
For the 2020 model year, the Ford GT received an update that introduced several mechanical upgrades and new special editions. The 3.5&amp;nbsp;L EcoBoost V6 is now rated at {{convert|660|hp|kW PS|abbr=on|0}} due to gallery-cooled pistons and more powerful [[ignition coil]]s.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.autoblog.com/2020/02/06/2020-ford-gt-update/|title=2020 Ford GT gets more power, full carbon fiber body in surprise update|last=Palmer|first=Zac|date=2020-02-06|website=Autoblog|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; New engine tuning also results in a 'broader torque band' according to Ford, although total torque output remains unchanged. The updated GT also comes standard with a new titanium exhaust system developed by [[Akrapovič]], which saves {{convert|9|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}} over the original exhaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newatlas.com/automotive/liquid-carbon-ford-gt-2020/|title=Feast your eyes on the new "Liquid Carbon" Ford GT|last=Blain|first=Loz|date=2020-02-06|website=New Atlas|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suspension stiffness in Track mode has also been further increased, and cooling airflow into the flying buttresses has been improved by new vent design in this updated model.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Special editions ====
[[File:2018 Ford GT (25437330737).jpg|thumb|'67 Heritage Edition in race red]]

There have been number of special edition series for the new GT, often involving unique liveries, materials, or interior changes. These special editions include:

* '''Competition Series:''' All optional carbon fiber parts fitted, with interior weight savings from deletion of A/C, radio hardware, and storage bins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/news/a32721/ford-gt-competition-series/|title=The "Lightweight" Ford GT Competition Series Still Weighs More Than 3000 Pounds|last=Perkins|first=Chris|date=2017-02-23|website=Road &amp; Track|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'66 Heritage Edition:''' Matte or metallic black paint with #2 graphics to honor the winning GT40 Mk II at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans.
* '''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'67 Heritage Edition:''' Race red paint with #1 graphics to honor the winning GT40 Mk II at the [[1967 24 Hours of Le Mans]].
* '''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'68 Heritage Edition:''' Blue and orange [[Gulf Oil]] livery with #9 (2019) or #6 (2020) graphics to honor the back to back wins at the [[1968 24 Hours of Le Mans|1968]] and [[1969 24 Hours of Le Mans]] by the GT40 Mk I.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/08/24/new-2019-ford-gt-heritage-edition-honors-most-famous-paint-schem.html|title=New 2019 Ford GT Heritage Edition Honors Most Famous Paint Scheme in Motorsports|last=|first=|date=2018-08-24|website=Ford Media Center|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Liquid Carbon:''' Exposed carbon fiber body and wheels for the 2020 model year, at an increased price of US$750,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://robbreport.com/motors/cars/ford-2020-gt-liquid-carbon-model-details-2897970/|title=The New 2020 Ford Liquid Carbon GT Is Here and It Costs $750,000|last=Cormack|first=Rachel|date=2020-02-07|website=Robb Report|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GT Mk II ===
A track-day-only version of the new GT, named the GT Mk II, was launched on 4 July 2019 at the [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url=https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2019/07/04/limited-edition-ford-gt.html|title=LIMITED-EDITION, TRACK-ONLY FORD GT MK II UNLEASHES THE NEXT LEVEL OF FORD GT SUPERCAR PERFORMANCE|date=2019-07-04|publisher=Ford|access-date=2019-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name pays homage to the original GT40 Mk II race car that won the [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans]].

The GT Mk II features many substantial changes from the road car that increase its capabilities on the track. The 3.5&amp;nbsp;L EcoBoost V6 engine has been tuned and is rated at over {{convert|700|hp|kW PS|abbr=on|0}}, which is cooled by a roof-mounted air intake and new outboard-mounted [[intercooler]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/a28262586/2020-ford-gt-mk-ii-pictures-specs-info-price-hp/|title=Celebrate July 4th With the New $1.2-Million 700-HP Track-Only Ford GT Mk II|last=Silvestro|first=Brian|date=2019-07-04|website=Road &amp; Track|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The removal of the adjustable ride height system and the stripped-out interior reduces the overall weight of the Mk II by about {{convert|200|lbs|kg|0}} over the road car.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a28267120/ford-gt-mk-ii-photos-info/|title=The Ford GT Mk II Is a $1.2 Million Track-Only Monster with 700 HP|last=Golson|first=Daniel|date=2019-07-04|website=Car and Driver|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The active spoiler has been replaced by a much larger fixed wing, which in combination with a larger diffuser and new aerodynamic elements results in a 400% increase in downforce over the road car.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.topgear.com/car-news/goodwood-festival-speed-2019/track-only-ps1m-ford-gt-mk-ii|title=This is the track-only, £1m Ford GT Mk II|last=Harrison|first=Tom|date=2019-07-04|website=TopGear|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GT Mk II uses smaller 19-inch wheels and Michelin Pilot Sport GT slick racing tires, although it shares the GT's carbon ceramic brakes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

As a result of these changes, the GT Mk II is not street legal. Only 45 will be built, and at a unit price of US$1.2 million it is the most expensive new Ford ever sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gastelu |first1=Gary |title=You can't drive Ford's first million-dollar car on the street |url=https://www.foxnews.com/auto/you-cant-drive-fords-first-million-dollar-car-on-the-street |website=Fox News |accessdate=5 July 2019 |date=28 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mk II, however, is not sold by Ford but rather directly to customers by Multimatic, the Canadian manufacturer of all GT cars.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

* Atlanta-based Robertson Racing entered a Doran-built Ford GT-R in the [[American Le Mans Series]] GT class (formerly GT2).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordgttv.com Ford GT TV] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012045117/http://www.fordgttv.com/ |date=October 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team made its first [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] appearance in 2011, scoring 3rd position overall in the GTE Am Class.
* Black Swan Racing entered a Falken Tires-sponsored Ford GT-R in the GT2 class in the [[American Le Mans Series]] during the 2008 season.
* [[Ford Chip Ganassi Racing]] formerly ran 4 factory-supported Ford GT's. Two in the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]] under the [[LM GTE|LMGTE Pro]] class during the 2016, 2017 &amp; 2018-19 seasons and two in the [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]] in the GTLM class during the 2016, 2017, 2018 &amp; 2019 seasons.


====Ford GT1====
[[File:Ford GT1 Marc VDS Racing Team 40 Silverstone 2011.jpg|thumb|left|A Ford GT1 in the [[FIA GT1 World Championship]] (Silverstone, 2011)]]

The Ford GT1 is a racing version of the Ford GT developed by [[Matech Concepts]] to comply with [[FIA]] GT1 rules. The official race debut of the Ford GT1 coincided with the kick-off of the [[2009 FIA GT Championship season]] in Silverstone. For the [[2010 FIA GT1 World Championship season]] four cars were fielded by two teams: [[Matech Competition]] and [[Marc VDS Racing Team]]. Three cars competed in the [[2010 24 Hours of Le Mans]] race, with two (the number 70 car run by the Marc VDS Racing Team and the number 61 car run by [[Matech|Matech Concepts]]) retiring early on. The third car retired later in the race. For the [[2011 FIA GT1 World Championship season]], Matech left the series which left Marc VDS running the four cars during the season, two under the Marc VDS Racing Team name and the other two cars under the name of Belgian Racing.

====Ford GT3====
[[File:Blancpain Endurance Series - Ford GT - 003.jpg|left|thumb|Ford GT GT3]]

The Ford GT was also homologated for the FIA GT3 rules by Matech Concepts. The Ford GT GT3 is involved in numerous championships including the [[FIA GT3 European Championship]], [[FIA GT1 World Championship]], [[Blancpain Endurance Series]], and others. The GT3 version is slower than the GT1 version (rated at around {{convert|500|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} instead of {{convert|600|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}) and features different bodywork.

====2016 Ford GT Race Program====
On 12 June 2015, at Le Mans, it was announced that Ford will return to the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2016 with a factory-supported, four-car effort operating as Ford Chip Ganassi Racing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fordgt.fordpresskits.com/|title=Ford GT returns to Le Mans 2016|website=Ford GT returns to Le Mans 2016|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ford Chip Ganassi Racing]] cars campaigned in both the [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]] and the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sportscar365.com/lemans/wec/multimatic-playing-major-role-in-ford-gt-program/|title=Multimatic Playing Major Role in Ford GT Program - Sportscar365|website=sportscar365.com|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car debuted at the 2016 [[24 Hours of Daytona]] on January 30–31 finishing seventh and ninth in class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imsa.com/sites/default/files/event-weekends/2016/emedit_event_weekend/em_rolex_24_at_daytona/2016_iwsc_rolex24_officialresults.pdf|title=Rolex 24 at Daytona: Official Race Report|last=|first=|date=|website=Official Results: Rolex 24 at Daytona|publisher=International Motor Sports Association|access-date=March 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19, 2016 the Number 68 Ford GT of Ford Chip Ganassi Racing finished first at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in the [[LM GTE|LMGTE Pro]] class; the victory marked fifty years after Ford won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966, where they came first, second and third with the GT40.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2016/06/19/ford-wins-le-mans/86111308/|title=Ford GT wins at Le Mans, first since 1980|website=Detroit News|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FORD WINS LE MANS!|url=https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2016/06/19/ford-wins-le-mans.html|website=media.ford|publisher=Ford Motor Company|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2016 [[6 Hours of Fuji]] and the [[6 Hours of Shanghai]], both the Ford GT's finished 1-2 at both races, the 67 winning both and the #66 coming second in both.

The '''Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor''' (colloquially referred to simply as the '''CVPI''', '''P71''', '''P7B''' is a four-door [[body-on-frame]] sedan that was manufactured by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] from 1992 to 2011. It is the law enforcement version of the [[Ford Crown Victoria]]. From 1997 to 2011, the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor was the most widely used automobile in [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] operations in the United States, Canada and Saudi Arabia.  They were also used for this purpose on a more limited scale in other countries.

==History==
After the discontinuation of the [[Chevrolet Caprice]], the Ford Motor Company held a near-monopoly on the market for [[Police vehicles in the United States and Canada|police cruisers in the United States and Canada]] for over a decade. The  conventional [[rear-wheel drive]], [[V8 engine|V8]] power, and [[body-on-frame]] construction were considered advantageous for police use. The body-on-frame construction allowed inexpensive repairs after collisions without the need to straighten the [[chassis]]. Rear-wheel drive was deemed  better for hard maneuvers and more robust than the front-wheel-drive competition for rough driving over curbs and other obstacles in the urban environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20110423/ARTICLES/110429869/-1/opinion?p=2&amp;tc=pg |title=Ford to retire Crown Vics; police cars to get makeover |publisher=StarNewsOnline.com |date=April 23, 2011 |author=Brian Freskos |accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor was not sold to the general public, they are widely available via secondhand in North America once they are decommissioned and no longer in service in law enforcement and fleet duty. The cars are in demand by taxi companies, those who want a safe, durable and/or inexpensive car, and those who need a car with a bench seat which can take three passengers in the back. The Crown Victoria Police Interceptor came equipped with many heavy duty parts such as a revised transmission, and a {{convert|186|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} engine. Used Crown Victoria Police Interceptors are normally stripped of any police decals, computer equipment, police radios, and emergency lights before being sold or auctioned to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hendonpub.com/resources/articlearchive/details.aspx?ID=207288 |title=Article Archive&amp;nbsp;— Law and Order, Police Fleet Manager, Tactical Response, Public Safety IT |publisher=Hendon Publishing |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2013-10-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309154923/http://www.hendonpub.com/resources/articlearchive/details.aspx?ID=207288 |archivedate=2012-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the name has been officially in use since 1992, the 1979–1991 full-size [[Ford LTD (North America)|LTDs]] and [[Ford LTD Crown Victoria|LTD Crown Victorias]] used the "P72" production code designation for both [[fleet vehicle|fleet]] and taxi and police models, with the model itself being internally classified as S (similar to LX). From 1992 to 1997, the [[police car]] models of the Crown Victoria (both base and LX trims) were officially known as ''Crown Victoria P71''s.

In the 1993 model year, the Crown Victoria was given a chrome front grille and a [[wikt:reflector|reflector]] strip between the [[taillight]]s. Another minor restyle followed suit in 1995, with a new grille and taillights. To accommodate the design of the 1995's new taillights, the rear license plate was moved from the bumper to the trunk's lid.

[[File:Ohio State Highway Patrol Ford Crown Victoria -1302 (14476399866).jpg|thumb|Crown Victoria Police Interceptor with [[Ohio State Highway Patrol]].]]
For the 1998 model year, the Ford Motor Company restyled the Crown Victoria, eliminating the "aero" look that the first generation Crown Victoria had from 1992 to 1997; adopting the more conservative styling of the Mercury Grand Marquis. Both cars included restyled front and rear end components. The 1998 police package P71 had a chrome grille, chrome door handle trim, chrome bumper strips, and a chrome-trimmed flat black rear fascia with the "Crown Victoria" badge. At this time, the car was still known as the "Crown Victoria P71".{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

In 1999, Ford introduced the "Crown Victoria Police Interceptor" name, with a badge on the trunk lid replacing the 1998 "Crown Victoria" badge. A chrome-trimmed gloss black rear fascia, unpainted door handle trim, black bumper strips, and a gloss black slatted grille were also introduced at this time. Finally, the new "Street Appearance Package", intended to make the Police Interceptor look like a Standard (P73) model, including chrome trimming and badging, was introduced.

Midway through 1999, the taillights were also changed. 1998 and early 1999 models had a separate amber turn signal along the bottom edge of each taillight housing. Starting in mid-1999, the extra bulbs were eliminated and the turn signals returned to the combination of stop/turn setup with red lenses found in many North American cars. Although the lenses changed, the housings did not; they still had the chambers for the separate turn signals that early models had. These chambers were now empty, leaving a perfect place to install in police cars strobe tubes that would not affect brake or turn signal visibility. Non-Police Interceptors and Police Interceptors equipped with the "Street Appearance Package" retained the amber turn signal.

For 2000, the rear fascia and tail-lights lost the chrome trim, and the gloss black grille was dropped in favor of a flat black slatted grille. Further alterations were made in 2001, including removal of all trim on the plastic bumper pieces and a new honeycomb-style grille, replacing the slat-style grille as is found on previous standard Crown Victorias and CVPIs. Power adjustable pedals also became an option starting in the 2001 model year, as height diversity among officers joining police departments increased. Ford also relocated the rear window defrost switch from the left side of the dash to the direct left of the HVAC controls.

The year 2003 brought a minor redesign. The interior door panels and seats were freshened, with side-impact airbags becoming an option. The 2001–2004 CVPIs all look the same on the exterior; the way for one to tell the 2003–2011 cars apart from the 2001 and 2002 models is by examining the wheels. The suspension, brakes, steering, and frame all were redesigned for the 2003 model year. Because of the new underpinnings, the wheels for the newer cars have a much higher offset. They look almost flat, compared to the concave wheels on the older model years. Along with a new wheel design, new hubcaps were introduced. Lastly, the 2003 model year was the last model in the second generation of CVPIs to feature a cassette player in the stock head unit. However, the 2011 model did include an optional player.

The 2004–2011 Police Interceptor is rated for {{convert|186.5|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} mostly due to the addition of a new better flowing [[intake manifold|air intake system]]. This system includes a new airbox that is similar to the [[Mercury Marauder]] [[airbox]] (raised airbox lid, deeper bottom), with an integrated {{convert|80|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} mass airflow (MAF) sensor that is part of the airbox lid (but can be serviced individually). This allows for much more precise flow calibration and reduces the chances of air leakage. The P71 zip tube (the flexible rubber hose between the throttle body and MAF outlet) is also used to reduce NVH (noise, vibration, and harshness) as well as transfer air from the airbox to the throttle body with minimal flow resistance. From 2005 on, the throttle body is no longer manually operated via cable but an electronic Drive-By-Wire (DBW) set up.

Standard on the 2006 is a redesigned instrument cluster, which now sports an analog speedometer, tachometer, digital odometer with hour meter and trip meter features, and cross-compatibility with the civilian version's various features (these are normally locked out, but can be accessed through wiring modification). [[Kevlar]]-lined front doors, which might be useful as protective barriers during gunfights, are optional on the Crown Victoria Police Interceptors for the 2006 Model Year. Also introduced in 2006, for P70/P72 Commercial Heavy Duty models and P71 Police Interceptor models is a 17" steel wheel, replacing the previous 16" wheels, plus new flat gray wheel covers rather than chromed wheel covers as in previous years.

For 2008, the Crown Victoria is restricted to fleet-only sales, and all Panther-platform cars are now [[E85 fuel|flex-fuel]] cars. The CVPI receives some new options, such as the ability to have keyless entry.

For the 2009 model year, the CVPI now has power pedals as standard equipment. Standard equipment across the entire Panther line is side impact airbags and new federally mandated recessed window switches. The CVPI also received upgraded brakes for 2009, although specifics about them are not available. The confirmation flash that occurs when the doors are locked is now automatically disabled when the Courtesy Lamp Disable option is ordered. The confirmation flash was considered to be a safety issue because the lights would flash when officers exited the vehicle and locked the doors, potentially giving their presence away at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tony|last=Gratson|work=Police Fleet Manager Magazine|date=July 2008|url=http://www.hendonpub.com/resources/articlearchive/details.aspx?ID=206939|title=Ford CVPI extended through 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220063240/http://www.hendonpub.com/resources/articlearchive/details.aspx?ID=206939|archivedate=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car gets new styled door moldings and also new for 2009 Ford placed a "Flex Fuel" badge in the lower right corner of the rear facia (2009–2011) even though they were Flex Fuel since 2008. The Street Appearance Package also gets the same new door moldings as found on the civilian fleet only Crown Victoria LX as well as blacked rear fascia like the normal Police Interceptor &amp; Crown Victoria LX.
In 2010, the [[Vehicle Identification Number|VIN]] code "P71" was replaced with "P7B".

The 2011 model year Ford CVPI (P70, P72 taxi/commercial and regular civilian model the P74) received updated larger front headrests to comply with new front crash rating standards.

==Comparison with standard Crown Victoria==
Both cars use the same 4.6&amp;nbsp;L 2V SOHC V8 (both Flex Fuel starting in 2008), [[Ford Modular engine]], and [[Ford AOD transmission|Ford 4-speed]] [[automatic transmission]]. However, there are few notable differences between the Police Interceptor and standard Crown Victoria or Grand Marquis.

=== Engine and drive train ===
The Police Interceptor is equipped with an external oil-to-engine-coolant oil cooler to reduce engine oil temperatures, allowing the vehicles to operate at high rpm/high loads for an extended period of time without the risk of engine oil overheating and subsequent engine damage. This engine oil cooler can be prone to seeping oil from the O-ring seals after the high mileage operation encountered by Police Interceptors, particularly where damaged by road salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Police Interceptor Oil Cooler Information|publisher=p71interceptor.com|url=http://www.idmsvcs.com/2vmod/oilcooler/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Police Interceptor engine calibration includes a slightly higher idle speed (by approximately 40 rpm) and minor changes in the emissions settings. The computer is tuned for more aggressive transmission shift points, and the transmission itself is built for firmer and harder shifts. The EGR system is controlled differently on 03+ vehicles than on 03+ non-police vehicles.

The 2004–2011 Police Interceptors are equipped standard with an open 3.27:1 rear axle (Axle code Z5), with a trac loc 3.27:1 rear axle (Axle Code X5) optional, and are electronically limited to {{convert|129|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} due to critical driveline speed limitations . An optional 3.55:1 trac loc [[axle|rear axle]] [[ratio]] with 119&amp;nbsp;mph speed limiter was also available (Axle code C6).  1999-2001 Police Interceptors equipped with the 3.55:1 rear axle ratio were limited to approximately {{convert|124|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. This compares to the standard non-P71 2.73 rear axle ratio with a speed limitation of  {{convert|110|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} for all "civilian" Crown Victorias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Matt/Bob |last=Hagin|publisher=The Auto Channel|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/vehicles/new/reviews/1999/gap9933.html |title=FORD CROWN VICTORIA LX (1999)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford used an aluminum metal matrix composite [[driveshaft]] for the 1999–2001 Police Interceptors as a measure to allow safe operation at  {{convert|126|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} with the 3.55:1 gear ratio, but it was more expensive than the regular aluminum driveshafts. Ford CVPIs with the 3.27:1 gear ratio were governed to 129 miles per hour after the 3.55:1 gear ratio was eliminated midway though the 2001 model year. Ford reintroduced a 3.55:1 rear axle ratio for the 2004 model year Police Interceptors with a {{convert|119|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} speed limitation to reduce the risk of driveshaft failure. Ford built two different gear ratios for police use. One had the 3.27 gear ratio and was built for highway use, the second option had the 3:55 gear ratio and was built for city use. All CVPIs came standard with a 3.27.1 ratio open differential, however departments could order a 3.55.1 ratio locking differential for better acceleration off the line. Also noteworthy is that all cars came standard with an open differential unless Ford's Trac-Lok Differential was ordered with the car. Trac-Lok was available with the 3.27.1 ratio and came standard with the 3.55.1 ratio.

===Body and chassis===
Another difference is Ford's "severe duty" [[shock absorbers]] that offer a stiffer ride than the standard Crown Victoria. They also have black steel wheels with [[stainless steel]] or [[chrome plating|chromed]] plastic hubcaps.

All Police Interceptors also come with T-409 stainless steel dual exhaust systems without resonators. Standard Crown Victorias come with a stainless steel single [[exhaust system]], while the Handling and Performance Package and LX Sport-equipped Crown Victorias have the same exhaust system as the Police Interceptor, with the resonators. The [[resonator]]s further reduce noise, vibration, and harshness without adding any restriction to the exhaust system. Police Interceptors have higher-rate [[coil spring]]s, approximately {{convert|0.8|in|mm|1}} of additional ground clearance, and thinner rear antiroll bars (shared with the LX Sport) than the Handling and Performance Package Crown Victorias; the base Crown Victoria does not have a rear antiroll bar.

On 2004 and newer models, P71s have a 200&amp;nbsp;[[Ampere|A]] alternator and a 78&amp;nbsp;[[Ampere-hour|A h]] [[Battery (electricity)|battery]].

Ford also offers trunk packages for equipment storage (see below), and as of 2005, has added an optional fire suppression system to the Police Interceptor.

The bulk of police car modifications, such as installation of emergency lights, [[Siren (noisemaker)|sirens]], passenger seat dividers, and plastic rear bench seats, are offered as aftermarket modifications by third parties.

===Interior===
Police Interceptors came standard with manual cloth bucket seats, despite having the shifter on the steering column. This gap between seats is generally filled by a console holding radios, controls for emergency equipment, large firearms, and often a laptop computer or [[mobile data terminal]] (MDT). A velour split-bench was optional, with a power adjustable driver's seat being optional on both the split bench and standard bucket seats. The Police Interceptor also has a calibrated {{convert|140|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} [[speedometer]].

==Identification==
One way to distinguish most P71s is the small "Police Interceptor" badge that replaces the standard "Crown Victoria" markings on the trunk lid, although the Street Appearance Package (SAP) Police Interceptors forego this badge, using the standard Crown Victoria marking. Police Interceptor badges are now available for purchase online, so this identifying technique is not as reliable as it once was. Street Appearance Package (SAP) cars also use chrome trim rather than the black trim of normal Police Interceptors. P71s can also be identified by the dual exhaust and an analog 140&amp;nbsp;mph speedometer. The Police Interceptor has an additional interior trunk release in the center of the dashboard with a prominent warning decal right below it, while the civilian version has it only on the driver's door.{{citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion. Many 2002 CVPI have trunk release on door.  Some P71 models have the trunk release in both locations.|date=December 2010}} All 1998 and newer Crown Victorias made for civilian (non-fleet) use have a five-digit horizontal keypad (known as SecuriCode) above the driver side door handle which can be used to lock/unlock the car and open its trunk. All P70, 71, and 72 Crown Victorias are assembled without this keyless entry system, so unless the driver door was damaged and had an improper replacement door installed any Crown Victoria with a keypad is a civilian one, while any one without a keypad is a P70, 71, or 72 fleet Crown Victoria.  The only completely infallible way to identify a Police Interceptor is to look for the code "P71" in the VIN, or "P7B", as it was renamed in 2010.

Police Interceptors will have the characters "P71" as the model code in the VIN, or "P7B" for 2010+ models, instead of P70 (Stretched wheelbase), P72 (Commercial Heavy Duty/Taxi and fleet vehicles), P73 (Base), P74 (LX), or P75 (1992 Touring Sedan).

Only Police Interceptors were available with black front grilles from the factory.

==Problems and criticism==
{{original research|section|date=January 2019}}
Following the criticism of fires following highway-speed [[rear-end collision]]s, 2005 and later model Police Interceptors now come with an optional [[automatic fire suppression]] system and special "trunk packs" designed to prevent cargo from penetrating the fuel tank in a collision. The customer must pay an additional $150 per car for the trunk packs. For a more detailed discussion of the fuel tank leakage concerns that prompted these changes, see [[Ford Crown Victoria]].

There were also some problems with early 2003 Police Interceptors. The newly designed steel wheels would rust prematurely, and the [[rack and pinion]] steering units would fail early (≤10,000 miles). This was not limited to the Police Interceptor; some 2004 [[Mercury Marauder]]s were also affected. A recall, initiated on March 1, 2007 (07S48) affects the steel wheels used on 2003–05 Police Interceptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2007/RCDNN-07V079-7153.pdf|title=Ford Recall No. 07848|website=NHTSA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue with the wheels have been weld points that come loose, causing rapid air loss in tires and the potential for loss of control. A recall was issued after an investigation by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]. However, the company has created anger among civilian owners of 2003+ Police Interceptors by refusing to honor the recall unless the vehicle is still being used in fleet service. The only way this problem could be addressed is if the civilian customer complains to a dealership about air leakage problems, an inability to balance the wheels properly, or a "nibble" or excessive vibration in the steering at speed. The issue is then addressed through the "Customer Satisfaction Program" that Ford has initiated for the same wheels. Ford ultimately resolved this issue on production cars in 2006 by introducing new 17″ steel wheels for their heavy duty models. These wheels may be of interest to those who have 2003–2005 Police Interceptors, 2003–2005 P70/P72 Commercial Heavy Duty models or 2003–2008 Standard (P73) models with 16″ steel wheels and are concerned about the safety of these wheels.

The steel body-on-frame Crown Victoria Police Interceptor fares better in crashes than current unibody counterparts such as the Chevrolet Impala and Dodge Charger. Many law enforcement officers and departments swear by the proven Crown Victoria, and are reluctant to purchase other police sedans in spite of the Crown Vic's departure. Some departments have purchased the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] 9C1, a full-size SUV, due in part to its body-on-frame construction.

On March 12, 2010, Ford Motor Company unveiled the 2013 Police Interceptor Sedan.  While sharing a nameplate with the Crown Victoria Police Interceptor, the Police Interceptor Sedan was a variant of the [[Ford Police Interceptor Sedan|sixth-generation Ford Taurus]], shifting from the long-running Panther chassis to an [[all-wheel drive]] version of the [[Ford D3 platform|D3]] architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordvehicles.com/fordpoliceinterceptor/|title=The New Ford Police Interceptor (Formerly the CVPI / P71) Law Enforcement Vehicle|publisher=Ford|archive-url=http://www.ford.com/fordpoliceinterceptor/|archive-date=2010-11-30|url-status=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Ford stopped accepting orders for the Crown Victoria Police Interceptor.  Following the 2011 model year, due to its lack of stability control, the Crown Victoria was no longer legal for sale in the United States and Canada; a short 2012 model year was produced solely for GCC/Middle East export.  On September 15, 2011, the final Crown Victoria (destined for Saudi Arabia) rolled off the assembly line at 12:30 PM as the final vehicle assembled by St. Thomas Assembly in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/15/the-last-crown-vic-rolls-and-not-as-a-new-york-cab/|title=The Last Crown Vic Rolls (but Not as a New York Cab)|date=2011-09-15|work=New York Times|accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a design decision, the Police Interceptor Sedan did not adopt the Taurus nameplate, as it was sold alongside the Police Interceptor Utility (derived from the [[Ford Explorer]], 2013–present); neither has been sold for retail sale.  Along with heavier-duty components and a redesigned interior, the Police Interceptor Sedan adopted higher-performance suspension tuning (from the Taurus SHO).  The standard engine was a 3.7L V6 (shared with the Mustang) and an optional 3.5L twin-turbocharged V6 (shared with the Taurus SHO).

In Russia, the [[Main Directorate for Road Traffic Safety (Russia)|Main Directorate for Road Traffic Safety]], popularly known under its historical abbreviation GAI (ГАИ) purchased 140 Crown Victoria P71s from 1994 to 1995.  Part of the [[Militsiya (Russia)|militsiya]] (now [[Police of Russia|Politisya]]), the vehicles were operated by the [[General Administration for Traffic Safety#Other names|Road Patrol Service]] (DPS) as highway patrol units around the greater [[Moscow]] area.  The most powerful vehicles purchased by the DPS at the time&lt;ref name="dps"&gt;''Ford Crown Victoria DPS GAI'', "Avtomobil Na Sluzhbie", Nr. 59, DeAgostini, 2014, ISSN 2223-0440, p.10-14 {{in lang|ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; (replacing [[GAZ Chaika|Chaika]]-engined [[GAZ-24-10|GAZ-24-10 Volgas]]), the Crown Victorias were used by the agency through the early 2010s.

In 2003, three Crown Victoria Police Interceptors were bought by the French city of [[Montpellier]].&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{cite web|author=2/22/15 10:54PM |url=https://oppositelock.kinja.com/that-one-time-a-french-city-bought-cars-too-big-for-its-1687379092 |title=That one time a French city bought cars too big for its roads |publisher=Oppositelock.kinja.com |date= |accessdate=2020-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Purchased as part of an upgrade of the [[Municipal Police (France)|local Police Municapale]], the Crown Victorias were selected for their durability, security, and safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Un mot à ajouter ? |url=https://www.liberation.fr/societe/2003/11/12/voitures-starsky-et-hutch-pour-la-police-montpellieraine_451425 |title=Voitures «Starsky et Hutch» pour la police montpelliéraine - Libération |publisher=Liberation.fr |date= |accessdate=2020-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, they were put up for sale, as the American-designed police cars were found to be too wide for the city streets and too long for police department garages.&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[File:LiveFreeDieHardFBIcar.jpg|thumb|A Police Interceptor used as a prop car in the filming of ''[[Live Free or Die Hard]]'']]

As the Crown Victoria became increasingly ubiquitous within North America as a police vehicle, media from the late 1990s up to at least the mid-to-late-2010s began to follow suit and as a result the Crown Victoria has become a common set-piece in television, cinema, and video games with a North American focus. This came especially after the discontinuation of the [[Chevrolet Caprice 9C1 Police|Chevrolet Caprice 9C1]]. Even years after its discontinuation, the Crown Victoria continues to hold a reputation as a tool of authority within North America.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In Russia, the mid-1990s Crown Victoria became a symbol of Moscow's road [[militsiya]] for over a decade; the P71 is pictured on a DPS badge awarded for 15 years of service.&lt;ref name=dps/&gt;  The cars were featured in several movies and in a 1997-1998 TV show ''[[Perehvat]]'' (The Intercept), where they tried to intercept target automobiles on Moscow streets.&lt;ref name=dps/&gt;

The '''[[Ford]] 3-Ton M1918''' was one of the first tankette designs by the U.S. It was a small two-man, one-gun tank. It was armed with a [[M1919 Browning machine gun]] and could reach a maximum speed of 8&amp;nbsp;mph. The 3-Ton had a 17-gallon tank that gave it a maximum range of 34 miles.

==History==
Design on the 3-ton tank started in mid-1917, before which American tank forces had been largely equipped with British or French examples. The 3-Ton was a two-man tank designed so that American forces could use another tank besides the [[Renault FT]] in battle, and was designed around the FT but as a cheaper alternative. Its two [[Ford Model T engine]]s were controlled by the driver, seated at the front with a gunner beside him who had control of a [[.30-06 Springfield|.30-06]] (7.62 mm) machine gun (either a [[M1895_Colt%E2%80%93Browning_machine_gun#Marlin_Rockwell_M1917.2FM1918_versions|M1917 Marlin machine gun]] or [[M1919 Browning machine gun]]) on a limited-traverse mount with approximately 550 rounds of ammunition. 

The initial production run of the 3-ton was of fifteen vehicles; one of these was sent to France for testing. A contract for 15,000 of these vehicles was awarded; however, the U.S tank corps felt it did not meet the requirements they wanted. The contract for the 15,000 tanks was ended by the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice]], leaving only the fifteen original vehicles produced.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forty|first1=George |last2=Livesey |first2=Jack|title=The Complete Guide to Tanks &amp; Armoured Fighting Vehicles|year=2012|publisher=Arness publishing|location=Leicestershire|isbn=978-1-78019-164-5|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Army evaluated the Ford 3-Ton tank and thought it inferior to the native [[Renault FT]]. However, the 3-Ton Tank was seen to have potential as a cheap, light, all-terrain artillery tractor especially for batteries of the [[Canon de 75 modèle 1897]]. One thousand five hundred 3-Ton tanks were ordered from Ford but the Armistice intervened before any were delivered and the order was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vauvillier |first1=François |title=1916-18 des Chenilles pour le 75 |journal=Guerre, Blindes &amp; Matériel |date=October–December 2009|volume=89|page=74 |lang=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''hemp car''' was a [[prototype car]] built with agricultural plastic.

==History==
[[Henry Ford]] first put [[Eugene Turenne Gregorie]] of his design department in charge of manufacturing. Ultimately he was not satisfied with the proposed project, and gave the project to the Laboratory in [[Greenfield Village]]. The person in charge there was Lowell Overly, who had a background in [[tool and die]] design. The finished [[prototype]] was exhibited in 1941 at the Dearborn Days festival in [[Dearborn, Michigan]]. It was also shown at the [[Michigan State Fair]] Grounds the same year.&lt;ref name="patent"/&gt;

Because of [[World War II]] all US automobile production was curtailed considerably, and the plastic car experiment basically came to a halt. By the end of the war the plastic car idea went into oblivion.{{sfn|Woodyard|2010}} According to Lowell Overly, the prototype car was destroyed by Bob Gregorie.&lt;ref name="patent"/&gt;

Others argue that Ford invested millions of dollars into research to develop the plastic car to no avail.{{sfn|Allen|Robertson|2002|page=121}} He proclaimed he would "grow automobiles from the soil" {{mdash}} however it never happened, even though he had over {{convert|12,000|acre|}} of hemp for experimentation. Some sources even say the Soybean Car wasn't made from soybeans at all {{mdash}} but of [[phenolic plastic]], an extract of [[coal tar]].&lt;ref Name="DeseretNews"&gt;{{cite news |work= [[Deseret News|Deseret News and Telegram]] |location=Salt Lake City |date=April 8, 1954 |page=17 |title=Hemp Car dream goes awry: It's cream (Section A)}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bryan|1993|page=48}}{{sfn|Maxwell|1994|page=93}} One newspaper even reports that all of Ford's research only provided [[whipped cream]] as a final product.&lt;ref Name="DeseretNews"/&gt;

==Reasoning for a plastic car==
The [[Henry Ford Museum]]&lt;ref Name="Benson"/&gt; gives three reasons for Ford's decision to make a plastic automobile, the ''plastic car made from hemp.''{{sfn|Bayman|2007}}
# Ford was looking to integrate industry with agriculture;
# Ford claimed that his plastic made these cars safer than normal metal cars;
# Ford wished to make his new plastic material a replacement for the metals used in normal cars. A side benefit would have been easing of the shortage of metal during [[World War II]].{{sfn|Woodyard|2010}}

==Car ingredients==
The frame of this automobile was made of tubular steel, to which were attached some fourteen plastic panels,{{efn-ua|"Fourteen plastic panels were mounted on a tubular welded frame."{{sfn|Anzovin|2000|page=189}} }} said to be "only a quarter of an inch ({{convert|1/4|in|0|disp=out}}) thick."{{sfn|Maxwell|1994|page=93}} The windows were made of [[acrylic glass|acrylic]] sheets. All of this led to a reduction in weight from {{convert|2500|lb|0}} for a typical car to {{convert|1900|lb|0}}, a reduction in weight of about 25 percent.{{sfn|Anzovin|2000|page=189}}&lt;ref Name="ResearchCenter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehenryford.org/research/soybeancar.aspx |title=Soybean Car |publisher=[[The Henry Ford]] |author=Benson Ford Research Center |year=2011 |accessdate=October 20, 2012 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916140307/http://www.thehenryford.org/research/soybeancar.aspx |archivedate=September 16, 2012 }} including an extensive bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bial|2007|page=33}}

The exact ingredients of the plastic are not known since there were no records kept of the plastic itself. Speculation is that it was a combination of  [[wheat]], hemp, [[flax]] and [[ramie]].

A report circulating on the Internet shows a film from 1941 about the plastic car in the opening credits as being the plastic hemp car, but at the end part it shows images of Henry Ford striking a hammer or axe onto a trunk lid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biography-help.com/henry-ford/henry-ford-plastic-car Henry Ford Plastic Car] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910160527/http://www.biography-help.com/henry-ford/henry-ford-plastic-car |date=2011-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not the Hemp Car he is hitting, but Ford's personal car with a plastic panel of the same material on the trunk,{{sfn|Bayman|2007}} and the hammer had a rubber boot placed on the sharp end of the ax.&lt;ref Name="ResearchCenter"/&gt; When Jack Thompson, the narrator of the 1941 [[black and white film]], stated in the introduction that this was the hemp Car being shown he did not make it clear that the trunk Henry Ford was hitting with the tool at the end of the film was actually Ford's personal car made of the same plastic material—not the Hemp Car itself.{{sfn|Davis|2011}} Henry Ford was doing this demonstration to show the toughness of the plastic material.{{sfn|Bial|2007|page=33}} The demonstration was dramatic, since the tool rebounded with much force and a picture of this was shown worldwide.{{sfn|Prestige Publications|1979|page=425}}

The '''Ford Crestline''' is an [[automobile]] which was produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in the United States for models years 1952 to 1954.&lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt;

==1952==
The Crestline was introduced as the top trim level of the [[1952 Ford]] range, above the intermediate-level [[Ford Customline|Customline]] and base level [[Ford Mainline|Mainline]].&lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt; It was offered in Victoria, Sunliner and Country Squire versions with 2-door [[hardtop]], 2-door [[convertible]] and 4-door [[station wagon]] body styles respectively.&lt;ref name=1952_brochure&gt;''Big 52 Ford'' (1952 US Ford sales brochure)&lt;/ref&gt; Crestlines were offered only with a 239 [[Cubic inch displacement|CID]] "flathead" [[V8 engine]].&lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt;

==1953==
The Crestline was updated with minor styling and trim changes for 1953.&lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt; It retained its position as the top trim level in the Ford range while body styles and engine availability also remained unchanged.&lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt;

==1954==
For 1954 the Crestline was again updated with minor styling and trim changes.&lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt; Fordor Sedan and Skyliner versions were added, the latter being a 2-door [[hardtop]] with a tinted transparent panel in the front section of the roof.&lt;ref name=1954_brochure&gt;''’54 Ford'' (1954 US Ford sales brochure)&lt;/ref&gt; New 223 [[Cubic inch displacement|CID]] [[Straight-six engine|straight-six]] and 239 [[Cubic inch displacement|CID]] overhead valve [[V8 engine|V8]] engines were offered.&lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt;

The Crestline was replaced by the [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Ford Fairlane]] in the [[1955 Ford]] range.&lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt;

The '''Ford Pygmy''' is the pilot vehicle submitted by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in response to the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s requirement for a "light reconnaissance and command car" during the military buildup prior to [[World War II]], which later became better known as the [[Willys MB|World War II jeep]].

The Pygmy is the only known survivor of the original pilot vehicles tested by the Army.

== History ==
[[File:Pygmy01.jpg|left|thumb|Ford Pygmy during testing at Camp Holabird, Maryland]]
[[American Austin Car Company|American Bantam]] was the first to deliver a pilot vehicle to the Army on 23 September 1940. [[Willys-Overland]] followed with its Quad on 13 November. On 23 November,&lt;ref&gt;ARMY MOTORS (1991, Summer). Editor's note. ARMY MOTORS #57, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] delivered two pilot vehicles to [[Fort Holabird|Camp Holabird]], Maryland for testing: the Pygmy and a second vehicle with a body built by the [[Budd Company]]. The Budd-bodied vehicle more closely resembled the Bantam pilot and was not tested by the Army.  Both the Willys and Ford vehicles were heavily based on the Bantam Pilot design.

The Pygmy was hand-built in the Ford development shop in Dearborn, Michigan using parts from Ford's commercial and agricultural lines.  It was the first of the pilot vehicles to feature a flat grill with headlamps positioned behind it for protection, an intermediate bow for the canvas top, its fuel tank mounted inside the body under the driver’s seat, and a two‐piece opening/folding windshield with a round tubing frame. Another innovation was headlamps positioned on hinged brackets which allowed them to be pivoted to illuminate the engine compartment at night. All of these design features were ultimately incorporated into the standard World War II [[Jeep#Origin of the name|jeep]], the {{nowrap|[[Willys MB]].}}

The pilot vehicles were the property of the manufacturer and after testing was complete, the army returned them. The Pygmy was donated to the [[Henry Ford Museum]] by [[Henry Ford II]] in 1948.  It was acquired at auction by a private collector in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;Withrow, Randall. "PYGMY The Saga Continues." ARMY MOTORS #53 Summer 1990: 16-17. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now in the collection of [http://www.memorialmuseum.org The U.S. Veterans Memorial Museum] in Huntsville, Alabama where it is preserved in virtually original un-restored condition.  [[File:Pygmy accession sheet.pdf|thumb|left|Ford Pygmy Accession Sheet]]

The second Ford pilot was discovered in 1998 derelict in a field in California. It was obtained by a private collector in the United Kingdom and has been restored. Neither the original Bantam Pilot nor the Willys Quad are known to have survived.  The oldest (and only) known surviving Bantam BRC‐60, serial number 1007, belongs to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and is currently displayed at the [[Heinz History Center]] in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  It was delivered to the Army 29 November 1940, six days after the Pygmy arrived at Camp Holabird for testing.

[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] manufactured the '''Econoline (E300) Box van''' starting in 1973. It was Ford's direct entry into the commercial midsize heavy equipment markets.  Prior to this introduction, only larger fleet customers could purchase a [[roller door|roll-up]] full-rear-door [[box van]].  Its release enabled a larger group of business and trades to purchase the vehicles. Ford continues to sell updated versions of this very successful design to this day. It has changed to the [[Ford E-Series|E350]] but the concept is still the same. The 14 gauge welded steel boxes ranged from 10 feet to 18 feet in length, with an interior height of 6 feet 2 inches.  The boxes also known as the "high cube design" were designed with square corners and edges to optimize their cargo space.  This design allowed them to load and carry items with square edges like cabinets, without wasting space due to the ceilings interior concave shape of other manufactures vans of the time. Their roll up rear door is full width enabling  much larger and heavier loads to be place into them with a [[forklift]]. The E300 Box Van started as a one-ton configuration. They could be ordered with two ton configurations also. When ordered with the heavier suspension they had a payload capacity of 4300 pounds.

The E300 box vans’ [[gross vehicle weight rating]] vary determined by the [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] configuration at manufacturing.  An average GVW for these is 8,300 pounds unladen.  The payload and weight capacities are due mostly to the [[twin I beam]] front end, and rear end taken directly from the [[F250]] pickup truck.  The box van came standard with 12 × 3″ front and 12 × 12½″ rear brakes.&lt;ref name="Brake Specifications and Options"&gt;{{cite web|title=Brake Specifications and Options|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jsupFcBM7dMC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=GVW+ford+econoline+300&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9vrt8J4zmp&amp;sig=phpAjJVZZZl89e4arcBcQJ7jS-w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CG9jT9r-HMKwiQf1qLjWBQ&amp;ved=0CIgBEOgBMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=GVW%20ford%20econoline%20300&amp;f=false|work=Brake Specifications}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have been a favorite of many of the major moving equipment rental chains since Ford first released them.  They have a lower rear deck for ease of loading than larger truck mounted boxes of their load capacity.

[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] produced three cars between 1932 and 1934: the '''Model&amp;nbsp;B''', the '''Model&amp;nbsp;18''', and the '''Model&amp;nbsp;46'''. These succeeded the [[Ford Model A (1927–1931)|Model&amp;nbsp;A]]. The Model B had an updated four cylinder and was available from 1932 to 1934. The V8 was available in the Model 18 in 1932, and in the Model 46 in 1933 &amp; 1934.  The 18 was the first Ford fitted with the  [[Ford flathead V8 engine|flathead V&amp;#8209;8]]. The company also replaced the [[Ford Model AA|Model AA]] truck with the '''Model BB''', available with either the four- or eight-cylinder engine.

== Technical ==
Rather than just updating the [[Ford Model A (1927–1931)|Model&amp;nbsp;A]], Ford launched a completely new vehicle for 1932. The V8 was marketed as the Model&amp;nbsp;18 in its initial year, but was commonly known as the Ford V‑8. It had the new [[Ford flathead V8 engine|flathead V8]] engine. The Model&amp;nbsp;18 was the first low-priced, mass-marketed car to have a V8 engine, an important milestone in [[Automotive industry in the United States|the American automotive industry]]. The 221 cu in (3.6 l) V8 was rated at 65&amp;nbsp;hp (48&amp;nbsp;kW), but power increased significantly with improvements to the carburetor and ignition in succeeding years. The V8 was more popular than the four-cylinder, which was essentially a variant of the Model&amp;nbsp;A engine with improvements to balancing and lubrication.

Model B was derived with as few technical changes as possible to keep cost low. Other than the engine, and badging on headlamp support bar (later: grille) and hub caps, it was virtually indistinguishable from the V-8. Its intention was to be a price leader, and as it offered more than the popular Model A, this should have been a winning formula. In fact, the new and only slightly more expensive V-8 stole the show, and finally made it obsolete. The V8 engine was previously exclusive to [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln]] products, which in 1932 switched to V12 engines only.

Although there is a certain visual similarity with the predecessor [[Ford Model A (1927–1931)|Model&amp;nbsp;A]], the car was new. While the Model&amp;nbsp;A has a simple frame with two straight longitudinal members, the new car got a longer wheelbase, and an outward curved, double-dropped chassis. In both models the fuel tank is relocated from the cowl as in Model&amp;nbsp;A and late Model&amp;nbsp;T, where its back formed the dash, to the lower rear of the car, as is typical in modern vehicles; thus requiring Ford to include an engine-driven fuel pump rather than rely on gravity feed. While the V8 was developed from scratch, the B just had an improved four-cylinder Model&amp;nbsp;A engine of {{convert|201|cid|L|abbr=on}} [[Engine displacement|displacement]] producing {{convert|50|hp|kW PS}}.

==1932==
[[File:1932-Ford-V8.jpg|thumb|left|1932 Ford V8 Standard Tudor Model 18 with optional color-keyed wheels, white wall tires, and side mounts]]

When Ford introduced the Model A in late 1927, there were several competitors also offering four-cylinder cars, among them [[Chevrolet]], [[Dodge]], [[Durant Motors|Durant]], or [[Willys]]. That changed within a few years, soon leaving the new Plymouth the sole major make in the Ford's price class with a four.

Although sharing a common platform, Model&amp;nbsp;Bs and Model&amp;nbsp;18s came not only in Standard and Deluxe trim, they were available in a large variety of body styles. Some of them, such as the commercial cars described below, were only available as Standards, and a few other came only in Deluxe trim. There were two-door [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]], two-door cabriolet, four-door phaeton, two and four-door sedans, four-door "woodie" station wagon, two-door convertible sedan, panel and [[Sedan delivery|sedan deliveries]], five-window [[coupe]], a sport coupe (stationary softtop), the three-window Deluxe Coupe, and pickup. The wooden panels were manufactured at the [[Ford Iron Mountain Plant]] in the Michigan Upper Peninsula from Ford owned lumber. One of the more well known and popular models was the two-door Victoria, which was largely designed by [[Edsel Ford]]. It was a smaller version of the Lincoln Victoria coupe, built on the [[Lincoln K-series#1932|Lincoln K-series]] chassis with a V8 engine; by 1933 Lincoln no longer used a V8 and only offered the V12, with the V8 now exclusive to Ford branded vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lincoln Series KA Victoria coupe|url=http://www.desertclassics.com/Linc32KAcp.html|website=Desert Classics|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prices ranged from [[United States dollar|US$]]495&lt;ref&gt;Gauld, Graham. "The Ford Motor Company", in Northey, Tom, ed. ''World of Automobiles'' (London: Phoebus, 1974), Volume 6, p.694.&lt;/ref&gt; for the roadster, $490 for the coupes, and $650 for the convertible sedan. Production totals numbered from 12,597 for the roadster to 124,101 for the two-door sedan. Ford sold 298,647 V8-powered 18s in 1932,&lt;ref name="Gauld-p694"&gt;Gauld, p.694.&lt;/ref&gt; and except for the fact Ford could not keep up with V8 demand, the essentially identical four-cylinder B would have been a sales disaster: dealers switched customers to them from the V8, and even then sold only 133,539,&lt;ref name="Gauld-p694" /&gt; in part because the V8 cost just US$10 more.&lt;ref name="Gauld-p694" /&gt;

The B was discontinued because buyers disliked four-cylinder models in general, and because of the huge success of the V8, not for being an inferior car. In fact, it persisted a little longer in Europe, where in many countries the tax system heavily favored smaller-displacement engines.

{{citation needed span|text=Today, the 1932 Model&amp;nbsp;B, although always a little bit in the shadow of the V8, is a highly collectible car and people will pay thousands of dollars to restore one to original specification, which is ironic, as they were once cheap "throwaway" cars popular with [[hot rod]]ders who would tear them apart and use them as the basis for a "build", which is partly why it is so hard to find an unaltered specimen today.|date=June 2019}}

All 1932 Fords—V8-8s and Model Bs—came with black fenders, wire wheels, and a rear-mounted spare wheel (side mounted on cars equipped with a [[trunk (automobile)#Tailgate|tail gate]]). Options included single or twin sidemounts, luggage rack, clock, interior and exterior mirrors, and choice of leather or Broadcloth (closed cars) interior material.

Paints were [[Pyroxylin]] [[lacquer]].&lt;ref&gt;Spencer/Woudenberg: Ford In The Thirties, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standard and Deluxe trim===
The B shared frame, bodies, and even most of the trim with the eight-cylinder car. The only technical difference was the use of the slightly reworked Model A engine, thus the designation B. Most body styles were available as Standard or Deluxe variants with either engine offered as an option. Customers could get a Deluxe version of the 1932 Model B in three-window coupe (which only came in Deluxe model), roadster, phaeton, Tudor and Fordor as well.&lt;ref&gt;Gunnell,  John. ''Standard Catalog of Ford''. (Krause Publications)&lt;!--needs publication year &amp; page--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard trim meant black front window frame, black wire wheels (color optional), black horn (chrome-plated optional), single tail light (second optional), painted dash, position lights integrated in the [[head lamp]]s (Deluxe cowl lamps optional), and less expensive interiors.

==1933==
[[File:1933 Ford Model B 5 window Coupe.jpg|thumb|1933 Ford Model B Standard 5 Window Coupe. This car has incorrect wheels. Painted window frame indicates a Standard. Twin chromed horns and cowl lamps were included on  Deluxes, and proved to be a popular option for Standard models.]]

When the Model 40 and the new B were introduced February 9, 1933, revisions of the car were substantial, especially considering how important the 1932 change had been.  For its second year, the wheelbase was stretched, from 106&amp;nbsp;in (2692&amp;nbsp;mm) to 112&amp;nbsp;in (2845&amp;nbsp;mm) on a new crossmember frame.  The grille was revised, gaining a pointed forward slope at the bottom which resembled either a [[spade]], a [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[shield]], or possibly the 1932 [[Packard Light Eight]] in general outline anyway.  Both the grille and hood louvers curved down and forward.  The overall design and grille were inspired by the English Ford Model Y.  Streamlining was further accentuated by the new hood which now covered the cowl, giving an impression of more length.  In addition, there were more rounded and skirted fenders and new, elegantly bowed bumpers.  Headlamp support bars were no longer in use, and there were new wire wheels. The cars got a new dashboard with instruments set in an oval insert in front of the driver. There was a glove box on the passenger side. Closed Deluxe models received heavy [[DI-NOC]] woodgraining&lt;ref&gt;DiNoc was a widely used photographc method of applying wood imitation on metal surfaces.&lt;/ref&gt; on dash and window frames, and there were deeper seat cushions.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

There were 10 body styles (14 if standard and Deluxe trim levels are counted separately). Now, all were available for V-8s and the Model B, which thus got Deluxe models, too. Convertible Coupes and Victoria came in Deluxe trim only, and the most expensive&lt;!--Contradicted by the $650 convertible above--&gt; car in the line,  the "woody", as a Standard only. It cost US$590 with the four-cylinder engine.&lt;ref name="Kimes-p567" /&gt;

The cars gained about 3 percent in weight, compensated for with more powerful engines, as on the V-8 with its 15 percent increase in power.&lt;ref&gt;Murray/Woudenberg, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Did the 201 get a boost, too? If so, how much?--&gt;

Total sales for the model&amp;nbsp;year were up to 311,113&lt;ref name="Kimes-p567"&gt;Kimes, p. 567&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Gauld p.694 sez half a million--&gt;and 334,969 for calendar year.&lt;ref name="Kimes-p567" /&gt;

==="Model C"===
Power from the V8 rose to 75&amp;nbsp;hp (56&amp;nbsp;kW) with a revised ignition system.{{clarify|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--I'd expect this to need higher compression--&gt; The four-cylinder engine continued unchanged, but was referred to (by some) as the Model&amp;nbsp;C, though Ford never referred to its "Improved Four-Cylinder engine" as a "Model&amp;nbsp;C" engine. There is some dispute over this; some sources say it was a common misconception due to the introduction of a larger counterbalanced crankshaft during the Model&amp;nbsp;B engine production, and the letter "C" casting mark on most, but not all, of the Model&amp;nbsp;B heads.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} On the other side, this integrally counterweighted crankshaft was first introduced for truck engines only. When they proved superior concerning smoothness and longevity, they were introduced for worldwide four cylinder production. Together with the fact that there were huge quantities of "B" code engines in stock which needed to be used up, this explains why there are "B" and "C" coded engines in some model years.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer/Woudenberg, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; as Canadian-built cars used the prefix "C" on their identification plates, there is another source for errors. Model Bs start with prefix "AB", V-8s with "18-1".&lt;ref&gt;Kimes, p. 566&lt;/ref&gt; (Model&amp;nbsp;A [[part number]] suffix was ‑A, Police Special High Compression head part number suffix was ‑b, and there was a fairly large letter "B" casting mark about the center of the head.)

The 1934 Ford (the Model&amp;nbsp;40B) was not as substantial a [[model year]] change as the previous two years had been.[[File:1934 Ford Model 40 (23285375560).jpg|thumb|left|1934 Ford Model 40]]  Noticeable changes included a flatter grille with a wider surround and fewer bars, straight hood louvers, two handles on each side of the hood, smaller head lights and cowl lamps, and a reworked logo. The bare metal dash insert was replaced by painted steel.&lt;ref name="Kimes-p567" /&gt;

V‑8 output was again increased, this time to 85&amp;nbsp;hp (63&amp;nbsp;kW), and the [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]] Model&amp;nbsp;B engine was in its last year, as was the Victoria body style; nevertheless, there were fourteen body options, the Tudor being top-seller.&lt;ref name="Gauld-p694" /&gt; The standard three window coupe was deleted.&lt;ref&gt;Kimes, p. 568&lt;/ref&gt;

Deluxes had [[Pin striping|pinstriping]], again twin (chromed) horns, and twin back lights.&lt;ref name="Kimes-p567" /&gt; Inside, they got more elaborate wood graining.

[[File:Bonnie Clyde Car.jpg|thumb|left|1934 Ford in which [[Bonnie and Clyde]] were ambushed and killed.]]
The 1934 Ford V-8 is infamous as being the vehicle in which the notorious Depression-era bandits [[Bonnie and Clyde|Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow]] were ambushed and killed.&lt;ref name=Milner&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bfLXGwAACAAJ |page=135 |title=The Lives and Times of Bonnie &amp; Clyde |isbn=9780809325528 |last1=Milner |first1=E.

===1934 Model 40 Special Speedster===

[[File:Edsel Ford's Model 40 Special Speedster.jpg|thumb|200px|Edsel Ford's Model 40 Special Speedster]]
Edsel Ford commissioned Ford's chief designer, E.T. "Bob" Gregorie to design and supervise the construction of a personal sports car based on a style of period sports car Mr. Ford had seen in Europe. A special two seat roadster was built from aluminum and installed with a flathead V8 engine. Only one was built and is currently at the Ford House museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edsel Ford's 1934 Model 40 Special Speedster|url=http://www.fordhouse.org/experience/edsel-fords-1934-special-speedster/the-story|website=Edsel and Eleanor Ford House|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hot-rodding variants==
Fords of 1932–1934 are extremely popular with [[hot rod]]ders.
[[File:'32 Ford Model B V8 (Auto classique Bellepros Vaudreuil-Dorion '11).JPG|right|thumb|1932 Ford De Luxe Coupe V8]]
During the period after WWII, Model&amp;nbsp;Bs and 18s were frequently rodded. This continued into the 1960s on a large scale. Today, the roadster and coupe are the most sought-after body styles, as these were popular for street rods and hotrods; unmodified examples have become rare.  Since the 1970s, 1932 bodies and frames have been reproduced either in fiberglass or lately in steel, which has helped resolve sheetmetal shortages, and increased the number of rods being created or restored. These are often very expensive, and a typical show-quality car may sell for $60,000 or more.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Deuce coupe===
{{For|the [[Twyla Tharp]] ballet routine|Deuce Coupe}}
A '''deuce coupe''' (''deuce'' indicating the year "2" in 1932) is a 1932 Ford coupe. The Model 18 coupe with its more powerful [[V8 engine]] was more popular than the [[Four-cylinder engine|four-cylinder]] Model B coupe. In the 1940s, the '32 Ford became an ideal hot rod, being plentiful and cheap enough for young men to buy, and available with a stylish V8 engine. Rodders would strip weight off this readily available car and "[[Engine tuning|hop up]]" or customize the engine. They came in two body styles, the more common [[Hot rod#Language|5-window]] and the rarer [[suicide door]] [[Hot rod#Language|3-window]]. The iconic stature of the 1932-vintage Ford in hot rodding inspired [[The Beach Boys]] to write their hit 1963 song "[[Little Deuce Coupe (song)|Little Deuce Coupe]]" and they also named [[Little Deuce Coupe|one of their three 1963 albums]] after the car. The deuce coupe was also featured as the pivotal street racing car in the 1973 hit film ''[[American Graffiti]]''. The car is also famously referenced in the 1973 [[Bruce Springsteen]] song, [[Blinded by the Light]], made popular by [[Manfred Mann's Earth Band]] in 1977. 

Typical of builds from before World War Two were '35 Ford [[wire-spoke wheels]].&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, Chris. "Then, Now, and Forever" in ''Hot Rod'', March 2017, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately postwar, most rods changed from [[Brake|mechanical]] to [[Hydraulic brake|hydraulic ("juice") brakes]] and from bulb to [[sealed-beam headlight]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, Chris. "Then, Now, and Forever" in ''Hot Rod'', March 2017, pp. 18 and 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The "gow job" morphed into the "hot rod" in the early to middle 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, Chris. "Then, Now, and Forever" in ''Hot Rod'', March 2017, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The mid-1950s and early 1960s custom deuce was typically fenderless and steeply chopped, and almost all Ford (or Mercury, with the {{convert|239|cid|cc|abbr=on}} flathead, introduced in 1939).&lt;ref name="Shelton"&gt;Shelton, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Halibrand]] [[Differential (mechanical device)|quick-change rearend]] was also typical, and an [[Edelbrock]] [[intake manifold]] or Harman and Collins [[ignition magneto]] would not be uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Reproduction spindles, brake drums, and backing based on the 1937s remain available today.&lt;ref name="Shelton" /&gt; Aftermarket "flatty" (flathead) [[cylinder head]]s were available from Barney Navarro,&lt;ref name="Shelton-caption"&gt;Shelton, p.20 caption.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edelbrock|Vic Edelbrock]], and [[Offenhauser]]. The first intake manifold Edelbrock sold was a "slingshot" design for the flathead V8.&lt;ref name="Shelton-caption" /&gt;  Front suspension [[hairpin]]s were adapted from [[sprint car]]s, such as the [[Kurtis Kraft]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, p. 24 and p. 26 caption.&lt;/ref&gt; The first Jimmy [[Supercharging|supercharger]] on a V8 may have been by Navarro in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, p. 26 caption.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brookville Roadster was one of the first companies to reproduce car bodies in steel.&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Little Deuce Coupe''====
[[File:Little Deuce Coupe.jpg|thumb|right|The "little deuce coupe" that appeared on the cover of [[the Beach Boys]]' album ''[[Little Deuce Coupe]]'' (1963)]]

The picture featured on the front cover of the Beach Boys' 1963 album ''[[Little Deuce Coupe]]'' was supplied by ''[[Hot Rod (magazine)|Hot Rod]]'' magazine, and features the body (with his head cropped in the photo) of the car's owner Clarence 'Chili' Catallo and his own customized three-window 1932 Ford coupe.

Catallo had bought the car in 1956 for $75 in [[Michigan]] when he was 15 years old. Catallo replaced the [[Ford flathead V8 engine|stock Ford V-8 engine]] (as in the song) with a newer [[Overhead valve|OHV]] [[Oldsmobile V8 engine|Oldsmobile V8]], [[Custom car#Language|chopped]] and [[Hot rod#Language|channelled]]{{citation needed|date=January 2018|reason=chopped is clear; cite the channelling, because ''NYT'' isn't reliable on this}} to lower the top by {{convert|6|in|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/30/automobiles/collectibles/30DEUCE.html ''New York Times'' online] (retrieved June 16, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the original customizing work, including the stacked headlights (from a later [[Chrysler 300 letter series|1960 Chrysler 300H]]), side trim, and grille was done by [[Alexander Brothers (customizers)|Mike and Larry Alexander]] in the [[Detroit]] suburb of [[Southfield, Michigan|Southfield]]. After Catallo moved to Southern California, additional work, including the chopped top, was done in 1960–61 at Kustom City, [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]]' North Hollywood auto customizing shop. This led to the magazine cover and two years later, the shot was featured as the cover for The Beach Boys' fourth album. Catallo sold the coupe a few years later but, urged by his son Curt, was able to buy it back in the late 1990s for $40,000. The car had since been additionally modified but was restored by Catallo with many of the original parts, so it is again nearly identical to the famous photo. In 2000, the hot rod won the "People's Choice" award at the [[Meadow Brook Concours d'Elegance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/30/automobiles/collectibles/30DEUCE.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|title=Surfers Met Rodders, and a Genre Was Born|first=Rex|last=Roy|date=August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hotrod.com/features/history/historic-cars/hrxp-1203-chili-catallo-1932-ford-three-window-little-deuce-coupe/|title=Little Deuce Coupe|first=Dave|last=Wallace|date=October 19, 2012|website=[[Hot Rod (magazine)|Hot Rod]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern hot rods===
{{citation needed span|text=Most newly built hot rods use fiberglass or more expensive, newly minted, steel bodies. The classic 1932 Ford lines are closely reproduced with new bodies. Because the 1932 Ford is extremely popular with hot rodders, unmodified versions are becoming rare. Although distinctly different in appearance, 1933 and '34 Fords are also popular starting points for hot rod construction, and are also available as reproductions.|date=June 2019}}

===Hot rod gallery===
The following cars might or might not be Model Bs. Chances are also that either non-Ford V-8s were used, or that they have modern parts (chassis, complete bodies, or body panels) that are produced for hot rodder's needs. It is possible to build a complete car consisting only of aftermarket parts.

There were no specific plants for the Model B. It rolled side by side with the V-8 off the line. In 1932, Ford Motor Company had 32 plants in the US, one in Canada, seven in Europe (one for [[Fordson]] [[tractor]] production only), four in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], and one each in [[Turkey]], [[Japan]] and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Norm Darwin, The History of Ford in Australia, p. 39.

[[File:Dorothea Lange atop automobile in California (restored).jpg|thumb|1933 Model 40 (V-8) station wagon. The B is similar; the only outside differences are lack of the V-8 emblem on grille and hub caps. Considered a commercial car, it came in standard guise only.]]

As with the previous model A, there were heavier commercial vehicles. They were available with either the venerable four or the more powerful V-8. The four cylinder truck got the designation "BB", following a practice started with the "[[Ford Model TT|TT]]" and "[[Ford Model AA|AA]]" trucks.

The BB had longer wheelbases of 131.5 or 157 in. (3340 or 3988&amp;nbsp;mm),&lt;ref&gt;Murray/Woudenberg, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; a reinforced frame, heavy duty transmissions and axles, and bigger wheels. Wire wheels were standard on the light duty cars, the heavier got steel wheels (some of them dual on the rear axle). There was a separate catalogue offering popular body styles, rolling chassis or chassis and cab. Many local coachbuilders offered their coachwork to customers in need of more specific solutions. During the [[Great Depression|Depression]], also ambulances, hearses, or fire trucks found their way&lt;!--From where?--&gt; to budget-minded communities and organizations.

Other than with the Model B automobiles, BB designated four as well as eight cylinder trucks. V-8 was strictly an option, even for heavy trucks. The bulk of these vehicles came with four cylinder engines.

These trucks are easily mistaken {{why|date=June 2019}} for B or V-8 commercial cars built on the passenger car chassis. [[Sedan delivery|Sedan deliveries]], pickups, and station wagons were the best remembered of these. They had elongated bodies and stiffer springs, and were generally shown in the commercial car catalogue, even if the wagon was the most expensive body style{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} available on the passenger car chassis.

The history of the Cortina Lotus began in 1961. [[Colin Chapman]] had been wishing to build his own engines for Lotus, mainly because the [[Coventry Climax]] unit was so expensive. Colin Chapman's chance came when he commissioned [[Harry Mundy]] (a close friend and designer of the Coventry Climax engine and technical editor for ''[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]]'') to design a [[Lotus-Ford Twin Cam|twin-cam version]] of the [[Ford Kent engine]]. Most of the development of the engine was done on the 997cc and 1,340cc bottom end, but in 1962 Ford released the 116E five bearing 1,498 cc engine and work centred on this. [[Keith Duckworth]], from [[Cosworth]], played an important part in tuning of the engine. The engine's first appearance was in 1962 at the [[Nürburgring]] in a [[Lotus 23]] driven by [[Jim Clark]]. Almost as soon as the engine appeared in production cars ([[Lotus Elan]]), it was replaced with a larger capacity unit (82.55&amp;nbsp;mm bore to give 1,557 cc). This was in order to get the car closer to the 1.6 litre capacity class in motorsport.

Whilst the engine was being developed, [[Walter Hayes]] (Ford) asked Colin Chapman if he would fit the engine to 1,000 Ford saloons for Group 2 [[homologation]]. Chapman quickly accepted, although it must have been very busy in the [[Cheshunt]] plant, with the Elan about to be launched. The Type 28 or Lotus Cortina or Cortina Lotus (as Ford liked to call it) was duly launched. Ford supplied the 2-door Cortina bodyshells and took care of all the marketing and selling of the cars, whilst Lotus did all the mechanical and cosmetic changes. The major changes involved installing the 1,557 cc ({{convert|105|bhp|kW PS|abbr=on}}) engine, together with the same close-ratio gearbox as the Elan. The rear suspension was drastically altered and lightweight alloy panels were used for doors, bonnet and boot. Lightweight casings were fitted to gearbox and differential. All the Lotus factory cars were painted white with a green stripe (although Ford built some for racing in red, and one customer had a dark blue stripe due to being superstitious about green). The cars also received front quarter bumpers and round Lotus badges were fitted to rear wings and to the right side of the radiator grille.

Interior modifications were limited to a centre console designed to accommodate the new gear lever position, different seats and the later style dashboard, featuring [[tachometer]], [[speedometer]], oil pressure, water temperature and fuel level gauges. A wood-rimmed steering wheel was fitted.

The suspension changes to the car were quite extensive; the car received shorter struts up front, forged track control arms and 5.5J by 13 steel wheel rims. The rear was even more radical with vertical coil spring/dampers replacing the leaf springs and two trailing arms with a A- bracket (which connected to the differential housing and brackets near the trailing arm pivots) sorting out axle location. To support this set-up, further braces were put behind the rear seat and from the rear wheelarch down to chassis in the boot. The stiffening braces meant that the spare wheel had to be moved from the standard Cortina's wheel well and was bolted to the left side of the boot floor. The battery was also relocated to the boot, behind the right wheelarch. Both of these changes made big improvements to overall weight distribution. Another improvement the Cortina Lotus gained was the new braking system ({{convert|9.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} front discs) which were built by brake specialist [[Lucas Industries#Girling|Girling]]. This system also was fitted to Cortina GTs but without a servo, which was fitted in the Cortina Lotus engine bay.

Initially, the engines were built by [[JA Prestwich Industries|J. A Prestwich]] of Tottenham and then [[Villiers Engineering|Villiers]] of Wolverhampton. In 1966, Lotus moved to [[Hethel]] in Norwich where they had their own engine building facilities. The Cortina Lotus used a {{convert|8.0|in|mm|abbr=on}} diaphragm-spring clutch, whereas Ford fitted coil-spring clutches to the rest of the range. The remainder of the gearbox was identical to the Lotus Elan. This led to a few problems because although the ultra-close gear ratios were perfect for the race track or open road, the clutch was given a hard time in traffic. The ratios were later changed.

The early cars were very popular and earned some rave reviews; one magazine described the car as a tin-top version of a [[Lotus Seven|Lotus 7]]. It was 'THE car' for many enthusiasts who before had to settle for a Cortina GT or a [[Mini-Cooper]] and it also amazed a lot of the public who were used to overweight 'sports cars' like the [[Austin-Healey 3000]]. The launch was not perfect however, the car was too specialist for some Ford dealerships who did not understand the car; there are a few stories of incorrect parts being fitted at services. There were a few teething problems reported by the first batch of owners, (most of these problems show how quickly the car was developed) some of the engines were down on power, the gear ratios were too close and the worst problem was the [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]] housing coming away from the casing. This problem was mainly caused by the high loads put on the axle because of the A bracket it was an integral part of the rear suspension. This was made even worse by the fact any oil lost from the axle worked its way on to the bushes of the A bracket. There were four main updates made to the Mk1 Lotus during its production to solve some of these problems. The first change was a swap to a two-piece prop shaft and the lighter alloy transmission casing were changed for standard Ford items; this also included swapping the ultra close ratio gears for Cortina GT gear ratios, the main difference was first, second, and reverse were much higher ratios. from 1964, standard panels were used rather than the light alloy ones. Alloy items and ultra-close ratios coulds be specified when buying new cars.

The second main change came in late 1964 when the entire Cortina range had a facelift which included a full width front grille and aeroflow outlets in the rear quarters because the Cortina Lotus also gained Ford's new ventilation system which also included an update to the interior. The third and probably most important change came in mid-1965, when the Lotus rear suspension was changed for the leaf springs and radius arms of the Cortina GT. This replaced all the stiffening tubing as well. The last update also came in 1965 when the rear drums were swapped for self-adjusting items and also the famous [[Ford Corsair|2000E]] gearbox ratios were used. These lowered first and reverse about halfway between the Cortina GT ratios and the ultra close-ratio box. All these changes made the cars less specialised but far more reliable and all the special parts were still available for competition as well as to members of the public.

The Cortina Lotus had by this time earned an impressive competition reputation. It was also being made in left hand drive when production finished around late 1966 and the Mk2 took over.

[[File:1969 Ford Lotus Cortina Mk2 (21162070183).jpg|thumb|left|Ford Cortina Lotus Mk2]]
Ford wanted to change a few things for the Mk2, the Mk1 had done all and more than they could expect in competition, but the public linked its competition wins with Lotus and its bad points with Ford. Ford still wanted to build a Mk2 Lotus and compete with it, but Lotus were moving from Cheshunt to Hethel so it was a bad time for them to build another model. Ford were also concerned with the unreliability of the Lotus built cars. So a decision was made at Ford that to continue with its competition drive and make the car more cost effective they would make the car at Dagenham themselves, alongside the other Cortinas. So the Mk2 had to be much easier to build than the Mk1 so that it could be made alongside Mk2 GT production, just with a different engine and suspension. The Mk2 took a while to appear, first appearing in 1967. The main difference was the choice of colours and the lack of a stripe, although most had them fitted at Ford dealers at extra cost. The only cosmetic changes made were a black front grille, 5.5J x 13 steel wheels and Lotus badges on rear wings and by the rear number plate. The badge on the front grille was an option at first. Unlike the Mk1, the Mk2 was also made in left hand drive from the start of production. The Mk2 Cortina Lotus also gained an improved and more powerful ({{convert|109|bhp|kW PS|abbr=on}}) engine, which was formerly supplied as the special equipment engine option on Lotus Elan and the Cortina Lotus Mk1. The gearbox ratios remained 2000E ones but the car now used the Mk2 GT remote-control gearchange. The car also had a different final drive of 3.77:1 rather than 3.9:1. The Mk2 was a wider car than the Mk1, so although they looked the same, the steel wheels had a different offset so as not to upset the tracking, and radial tyres &lt;!--(thank you!)--&gt; were now standard. Another attraction was the larger fuel tank. The spare wheel could now be mounted in its wheel well, but the battery remained in the boot to aid weight distribution.

The only real difference to the engine bay was the air cleaner mounted on top of the engine. The interior was almost identical to a GT. The Mk2 did exactly what Ford wanted, it was far more reliable whilst still quick enough to be used in competition, until it was replaced by the [[Ford Escort (Europe)#Ford Escort Mark I .281968.E2.80.931974.29|Escort Twin Cam]]. The car did receive a few updates, but none as urgent as the Mk1's. Only a few months after production started, the Lotus badge on the rear panel was cancelled and a new TWIN CAM badge was fitted under the Cortina script on the boot lid. Despite the badge changes, Ford UK continued to market the model as the "Cortina Lotus".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6Pcn5qtn0?url=http://www.ebay.com/itm/1970-Ford-Cortina-GT-1600E-Lotus-1300-1600-Brochure-England-wu1454-/291127507357 Cortina Lotus page, 1970 Ford Cortina GT 1600E Lotus 1300 1600 Brochure England wu1454, ebay.com] As archived at www.webcitation.org on 17 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;   The new combined clock and centre console was fitted. In late 1968 the entire Mk2 range received some cosmetic changes; for the Lotus, this meant that the 4 dials on top of the dash were brought down and made part of the dash. An internal bonnet release and a more conventional mounting for the handbrake were also phased in. A new single-rail gearshift mechanism was used. The car stayed in production until 1970.

The Cortina Lotus was marketed in Europe as the '''Cortina Twin Cam''' in 1969/70.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lotuscortinainfo.com/?page_id=482 Mk 2 Brochures and Adverts, www.lotuscortinainfo.com] Retrieved on 30 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Two 4-door versions were supplied to the [[Mid-Anglia Constabulary]] for evaluation as use as a fast patrol and pursuit car by British Police forces. The trial never went beyond the two vehicles, which are both still in existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2208893/Straight-Z-cars-Former-police-officer-reunited-Ford-Cortina-40-years-leaving-job-saw-classic-car-magazine.html Straight out of Z Cars!

==Racing==
To [[homologate]] the car for [[Group 2 (racing)|Group 2 Touring Car racing]], 1000 were required to be built in 1963, and the car was duly homologated in September 1963. In the same month, in the car's first outing, in the [[Oulton Park Gold Cup]], the car finished 3rd and 4th behind two [[Ford Galaxie]]s, but beat the 3.8-litre [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguars]] which had been dominant in saloon car racing for so long. Soon Ford were running cars in Britain, Europe, and the USA, with Team Lotus running cars in Britain for Ford, and [[Alan Mann Racing]] running cars in Europe, also on behalf of Ford. The Cortina Lotus was able to beat almost anything except the 7-litre V8 Ford Galaxies, and later, [[Ford Mustang]]s.

In 1964, a Cortina Lotus leading around a bend with its inside front wheel in fresh air became a familiar sight, as the cars were set up with soft rear suspension and a hard front end. Jim Clark won the [[British Saloon Car Championship]] easily, in the USA, Jackie Stewart and Mike Beckwith won the Malboro 12-hour, and [[Alan Mann Racing]] also performed well in the [[European Touring Car Championship|European Touring Car Challenge]], including a 1-2 victory in the 'Motor' Six Hour International Touring Car Race at [[Brands Hatch]]. A Boreham-built car also won its class, came 4th outright, and won the handicap section, in the 4000 mile 10-day Tour de France. Other Cortina Lotus achievements included the Austrian Saloon Car Championship, the South African National Saloon Championship, the Swedish Ice Championship, and the Wills Six-Hour in New Zealand.

1965 saw the Cortina Lotus winning regularly, the car being more competitive due to the increased reliability of the new leaf spring rear end. Driving for [[Alan Mann Racing]], [[Sir John Whitmore]] dominated and won the European Touring Car Championship in KPU-392C, Jack Sears won his class in the British Saloon Car Championship (a Mustang won outright), Jackie Ickx won the Belgian Saloon Car Championship, and a Cortina Lotus won the New Zealand Gold Star Saloon Car Championship. Other wins were the [[Nürburgring Six-Hour]] race, the Swedish National Track Championship, and the Snetterton 500.

In 1966, Team Lotus registered new cars for the British Saloon Car Championship, which was now open to [[Group 5 Special Touring Cars]], as regulations had been changed. Fuel-injection and dry sumping were allowed, and with Lucas injection and tuning by [[BRM]], the engines could produce {{convert|180|bhp|kW PS|abbr=on}} at 7750&amp;nbsp;rpm, increasing their ability to stay with the Mustangs. The cars also had the [[MacPherson strut]]s replaced with coil springs and shock absorbers and a revised wishbone geometry. They scored 8 class wins, many driven by Jim Clark. In the [[European Touring Car Challenge]], Sir John Whitmore scored another four wins, not enough to give him the title, being beaten by [[Alfa Romeo GTA|Alfa Romeo Giulia GTA]]s.

Cortina Lotus Mark 1's are a consistent class winner in modern Historic Touring Car racing throughout the world. The fastest official recorded speed is {{Convert|147|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} at Mount Panorama Bathurst in Australia by Marc Ducquet. The recorded speed by radar on Conrod Straight was 143&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Australian Motor Racing Year Book|publisher=Chevron Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car was owned by Bob Pearson and had a 203HP Twin Cam engine built by Randall Edgell in New Zealand. 185/60-13 Radial tyres, 4.3 differential and 9,500 RPM.&lt;ref&gt;Theoretical maximum speed using this setup without considering the tyre diameter inflation at higher speed is: ((185mm x 0.6 x 2) + (13 x 25.4)) x 3.1416 / 4.3 x 9500 x 60 = 230km/h = 143.7mph assuming on-spec tyre diameter and direct 1:1 top gear.&lt;/ref&gt; Considering the relatively low horsepower of the standard pushrod GT500 Cortina and the Lightweight alloy panelled Cortina Lotus this speed is achievable.  For example, the legendary Australian driver [["Gelignite Jack" Murray]]&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Moore: ''[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/murray-john-eric-jack-15098 Murray, John Eric (Jack) (1907–1983)]'', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Vol. 18, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; driving a Cortina GT500 - Australia's answer to the Cortina Lotus produced to comply with the local build requirements to be able to be raced of 100 units; initial batch 122, as opposed to running the Cortina Lotus which would have been imported with a minimum requirement of 250 - built by and intended for Harry Firth in the 1965 Bathurst 500 was clocked at 118&amp;nbsp;mph down conrod straight using a 3.9 diff, lotus gearbox, large diameter (non radial) tyres and 7,900 rpm.

The Cortina is well known in the USA for its competitiveness in the under 2000 cc class of the [[Trans Am Series]]. Canadian born Australian [[Allan Moffat]] shocked the outright class cars, winning Round 3 of the inaugural series in [[1966 Trans-Am season|1966]] at the [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway|Bryar Motorsports Park]] in [[Loudon, New Hampshire|Loudon]], [[New Hampshire]].

==Rallying==
Whilst the Cortina Lotus is somewhat overshadowed by the success of the [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] in rallying, it performed admirably in the mid-1960s, which might be surprising, given its reputation for unreliability. The first Cortina Lotus to be rallied was a Cortina GT with the Lotus engine, in the 1963 Spa-Sofia-Liege rally in September, just to try out the engine, and driven by Henry Taylor to 4th place. The first outing in a rally by a Cortina Lotus proper was in the 1963 [[RAC Rally]], campaigned again by Taylor, with co-driver Brian Melia. It finished 6th somehow, in spite of its A-bracket rear end needing constant attention. The A-bracket was persevered with by [[Vic Elford]] and [[David Seigle-Morris]] for the 1964 [[Tour de France Automobile]], a 10-day, {{convert|4000|mi|km|sing=on}} event, as it was run completely on sealed roads, unlike the rough RAC Rally. Their car came 4th outright in the Touring Car category, and first in the Handicap category, in a mix of one-hour sprints, [[Hillclimbing|hillclimbs]], and mountain road rallying.

Still, the general dodginess of the A-bracket suspension meant that Ford decided to replace it with the more conventional GT rear suspension. This became available in June 1965, and while the car still seemed to be afflicted with bad luck, a few victories were racked up. Four of the newly updated cars competed in the Alpine rally of July 1965, and Vic Elford's car led outright, all the way. Well, until less than an hour from finishing, when a piece of the distributor fell out and delayed the car 26 minutes. All four cars retired from that year's RAC rally, which was severely snow-affected. The first works victory came in December 1965, when [[Roger Clark]] and Graham Robson won the Welsh International.

In 1966, Ford managed to homologate the car for Group 1, which requires 5000 cars to be built. In the [[Monte Carlo Rally]], Roger Clark finished 4th, only to be disqualified, and then Elford finished 1st in the [[Rallye Sanremo]] (Rally of the Flowers), only to be disqualified as well. Elford came 2nd in the [[Tulip Rally]]. Bengt Söderström was named victor of the [[Acropolis Rally]], after the 1st-placed Mini Cooper S was disqualified. New cars were used for the [[Coupe des Alpes]] (Alpine Rally), where Elford's engine blew up after leading, while Roger Clark finished second. Clark was always competitive, but suffered with unreliable cars, coming 3rd in the Canadian Shell 4000, 2nd in Greece, and 4th in Poland. The Cortina Lotus finally proved itself with an outright win in the RAC rally. F1 World Champion Jim Clark crashed his (twice), but Söderström saw his through to a 13-minute victory, with Gunnar Palm. Other victories in 1966 were in the Geneva rally by Staepelaere, and by Canadian Paul MacLellan in the Shell 4000. A final win before the advent of the Mk. II was also pulled off by Soderstrom in the snowy [[Swedish Rally]] of February 1967.

The '''Ford Transit Connect''' is a [[Compact car|compact]] [[panel van]] developed by [[Ford of Europe|Ford Europe]]. It is built on a dedicated commercial vehicle platform and shares parts with the [[Ford Focus]]. The first generation was designed by [[Peter Horbury]] and introduced in 2002 to replace the older [[Ford Escort (Europe)#Ford Escort Mark VI (1995–2000)|Ford Escort]] and [[Ford Fiesta|Fiesta]]-based [[Ford Courier#European Ford Courier Van (Ford Fiesta based : 1991–2002)|Courier]] van ranges, which had ceased production in the same year. It has been imported to the North American market since the 2010 model year. In North America, the Transit Connect does not have a direct predecessor; the closest vehicle to its size was the standard-length [[Ford Aerostar]] cargo van, which ceased production in 1997.

The '''Ford Tourneo Connect''', a [[leisure activity vehicle]], is a Transit Connect with side windows and rear seats. All Transit Connects bound for the United States are imported in this configuration to avoid the 25% "[[chicken tax]]" on imported light trucks.&lt;ref name="wsjtransit"/&gt; In 2013, US Customs told Ford that they must stop this practice of importing vans disguised as passenger cars.&lt;ref name="ibtimes.com"&gt;http://www.ibtimes.com/chicken-tax-chopping-block-trade-deals-could-see-more-small-pickups-us-market-if-1988363&lt;/ref&gt;

The Transit Connect was introduced in Europe in October 2002 as the replacement for [[Panel van|car-derived vans]] based on the Escort and the Fiesta but as it is built on a dedicated commercial vehicle platform it is not a car derived van itself. Production of the Escort in Europe ceased in 2000 (although the vans carried on for another two years), whilst the Fiesta Courier was also planned to be discontinued when the fifth generation Fiesta entered production in 2002. Ford elected not to develop a direct sedan delivery version of the Focus, instead pursuing a purpose built design.

Sharing few components with the much larger [[Ford Transit|Transit]], the Transit Connect was built on a dedicated commercial vehicle platform [[Ford C170|C170]] similar to the [[Ford Focus (international)|international Ford Focus]], then common with the first generation [[Ford Focus (North America)|North American Ford Focus]].&lt;ref name="next"&gt;{{cite web| title = Ford Imports Transit Connect from Europe| publisher = Nextautos.com, Evan McCausland|date= 2 June 2008| url = http://www.nextautos.com/body-stylesmarket-segment/minivans/08-chicago-ford-imports-transit-connect-from-europe/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than adapting an existing bodystyle into a van, the Transit Connect was designed with sliding side doors.

The Escort van and the Fiesta Courier had been assembled at the [[Halewood Body &amp; Assembly|Halewood]] and [[Ford Dagenham|Dagenham]] plants in England, respectively, but both plants were to cease Ford car production (Halewood was to be handed over to [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]], whilst Dagenham was to become an engine plant only), so a new production facility was needed.

The Transit Connect was assembled by [[Otosan]] in an all-new production facility at [[Gölcük, Kocaeli|Gölcük]], near [[İzmit|Kocaeli]], Turkey.

The Ford Transit Connect was awarded "Van of the Year 2003" by ''[[Professional Van and Light Truck Magazine]]''. In its first year on the North American market, the Transit Connect was awarded "North American Truck of the Year 2010" at the North American International Auto Show (NAIAS).&lt;ref name=truckofyear&gt;{{cite web

===2009 update===
Since mid-2009, the Transit Connect has been imported to the United States and Canada. First shown in the United States at the 2008 [[Chicago Auto Show]], the 2010 production model was introduced at the following year's show on 11 February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/109020916871/ford-launches-all-new-2010-transit-connect-for-us |title=Ford Launches all-new 2010 Transit Connect for U.S. |date=9 February 2009 |author=Michael Gauthier |publisher=World Car Fans }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of the North American variant coincided with a mid-cycle facelift which includes a restyled front grille, a deeper front bumper and a new dashboard featuring the switchgear and instrument pod from the [[Ford Focus (international)|C307 Focus]].

Initially, only the long-wheelbase version of the van,&lt;ref&gt;Ford 2010 Transit Connect brochure, ref. # 10TCONCAT&lt;/ref&gt; outfitted with a 2.0L [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]] petrol engine and 4 speed [[Ford 4F27E transmission|4F27E]], was offered in North America; elsewhere, the 1.8L diesel engine and 5 speed [[manual transmission]] was the only available powertrain.  The 2.0L Duratec DOHC I-4 gasoline engine has 136&amp;nbsp;hp @6300rpm, and 128&amp;nbsp;lb.-ft. of torque @4750 rpm.  It specifies minimum 87 octane gasoline and fuel economy is 21 mpg city/27 mpg hwy and 23 mpg combined.

An electric version followed in 2011, converted by [[Azure Dynamics Corporation]] at a U.S. facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freep.com/article/20090209/BUSINESS01/902090358/1014/Plug-in+Ford+Transit+Connect+to+make+its+debut+in+2010 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627114128/http://www.freep.com/article/20090209/BUSINESS01/902090358/1014/Plug-in+Ford+Transit+Connect+to+make+its+debut+in+2010 |archivedate=27 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To build interest and awareness in North America, Transit Connects specifically equipped as "mobile showrooms" were displayed at industrial parks and other venues in 13 U.S. urban areas in May 2009, with the goal of offering 3,000 test drives to small business owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=30371 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519143402/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=30371 |archivedate=19 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With model year 2011, Ford offered the Transit Connect XLT Premium Wagon in the US and Canada, a passenger version of the van — with seating for five, rear windows that opened for ventilation, blind spot awareness, rear view camera, larger alloy wheels, body-colour grille, and front fog lamps.

The Transit Connect Wagon was the first Ford minivan since the 2007 discontinuation of the [[Ford Freestar|Freestar]], though it was closer in size to the standard length [[Ford Aerostar]] sold from 1986 to 1997.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Trim levels===
In the U.S., the Transit Connect was available in two different trim levels:

'''XL''': Manual windows, manual door locks, cloth seating surfaces, A/M-F/M stereo, two speakers, black-painted steel wheels w/ plastic wheel covers, 2.0L I4 engine, automatic transmission, front-wheel-drive, and air conditioning.

'''XLT''': Power windows, power door locks, four speakers, and exterior-colored accents and bumpers.

For Passenger models, an '''XLT Premium''' model was offered, adding these features to the '''XLT''': A/M-F/M stereo with single-disc CD/MP3 player and USB and auxiliary audio input jacks, leather seating surfaces, rear cargo door trim, and enhanced interior sound deadening material. This model appealed very much to families.

The second generation Transit Connect was introduced on 6 September 2012 in [[Amsterdam]], Netherlands. In its first redesign since its 2002 introduction, the 2014 Transit Connect adopts many features of the ''[[Ford Kinetic Design|Kinetic Design]]'' language. A major design change is an optional rear liftgate in addition to the double rear doors preferred by people in wheel chairs and delivery companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2012/12/2014-ford-transit-connect-a-people-focused-salvo-into-the-commercial-van-market.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Transit Connect will include the optional new feature called [[MyKey]], a personalized key system. MyKey owner controls let the vehicle owner program different keys to restrict different vehicle features, such as top speed and maximum radio volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ford.com/crossovers/transitconnect-wagon |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121204061156/http://www.ford.com/crossovers/transitconnect-wagon/ |archivedate=4 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }} MyKey® | 2014 Ford Transit Connect Wagon | Multi-Purpose For The Multi-You | Ford.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Production now takes place at Valencia, Spain. As before, to avoid the 25% tariff on imported trucks, all cargo vans sold in the United States are built and shipped as passenger vans, which are then converted to cargo configuration before delivery.&lt;ref name="Car and Driver"&gt;{{cite web|title=Car and Driver: Ford Transit Connect|url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/feds-watching-fords-run-around-on-chicken-tax-riles-customs-officials/|publisher=Car and Driver|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports have been published that US Customs told Ford that they must stop this practice.&lt;ref name="ibtimes.com"/&gt;
[[File:2015 Ford Grand Tourneo Connect Zetec 1.5 Rear.jpg|thumb|left|View of optional rear liftgate]]

===North America===
The 2014 Transit Connect is powered by a 2.5&amp;nbsp;L inline-4, or a 1.6&amp;nbsp;L EcoBoost turbocharged inline-4. The only transmission type available is the 6-speed 6F-35 automatic. For buyers interested in alternative-fuel vehicles, Ford offers optional hardware allowing for the 2.5L engine to be converted to use [[compressed natural gas|CNG]] or [[liquefied petroleum gas|LPG/propane]] instead of gasoline.&lt;ref name="CNG/LPG"&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Transit Connect: CNG/LPG Gaseous Engine Prep Package|url=http://www.ford.com/commercial-trucks/transitconnect-commercial/2014/features/#page=Feature23|publisher=Ford Motor Company|accessdate=2 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016064842/http://www.ford.com/commercial-trucks/transitconnect-commercial/2014/features/#page=Feature23|archive-date=16 October 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When sold in the United States, the Tourneo Connect bears the "Transit Connect Wagon" moniker, available in two wheelbases, and with a choice of 5 or 7-passenger seating. The latter configuration is the first 7-passenger minivan sold by Ford since the 2007 discontinuation of the [[Ford Freestar]] and Mercury Monterey.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.autoblog.com/2012/11/13/ford-shows-off-2014-transit-connect-wagon-confirms-cargo-model/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ford.com/commercial-trucks/transit/2014/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214130550/http://www.ford.com/commercial-trucks/transit/2014/ |archivedate=14 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2020|2|26}}&lt;!-- is this vehicle still in production, in 2020?  No source indicates it is. --&gt;

In 2014, it was available in three models:{{cn|date=February 2020}}

'''XL''': 2.5L I4 engine, 6-speed 6F-35 automatic transmission, front-wheel-drive, A/M-F/M stereo with auxiliary audio input jack, two speakers (four speakers for Passenger model), vinyl seating surfaces, manual windows, manual door locks, and sixteen-inch black-painted steel wheels w/ plastic wheel covers. The XL is actually slotted above the XLT in price on the Passenger model.

'''XLT''' adds: A/M-F/M stereo with HD Radio, USB and auxiliary audio input jacks and four speakers (Cargo model) or six speakers (Passenger model), Ford SYNC, power windows, and power door locks. The XLT is actually slotted below the XL in price on the Passenger model.

'''Titanium''', for Passenger model only adds: A/M-F/M stereo with HD Radio, single-disc CD/MP3 player, rear backup camera, USB and auxiliary audio input jacks, leather seating surfaces, third-row seating, keyless entry and security system, increased interior sound deadening and interior panels, and sixteen-inch alloy wheels (upgradeable to seventeen-inch alloy wheels), as well as exterior-colored bumpers and exterior accents. This is the top-of-the-line Transit Connect model for the Passenger model, and is only available for the Passenger model.

=== 2019 facelift ===
For the 2019 model year. the Transit Connect underwent a mid-cycle revision, receiving updates to the front fascia and rear door(s), with the interior receiving a redesigned dashboard.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/news/2019-ford-transit-connect-cargo-van-first-look/|title=2019 Ford Transit Connect Cargo Van First Look|date=2018-03-07|website=Motor Trend Canada|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Retaining the multiple wheelbases and body heights from its 2014 launch, the facelifted model replaces the 2.5L engine with a 2.0L direct-injection I4 (the 2.5L engine remains an option for LPG/CNG conversion).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  At the launch of the model facelift, a 1.5L [[EcoBlue]] diesel engine was announced; both engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission.  In July 2019, after several delays, production of the diesel Transit Connect was abandoned for North America.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a28337911/ford-transit-connect-diesel-dead/&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2020 production, Ford ended production of the short-wheelbase Transit Connect passenger van, solely offering the three-row body style.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Safety and recall===
In 2017, Ford recalled 2013-2015 Ford Transit Connect with 1.6 ecoboost engines because of a risk of engine fires caused by a “lack of coolant circulation”. The recall partly contributed to a charge of US$300 million by Ford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lynch|first1=Jim|title=Ford recalls 230,000 cars over potential engine fires|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2017/03/29/ford-recall/99771750/|accessdate=1 April 2017|work=The Detroit News|date=29 Mar 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krisher|first1=Tom|title=Ford recalls 570,000 vehicles for engine fire risk, door latch trouble|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/ford-recalls-570000-vehicles-for-engine-fire-risk-door-latch-trouble/article34471584/|accessdate=1 April 2017|work=The Globe and Mail|agency=AP|date=29 Mar 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tariff circumvention==
Ford imports all Transit Connects as ''passenger vehicles'' with rear windows, rear seats, and rear seat-belts to circumvent the [[chicken tax|25% tariff]] on imported [[light trucks]].&lt;ref name="wsjtransit"&gt;{{cite news
 | title = To Outfox the Chicken Tax, Ford Strips Its Own Vans

| date=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicles are exported from Turkey on cargo ships owned by [[Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics]], arrive in Baltimore, and are converted into ''commercial vehicles'' at WWL Vehicle Services Americas Inc. facility: rear windows are replaced with metal panels and rear seats removed (except on wagons).&lt;ref name="wsjtransit"/&gt; The removed parts are recycled.&lt;ref name="wsjtransit"/&gt;

The process exploited a perceived loophole in the customs definition of a commercial vehicle. As cargo does not need seats with seat belts or rear windows, presence of those items exempts the vehicle from ''commercial vehicle'' status. The conversion cost Ford hundreds of dollars per van but saved thousands over having to pay the tax.&lt;ref name="wsjtransit"/&gt;

Partly because of this, only the long-wheelbase, high-roof configuration is exported to North America. In most places the high-roof Transit Connect, like most Ford Econoline vans, is unable to access multi-story parking because of its height of 1.98 m (6′ 6″).&lt;ref name="Autoblog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/11/13/2014-ford-transit-connect-wagon-brings-minivans-back-to-the-blue/ | title=2014 Ford Transit Connect Wagon brings minivans back to the Blue Oval | date=13 November 2012 | accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2018, Ford continues to employ the loophole but has been continuously in court over the practice.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/the-strange-case-of-fords-attempt-to-avoid-thechicken-tax/2018/07/06/643624fa-796a-11e8-8df3-007495a78738_story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2019, the United States won its appeal in the Federal Appellate Court.  The court determined that the Ford Transit Connect was a vehicle for the transportation of cargo.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/18-1018.Opinion.6-7-2019.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2019 production, the conversion process of Transit Connects has undergone major revision.  While all vehicles are still imported from Spain as passenger vehicles and converted to cargo vans (a process that happens to approximately 85% of Transit Connects imported to North America&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;), the conversion no longer involves the disposal/recycling of the removed parts; instead, the removed rear seats and rear windows are shipped to Ford in Spain for reuse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The next-generation Transit Connect, due for the 2022 model year, will be fully assembled for North America in [[Mexico]] at [[Hermosillo Stamping and Assembly]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Like all future Ford products built in Mexico, it will comply with the 75% US/Canada/Mexico content rule of the new [[USMCA]] trade deal set to take effect in 2020.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

==Fleet usage==

=== Grumman LLV replacement ===
[[File:Ford Transit Connect.jpg|thumb|Ford Transit Connect of Canada Post]]
On 18 March 2010, [[Canada Post]] and [[Ford Motor Company]] announced that Canada Post would purchase a fleet of Ford Transit Connect vans to replace their aging fleet of [[Grumman LLV]] vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;Ford Motor Company Press Release, [http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=32230 "Canada Post Selects Ford Transit Connect to Replace Aging National Fleet of Light Vehicles,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719163146/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=32230 |date=19 July 2010 }} 18 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Right-hand-drive tooling already existed for the versions sold in RHD markets, likely contributing to the model's selection. However, all Canada Post Transit Connects are left-hand-drive.

===Taxicab===
[[File:NYC taxi of tomorrow 2014 NY Auto Show.jpg|thumb|right|Ford Transit New York City's [[Taxicabs of New York City#2010s – Taxi of Tomorrow|Taxi of Tomorrow]].]]
In fleet (taxi) applications, Ford markets the Ford Transit Connect Wagon as a replacement for the Ford Crown Victoria LWB (discontinued in 2011).  For taxi use, modifications include shifting the rear seat several inches rearward (to increase legroom and to allow for the fitment of a partition), rear-seat climate controls, and [[school bus yellow]] paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ford.com/commercial-trucks/transitconnect-commercial/trim/xltwagonpremium/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=22 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507045245/http://www.ford.com/commercial-trucks/transitconnect-commercial/trim/xltwagonpremium/ |archive-date=7 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2011, the Transit Connect was one of three finalists (alongside the [[Karsan V-1]] and the [[Nissan NV200]])  in the New York City [[Taxicabs of New York City#2010s – Taxi of Tomorrow|Taxi of Tomorrow]] bid, in a potential 10-year contract to supply the city with taxicabs exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://autos.aol.com/article/taxi-of-tomorrow/|title=Meet the Taxis of Tomorrow|author=Berk, Honey|date=5 December 2010|accessdate=26 January 2011|publisher=[[AOL]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While losing the Taxi of Tomorrow bid to the Nissan NV200, the Transit Connect Wagon remains in use as a taxicab replacement for the Crown Victoria in New York City (as an accessible cab) and other American municipalities, as well as [[Hong Kong]].

===Transit Connect X-Press===
In 2004, Ford of Europe created the Ford Transit Connect X-Press, based upon a pre-production Transit Connect prototype and a 212&amp;nbsp;hp 2.0L engine of the [[Ford Focus (first generation)#RS|Ford Focus RS]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/carreviews/firstdrives/45035/ford_transit_connect_xpress.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Using a short-wheelbase cargo van with a rear liftgate, the X-Press is fitted with the front suspension, four-wheel disc brakes, and steering of the Focus RS.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;http://jalopnik.com/225660/speedy-delivery-the-ford-transit-connect-x+press&lt;/ref&gt;  The cargo bay is fitted with a full-body roll cage along with two spare tires.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

During 2006, the Transit Connect X-Press saw minor exterior changes to better reflect the production vehicle.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Tourneo Connect===
The '''Ford Tourneo Connect''' is a [[leisure activity vehicle]] produced by [[Ford]], which was first put into production in 2002 to the British market. Much like the Tourneo is a passenger version of the Transit, the Tourneo Connect was designed with rear windows and seats. Principally termed a commercial vehicle, Ford predicted relatively low sales of between 800–1000 mainly to [[taxicab|taxi]] operators, due to its given status as a commercial vehicle. However, Ford described the Connect as a 'dual use' vehicle, equally able to meet business and leisure needs. It was put into production to rival the similar models of the [[Citroën Berlingo]], [[Citroën Berlingo|Peugeot Partner]], [[Volkswagen Caddy]], [[Fiat Doblò]] and the [[Opel Combo|Opel/Vauxhall Combo Tour]].

The Connect, when first sold, was the only vehicle of its kind to offer folding and separately removable 60/40 split rear seats that allowed multiple seating formations and increased load capacity. It also boasted the option of twin sliding side load doors as well as rear doors or a tailgate, whereas neither of its main competitors have this option. The Connect's design emphasizes Ford's ideal that the vehicle be multipurpose.&lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

'''Ford Thunderbird''' (colloquially called the '''T-Bird''') is a nameplate that was used by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] from [[model year]]s 1955 to 1997 and 2002 to 2005 for a [[personal luxury car]] during which there were eleven distinct generations. Introduced as a two-seat [[convertible]], the Thunderbird was produced in a variety of body configurations. These included a four-seat [[hardtop]] coupe, four-seat convertible, five-seat convertible and hardtop, four-door pillared hardtop sedan, six-passenger hardtop coupe, and five passenger pillared coupe, with the final generation designed again as a two-seat convertible.

Ford targeted the two-seat Thunderbird as an upscale model, but the design introduced for 1958 featured a rear seat and arguably marked expansion of a market segment eventually known as [[personal luxury car]]s. An American interpretation of the [[grand tourer]], personal luxury cars were built with a higher emphasis on driving comfort and convenience features over handling and high-speed performance. From 1968 to 1998, Lincoln-Mercury marketed their own versions of the Thunderbird as the [[Lincoln Continental Mark III|Continental Mark III]], [[Lincoln Continental Mark IV|Mark IV]], [[Lincoln Mark V|Mark V]], [[Mercury Cougar]], [[Lincoln Continental Mark VII|Lincoln Mark VII]], and [[Lincoln Mark VIII]].

==Overview==
The Thunderbird entered production for the 1955 [[model year]] as a sporty two-seat convertible. Unlike the [[Chevrolet Corvette]], it was not marketed as a [[sports car]]. Ford positioned the Thunderbird as an upscale model and it is credited in developing a new market segment, the [[personal luxury car]]. For 1958, the Thunderbird was redesigned with a second row of seats. Succeeding generations became larger until the line was downsized in 1977, again in 1980, and once again in 1983. Sales were good until the 1990s, when large 2-door [[coupe]]s became unpopular. Initial production ceased at the end of 1997. In 2002, production of the Thunderbird started again; a revived 2-seat model was launched which was available through the end of the 2005 model year. From its introduction in 1955 to its final phaseout in 2005, Ford produced over 4.4&amp;nbsp;million Thunderbirds.&lt;ref name="tast"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tast |first=Alan H. |first2=David |last2=Newhardt |title=Thunderbird Fifty Years |publisher=Motorbooks |year=2015 |isbn=9780785832454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convertible models==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}
The [[Ford Thunderbird (second generation)|Second]] to [[Ford Thunderbird (fourth generation)|Fourth Generation Thunderbird]] convertibles were similar in design to the Lincoln convertible of the time and utilized a design from earlier Ford hardtop and convertible models. While these Thunderbird models had a true convertible soft top, the top was lowered to stow in the trunk. This design reduced available trunk space when the top was down.

The trunk lid was rear-hinged; raised and lowered via hydraulic cylinders during the top raising or lowering cycle. The forward end of the trunk lid contained a metal plate that extended upward to cover the area that the top is stowed in. With the top down and the trunk lid lowered, there is no sight of the soft top. With the top down, ehe overall appearance had no trace of a convertible top and no separate cover boot was needed.

However, this design could present a challenge to one who is troubleshooting a convertible top malfunction. The system consists of a spiderweb of solenoids, relays, limit switches, electric motors, a hydraulic pump/reservoir, hydraulic directional valves and cylinders. While the hydraulics are not often a cause for trouble, the electrical relays are known to fail. Failure of any of the relays, motors or limit switches will prevent the convertible system from completing the cycle.

Unlike hardtop models that utilized a conventional key-secured, forward hinged design, the convertibles combined the trunk opening and closing within the convertible top operating system.

==Genesis==
A smaller two-seater sports roadster was developed at the behest of [[Henry Ford II]] in 1953 called the [[Ford Vega|Vega]]. The completed one-off generated interest at the time, but had meager power, European looks, and a correspondingly high cost, so it never proceeded to production. The Thunderbird was similar in concept, but would be more American in style, more luxurious, and less sport-oriented.

Credit for the development of the original Thunderbird is given to [[Lewis Crusoe]], a former GM executive lured out of retirement by [[Henry Ford II]]; [[George W. Walker|George Walker]], chief stylist and a Ford vice-president; [[Frank Hershey]], chief stylist for Ford Division; Bill Boyer, designer Body Development Studio who became manager of Thunderbird Studio in spring of 1955; and Bill Burnett, chief engineer. Ford Designer William P. Boyer was lead stylist on the original 1955 two-seater Thunderbird and also had input in following series of Thunderbirds including the 30th Anniversary Edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Obituary: William Boyer |url= http://www.autonews.com/article/20030203/ANA/302030760/obituary%3A-william-boyer |date=February 3, 2003 |work=Automotive News |accessdate=November 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hershey's participation in the creation of the Thunderbird was more administrative than artistic. {{citation needed span|Crusoe and Walker met in France in October 1951. Walking in the [[Grand Palais]] in Paris, Crusoe pointed at a sports car and asked Walker, 'Why can't we have something like that?' Some versions of the story claim that Walker replied by telling Crusoe, "oh, we're working on it" ... although if anything existed at the time beyond casual dream-car sketches by members of the design staff, records of it have never come to light.|date=February 2020}}

Walker promptly telephoned Ford's HQ in [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]] and told designer Frank Hershey about the conversation with Crusoe. Hershey took the idea and began working on the vehicle. The concept was for a two-passenger open car, with a target weight of {{convert|2525|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}, an Interceptor [[V8 engine]] based on the forthcoming overhead-valve Ford V8 slated for 1954 model year introduction, and a top speed of over {{convert|100|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}}. Crusoe saw a painted clay model on May 18, 1953, which corresponded closely to the final car; he gave the car the go-ahead in September after comparing it with current European trends. After Henry Ford II returned from the [[LA Auto Show|Los Angeles Auto Show]] (Autorama) in 1953, he approved the final design concept to compete with the then new Corvette.

The name was not among the thousands proposed, including rejected options such as Apache (the original name of the [[P-51 Mustang]]), Falcon (owned by Chrysler at the time),&lt;ref&gt;Witzenburg, Gary. "The Name Game", ''Motor Trend'', 4/84, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Eagle, Tropicale, Hawaiian, and [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)#Thunderbolt|Thunderbolt]].&lt;ref name="Witzenburg, p.86"&gt;Witzenburg, p.86.&lt;/ref&gt; A Ford stylist who had lived in the southwest submitted the Thunderbird name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mike |first=Hanlon |title=Ford's historic Thunderbird nameplate returns to the future-product vault |url= https://newatlas.com/go/3849/ |work=New Atlas |accessdate=November 13, 2018 |date=March 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "[[Thunderbird (mythology)|thunderbird]]" is a reference to a [[legendary creature]] for [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|North American indigenous people]]. It is considered a supernatural bird of power and strength.

[[Thunderbird Country Club]] in Rancho Mirage, California also lays claim to being the inspiration for the name of the car. Ernest Breech, a Thunderbird Country Club member, who was then chairman of Ford Motor Company was supposedly deeply involved in the creation of the Thunderbird. Breech asked the Club's permission to name the new model after the Club and the club consented to the use of the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thunderbirdcc.org |title=Home |publisher=Thunderbird Country Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ford Thunderbird was introduced in February 1953 as response to [[Chevrolet]]'s new sports car, the [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]], which was publicly unveiled in prototype form just a month before.&lt;ref name="HagertyTBird"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hagerty.com/articles-videos/articles/2016/05/23/thunderbird |title=Other Perspectives: what is a Thunderbird? |first=Jim |last=Koscs |work=Automotive Mileposts |date=May 23, 2016 |accessdate=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under rapid development, the Thunderbird went from idea to prototype in about a year, being unveiled to the public at the [[Detroit Auto Show]] on February 20, 1954. It was a two-seat design available with a detachable glass-fibre hard top and a folding fabric top.&lt;ref&gt;1955 Ford Thunderbird sales brochure (FD7520)&lt;/ref&gt; Production of the Thunderbird began on September 9 of that year, with the car beginning sales as a 1955 model on October 22, 1954. Though sharing some design characteristics with other Fords of the time, such as single, circular headlamps and tail lamps and modest tailfins, the Thunderbird was sleeker in shape, and featured a hood scoop and a {{convert|150|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} speedometer not available on other Fords. It utilized mechanical components from mass-market Ford models. The Thunderbird's {{convert|102.0|in|0}} wheelbase frame was a shortened version used in other Fords and the standard {{convert|292|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford Y-block engine|Y-block]] V8 came from Ford's [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] division.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.edmunds.com/ford/thunderbird/history.html "Ford Thunderbird History"], Edmunds Inc., 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though inspired by, and positioned directly against, the Corvette, Ford billed the Thunderbird as a ''[[personal luxury car|personal car]]'', putting a greater emphasis on the car's comfort and convenience features rather than its inherent sportiness.&lt;ref name="AM1955"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://automotivemileposts.com/tbird/tbird1955selections.shtml |title=1955 Ford Thunderbird - A personal car of distinction |work=Automotive Mileposts |date=|accessdate=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AM1958"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://automotivemileposts.com/tbird1958selections.shtml |title=1958 Ford Thunderbird: Personal Luxury 101 |work=Automotive Mileposts |date=|accessdate=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="American"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.american-automobiles.com/Ford/1955-1960-Ford-Thunderbird.html |title=The 1955-1960 Ford Thunderbird Automobiles |work=American Automobiles |publisher=Farber and Associates|date=2009|accessdate=4 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jedlinka"&gt;{{cite web |last=Jedlinka |first=Dan |url=http://www.danjedlicka.com/classic_cars/55_57_thunderbird.html |title=1955-57 two-seat Ford Thunderbird |date= |accessdate=4 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hagerty"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Hagerty |url=https://www.hagerty.com/apps/valuationtools/1955-ford-thunderbird |title=History of the 1955 Ford Thunderbird |date= |accessdate=4 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MotorTrend"&gt;{{cite web |work=Motor Trend |last=Wiron |first=Walt |url=https://www.motortrend.com/news/1955-ford-thunderbird/|title=1955 FORD THUNDERBIRD ROAD TEST|date= December 1954|accessdate=4 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Thunderbird sold exceptionally well in its first year. In fact, the Thunderbird outsold the Corvette by more than 23-to-one for 1955 with 16,155 Thunderbirds sold against 700 Corvettes.&lt;ref&gt;Gower, Colin. GREATEST AMERICAN CARS. January 1, 2004. Colin Gower Enterprises, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jedlinka"/&gt; With the Thunderbird considered a success, few changes were made to the car for the 1956 model year. The most notable change was moving the spare tire to a continental-style rear bumper in order to make more storage room in the trunk and a new 12 volt electrical system.&lt;ref name="AM1955"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://automotivemileposts.com/tbird/tbird1955selections.shtml |title=1955 Ford Thunderbird - A personal car of distinction |work=Automotive Mileposts |date=|accessdate=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of the weight at the rear caused steering issues. Among the few other changes were new paint colors, the addition of circular porthole windows as standard in the fiberglass roof to improve rearward visibility, and a {{convert|312|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford Y-block engine|Y-block]] V8 rated at {{convert|215|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} when mated to a 3-speed manual transmission or {{convert|225|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} when mated to a ''Ford-O-Matic'' 2-speed automatic transmission; this transmission featured a "[[low gear]]", which was accessible only via the gear selector. When in "Drive", it was a 2-speed automatic transmission (similar to Chevrolet's Powerglide). The Low gear could also be accessed with wide open throttle.

The Thunderbird was revised for 1957 with a reshaped front bumper, a larger grille and tailfins, and larger tail lamps.  The instrument panel was heavily re-styled with round gauges in a single pod, and the rear of the car was lengthened, allowing the spare tire to be positioned back in the trunk. &lt;ref name="Jedlinka"/&gt; The {{convert|312|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 became the Thunderbird's standard engine, and was now rated at {{convert|245|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Other, more powerful versions of the {{convert|312|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 were available including one with two four-barrel [[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] carburetors and another with a [[Paxton Automotive|Paxton]] [[supercharger]] rated at {{convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Though Ford was pleased to see sales of the Thunderbird rise to a record-breaking 21,380 units for 1957, company executives felt the car could do even better, leading to a substantial redesign of the car for 1958.

===Second generation (1958–1960)===
{{Main|Ford Thunderbird (second generation)}}
[[File:Ford Thunderbird 1960 Oldtimertreffen Ebern 2019 6200242.jpg|thumb|1960 Ford Thunderbird]]

Although the 1955–57 Thunderbird was a success, Ford executives—particularly [[Robert McNamara]]—were concerned that the car's position as a two-seater limited its sales potential. As a result, the car was redesigned as a four-seater for 1958.&lt;ref name="AM1958"/&gt;

The new Thunderbird began a sales momentum previously unseen with the car, selling 200,000 units in three years, four times the result of the two seat model. This success spawned a new [[market segment]], the [[personal luxury car]].&lt;ref name="AM1958"/&gt; It was the first individual model line (as opposed to an entire company) to earn ''[[Motor Trend]]'' [[Motor Trend Car of the Year|"Car of the Year"]] honors.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1946–1959'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Coy, 2008), p.856.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was offered in both hardtop and [[convertible]] body styles, although the latter was not introduced until June 1958, five months after the release of the hardtop.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=John |last=Gunnell |title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975 |edition=Revised 4th |date=2002 |publisher=Krause Publications |isbn=978-0873494618 |pages=400–401}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Thunderbird was considerably larger than the previous generation, with a longer {{convert|113.0|in|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase to accommodate the new back seat. The increased size also increased the car's weight to {{convert|1000|lb|0|abbr=on}}. Along with a new, more rigid [[unibody]] construction was new styling, including quad headlights, more prominent tailfins, a bolder chrome grille, and a larger, though non-functional, hood scoop. Powering the Thunderbird was a new, {{convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|352|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford FE engine|FE]] V8, available with a three-speed manual or automatic transmissions.&lt;ref name="AM1958"/&gt;

In the 1958 model year in which the car was introduced, sales were 37,892 units, outselling the previous model year's 16,000 units.&lt;ref name="AM1958"/&gt;

For 1959, the car received a new grille and a newly optional, {{convert|350|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|430|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford MEL engine|MEL]] V8 for 1959, sales climbed even higher to 67,456 units. 

For 1960, the Thunderbird was given another new grille and other minor styling changes along with a newly optional manually operated sunroof for hardtop models. Dual-unit round taillights from 1958 to 1959 were changed to triple-units after the fashion of the Chevrolet Impala. Sales increased again with 92,843 sold for 1960.

===Third generation (1961–1963)===
{{Main|Ford Thunderbird (third generation)}}
[[File:1963 Thunderbird (14382613191).jpg|thumb|1963 Ford Thunderbird hardtop]]

The Thunderbird was redesigned for 1961 with styling that gave the car a unique bullet-like body side appearance. A new engine, the {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Ford FE engine|FE]]'' V8, was the standard and only engine initially offered in the Thunderbird. It was rated at {{convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and was mated to a 3-speed automatic transmission. The new Thunderbird was well received with 73,051 sold for 1961.&lt;ref name="AM1961"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://automotivemileposts.com/tbird1961selections.shtml |title=1961 Ford Thunderbird |work=Automotive Mileposts |date=|accessdate=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The car was 1961's [[Indianapolis 500]] [[pace car]] and was featured prominently in [[President of the United States|US President]] [[John F. Kennedy]]'s inaugural parade, who appointed Ford executive [[Robert McNamara]] as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]].&lt;ref name="AM1961"/&gt; It also benefitted from [[Product placement#Movies and television|product placement]], notably on the popular television series [[77 Sunset Strip]].&lt;ref name="AM1961"/&gt;

A vinyl-roofed Landau option with simulated S-bars was added to the Thunderbird for 1962 as was a ''Sports Roadster'' package for convertible models. The Sports Roadster included 48-spoke Kelsey-Hayes designed wire wheels and a special fiberglass tonneau cover for the rear seats which gave the car the appearance of a two-seat roadster like the original Thunderbird. The Sports Roadster package was slow-selling due to the high price of the package and complexity of the tonneau cover, resulting in few Thunderbirds being equipped with it.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Newly optional for 1962 was an upgraded version of the {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 called the "M-Code" (a nickname used in reference to the letter M used as the engine code in the [[Vehicle Identification Number|VIN]] in cars so equipped). The M-Code version of the {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 was equipped with three two-barrel [[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] carburetors and was rated at {{convert|340|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. M-Code V8 Thunderbirds are exceptionally rare with only 200 being sold between 1962 and 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musclecarclub.com/musclecars/ford-thunderbird/ford-thunderbird-history.shtml "Ford Thunderbird—History: 1955–1963"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411040047/http://www.musclecarclub.com/musclecars/ford-thunderbird/ford-thunderbird-history.shtml |date=April 11, 2009 }}, MuscleCarClub.com, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For 1963 only, Y-code cars could come equipped with the same 390 cubic inch V8 also equipped by the factory with tri-power carburetors only if the buyer desired air conditioning.

Few other changes were made to the Thunderbird for 1963 as Ford prepared to introduce a new version for 1964. A horizontal styling line was added that ran from the point where bumper and fender meet back through the door and angled down. Small diagonal chrome bars were added in this area on the door. [[Alternator]]s rather than [[Electric generator|generators]] were a new feature on all 1963 Thunderbirds.

===Fourth generation (1964–1966)===
{{Main|Ford Thunderbird (fourth generation)}}
[[File:Ford Thunderbird (1964-66) (18147211664).jpg|thumb|1966 Ford Thunderbird convertible]]
[[File:66 Ford Thunderbird (9684280658).jpg|thumb|Rear view (hardtop)]]

For 1964 the Thunderbird was restyled in favor of a more squared-off appearance, which was mostly evident when viewing the car from the side or rear. Hinting at its roots in the previous generation of Thunderbird that it evolved from, the new model retained a similar grille design with quad headlights and a {{convert|113.2|in|0}} wheelbase. As before, the new Thunderbird continued to be offered in hardtop, convertible, and Landau versions. The {{convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford FE engine|FE]] V8 continued as the standard engine for the Thunderbird. It was paired with a 3-speed automatic transmission. For 1965, [[Automotive lighting#Sequential turn signals|sequential turn signals]] were added, flashing the individual segments of the broad, horizontal tail lights in sequences from inside to outside to indicate a turn. Also new for 1965 were standard front [[disc brake]]s, and doubled sided keys.

Even though it was the last year of the generation, 1966 saw a stylistic revision for the Thunderbird highlighted by a new egg-crate style grille with a large Thunderbird emblem at its center and a single-blade front bumper. The rear bumper was restyled to include new full-width taillamps. Engine choices were also revised for 1966. The standard {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 equipped with a single four-barrel carburetor was rated at {{convert|315|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Newly optional and taking the top position for performance was a {{convert|345|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|428|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford FE engine|FE]] V8. The 428 cost only $86 over the base engine, and was a popular option.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; This would be the last year for the convertible until the "retro" models of 2002-05.

===Fifth generation (1967–1971)===
{{Main|Ford Thunderbird (fifth generation)}}

; 1967–1969
[[File:68 Ford Thunderbird (5908835299).jpg|thumb|1968 Ford Thunderbird]]
[[File:1969 Blue Ford Thunderbird rearquarter.jpg|thumb|Ford Thunderbird sedan with the rear suicide door open]]

The Thunderbird's fifth generation brought the second major change in the car's design direction since its debut in 1955. From 1958 to 1966, the Thunderbird had remained fundamentally the same in concept as a sporty two-door coupe/convertible with two rows of seating. However, the introduction of the [[Ford Mustang]] in early 1964 had created a challenge to the Thunderbird's market positioning for it. Like the Thunderbird, the Mustang was also a two-door coupe/convertible with two rows of seating. Where the Mustang had an advantage was in the point that it was substantially cheaper. To prevent overlap between the two cars, Ford's response was to move the Thunderbird upmarket. The result, introduced for 1967, was a larger Thunderbird with luxury appointments more in line with a [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]].

The new Thunderbird abandoned [[unibody]] construction in favor of a body-on-frame construction with sophisticated rubber mountings between the body and frame to reduce noise and vibration. A pair of significant departures from the previous generation of the Thunderbird was the elimination of a convertible model and the addition of a four-door model, which used [[suicide door]]s for rear seat access. The available four-door design would remain a unique feature to this generation as it was not carried on after 1971. One of the most noticeable design elements of the fifth generation Thunderbird was the gaping, fighter jet-inspired grille opening that incorporated hidden headlights.

; 1970–1971
[[File:Ford Thunderbird 1971 (7509237148).jpg|thumb|1971 Ford Thunderbird]]

The 1970 Thunderbird continued with the same platform and many of the same parts and styling cues used in the 1967 to 1969 models, including the sequential turn signals incorporated into the full width taillamps in the rear of the vehicle. The most noticeable change was in the front [[Fascia (car)|fascia]] where there was now a large prominent projection resembling a bird or eagle's beak that was in line with long angular lines in the hood. [[Semon "Bunkie" Knudsen]], a former GM executive now President of Ford, is said to be responsible for this dramatic change. The T-bird was offered in coupe or sports-back models for these two years, the latter being a further distinction from the '67 to '69 models.

In 1971, [[Neiman Marcus]] offered "his and hers" Thunderbirds in its 1970 catalog, with telephones, tape recorders and other niceties. Sold only as a pair, they retailed for a total of $25,000 USD. The 1971 Thunderbird was mostly a carry-over from the 1970 model as Ford prepared to release a new, larger Thunderbird for 1972. It was also the last year to offer a four-door.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960–1972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), p. 825.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sixth generation (1972–1976)===
{{Main|Ford Thunderbird (sixth generation)}}
[[File:Ford Thunderbird (1971) , Dutch licence registration DH-14-92 pic1.JPG|thumb|1972 Ford Thunderbird]]

The sixth generation of the Thunderbird debuted in the fall of 1971 as a 1972 model. With a {{convert|120.4|in|0|adj=on}} wheelbase, an overall length of {{convert|214|in|0}} (growing to {{convert|225|in|0}} by 1974), and a curb weight of {{convert|4420|lb|0}} (over {{convert|4800|lb|0}} when equipped with a {{convert|460|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8), it was the largest Thunderbird ever produced by Ford, sharing the assembly line with the Lincoln Continental Mark IV. Matching the large size of the car were large engines, including a standard {{convert|429|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 and an optional {{convert|460|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 (standard after 1973). Though offering two of the largest displacement V8 engines ever installed in a production vehicle by Ford, the car's considerable weight combined with low power output caused by restrictive emissions technology resulted in modest performance. As might also be expected from installing a large displacement V8 in a heavy car, fuel efficiency was poor. The big Thunderbirds were popular with sales peaking at over 87,000 units in 1973 in spite of the [[1973 oil crisis]], but sales had slumped to less than 43,000 by 1975. Finishing off the generation, sales saw an uptick to almost 53,000 units for 1976. Acknowledging increasing fuel prices and more stringent federal emissions standards, a new, down-sized Thunderbird would appear for 1977.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

===Seventh generation (1977–1979)===
{{Main|Ford Thunderbird (seventh generation)}}
[[File:1977 Ford Thunderbird at Belmont, front left.jpg|thumb|1977–1979 Ford Thunderbird]]

For the 1977 model year, the Thunderbird was shifted to the smaller {{convert|114|in|0}} wheelbase chassis that underpinned the 1972–76 [[Ford Torino]] and its replacement, the [[Ford LTD II|LTD II]] which also debuted for 1977. Even with the nearly 8 inches shorter length from the 1975 Thunderbird (only 1.2 inches 217.7 vs 218.9 from the 2nd model year 1973 of 6th generation)&lt;ref&gt;[http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Ford_Thunderbird/1973_Ford_Thunderbird/1973-Ford-Thunderbird-Brochure/1973-Ford-Thunderbird-15 oldcarbrochures.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118162640/http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Ford_Thunderbird/1973_Ford_Thunderbird/1973-Ford-Thunderbird-Brochure/1973-Ford-Thunderbird-15 |date=November 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it still looked large to the eye. It was not until the next generation (model year 1980) that there was a dramatic downsizing, from 217.7 to 200.4 inches in length.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures.org"&gt;[http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Ford_Thunderbird/1979_Ford_Thunderbird/1979_Thunderbird_Brochure/1979-Ford-Thunderbird-12 oldcarbrochures.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816100450/http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Ford_Thunderbird/1979_Ford_Thunderbird/1979_Thunderbird_Brochure/1979-Ford-Thunderbird-12 |date=August 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Ford_Thunderbird/1980_Ford_Thunderbird/1980-Ford-Thunderbird-Brochure/1980-Ford-Thunderbird-18-19 oldcarbrochures.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816094619/http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Ford_Thunderbird/1980_Ford_Thunderbird/1980-Ford-Thunderbird-Brochure/1980-Ford-Thunderbird-18-19 |date=August 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1977 saw Ford's first effort at downsizing the Thunderbird, reflecting rising demand for more fuel efficient cars. In essence, this generation was a continuation of the 1974–1976 [[Ford Elite]], Ford's first attempt at competing in the market created by the [[Pontiac Grand Prix]] and [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]. Compared to the previous generation Thunderbird, the new car lost nearly 8 inches of overall length at 217.7 and {{convert|900|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} of weight, although height and width were relatively unchanged.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures.org"/&gt; A substantial component of the weight reduction was in the drivetrain, where a [[small-block]] [[V8 engine|V8]] replaced the heavier [[big-block]] V8s of previous years and proved to be an outstanding performer. The standard engine outside California was the {{convert|302|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford Windsor engine|Windsor]] V8, while the larger {{convert|351|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford 335 engine|351M]] and [[Ford 335 engine|{{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] and T-tops were available as options along with the 351W. In California, the 351 was the standard engine, and the 400 was optionally available. For the first time, a wide fixed "B" pillar was used, reflecting Detroit's abandonment of pillarless hardtops in the mid- and late-1970s. However, the door window glass remained frameless.

In 1978, Ford offered the "Diamond Jubilee Edition" Thunderbird to commemorate the company's 75th year as an auto manufacturer. This option package escalated the price of the car to almost US$12,000, virtually doubling the standard price. Naturally, it included every option available except for a moonroof and an engine block heater. A similar option package, called "Heritage", was available for 1979. Though this generation was the most successful in sales with over 955,000 examples produced in its three-year run,&lt;ref name="tast"/&gt; Ford sought to downsize the Thunderbird further out of fuel efficiency and emissions concerns, leading to a redesign for 1980. For the 1979 model year, the 400 cuin engine was no longer available.

===Eighth generation (1980–1982)===
{{Main|Ford Thunderbird (eighth generation)}}
[[File:1980 Ford Thunderbid (37142983790).jpg|thumb|1980 Ford Thunderbird]]

Reflecting a further industry-wide adoption of smaller vehicle designs in the interest of improved fuel efficiency and emissions compliance, the Thunderbird was redesigned for 1980 on the compact [[Ford Fox platform]], which first appeared only two years prior as the basis for the [[Ford Fairmont]]. Compared to the previous Torino-based Thunderbird and its large {{convert|114|in|0}} wheelbase and {{convert|217.7|in|0}} overall length, the new Thunderbird lost {{convert|5.6|in|0}} of wheelbase and {{convert|17.3|in|0}} in overall length. The squarish styling seen in the previous generation of the Thunderbird was favored for the new model, but now utilizing a smaller car platform. Frameless door glass was no longer used; a chrome metal frame was used instead, making the car look more like a two-door sedan. Combined with the poor performing {{convert|255|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[Ford Windsor engine#255|''Windsor'' V8]] as a base engine, and a C5 3 speed transmission with 2.26 rear gears, this Thunderbird generation was not well received by the public. The available 5.0 L (302 cid) ''Windsor'' V8 with the AOD automatic overdrive transmission, coupled with a 3.45 rear end gear, was a welcome alternative to the 255, but with only {{convert|131|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, performance was moderately enhanced. Significantly, though failing to generate any new interest for the Thunderbird, a six-cylinder engine was made available for the first time in the Thunderbird's history in 1981, the {{convert|200|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Ford Straight-6 engine#200|Thriftpower Six]]''. For 1982 this was followed up with the replacement of the straight-six with a more modern V6, the [[Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)|3.8&amp;nbsp;L Essex]], which was also now the Thunderbird's standard engine. It came equipped with a Motorcraft 2150 2V carburator. Hurting the Thunderbird's sales performance further, the 302 V8 did not return for 1982, leaving the 255 Cubic inch V8 as the only alternative engine. At 288,638 examples produced between 1980 and 1982, the eighth generation of the Thunderbird was barely more successful than the final model year of the previous Thunderbird generation.&lt;ref name="tast"/&gt;

{{Main|Ford Thunderbird (ninth generation)}}
[[File:1984 Ford Thunderbird; Annandale, MN (42362510175).jpg|thumb|right|1984 Ford Thunderbird]]

In response to the lackluster reception of the eighth-generation 1980–1982 Thunderbird, Ford executed a significant redesign for 1983. Though based on the [[Ford Fox platform|Fox body]] like the previous Thunderbird, the new Thunderbird featured a radically sleeker, more aerodynamic body and a slightly shorter wheelbase of {{convert|104.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. To power the new Thunderbird, the [[Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)|3.8&amp;nbsp;L Essex]] V6 and the 5.0 L (302 cid) V8 were carried over from the previous generation with the V8 engine gaining CFI electronic fuel injection in 1983, and the V6 in 1984 for US models, 1985 for Canadian models (which was in turn replaced by multipoint fuel injection on the V8 in 1986 and the V6 in 1988). All-new, and a Thunderbird first, was a [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[Ford Pinto engine#2.3 OHC|2.3&amp;nbsp;L OHC]] [[Straight-4|4-cylinder]] engine featured in the 1983 Thunderbird Turbo Coupe. The engine initially was rated at {{convert|142|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, but by 1985 power was increased to {{convert|155|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Another first was the availability of a 5-speed manual transmission with the turbocharged four. In 1983, the higher trim model was the Heritage; this was renamed the Elan in 1984. There was also a Fila-branded model. In 1985, a special 30th Anniversary edition was available, with special Medium Regatta Blue Metallic paint, special graphics, and trim.

For 1987 the Thunderbird received a significant refresh complete with new sheetmetal and a revised front [[Fascia (car)|fascia]] with aerodynamic composite headlamps. Mechanically the car was mostly unchanged. V6s models carried over port fuel injection from 1986 while the Turbo Coupe's turbocharged 4-cylinder engine gained an intercooler, increasing output to {{convert|190|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and 240&amp;nbsp;lbs of torque.

===Tenth generation (1989–1997)===
{{Main|Ford Thunderbird (tenth generation)}}
[[File:Ford Thunderbird 1990 Il.JPG|thumb|1990 Ford Thunderbird]]

On December 26, 1988, a completely redesigned Thunderbird was introduced as a 1989 model along with the similar [[Mercury Cougar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coolcats.net/mn12/1989.html "1989 Cougar"], Cool Cats. November 17, 2007. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517071848/http://www.coolcats.net/mn12/1989.html |date=May 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Thunderbird was developed on Ford's [[Ford MN12 platform|MN12]] (Mid-Size North American Project 12) platform, which had been in development since 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{google books |d0LnCwAAQBAJ|keywords=MN12||plainurl=yes}} |title=The Perpetual Enterprise Machine |first1=H. Kent |last1=Bowen |first2=Charles A. |last2=Holloway |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Featuring a nine-inch (229&amp;nbsp;mm) longer wheelbase than the previous generation Thunderbird and a four-wheel [[independent suspension]], with [[Short long arms suspension|short-and-long arms]] (SLA) and a spring strut assembly in the front and multiple links in the rear, the car offered excellent handling and ride quality. Significantly, the 1989 Thunderbird was the first in the car's history not to offer a V8 engine, instead offering two different versions of Ford's [[Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)|3.8&amp;nbsp;L Essex]] [[OHV]] V6. Standard versions of the Thunderbird received a [[Naturally-aspirated engine|naturally aspirated]] version of the V6 producing {{convert|140|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} while the [http://www.sccoia.org high performance Super Coupe] (SC) model received a [[supercharged]] and [[intercooled]] version of the engine rated at {{convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The naturally aspirated V6 came with an [[Ford AOD transmission|AOD]] 4-speed [[automatic transmission]] as standard equipment. The AOD was optional on the Super Coupe and a [[Mazda M5OD transmission|M5R2]] 5-speed, Mazda-derived [[manual transmission]] was standard in the SC model.

The Super Coupe's engine had the same {{cvt|3.8|L|cuin|0|adj=on}} displacement as the naturally aspirated V6, but most all internal components were upgraded to handle the increased torque and temperature generated due to the addition of a supercharger. Among the modifications, the engine block and heads were modified to enhance coolant flow, the crankshaft was upgraded to a fully counter weighted forged unit, the billet roller cam had a unique profile, and the pistons were made of a stronger hypereutectic alloy. The supercharger utilized was an Eaton M90 [[Roots-type supercharger|Roots-style]], designed for mounting atop the intake manifold. Boost pressure during hard acceleration under ideal conditions is approximately {{cvt|12|psi|bar|1}}.&lt;ref name=sccoa&gt;[http://www.sccoa.com Super Coupe Club of America] Thunderbird Super Coupe owners and members community&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sccoia-specs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sccoia.org/ford-super-coupe-specs/ |title=Ford Super Coupe Specs |website=Super Coupe Club of Iowa |location=US |year=2016 |access-date=October 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 for the 1991 model year, a V8 was offered in the Thunderbird once again, slotting in between the standard and supercharged versions of the 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6. The V8 5.0 L engine produced at the Cleveland Engine Plant #1, now with more power and torque relative to the last time the engine was used in the Thunderbird in 1988. For 1992, there was a one-year only Thunderbird Sport model featuring the 5.0 liter V8 engine, the Super Coupe front fascia with fog lamps and colored coordinated lower bodyside stripes. In 1993, the 1994 model year Thunderbird received a substantial refresh, including stylistic changes inside and out and mechanical enhancements. In particular, the Windsor 5.0 was replaced with Ford's new [[Ford Modular engine#2-valve|''Modular'']] 4.6&amp;nbsp;L [[OHC]] V8 while the Super Coupe's supercharged V6 was enhanced to produce more power and torque. The performance increase is largely attributed to the tighter gap tolerance of the supercharger rotors allowed by the use of resin coating and a new high flow supercharger case. Simultaneously, the AOD automatic transmission was replaced by the also-new electronically controlled [[Ford AOD transmission#4R70W|4R70W]] 4-speed automatic in all instances where the AOD was previously used in the Thunderbird.

In 1995, Ford did little to commemorate the Thunderbird's 40th anniversary; instead, choosing to reduce its investment in the tenth generation model. While the Thunderbird received minor changes for 1996, the Super Coupe model was discontinued the previous year and the options list for the remaining models was condensed. In the mid-1990s, Ford decided to discontinue the tenth generation Thunderbird with the last example of the car rolling off the assembly line in [[Lorain, Ohio]] on September 4, 1997.

===Eleventh generation (2002–2005)===
{{Main|Ford Thunderbird (eleventh generation)}}
[[File:2005 Ford Thunderbird Hardtop front 4.28.18.jpg|thumb|2002–2005 Ford Thunderbird]]

After a five year hiatus, Ford introduced a new Thunderbird for 2002. Returning to the original formula for the Thunderbird, the latest version had a two-seat coupe or convertible layout like the first-generation Thunderbird and [[Retro-futurism|retrofuturistic]] styling to match. The eleventh generation Thunderbird was built at Ford's [[Wixom Assembly Plant]] and was based on the company's [[Ford DEW platform|DEW98]] platform, which was shared with the [[Lincoln LS]], [[Jaguar S-Type]] and [[Jaguar XF (X250)|XF]]. Though the Thunderbird's exterior styling was unique relative to its platform mates, the instrument panel, steering wheel and other trim pieces were borrowed from Lincoln LS. The sole engine of the Thunderbird was a Jaguar-designed [[Jaguar AJ-V8 engine|AJ-30]] 3.9&amp;nbsp;L [[DOHC]] V8, a short-stroke (85mm) variant of the Jaguar AJ-26 4.0&amp;nbsp;L V8, rated at {{convert|252|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|267|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The engine was mated to Ford's [[Ford Bordeaux Automatic Transmissions#5R44E/5R55E/N/S/W|5R55N]] 5-speed automatic transmission. The AJ-30 V8 was replaced by the AJ-35 in 2003 and later Thunderbirds, bringing with it [[variable valve timing]] (VVT) and [[electronic throttle control]] (ETC) as well as {{convert|280|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|286|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. Complementing the extra power and torque provided by the AJ-35 V8, a manual shift feature for the 5-speed automatic called ''SelectShift'' was available as an option in 2003 and later Thunderbirds. With sales dropping off significantly after its first model year, Ford decided to make the 2005 model year the Thunderbird's last with no scheduled successor. The last Thunderbird rolled off the assembly line on July 1, 2005.

==NASCAR==
[[File:Bill Elliott 200 mph.jpg|thumb|right|A 1987 [[NASCAR]] version of the Thunderbird driven by [[Bill Elliott]]]]

Thurderbirds first made serious inroads into NASCAR racing in the 1959 season. The combination of the second generation body style and the newly available 430 CID V8 took drivers Curtis Turner, Johnny Beauchamp, "Tiger" Tom Pistone and Cotton Owens to victory lane. In the 1960 season, most teams returned to using the conventional full sized Ford body style, and the T-Bird made only sporadic appearances through the rest of the 1960s, with no additional wins.
Beginning in 1977, Thunderbird bodied racecars replaced the Torino as Ford's primary body style in [[NASCAR]], starting a trend of luxury coupe type bodystyles (eventually the 1981 [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]] would also be seen racing) being used as a sheet metal source on the race track. [[Bobby Allison]] won 13 races with this car driving for owner [[Bud Moore (NASCAR owner)|Bud Moore]] in the 1977 through 1980 seasons even though the cars looked boxy and unaerodynamic. During the period 1981–1997, the downsized and aerodynamically clean Thunderbirds were successful in NASCAR stock car racing before they were replaced by [[Ford Taurus|Taurus]]-based bodies in 1998. The 1983–1988 bodied cars routinely broke the 200&amp;nbsp;mph barrier, in one case during a qualifying session set the record of the fastest lap in stock car history at 44.998 seconds with an average speed of {{convert|212.809|mi/h|km/h|3|abbr=on}} at [[Talladega Superspeedway]], a record that still stands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nascar.com/races/tracks/tal/ Talladega Superspeedway] at NASCAR.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talladegasuperspeedway.com/This-Is-Talladega/History.aspx History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416000000/http://www.talladegasuperspeedway.com/This-Is-Talladega/History.aspx |date=April 16, 2010 }} at Talladega Superspeedway&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Elliott]] and [[Davey Allison]], in particular, were successful with the cars, with Elliott winning the 1988 championship. [[Alan Kulwicki]] also won the championship in 1992 in a car nicknamed "Underbird", due to his underdog status as a driver.

The successor to the [[Ford LTD Crown Victoria]], the Crown Victoria served as the flagship Ford sedan above the [[Ford Taurus]], and was the Ford-branded version of the [[Mercury Grand Marquis]]. Ford marketed the [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor|Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]] [[police car]] to law-enforcement agencies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sweet|first=Sam|date=3 September 2013|title=The Crown Vic Jumps Its Last Curb|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-crown-vic-jumps-its-last-curb|journal=The New Yorker|issn=0028-792X|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a long-wheelbase version was introduced in 2002 for [[taxicab|taxi cab]] fleet.   

The Crown Victoria was produced on the rear-wheel-drive [[Ford Panther platform]] it shared with the Grand Marquis and [[Lincoln Town Car]].  From 1997 to 2011, the three sedans were the only full-frame rear-wheel-drive passenger cars produced in North America and the only non-luxury cars offered with a standard [[V8]] engine.    

The Crown Victoria, Police Interceptor, and Grand Marquis were produced at the [[St. Thomas Assembly]] in [[Southwold, Ontario|Southwold, Ontario, Canada,]] which closed in 2011. A 2012 Crown Victoria was the final vehicle produced at the facility as part of a small group of vehicles intended for export to the Middle East. Over 1.5 million Crown Victorias (including Police Interceptors) were manufactured by St. Thomas Assembly from 1991 to 2011. Ford did not replace the Crown Victoria, leaving the front-wheel-drive/all-wheel-drive [[Ford Taurus (sixth generation)|Ford Taurus]] as the closest option. 

==Origin of name ==
Ford used the Crown Victoria nameplate on two vehicles before the 1992 model year. From 1955 to 1956, it was used to denote the flagship model of the Ford Fairlane. From 1983 to 1991, the nameplate was used to distinguish all full-size LTD sedans in North America.   

===1955&amp;ndash;1956===
{{See also|1955 Ford|Ford Fairlane Crown Victoria|Ford Fairlane Crown Victoria Skyliner}}
1955 marked the first use of the Crown Victoria nameplate by Ford.  To introduce its premium [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Ford Fairlane]] model range, the Fairlane Crown Victoria was introduced as its flagship model, replacing the hardtop roofline of the Victoria hardtop coupe (an additional nameplate revived for 1955) with a [[Pillar (car)|B-pillared roofline]] distinguished by a wide stainless-steel band "crowning" the roof.  While the large B-pillar pre-empted a hardtop roofline, the design allowed for a sleeker appearance.   

The [[Ford Fairlane Crown Victoria Skyliner|Crown Victoria Skyliner]] was a variant of the Crown Victoria with a fixed [[acrylic glass]] sunroof forward of the stainless-steel B-pillar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1955_Ford/1955_Ford_Brochure/1955%20Ford-04.html|title=1955 Ford brochure|date=|publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com|accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

For the 1956 model year, along with the rest of the Ford model line, the Fairlane Crown Victoria was offered with the [[Lifeguard (automobile safety)|Lifeguard option package]] as an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1956%20Ford/1956_Ford_Fairlane_Victoria_Brochure/1956%20Ford%20Fairlane%20Victoria-04.html|title=1956 Ford Fairlane Victoria brochure|date=|publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com|accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Ford model line was redesigned for 1957, the Ford Fairlane Crown Victoria was withdrawn with no replacement.  The Skyliner name returned to the Fairlane range, denoting the [[Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner]] retractable hardtop convertible.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===1980&amp;ndash;1991===
{{See also|Ford LTD Crown Victoria}}
For the 1980 model year, the Crown Victoria nameplate was revived after a 23-year hiatus,&lt;ref name="UptoSpeed"&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H_QOcRAXkw|title=Ford Crown Victoria - Everything You Need to Know - Up to Speed|date=June 7, 2018|people=|language=|publisher=Donut Media|trans-title=|location=|time=|access-date=July 12, 2018|format=[[YouTube]]|ref=|id=|isbn=|oclc=|quote=|medium=}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming part of the [[Ford LTD (Americas)|Ford LTD]] model range.  A year after the downsizing of the full-size Ford model lines, the [[Ford LTD Crown Victoria|LTD Crown Victoria]] replaced the LTD Landau (1975-1979).  To distinguish itself from its Mercury (Grand) Marquis counterpart, the LTD Crown Victoria adopted a styling element of its 1950s predecessor.  The vinyl roof was fitted with a stainless-steel band to trim the B-pillars (with the standard vinyl roof not extending past the B-pillar).  Sold as a two-door and four-door sedan, the LTD Crown Victoria shared its interior trim with the [[Ford Country Squire|LTD Country Squire]] station wagon.&lt;ref name="UptoSpeed" /&gt;      

For 1983, as part of an extensive revision of the midsize and full-size model lines of all three Ford divisions, the LTD Crown Victoria became a stand-alone model line (alongside its Mercury Grand Marquis counterpart); the Ford LTD nameplate was shifted to the mid-size segment, replacing the Ford Granada.     

The 1991 discontinuation of the LTD Crown Victoria (and LTD Country Squire station wagon) marked the final usage of the Ford LTD nameplate in North America.  Ford of Australia would continue usage of the nameplate (as a higher-trim version of the [[Ford Fairlane (Australia)|Ford Fairlane]]) through the 2007 model year.    &lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

Ford reduced the [[coefficient of drag]] of the exterior from 0.42 to 0.34&lt;ref name="UptoSpeed" /&gt; (nearly matching the 0.32 of the Ford Taurus) to enhance aerodynamics and fuel efficiency, giving the first generation Crown Victoria its sleek, wedge-shaped design that would come to be known as the "Aero" look.

Due to a market shift in family-oriented vehicles, the Crown Victoria was offered exclusively as a four-door sedan, with the wood-trimmed LTD Country Squire station wagon discontinued. While the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable continued in production with optional three-row seating, the Country Squire was essentially replaced by the [[Ford Aerostar]], [[Ford E-Series|Ford Econoline/Club Wagon]], and [[Ford Explorer]].

Ford benefitted from a unique loophole in [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy|CAFE]] standards when the 1992 Crown Victoria and its Grand Marquis twin were launched. To avoid paying gas guzzler taxes, Ford modified its supplier network so that the two vehicles could be classified as imports from Canada, effectively removing the full-size sedans from the Ford domestic CAFE fleet (alongside the Ford Mustang V8) and placing them in its imported fleet (alongside the [[Ford Festiva]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=So what's an import car? Here's the fuelish answer|last=Standish|first=Frederick|date=12 May 1991|work=The Bulletin|page=C-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chassis ===
In lieu of developing an all-new platform architecture from the ground up, the Crown Victoria retained the [[Ford Panther platform|Panther platform]] of its LTD Crown Victoria predecessor. Although launched in 1978, the Panther chassis underwent extensive upgrades to improve its road manners and handling; major updates were made to the steering and suspension tuning.&lt;ref name="PM-April 1991"&gt;{{cite journal | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0eQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=1992%20mercury%20grand%20marquis%20specs&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q=1992%20mercury%20grand%20marquis%20specs&amp;f=false |title=Ford Revitalizes Big Car Lineup |page=127 |first=Rick |last=Titus |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=April 1991 |volume=168 |issue=4 |accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To improve braking performance, the Crown Victoria gained four-wheel disc brakes, which were only seen on the [[Lincoln Continental Mark VII|Lincoln Mark VII]], [[Ford Taurus SHO]] and [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] GT (1991-1996). Available as options, anti-lock brakes and [[Traction control system|low-speed traction control]] became popular features.&lt;ref name="pmm92" /&gt; For 1997, several updates were made to improve handling response and steering control&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/overview.aspx?year=1997&amp;make=Ford&amp;model=Crown%20Victoria |title=1997 Ford Crown Victoria Overview |publisher=MSN |accessdate=2008-09-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728020336/http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/overview.aspx?year=1997&amp;make=Ford&amp;model=Crown%20Victoria |archivedate=July 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Showcased in the redesign was the new [[Ford Modular engine#4.6|Modular]] V8 engine. First introduced in the 1991 Lincoln Town Car, the 4.6&amp;nbsp;L SOHC V8 replaced the overhead-valve 5.0&amp;nbsp;L (302 CID) small block V8 and was the first of a family of overhead-cam engines that would eventually appear in several Ford and Lincoln-Mercury cars and trucks. Lighter than its predecessor,&lt;ref name="psj91"&gt;{{citation|work=Popular Science|issue=June 1991|pages=99–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 4.6 produced nearly identical torque output while producing 40 additional horsepower in its standard single-exhaust configuration. As with its predecessor and the Lincoln Town Car, the 4.6 was paired with a 4-speed overdrive automatic transmission. In 1993, the Ford AOD transmission was replaced by the electronically-controlled AOD-E version. For 1995, the AOD-E was replaced by the 4R70W, a heavier-duty version introduced in the [[Lincoln Mark VIII]].

Ford based much of the Crown Victoria's appearance on the [[Ford Taurus (first generation)|first-generation Ford Taurus]], a look pioneered by Ford VP of Design Jack Telnack. Though the Taurus became wildly popular in its market segment, Telnack's "Aero" look proved to be either a love or hate proposition with potential buyers of the Crown Victoria. Along with its distinctive no-grille front fascia, the Crown Victoria would share a [[Greenhouse (automotive)|similar roofline]] with the Taurus, similar body and bumper moldings, similar door handles, aircraft-style doors, and similarly shaped headlamp and taillamp clusters. To reduce aesthetic commonality with the Mercury Grand Marquis, only the front doors, windshield, and alloy wheels were shared between them. 

For the interior, the two vehicles also were given different seats, door trim, and dashboards; the Crown Victoria featured an instrument panel with round dials that included voltage and oil pressure gauges, while the Grand Marquis featured a horizontal speedometer without the full instrumentation. An electronic instrument panel was introduced as an option. Though better received than the 1990 redesign of the Chevrolet Caprice, the 1992 Crown Victoria was met with disapproval from some critics and buyers, leading Ford to revise the exterior. For the model year 1993, a grille was added to the front fascia (though it retained its "bottom-breather" cooling system configuration); for 1994, a red reflector strip was added to the trunk lid to visually connect the taillamps. For the 1995 model year, a mid-cycle redesign saw more extensive changes to the Crown Victoria; a 6-slot grille replaced the egg-crate design, and wider taillamps were added to the rear with the license plate positioned between them on the trunk lid. Inside, the 1995 Crown Victoria had redesigned seats and a new dashboard which was now shared with the Grand Marquis. The new design featured larger controls and switches, with the radio enlarged and positioned higher. The gauge cluster retained its previous layout. In late 1995, the first-generation "brick" airbag steering wheel was replaced by one with a smaller hub that returned the horn button to the center of the wheel.

[[File:1996 ford crown victoria.jpeg|thumb|Facelift Ford Crown Victoria]]
As with its LTD Crown Victoria predecessor, the Crown Victoria was a six-passenger automobile; the front seat was a 50/50 split [[bench seat]]. The Crown Victoria was sold in two trim levels: base and LX, with the latter forming the majority of non-fleet sales. In addition, the [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor|Crown Victoria P71]] replaced the fleet-market "S" designation in 1993; the P71 was marketed exclusively for law-enforcement sales.

As with the Mercury Grand Marquis, a driver airbag was standard equipment and a passenger airbag was added as an option during later 1991 production. It later became standard in 1993 for the 1994 model year.&lt;ref name="pmm92"&gt;{{citation|work=Popular Mechanics|issue=March 1992|pages=21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Daily Courier|date=27 March 1994|page=10C|title=Crown Victoria earns top ranking}}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular feature were the anti-lock brakes and [[Traction control system|low-speed traction control]].&lt;ref name="pmm92" /&gt; For 1996, a single-key entry system became standard, along with a hidden audio antenna, rear window defroster and tinted glass. Automatic climate control and a [[JBL (company)|JBL]] audio system became available on the LX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/overview.aspx?year=1996&amp;make=Ford&amp;model=Crown%20Victoria |title=1996 Ford Crown Victoria Overview |publisher=MSN |accessdate=2008-09-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515150410/http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/overview.aspx?year=1996&amp;make=Ford&amp;model=Crown%20Victoria |archivedate=May 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Touring Sedan ====
For 1992, Ford introduced the Crown Victoria Touring Sedan as a performance-oriented flagship trim. The Touring Sedan featured a number of suspension and handling improvements over the Crown Victoria LX, featuring the heavier-duty suspension components of the police-package version, and also including wider tires, rear air suspension, removal of the speed limiter, and a 210 hp dual-exhaust variant of the 4.6&amp;nbsp;L V8. Optional features included speed-sensitive steering and larger-diameter sway bars. Distinguished by its standard two-tone exterior paint scheme (with painted alloy wheels), the Touring Sedan featured a unique leather interior with every feature available on a Crown Victoria at the time. For a lower price, Ford offered the performance upgrades of the Touring Sedan on the LX as the Handling and Performance Package alongside a separate towing package. The Touring Sedan would be a one-year-only model, as it was discontinued after 1992. However, the Handling and Performance Package remained an option in various forms until 2007.

}}The second generation Crown Victoria commenced sales on December 26, 1997. Although the 1992-1997 Ford Crown Victoria saw better critical and marketplace acceptance than the controversial styling of the 1991 Chevrolet Caprice, its sales struggled to match those of its Mercury Grand Marquis counterpart.  In an effort to gain acceptance among buyers (and increase parts commonality), for the 1998 model year, the Crown Victoria adopted much of the exterior design of the Mercury Grand Marquis.

Following its 1998 introduction, the second-generation Crown Victoria underwent an extensive revision for the 2003 model year.  Introduced in April 2002, while the exterior saw no change, nearly the entire chassis was redesigned, with major updates to the suspension and steering.

=== Chassis ===
The second-generation Ford Crown Victoria continued the use of the Ford Panther platform, shared with the Mercury Grand Marquis and Lincoln Town Car.&lt;ref name="UptoSpeed" /&gt;

Under the 1998 redesign, several changes were made to the rear suspension to improve general road manners (at the expense of reduced towing capacity).  The original three-link coil-spring configuration was replaced with a four-link configuration with a [[Watt's linkage]].  Continuing the use of four-wheel disc brakes, for 1998, enlarged brake rotors necessitated a shift to 16-inch wheels for all Crown Victoria models.  For 1999, ABS became standard on all Crown Victorias (except Police Interceptors).

For the 2003 model year, the suspension and steering underwent an extensive update, paired with the chassis redesign.  For the first time, the Crown Victoria adopted [[Rack and pinion|rack and pinion steering]] (replacing the long-running [[recirculating ball]] system), with the adoption of aluminum front control arms.&lt;ref name="aol05"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autos.aol.com/cars-Ford-Crown+Victoria-2005/expert-review|title=2005 Ford Crown Victoria Overview|publisher=AOL|accessdate=2008-09-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210045054/http://autos.aol.com/cars-Ford-Crown+Victoria-2005/expert-review|archive-date=February 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the rear, twin-tube shocks (in use since the mid-1960s), were replaced by monotube shocks; to improve maintenance and on-road handling, the shocks were moved outside of the frame rails.  As part of the suspension upgrades, the Panther-chassis vehicles were fitted with wheels with a high positive offset (flat-face).   For 2006, the steel wheels of the Crown Victoria shifted to a 17-inch diameter.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://moldyrabbit.com/liquid/changes.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103054448/http://moldyrabbit.com/liquid/changes.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-01-03|title=Year-to-Year Changes|date=2010-01-03|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second-generation is powered by a single engine, the 4.6L SOHC 16-valve Modular V8.  Carried over from 1992–1997, output for 1998 was raised to 200&amp;nbsp;hp (dual-exhaust examples produced 215&amp;nbsp;hp).  For 1999, the distributorless ignition system (2 coil packs and wires) was replaced by coil-on-plug ignition (a feature first used on the DOHC 4.6L V8, and shared with other iterations of the Modular V8 for 1999).  For 2001, the 4.6L V8 received new cylinder heads (from the Mustang GT), raising output to 220&amp;nbsp;hp (235&amp;nbsp;hp in dual-exhaust configuration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/overview.aspx?year=2001&amp;make=Ford&amp;model=Crown%20Victoria|title=2001 Ford Crown Victoria Overview|publisher=MSN|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513001334/http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/overview.aspx?year=2001&amp;make=Ford&amp;model=Crown%20Victoria|archivedate=May 13, 2009|url-status=dead|accessdate=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For 2003, the engine output was increased further, to 224&amp;nbsp;hp and 239&amp;nbsp;hp (depending on exhaust configuration); the increase resulted from a knock sensor fitted to the engine.  For 2004, engine output was increased for the last time, as the Police Interceptor raised output to 250&amp;nbsp;hp (as its engine received the air intake of the Mercury Marauder).  For 2005, the engine underwent a minor revision, as it adopted electronic "drive-by-wire" throttle control.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

From 1998 to 2004, the 4R70W 4-speed automatic was paired with the 4.6L V8, replaced by the 4R70E after 2005 (the latter designed to accommodate electronic throttle controls); the 4R75W was exclusive to the 2004 Police Interceptor.

=== Body ===
Following the poor critical and sales acceptance of the 1991-1996 Chevrolet Caprice and Buick Roadmaster, for the second-generation Crown Victoria, Ford sought a more conservative exterior design, choosing design commonality with the Mercury Grand Marquis over the Ford Taurus.  In doing so, the Crown Victoria adopted the formal notchback roofline of its Mercury counterpart, sharing all four doors (previously, the front doors were shared).  On the front fascia, both the grille and headlamps were enlarged.  The rear fascia underwent a redesign, as large taillamp units were mounted at the corners of the body, replacing the previous full-width design. Ford called the styling "...more contemporary, yet distinctly classic." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=the nineteen hundred and ninety-eight Crown Victoria |date=1998 |publisher=Ford Motor Company |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/June%202019/1998%20Ford%20Crown%20Victoria/slides/1998%20Ford%20Crown%20Victoria-04.html |accessdate=5 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to its Mercury counterpart, the Crown Victoria was nearly devoid of chrome trim, largely restricted to the grille, window trim, and trunk lid.

In contrast to the exterior, relatively few changes were made to the interior, updated for the 1995 model year.  Offered with nearly the same features as the Grand Marquis, the Crown Victoria was largely differentiated by its (optional) wood trim and seating materials.

To comply with US federal regulations, for 2000, the Crown Victoria adopted an emergency trunk release system, alongside other safety features, including [[LATCH]] anchors and "Belt Minder" (seat belt reminder chime that sounds for an unbelted front seat occupant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/overview.aspx?year=2000&amp;make=Ford&amp;model=Crown%20Victoria|title=2000 Ford Crown Victoria Overview|publisher=MSN|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426181740/http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/overview.aspx?year=2000&amp;make=Ford&amp;model=Crown%20Victoria|archivedate=April 26, 2006|url-status=dead|accessdate=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For 2001, the dual airbags were redesigned, replaced by dual-stage airbags; power-adjustable pedals became an option.  For 2003, seat-mounted side airbags became an option.  For the 2007 model year, the optional side airbags underwent revision to better protect passengers in side-impact collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=1051|title=Ford Crown Victoria 2007-08 models mfg. after July 2006|date=2008-11-25|publisher=Iihs.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107025402/http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=1051|archivedate=November 7, 2010|url-status=dead|accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2002 model year, heated exterior side mirrors became available, along with standard floor mats, improved cloth upholstery; for LX-trim vehicles, a trunk storage organizer became an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/overview.aspx?year=2002&amp;make=Ford&amp;model=Crown%20Victoria|title=2002 Ford Crown Victoria Overview|publisher=MSN|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513002833/http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/overview.aspx?year=2002&amp;make=Ford&amp;model=Crown%20Victoria|archivedate=May 13, 2009|url-status=dead|accessdate=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the extensive mechanical changes for the 2003 model year (and redesigns of the Mercury Grand Marquis and Lincoln Town Car), the Ford Crown Victoria saw no exterior changes since the 1998 model year (grille changes were limited to Police Interceptors).   For the interior, a minor update saw redesigned front and rear seats (distinguished by taller head restraints) and redesigned door panels.

During the 2003 model year (after December 2002 production), Ford began to de-content the Crown Victoria, removing the amber-color turn signal lenses, body-color sideview mirrors, front-seat map pouches, locking fuel cap, automatic-release parking brake, and engine compartment light.  For 2004, in one of the first American cars to do so, the Crown Victoria adopted laminated door glass as an option; along with providing additional security, the feature filtered [[ultraviolet rays|UV light]]  and heat from the interior.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autos.aol.com/cars-Ford-Crown+Victoria-2004/expert-review|title=2004 Ford Crown Victoria Overview|publisher=AOL|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114190508/http://autos.aol.com/cars-Ford-Crown+Victoria-2004/expert-review|archivedate=January 14, 2009|url-status=dead|accessdate=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In another revision, the overhead console was redesigned.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/overview.aspx?year=2004&amp;make=Ford&amp;model=Crown%20Victoria|title=2004 Ford Crown Victoria Overview|publisher=MSN|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513001334/http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/overview.aspx?year=2004&amp;make=Ford&amp;model=Crown%20Victoria|archivedate=May 13, 2009|url-status=dead|accessdate=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2005, the Crown Victoria received a new non-locking steering column, which gave the model its first new steering wheel since 1998.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For the first time, the Crown Victoria offered a moonroof as an option; in line with other Ford vehicles, a 6-disc CD changer became an option.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/overview.aspx?year=2005&amp;make=Ford&amp;model=Crown%20Victoria|title=2005 Ford Crown Victoria Overview|publisher=MSN|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513003509/http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/overview.aspx?year=2005&amp;make=Ford&amp;model=Crown%20Victoria|archivedate=May 13, 2009|url-status=dead|accessdate=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2006, the dashboard of the Crown Victoria saw a revision, as Ford introduced a new instrument panel (for the first time since 1992).  Along with becoming the final Ford Motor Company vehicle fitted with a tachometer in North America, the 2006 Crown Victoria became the final Ford vehicle to adopt a digital odometer (as the digital instrument panel option was discontinued); Police Interceptors were given an engine hour meter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Trim ===
Carried over from the 1992-1997 Crown Victoria, the second-generation Crown Victoria was marketed in two trim levels: Ford Crown Victoria and Ford Crown Victoria LX (internally designated P73 and P74, respectively).&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;  The Crown Victoria P71 was carried over, with Ford creating the [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor|Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]] as a stand-alone model for 1999.

For 2000, Ford offered a "Special Edition" option package for the LX; along with namesake exterior badging, the interior was fitted with two-tone leather seating.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://moldyrabbit.com/liquid/p7x.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119093024/http://moldyrabbit.com/liquid/p7x.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-11-19|title=Crown Victoria - P7x Breakdown|date=2008-11-19|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2001, Ford offered a counterpart to the Mercury Grand Marquis LSE, named the Sport Appearance Package.  Alongside the standard Handling and Performance Package, the Sport Appearance Package offered 5-passenger seating with a floor-mounted shifter, 5-spoke aluminum wheels, and monochromatic exterior trim.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  For 2002, the Sport Appearance Package was renamed Crown Victoria LX Sport; with the Handling and Performance Package, it was fitted with rear air suspension, a 3.27:1 rear-axle ratio, and a larger rear stabilizer bar.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Sharing many of the performance upgrades of the Mercury Marauder (except for the engine), the LX Sport was produced through 2006.  For 2007, most features of the LX Sport returned as the Handling and Performance Package became a stand-alone option. The LX Handling and Performance package was finally discontinued after the mid 2008 model year.

*''Base'' - Included: Cloth upholstery, manual seats, power locks, power windows with automatic driver's side window, solar glass, power remote control mirrors, illuminated entry, steel rims with hubcaps, air conditioning, battery saver that turns off lights after 30 mins, power trunk, power steering, and an AM/FM stereo with clock (later, a cassette player was added, then a single-CD player replaced the tape deck). Later standard features were a power driver's seat and wiper-activated automatic headlamps.
*''LX'' - Added: Luxury cloth upholstery, power driver's seat (later, power front seats), keyless entry, cross-spoke hubcaps, an AM/FM stereo with a cassette player (later, a single CD/cassette player, then just a single-CD player) and clock, and illuminated mirrors.
*''LX Sport'' - Added: Auto-dimming rearview mirror, heated exterior mirrors, monochromatic exterior trim (on select colors), 17 inch “Sport” wheels, upgraded sport tuned suspension components, rear air suspension, standard dual exhaust, standard leather interior trim, a floor mounted shifter with center console, front bucket seats, an AM/FM stereo with single CD and cassette players as well as steering wheel audio controls &amp; steering wheel climate controls.

In 2006, after factoring out fleet/Police Interceptor sales (95% of production),&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-33331708_ITM|title=Way Forward doesn't include Crown Vic: Dealers will no longer sell the Ford Crown Victoria|last=Webster|first=Sarah A.|date=2007-10-31|accessdate=2008-08-16|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220024641/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-33331708_ITM|archivedate=December 20, 2008|url-status=dead|publisher=Detroit Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; retail sales of the Crown Victoria dwindled to 3,000 (coming within 1,100 units of the Ford GT supercar), outsold by its Mercury Grand Marquis counterpart by an 18-to-1 margin.  For 2008, Ford ended retail sale of the Crown Victoria in the United States, removing the model from its website (later replacing it with the newly revived [[Ford Taurus (fifth generation)|2008 Ford Taurus]]); through Ford Fleet, sales continued of the Police Interceptor and commercial (taxi/fleet/LWB) variants.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Subsequently, the only retail market selling the Ford Crown Victoria was the GCC/Middle East, with the Crown Victoria sold alongside the Mercury Grand Marquis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/?p=6094|title=Ford Crown Victoria RIP|date=|publisher=The Truth About Cars|access-date=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2009, the Crown Victoria model line underwent a consolidation, as the LX became the sole version of the standard-wheelbase Crown Victoria (alongside the Police Interceptor).  In line with its Mercury and Lincoln counterparts, 17-inch wheels became standard, with the LX adopting the 5-spoke alloy wheels of the LX Sport/Handling and Performance Package (the package itself was discontinued during the 2008 model year).  To streamline manufacturing, several features were standardized, including power-adjustable pedals and side airbags.  To comply with federal regulations, recessed power window switches were added (replacing a design used since 1995).

The Ford Crown Victoria is the only Panther vehicle that was produced for the 2012 model year, as the Mercury Grand Marquis, Lincoln Town Car, and Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor were discontinued during the 2011 model year.  As 2012 production was illegal for sale in the United States (due to lack of stability control),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhtsa.gov/Laws+&amp;+Regulations/Electronic+Stability+Control+(ESC)/ NHTSA Electronic Stability Control (ESC) Final Rule] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918065210/http://www.nhtsa.gov/Laws+%26+Regulations/Electronic+Stability+Control+%28ESC%29|date=2016-09-18}} NHTSA Electronic Stability Control (ESC) Final Rule&lt;/ref&gt; the entire 2012 production was exported to the Middle East.

==Discontinuation==
From the 1992 introduction of the Crown Victoria to the 2005 introduction of the Ford Five Hundred, the layout of American full-size sedans underwent an extensive transition.  By 1996, as General Motors ended production of the Chevrolet Caprice, Buick Roadmaster, and Cadillac Fleetwood, virtually all competitors of the Crown Victoria had adopted front-wheel drive, with a five-passenger configuration largely replacing six-passenger seating (with the first two generations of the [[Toyota Avalon]] becoming the sole Japanese-brand sedan marketed in North America with a [[Bench seat|front bench seat]]).

As an unintended consequence of the 1996 discontinuation of the Chevrolet Caprice, in the late 1990s, the Crown Victoria secured a near-monopoly of police car sales and significant market share of taxi vehicles; both segments viewed body-on-frame construction with rear-wheel drive as advantageous attributes.  As the sole remaining competitor of Crown Victoria was its Mercury Grand Marquis counterpart, to decrease internal competition, marketing for the Crown Victoria was de-emphasized, shifting buyers interested in Ford vehicles to the Taurus; buyers seeking full-size vehicles were shifted towards the Mercury Grand Marquis and Lincoln Town Car.

For 2005, Ford introduced the Five Hundred sedan, deriving its chassis components from the [[Volvo S80]].  The larger of the two cars intended to replace the [[Ford Taurus (fourth generation)|Ford Taurus]] (alongside the [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]]), the front-wheel-drive Five Hundred was the first completely new full-size Ford sedan since 1979.  While nearly a foot shorter than the Crown Victoria, the Five Hundred offered comparable interior dimensions; in a major shift, the Five Hundred adopted a five-passenger configuration as standard.

The 2006 Ford restructuring plan ''[[The Way Forward]]'' ultimately sealed the fate of the Ford Crown Victoria.  Coinciding with the 2008 withdrawal of the Crown Victoria from retail sale (see above), in 2009, Ford announced the 2011 closure of St. Thomas Assembly in Southwold, Ontario, Canada.  At the time, the production of the Ford Panther platform was to cease, as the architecture was unable to support electronic stability control, required for 2012 vehicles sold in the United States and Canada.  In line with the announcement, the Mercury Grand Marquis and Lincoln Town Car were discontinued without replacement (the former, as part of the closure of the Mercury brand).

From August 31, 2011, St. Thomas Assembly produced a short run of 2012 model year Ford Crown Victorias; all vehicles were produced for GCC export, as they were illegal for sale in the United States and Canada.  On September 15, 2011, the final Ford Crown Victoria rolled off the assembly line, destined for export to Saudi Arabia;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/15/the-last-crown-vic-rolls-and-not-as-a-new-york-cab/ The Last Crown Vic Rolls (but Not as a New York Cab)] The New York Times.com - September 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; the vehicle was the final Panther-platform vehicle produced and the final vehicle produced at St. Thomas Assembly.

As with the Mercury Grand Marquis and Lincoln Town Car, the Ford Crown Victoria was discontinued with no direct successor.  The Crown Victoria Police Interceptor is the only Panther-platform vehicle that was directly replaced, as Ford introduced [[Ford Taurus (sixth generation)#Police Interceptor Sedan|Ford Police Interceptor sedan]] (based on the Taurus) and the Police Interceptor Utility (based on the [[Ford Explorer#Fifth generation (2011–)|Ford Explorer]]);&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=34269 ''All-New Ford Police Interceptors to Deliver Higher Fuel Economy with Significant Fuel Savings for Cities''] Ford Media Press Release - 23 March 2011 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821141013/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=34269|date=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; both vehicles are derived from each other and are redesigned versions of the chassis introduced by the Ford Five Hundred.  In 2010, a variant of the [[Ford Transit Connect#Taxicab|Ford Transit Connect]] was developed specifically for taxicab usage.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;[http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=34802 ''A Taxi Trend: Ford Transit Connect Compressed Natural Gas Taxis Heading to Los Angeles and Chicago''] - Ford Media Press Release - 16 June 2011 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619113918/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=34802|date=June 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/26/nyregion/26towncar.html|title=Two Car Models, New York Emblems, Discontinued|author=Michael M.

==Variants==

===Police Interceptor (1998–2011)===
[[File:US Capitol Police Cruiser Ford Crown Vic fr.jpg|thumb|[[United States Capitol Police]] interceptor]]
{{main|Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor}}
Starting with the 1998 model year, the police version of the Crown Victoria, previously named ''Crown Victoria P71'', was changed to ''Police Interceptor'', and new rear badging was assigned instead of the civilian Crown Victoria badge. Though the Crown Victoria badge is still affixed to Police Interceptors equipped with the ''Street Appearance'' package for vehicles that require civilian styling (undercover cars, office/city motor pool, fire departments, etc.), Police Interceptor models come with a black front grille, a black rear fascia on the trunk lid, with chrome trim under the tail lights through 1999 models and black trim under the tail lights on 2000 and later models. 1999 through 2000 models have a blacked-out version of the standard chrome bar grille, while 2001 and up models have a black honeycomb type grille. They also have several "heavier-duty" mechanical upgrades, and newer models have additional safety features to deal with [[Ford Crown Victoria#Fuel tank|fuel-tank safety concerns]]. Ford has replaced the Crown Victoria Police Interceptor with upgraded and heavy-duty versions of the [[Ford Explorer]] and [[Ford Taurus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=31418 |title=Ford Announces Development Of All-New Police Interceptor For Law Enforcement Use Nationwide |publisher=Media.ford.com |date=2009-11-13 |accessdate=2011-01-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519224522/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=31418 |archivedate=May 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, many police departments like that of Austin, Texas, are buying reserve supplies of the last Crown Victorias to allow them to maintain a fleet of reliable police cars into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statesman.com/news/local/austin-police-ask-for-4-5-million-to-1409441.html |title=Austin police ask for $4.5 million to stock up on Crown Victorias |publisher=Statesman.com |accessdate=2011-04-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110421074830/http://www.statesman.com/news/local/austin-police-ask-for-4-5-million-to-1409441.html |archivedate=2011-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-wheelbase commercial version (2002–2012)===
[[File:Ford Crown Victoria (1998) extended.jpg|thumb|Extended Wheelbase Crown Victoria (US Spec)]] 
In 2002, Ford introduced a long-[[wheelbase]] version of the Crown Victoria, extended six inches to a 120.7-inch wheelbase.  As with the extended-wheelbase Lincoln Town Car L, the long-wheelbase Crown Victoria was modified through the use of a longer frame and longer rear doors; all additional interior room was added to the rear seat.

While not offered for retail sale in North America, the long-wheelbase Crown Victoria was offered for fleet sale, targeted directly for sales in taxi and livery markets.  From 2002 to 2006, a special-service version was offered for law-enforcement sale (though not as a Police Interceptor) with street-appearance trim from 2002 to 2004.  For GCC export (see below), Ford offered long-wheelbase versions of both the Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis for retail sale.    

=== Export ===

==== Canada ====
[[Ford Motor Company of Canada|Ford of Canada]] (the official manufacturer of the Crown Victoria, Police Interceptor, and Mercury Grand Marquis) marketed the Ford Crown Victoria in Canada through the 1999 model year.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/printArticle/200078|title=Why sell Crown Vic only to fleets up here?|last=Lai|first=Eric|date=2007-04-07|accessdate=2008-08-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220085030/http://www.thestar.com/printArticle/200078|archive-date=2008-12-20|url-status=dead|publisher=Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coinciding with the withdrawal of the Mercury brand from Canada, for the 2000 model year, Ford of Canada continued sale of the Grand Marquis in Ford dealerships through the 2009 model year, replaced by the 2010 Ford Taurus.  For fleets, sales of the Crown Victoria (consisting largely of the Police Interceptor) continued through the 2011 model year; as in the United States, its lack of stability control precluded further legal sale in Canada.  

==== Middle East (GCC) ====
Through its production, the Ford Crown Victoria was exported to two [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] nations ([[Kuwait]] and [[Saudi Arabia]]) alongside its Lincoln-Mercury counterparts.  In a region favoring full-size sedans (among other vehicles) the Crown Victoria became popular, as buyers of the region favored its durability, reliability, and ease of use (in comparison to German and British luxury vehicles), along with its lower price.  As American nameplates shifted to newer vehicles (with the introduction of the [[Chrysler 300|Chrysler 300C]], [[Dodge Charger (LX/LD)|Dodge Charger]], and the [[Chevrolet Caprice]] becoming a variant of the [[Holden Caprice]]), during the 2000s, the Crown Victoria, Grand Marquis, and Lincoln Town Car, while still popular, began to lose market share, primarily due to their age.  

Panther-chassis sedans destined for Middle East export were referred to as "GCC-Spec" vehicles.  Five versions of the Crown Victoria were available:  Standard, Sport, Long-wheelbase, LX, and LX Sport.  Unlike the United States and Canada, the long-wheelbase Crown Victoria was available for retail sale.  In [[Kuwait]], where the Crown Victoria was outsold by the higher-trim Mercury Grand Marquis, only the Standard and Long-wheelbase versions were sold after 2000 (the LX was discontinued in 1999).

File:P72 Kuwait.jpg|2006 Ford Crown Victoria Standard in Ford/Mercury dealership in Kuwait
&lt;/gallery&gt;    

===== Modifications from American vehicles  =====
Along with a metric instrument panel, several modifications are made to GCC-Spec Crown Victorias.  In place of the 50/50 bench seat of the standard Crown Victoria, GCC-Spec vehicles use a 40/20/40 bench seat.  Derived from the Lincoln Town Car, the front seat has air conditioning vents for the rear seats (except for LX Sport models), an 8-way driver's seat, a 4-way manual passenger seat (an 8-way power seat as an option); seat upholstery is either cloth or leather.  On all standard-wheelbase models, a true dual-exhaust system was fitted (not available on an American Crown Victoria).  On Standard and Standard Long-Wheelbase models, a driver's side spotlight assembly was optional.  A DVD entertainment system (marketed as "Export DVD Entertainment System") was added for the 2007 model year; it was optional on Sport, LX, and LX Sport models.

Differing from its American/Canadian counterpart, the warranty offered for a GCC-spec Crown Victoria was 5 years/200,000 kilometers (125,000 miles) – whichever came first. 

Derived from the Mercury Marauder, a trunk lid spoiler was either standard or an option on all standard-wheelbase models.  For GCC-spec vehicles, the optional Handling and Performance Package (HPP) offered in the United States was rebranded the Export Handling Package (EHP).  The EHP differed from the HPP largely by its retention of the 2.73:1 rear axle ratio (the standard-equipment "taller" axle) and the use of a true dual exhaust system (standard equipment on all standard-wheelbase export Crown Victorias).  Included as part of the Sport and LX Sport trims (optional on the LX), the package includes tuned rear air suspension, revised coil springs, handling shock absorbers and a larger rear stabilizer bar.  On GCC-Spec Crown Victorias, the EHP option is externally distinguished by a monochromatic paint scheme, with Ford offering Dark Toreador Red, Silver Birch, Tungsten, and Black as color choices.

===== 2008 Special Edition =====
With no major redesign of the Crown Victoria since 1998, to keep the model line competitive, the GCC importer of Ford vehicles designed a commemorative trim package for the Ford Crown Victoria for the 2008 model year.  Exclusive to GCC-Spec Standard models, the cosmetic package adds several cosmetic features, including:

{{Unbulleted list|A 3-bar grille (in the style of the [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]])|[[Mercury Marauder]] trunk lid spoiler (derived from Export Handling Package)|Chrome trim, front and rear bumpers|"Special Edition" logos, front fenders, trunk lid, dashboard|AM/FM/CD Premium stereo }}

Everything else on the Special Edition package is identical to the Standard-trim model.  Not listed in any sales literature, in [[Saudi Arabia]], it was available with a choice of different colors.  In [[Kuwait]], the Special Edition was only available in black (due to market size); the price was approximately [[KWD]] 6,000 (approximately $22,000 [[USD]]).  For 2009, the Special Edition was withdrawn.

==Safety concerns==

===Fuel tank===

The reports that the cars were more prone to fires during a rear collision were a simple combination of three things. First, most law enforcement agencies relied heavily on the Crown Victoria as their primary vehicle, meaning that any police-related auto accident was very likely to involve a Crown Victoria. Second, the accidents occurred as the result of the officers intentionally parking their vehicles close to active traffic to shield a stopped motorist—something most civilians would never do. Third, the impacting vehicle was often traveling at, or above, the posted legal limit ({{convert|65|to|75|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in most jurisdictions).

The condition was exacerbated by police equipment installers drilling over the package tray in the luggage compartment. Due to the gas tank's orientation, drilling through the package tray may result in drilling into the gas tank. Installers also used screws set directly into the bulkhead and facing the fuel tank. In the event of a high-energy collision, these screws could be forced into the tank, both rupturing the tank and possibly acting as a spark source. Long bolts for mounting heavier equipment were also directly suspect. The manufacturer provided an aftermarket shield to help prevent these items from puncturing the tank during impact. Further, many investigations, both performed by federal/state agencies, and the police department themselves, have found that removable items in the trunk were improperly stowed. These items became tank-piercing projectiles during the rear-collision scenarios. Ford's second solution came in the form of a recall kit including patterns to mark unsafe areas (to drill) in the luggage compartment. Also included were rubberized kevlar and hard ballistic nylon shields for the differential cover lower shock bolts. They also included a kevlar-based trunk liner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Kiley, David |title=Police car fires not Crown Vic's fault |work=USA Today |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/autos/2002-10-04-crown-vic_x.htm |date=2002-04-10 |accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford used similar kits on early-1980s model passenger vehicles. For 2005 and newer models, Ford offers an optional onboard fire-suppression system for the Crown Victoria Police Interceptor units. The system itself is integrated with the anti-lock braking system as part of the activation and can be activated manually. However, Ford does cite several system limitations regarding fuel loss and impact speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fleet.ford.com/showroom/CVPI/FireSuppression.asp |title=Ford Fleet - Showroom - Police Vehicles - Fire Suppression |publisher=Fleet.ford.com |date=2005-02-02 |accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite numerous court cases charging Ford with partial liability for fires caused in accidents, the company has never been found liable in a Crown Victoria accident.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Notably, only the Ford Crown Victoria and new Ford police car have been certified for high-speed rear-impact collisions, adding credibility to Ford's statement that fiery crashes are a result of extreme and unfortunate situations.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

===Intake manifold defect===
Model years 1996 to 2001 inclusive, using an all-composite intake manifold, are subject to coolant leaks. Late in 2005, Ford settled a class-action lawsuit. See [[Ford Modular engine#Intake manifold defect|Intake Manifold Defect]] for details. This problem can be remedied by upgrading the intake manifold to the 2002 and up version.

In 1960, [[Ford Motor Company of Canada, Limited|Ford Canada]] introduced the '''Frontenac''' to give [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]]-[[Meteor (automobile)|Meteor]] dealers a compact vehicle to sell. It was a separate marque, like Lincoln was to Ford. Produced for the 1960 model year only, the Frontenac was essentially a 1960 [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]] with its own unique grille, tail lights, and external trim, including red maple-leaf insignia. It was the second-best selling compact in Canada during its one-year (5% of Ford's total Canadian output).&lt;ref name="BobEnglish"&gt;{{cite news|first=Bob |last=English |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/reviews/classics/ford-frontenac-a-one-year-wonder/article4389492/ |title=The one-year wonder |page=G5 |date=23 September 2010 |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 9,536 Frontenacs were built at its [[Oakville, Ontario]], plant.&lt;ref name="BobEnglish"/&gt; In August 1960 a prototype 1961 Frontenac was driven from Halifax to Vancouver for a [[photo shoot]] only for the crew to learn that the Canadian model was discontinued from the domestic market and replaced by the [[Mercury Comet|Comet]] for the 1961 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.61thriftpower.com/frontenac.shtml |title=Frontenac from the "Magic World of Comet" |work=61thriftpower.com |accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At launch the Frontenac was available in 2-door and 4-door sedan body styles with 2-door and 4-door station wagons added later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://falconfaq.dyndns.org/Frontenac/Frontenac01.html The Frontenac, from Ford of Canada, falconfaq.dyndns.org] Retrieved 18 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The Frontenac is one example of U.S. automakers' attempts to market slight variations of U.S. models as unique Canadian makes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Ford Frontenac Goes On Display Here Oct 8th|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=b5FNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yEEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=ford+frontenac&amp;pg=1401,1359911&amp;hl=en |newspaper=St Maurice Valley Chronicle|date=17 September 1959 |accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Mercury Monarch#Monarch (Ford of Canada brand)|Monarch]] and [[Meteor (automobile)|Meteor]] brands marketed by the [[Ford Motor Company of Canada]], the Frontenac was not part of the Ford or Mercury lines. It was its own [[marque]], and was marketed as such. 

The Frontenac was named after a [[Louis de Buade de Frontenac|late 17th century governor of New France]]. The name had been used previously, from 1931 to 1933, on a car assembled in Toronto by [[Dominion Motors Frontenac|Dominion Motors]].&lt;ref name="BobEnglish"/&gt;

'''''The California Kid''''' is a [[Custom car|customized]] 1934 Ford [[Three window coupe|three-window]] [[coupé]] built by [[Pete Chapouris]].

The '34 was on the cover of [[Custom Rod Magazine|''Custom Rod'']] in November 1973, along with a similar coupé built by [[Jim Jacobs (customizer)|Jim Jacobs]].&lt;ref&gt;The coincidence would lead them to form a partnership, [[Pete and Jake's Hot Rod Shop]] in [[Temple City, California]], in 1974. [http://www.hotrod.com/events/coverage/so-cal-speed-shop-pomona/ ''Hot Rod Magazine'' online] (retrieved 17 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; It attracted the attention of television [[Television producer|producer]] [[Howie Horowitz]],&lt;ref&gt;Producer of [[Batman (TV series)|"Batman"]]&lt;/ref&gt; who wanted it for a [[Television movie|TV movie]], "[[The California Kid]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotrod.com/events/coverage/so-cal-speed-shop-pomona/''Hot Rod Magazine'' online] (retrieved 17 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapouris' selection of a classic customizing technique, contrary to the trend at the time, made it perfect for its role in the movie.

The movie earned Chapouris' '34 legendary status, and led to numerous copies being built in the following decades. Today, ''The California Kid'' refers more to the car than the film among [[Hot rod|rodder]]s and [[Custom car|customizer]]s.

==Construction==
Chapouris, then a member of the [[Vintage Tin Hot Rod Club]], customized a 1934 Ford three-window coupe in a style that, at the time, was at odds with most contemporary enthusiast thinking, and was generally considered "old-fashioned"; "resto-rodding" (a style sympathetic to the car's original design and specification) was in vogue.

The original '34 was completed in black, with a classic style of [[Flame job (custom painting)|flame job]], and 1960s-era [[Halibrand]] wheels. The film company added dummy [[Custom car#Language|sidepipes]], a 'c' channel rear bumper, and replaced the Halibrands with period-correct steel wheels and Ford hubcaps.

      <text bytes="7391" xml:space="preserve">{{advert|date=June 2019}}'''Ford Ranger''' is a [[nameplate]] that has been used on three distinct model lines of vehicles sold by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]].  The name originated in 1958 when the [[Edsel Ranger]] was introduced as the base trim level of the Edsel model range. From 1965 to 1981, Ranger denoted various trim packages of the [[Ford F-Series]] (and Ford Bronco), serving as a mid- to top-level trim.

For the 1983 model year, the Ford Ranger nameplate was applied to a new compact pickup truck, replacing the 1972-1982 [[Ford Courier]] in North America.  In global markets, Ford began use of the Ranger nameplate in 1998 in place of Courier, with all compact trucks named Ranger by 2006.

For 2011, the Ranger was discontinued in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detroitautopress.com/ford/ranger/|title=Ford Ranger - Overview|work=Detroit Auto Press|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same year, Ford commenced production of a mid-size Ford Ranger; sold globally (other than the United States and Canada until 2019), production was revived in the United States in 2018.

== Americas (1983–2012, 2019-present) ==
{{main|Ford Ranger (Americas)}}

For the 1983 model year, Ford introduced the Ranger for the United States and Canada.  Replacing the Courier (a rebadged Mazda B1800), the Ranger was the first compact pickup truck designed by Ford.  Using the same chassis architecture, three generations of the Ranger were produced across its 29-year production run.  The model line underwent major redesigns for 1993 and 1998, a mid-cycle update in 1989, with smaller updates for 2001, 2004, and 2006.

The Ford Ranger chassis architecture served as the basis for several model ranges over its production.  The [[Ford Bronco II]] and the 1991-2001 [[Ford Explorer]] were derived from the Ranger (alongside the [[Mazda Navajo]] and [[Mercury Mountaineer]]) alongside the 2001-2005 [[Ford Explorer Sport Trac]].  Through the use of [[rebadging]], in North America, Mazda sold the Ranger as the Mazda B-Series from 1994-2009 (the reverse of the original Ford Courier; also the reverse of the Ford Ranger outside North America).

On December 22, 2011, the final Ford Ranger produced for North America rolled off the [[Twin Cities Assembly Plant|Twin Cities Assembly]] line, as the final vehicle assembled at the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/bye-bye-ford-ranger-cars-trucks-2012-article-1.993938|title=Ford Ranger, other cars, cease production in 2012|last=Max|first=Josh|date=19 December 2011|work=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South America (Ford Argentina) ===
In 1995, exports of the Ford Ranger began to select Latin and South American countries.  To accommodate the demand for the vehicle, in 1998, Ford Argentina commenced local production of the Ranger, introducing a four-door cab not sold in North America.  During the 2000s, Rangers produced by Ford Argentina shared a common chassis with North American-produced vehicles (offering a diesel engine to meet local demand).  For 2010, the Ranger underwent a major revision of the exterior (not done for North America).

Ford Argentina ended production of the compact Ranger following the 2011 model year (slightly before the United States) to expand production of the Ranger T6 mid-size pickup, which remains in production.

=== Model revival (2019–present) ===
After an eight-year hiatus, the Ford Ranger returns to the Ford model range in North America for the 2019 model year, with the first example rolling off the assembly line at [[Michigan Assembly Plant]] on October 22, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/2019-ford-ranger-production-starts-michigan/|title=2019 Ford Ranger production starts in Michigan|date=2018-10-22|work=Roadshow|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The revived Ranger is the global Ranger T6, adapted slightly to accommodate American government regulations.  Similar in size to the Ford Explorer Sport Trac, the 2019 Ranger is the first generation produced as a mid-size pickup for the North American market.  The Ranger is sold in two configurations, SuperCab (2+2 door extended cab with 6-foot bed) and SuperCrew (4-door crew cab with 5-foot bed); the two-door standard cab is not produced for North American sale.

As the 1983–2012 Ranger served as a basis for several Ford/Mercury/Mazda vehicles during its production, the current mid-size Ranger will serve as the basis for the revived [[Ford Bronco (sixth generation)|Ford Bronco]] (slated for a 2020 introduction).&lt;ref name="Ranger_returns_to_NA"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tk6iShyuM3M Ford NAIAS 2017: Official Press Conference Livestream]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;gallery widths="200" heights="150" mode="packed"&gt;

== International (1998–present) ==
{{main|Mazda B-Series|Mazda BT-50|Ford Ranger (T6)}}

To enter the lucrative compact truck segment, Ford sold the [[Mazda B-Series]] under the [[Ford Courier]] nameplate.  Replaced by the Ranger in North America for 1983, the nameplate continued in global markets through the 1990s; in 1998, Ford phased out the Courier name on Mazda-produced trucks in favor of Ranger in markets outside of Australasia (where it would remain until 2006).  

From 1971 to 2006, the Ford Courier and the first-generation 1998-2006 Ranger would follow the development of the Mazda B-Series.  In 2006, the B-Series was replaced by the [[Mazda BT-50]], forming the basis of the second-generation Ranger, produced from 2006 to 2011.  The third-generation Ranger is the [[Ford Ranger (T6)|Ranger T6]], produced since 2011.  In contrast to previous production, the Ranger T6 was designed by [[Ford Australia]], with the second-generation Mazda BT-50 serving as the derivative vehicle.    

All three generations of the Ranger serve as the basis of the [[Ford Everest]] mid-size SUV, introduced in 2003.  The third-generation Ranger T6 is the basis for the fourth-generation Ranger in North America, with several design adaptations to accommodate market demands and government regulations.

[[File:Ford GT40 (front).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ford GT40 Mk II front. This car took second place overall (all three top finishers were Ford GT40s) in the 1966 [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]. The #1 car was driven by [[Ken Miles]] and [[Denny Hulme]], and together with the #2 car driven by [[Bruce McLaren]]/[[Chris Amon]] (1st overall) and #5 car driven by Bucknum/Hutcherson (3rd overall) gave Ford its first victory in a 24-hour race. The photo shows the livery as used at Le Mans in 1966. (Serial Number GT-40 P 1015 Mk. II)]]

The '''Ford GT40''' is a high-performance endurance [[Auto racing|racing car]]. The Mk I, Mk II, and Mk III variants were designed and built in England based upon the British [[Lola Mk6]]. Only the Mk IV model was designed and built in the United States. The range was powered by a series of American-built [[Ford V8]] engines modified for racing. 

The GT40 effort was launched by [[Ford Motor Company]] to win long-distance [[sports car racing|sports car races]] against [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], which won every [[List of 24 Hours of Le Mans winners|24 Hours of Le Mans]] race from 1960 to 1965. The GT40 broke Ferrari's streak in [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans|1966]] and went on to win the next three annual races. The Mk II's victory  was the first win for an American manufacturer in a major European [[Auto racing|race]] since [[Jimmy Murphy (racing driver)|Jimmy Murphy]]'s triumph with [[Duesenberg]] at the [[1921 French Grand Prix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supercars.net/cars/692.html|title=Ford GT40 Mark II|date=2004-03-01|publisher=Supercars.net|accessdate=2010-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/1089/Ford-GT40-Mk-II.html|title=1965 - 1966 Ford GT40 Mk II - Images, Specifications and Information|date=2006-12-21|publisher=Ultimatecarpage.com|accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1967 24 Hours of Le Mans|1967]], the Mk IV became the only car designed and built entirely in the United States to achieve the overall win at Le Mans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://simeonemuseum.org/the-cars|title=The Collection|work=simeonemuseum.org|date=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Mk 1, the oldest of the cars, won in [[1968 24 Hours of Le Mans|1968]] and [[1969 24 Hours of Le Mans|1969]], the second chassis to win Le Mans more than once. (This Ford/Shelby chassis #P-1075 was believed to have been the first until the Ferrari 275P chassis 0816 was revealed to have won the [[1964 24 Hours of Le Mans|1964]] race after winning the [[1963 24 Hours of Le Mans|1963]] race in 250P configuration and with a 0814 chassis plate). Using an American Ford V8 engine, originally of 4.7-liter displacement capacity ([[Ford Windsor engine#289 HiPo (K-code)|289]] cubic inches), it was later enlarged to the 4.9-liter engine ([[Ford Windsor engine#302|302]] cubic inches), with custom alloy [[Dan Gurney|Gurney]]–[[Weslake]] [[cylinder head]]s. 

Early cars were simply named "Ford GT" for [[Grand tourer|Grand Touring]]), the name of Ford's project to prepare the cars for the international endurance racing circuit. The "40" represented its height of 40&amp;nbsp; inches (1.02 m), measured at the windshield, the maximum allowed. The first 12 "prototype" vehicles carried serial numbers GT-101 to GT-112. The "production" began and the subsequent cars: the MkI, MkII, MkIII, and MkIV were numbered GT40P/1000 through GT40P/1145, and thus officially "GT40s". The Mk IVs were numbered J1-J12.

The contemporary [[Ford GT]] is a modern homage to the GT40.

== History ==
[[Henry Ford II]] had wanted a Ford at Le Mans since the early 1960s. In early 1963, Ford reportedly received word through a European intermediary that [[Enzo Ferrari]] was interested in selling to Ford Motor Company. Ford reportedly spent several million dollars in an audit of Ferrari factory assets and in legal negotiations, only to have Ferrari unilaterally cut off talks at a late stage due to disputes about the ability to direct open-wheel racing. Ferrari, who wanted to remain the sole operator of his company's motorsports division, was angered when he was told that he would not be allowed to race at the [[Indianapolis 500]] if the deal went through since Ford fielded Indy cars using its own engine, and didn't want competition from Ferrari. Enzo cut the deal off out of spite and Henry Ford II, enraged, directed his racing division to find a company that could build a Ferrari-beater on the world endurance-racing circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ford GT40.|last=Ray.|first=Hutton|publisher=|isbn=978-1907085680|location=|page=12|oclc=1019613496|date = 6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To this end Ford began negotiation with [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]], [[Lola Cars|Lola]], and [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]]. Cooper had no experience in GT or prototype and its performances in [[Formula One]] were declining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5oRmCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=Cooper+and+gt+ford#v=onepage&amp;q=Cooper%20and%20gt%20ford&amp;f=false|title=Ford GT: How Ford Silenced the Critics, Humbled Ferrari and Conquered Le Mans|last=Lerner|first=Preston|date=2015-11-09|publisher=Motorbooks|isbn=9780760347874|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lola Mk6 GT front.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lola Mk6]] ]]
The Lola proposal was chosen since Lola had used a Ford V8 engine in its mid-engined [[Lola Mk6]] (also known as Lola GT). It was one of the most advanced racing cars of the time, and made a noted performance in Le Mans 1963, even though the car did not finish, due to low gearing and slow revving out on the [[Mulsanne Straight]]. However, [[Eric Broadley]], Lola Cars' owner and chief designer, agreed on a short-term personal contribution to the project without involving Lola Cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jO8Ad4W-JQ8C&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=Eric+Broadley+ford+gt#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Ford GT: Then, and Now|last=Streather|first=Adrian|date=2006|publisher=Veloce Publishing Ltd|isbn=9781845840549|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement with Broadley included a one-year collaboration between Ford and Broadley, and the sale of the two Lola Mk 6 chassis builds to Ford. To form the development team, Ford also hired the ex-[[Aston Martin]] team manager [[John Wyer]].&lt;ref name=scm201211&gt;{{cite journal|last=Comer|first=Colin|title=1968 Ford GT40 Gulf/Mirage Lightweight|journal=[[Sports Car Market]]|date=November 2012|volume=24|issue=11|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford Motor Co. engineer [[Roy Lunn]] was sent to England; he had designed the mid-engined [[Ford Mustang I|Mustang I]] concept car powered by a 1.7-liter V4. Despite the small engine of the Mustang I, Lunn was the only Dearborn engineer to have some experience with a mid-engined car.

Overseen by [[Harley Copp]], the team of Broadley, Lunn, and Wyer began working on the new car at the Lola Factory in Bromley. At the end of 1963, the team moved to [[Slough]], near [[Heathrow Airport]]. Ford then established [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] Advanced Vehicles (FAV) Ltd, a new subsidiary under the direction of Wyer, to manage the project.&lt;ref name=scm201211/&gt;

The first chassis built by [[Abbey Panels]] of Coventry was delivered on 16 March 1964, with fiber-glass moldings produced by Fibre Glass Engineering Ltd of [[Farnham]]. The first "Ford GT" the GT/101 was unveiled in England on 1 April and soon after exhibited in New York. Purchase price of the completed car for competition use was £5,200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gt40.co.uk/gt40st16.html|title=Ford Press Release, January 1966.

It was powered by the 4.7&amp;nbsp;L [[Ford Windsor engine#289 HiPo (K-code)|289]] cu in [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Fairlane]] engine with a [[Colotti Trasmissioni|Colotti]] transaxle, the same power plant was used by the Lola GT and the single-seater Lotus 29 that came in a highly controversial second at the Indy 500 in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Barry |first=David |date=August 2001 |title=The Lotus-Ford Plot to Overthrow the Offy Roadster |url=http://www.davidbarrywriter.com/files/The_Lotus-Ford_Plot.docx |format=doc |magazine=Vintage Motorsport Magazine |location= |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (An aluminum block DOHC version, known as the Ford Indy Engine, was used in later years at Indy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quadcamford.com/development.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314065909/http://www.quadcamford.com/development.html |archivedate=14 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It won in 1965 in the Lotus 38.)

=== Racing history ===
[[File:1964 Ford GT40 proto GT.104.jpg|thumb|left|Prototype chassis GT 104, which finished third at the Daytona 2000 in 1965]]
The Ford GT40 was first raced in May 1964 at the [[Nürburgring]] ''1000 km race'' where it retired with suspension failure after holding second place early in the event. Three weeks later at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], all three entries retired although the Ginther/Gregory car led the field from the second lap until its first pitstop. After a season-long series of dismal results under John Wyer in 1964, the program was handed over to [[Carroll Shelby]] after the [[Bahamas Speed Week|1964 Nassau race]]. The cars were sent directly to Shelby, still bearing the dirt and damage from the Nassau race. Carroll Shelby was noted for complaining that the cars were poorly maintained when he received them, but later information revealed the cars were packed up as soon as the race was over, and FAV never had a chance to clean and organize the cars to be transported to Shelby.

Shelby's first victory came on their maiden race with the Ford program, with [[Ken Miles]] and [[Lloyd Ruby]] taking a Shelby American-entered Ford GT40 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racingsportscars.com/covers/_Daytona-1965-02-28e.jpg ''Entries for the fourth annual Daytona Continental'', 1965 Daytona Speedweeks Program No 2, 15–28 February 1965, www.racingsportscars.com] Retrieved 7 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; to victory in the [[24 Hours of Daytona#2000 km distance|Daytona 2000 in February 1965]]. One month later Ken Miles and [[Bruce McLaren]] came in second overall (to the winning [[Chaparral Cars|Chaparral]] in the sports class) and first in prototype class at the Sebring 12-hour race. The rest of the season, however, was a disappointment.

[[File:Ford GT40.JPG|thumb|right|Ford GT40 Mk I road version]]
The experience gained in 1964 and 1965 allowed the 7-liter Mk II to dominate the following year. In February, the GT40 again won at Daytona. This was the first year [[24 Hours of Daytona#24 Hour duration .281966.E2.80.931971.29|Daytona was run in the 24 Hour format]] and Mk II's finished 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. In March, at the [[1966 12 Hours of Sebring]], GT40s again took all three top finishes with the X-1 Roadster first, an Mk. II taking second, and an Mk. I in third. Then in June at the [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans]] the GT40 achieved yet another 1–2–3 result.

The Le Mans finish, however, was clouded in controversy: in the final few hours, the Ford GT40 of New Zealanders [[Bruce McLaren]] and [[Chris Amon]] closely trailed the leading Ford GT40 driven by Englishman [[Ken Miles]] and New Zealander [[Denny Hulme]]. With a multimillion-dollar program finally on the very brink of success, Ford team officials faced a difficult choice. They could allow the drivers to settle the outcome by racing each other—and risk one or both cars breaking down or crashing. They could dictate a finishing order to the drivers—guaranteeing that one set of drivers would be extremely unhappy. Or they could arrange a tie, with the McLaren/Amon and Miles/Hulme cars crossing the line side-by-side.

The team chose the last and informed McLaren and Miles of the decision just before the two got in their cars for the final stint. Then, not long before the finish, the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO), organizers of the Le Mans event, informed Ford that the geographical difference in starting positions would be taken into account at a close finish. This meant that the McLaren/Amon vehicle, which had started perhaps {{convert|60|ft|m}} behind the Hulme-Miles car, would have covered slightly more ground over the 24 hours and would, therefore, be the winner. Secondly, Ford officials admitted later, the company's contentious relationship with Miles, its top contract driver, placed executives in a difficult position. They could reward an outstanding driver who had been at times extremely difficult to work with, or they could decide in favor of drivers (McLaren/Amon) who had committed less to the Ford program but who had been easier to deal with. Ford stuck with the orchestrated photo finish but Miles, deeply bitter over this decision after his dedication to the program, issued his own protest by suddenly slowing just yards from the finish and letting McLaren across the line first. Miles died in a testing accident in the J-car (later to become the Mk IV) at Riverside (CA) Raceway just two months later.

Miles' death occurred at the wheel of the Ford "J-car", an iteration of the GT40 that included several unique features. These included an aluminum honeycomb chassis construction and a "bread van" body design that experimented with "[[Kammback]]" aerodynamic theories. Unfortunately, the fatal Miles accident was attributed at least partly to the unproven aerodynamics of the J-car design, as well as the experimental chassis' strength. The team embarked on a complete redesign of the car, which became known as the Mk IV. The Mk IV, newer design with an Mk II engine but a different chassis and a different body, won [[1967 24 Hours of Le Mans|the following year at Le Mans]] (when four Mark IVs, three Mark IIs, and three Mark Is raced). The high speeds achieved in that race caused a rule change, which already came in effect in 1968: the prototypes were limited to the capacity of 3.0 liters, the same as in [[Formula One]]. This took out the V12-powered [[Ferrari P#330 P 3/4 and P4|Ferrari 330P]] as well as the Chaparral and the Mk. IV.

If at least 50 cars had been built, sportscars like the GT40 and the [[Lola T70]] were allowed, with a maximum of 5.0&amp;nbsp; L. [[John Wyer]]'s revised 4.7-liter (bored to 4.9 liter, and [[O-ring]]s cut and installed between the [[Cylinder block|block]] and [[Cylinder head|head]] to prevent [[head gasket]] failure, a common problem found with the 4.7 engine) Mk I won the [[1968 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 hours of Le Mans race in 1968]] against the fragile smaller prototypes. This result added to four other round wins for the GT40, gave Ford victory in the [[1968 World Sportscar Championship|1968 International Championship for Makes]]. The GT40's intended 3.0&amp;nbsp; L replacement, the [[Ford P68]], and Mirage cars proved a dismal failure. While facing more experienced prototypes and the new yet still unreliable 4.5&amp;nbsp; L [[Flat-12 engine|flat-12]]-powered [[Porsche 917]]s, Wyer's [[1969 24 Hours of Le Mans]] winners [[Jacky Ickx]]/[[Jackie Oliver]] managed to beat the remaining 3.0-liter [[Porsche 908]] by just a few seconds with the already outdated GT40 Mk I, in the very car that had won in 1968—the legendary GT40P/1075. Apart from brake wear in the Porsche and the decision not to change brake pads so close to the race end, the winning combination was relaxed driving by both GT40 drivers and heroic efforts at the right time by (at that time Le Mans' rookie) Ickx, who won Le Mans five more times in later years.

=== International titles ===
In addition to four consecutive overall Le Mans victories, Ford also won the following four [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] international titles (at what was then unofficially known as the [[World Sportscar Championship]]) with the GT40:

* [[1966 World Sportscar Championship|1966 International Manufacturers Championship]]&amp;nbsp;– Over 2000cc
* [[1966 World Sportscar Championship|1966 International Championship for Sports Cars]]&amp;nbsp;– Division III (Over 2000cc)

[[File:1968 Ford GT40 Mk I (14288662849).jpg|right|thumb|1968 Ford GT40 Mk I]]
The Mk.I was the original Ford GT40. Early prototypes were powered by {{cvt|255|CID|L|1|order=flip}} [[alloy]] [[V8 engine]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/photo/Nurburgring-1964-05-31.html|title=Nürburgring 1000 Kilometres 1964|accessdate=18 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and production models were powered by [[Ford Windsor engine#289 HiPo (K-code)|{{cvt|289|CID|L|1}} engines]] as used in the [[Ford Mustang]]. Five prototype models were built with [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]] bodywork, including the Ford X-1.&lt;ref name=isr/&gt; Two lightweight cars (of a planned five) were built by Alan Mann Racing in 1966, with light alloy bodies and other weight-saving modifications.

The Mk.I met with little success in its initial tune for the 1964 and 1965 Le Mans races. The first success came after their demise at the Nassau Speed Weekend Nov 1964 when the racing was handed over to Carrol Shelby. Shelby's team modified the Ford GT40 and the first win at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] February 1965 was achieved. Much was later modified and run by [[John Wyer]] in 1968 and 1969, winning Le Mans in both those years and [[Sebring International Raceway|Sebring]] in 1969. The Mk.II and IV were both obsolete after the [[FIA]] had changed the rules to ban unlimited capacity engines, ruling out the {{cvt|427|CID|L|1|order=flip}} Ford V8. However, the Mk.I, with its smaller engine, was legally able to race as a [[homologated]] sports car because of its production numbers.

In 1968 competition came from the [[Porsche 908]] which was the first prototype built for the 3-liter Group 6. The result of the 1968 was resounding success at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] with [[Pedro Rodríguez (racing driver)|Pedro Rodríguez]] and [[Lucien Bianchi]] having a clear lead over the Porsches, driving the almighty #9 car with the '[[Gulf Oil]]' colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

; X-1 Roadster
The X-1 was a roadster built to contest the Fall 1965 North American Pro Series, a forerunner of [[Can-Am]], entered by the Bruce McLaren team and driven by Chris Amon. The car had an aluminum chassis built at Abbey Panels and was originally powered by a 4.7-liter (289&amp;nbsp;ci) engine. The real purpose of this car was to test several improvements originating from Kar Kraft, Shelby, and McLaren. Several gearboxes were used: a [[Hewland]] LG500 and at least one automatic gearbox. It was later upgraded to Mk.II specifications with a 7.0-liter (427&amp;nbsp;ci) engine and a standard four ratio Kar Kraft (subsidiary of Ford) gearbox, however, the car kept specific features such as its open roof and lightweight aluminum chassis. The car went on to win the [[1966 12 Hours of Sebring|12 Hours of Sebring]] in 1966. The X-1 was a one-off and having been built in the United Kingdom and being liable for United States [[tariff]]s, was later ordered to be destroyed by United States customs officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supercars.net/cars/2492.html|title=Ford GT40 X1|work=supercars.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ford GT40 (rear).jpg|thumb|left|Ford GT40 Mk II rear]]
The Mk.II was very similar in appearance to the Mk.I but used the [[Ford FE engine|7.0-liter FE (427 ci)]] engine from the [[Ford Galaxie]], used in NASCAR at the time and modified for road course use. The car's chassis was similar to the British-built Mk.I chassis, but it and other parts of the car had to be redesigned and modified by Shelby to accommodate the larger and heavier 427 engine. A new Kar Kraft-built four-speed gearbox replaced the ZF five-speed used in the Mk.I. This car is sometimes called the ''Ford Mk.II''.

In 1966, the Mk.II dominated Le Mans, taking European audiences by surprise and beating Ferrari to finish 1-2-3 in the standings. After the success of these Mk.II cars, the Ford GT40 went on to win the race for the next three years.

For 1967, the Mk.IIs were upgraded to "B" spec; they had re-designed bodywork and twin Holley carburetors for an additional 15&amp;nbsp;hp. A batch of improperly heat-treated input shafts in the transaxles sidelined virtually every Ford in the race at Daytona, however, and Ferrari won 1-2-3. The Mk.IIBs were also used for Sebring and Le Mans that year and won the Reims 12 Hours in France. For the Daytona 24 Hours, two Mk II models (chassis 1016 and 1047) had their engines re-badged as Mercury engines; Ford seeing a good opportunity to advertise that division of the company. {{fact|date=January 2020}}

=== Mk III ===
[[File:1963 Ford GT40 Mk.III (6315540555).jpg|thumb|right|Ford GT40 Mk III]]
The Mk III was a road-car only, of which seven were built.&lt;ref name=isr /&gt; The car had four headlamps, the rear part of the body was expanded to make room for luggage, the 4.7-liter engine was detuned to {{convert|306|BHP||abbr=on}}, the shock absorbers were softened, the shift lever was moved to the center, an ashtray was added, and the car was available with the steering wheel on the left side of the car. As the Mk III looked significantly different from the racing models many customers interested in buying a GT40 for road use chose to buy a Mk I that was available from Wyer Ltd. Of the seven MK III that were produced four were left-hand drive. One of these examples is currently on display at the [[Petersen Automotive Museum]].

=== J-car ===
[[File:1967 GT40 Mk IV at 2010 Canadian International AutoShow.JPG|thumb|left|1967 Ford GT40 Mk IV, which was developed from the J-car. This particular car, J-4, won the 1967 [[12 Hours of Sebring]]]]
In an effort to develop a car with better [[aerodynamics]] and lighter weight, it was decided to retain the 7-liter engine, but redesign the rest of the car and ditch the Mk.I/Mk.II chassis. In order to bring the car more "in house" and lessening partnership with English firms, Ford Advanced Vehicles was sold to [[John Wyer]] and the new car was designed by Ford's studios and produced by Ford's subsidiary Kar-Kraft under [[Ed Hull]]. There was also a partnership with the [[Brunswick Aircraft Corporation]] for expertise on the novel use of [[aluminum]] honeycomb panels bonded together to form a lightweight, rigid "tub". The car was designated as the J-car, as it was constructed to meet the new Appendix J regulations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/3406/Ford-Mk-IV.html|title=Ford Mk IV|accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which were introduced by the FIA in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fia.com/resources/documents/2102817986__Hist_App_J_69_Art_252_a.pdf|title=Appendix J to the International Sporting Code|accessdate=23 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050302205843/http://www.fia.com/resources/documents/2102817986__Hist_App_J_69_Art_252_a.pdf|archive-date=2 March 2005|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first J-car was completed in March 1966 and set the fastest time at the Le Mans trials that year. The tub weighed only {{convert|86|lb|abbr=on}}, and the entire car weighed only {{convert|2660|lb|abbr=on|0}}, {{convert|300|lb|abbr=on|0}} less than the Mk II. It was decided to run the Mk IIs due to their proven reliability, however, and little or no development was done on the J-car for the rest of the season. Following Le Mans, the development program for the J-car was resumed, and a second car was built. During a test session at [[Riverside International Raceway]] in August 1966 with [[Ken Miles]] driving, the car suddenly went out of control at the end of Riverside's high-speed, 1-mile-long back straight. The aluminum honeycomb chassis did not live up to its design goal, shattering upon impact. The car burst into flames, killing Miles. It was determined that the unique, flat-topped "bread van" aerodynamics of the car, lacking any sort of spoiler, were implicated in generating excess lift. Therefore, a conventional but significantly more aerodynamic body was designed for the subsequent development of the J-car which was officially known as the Mk IV.&lt;ref name="supercars.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supercars.net/cars/694.html|title=1967 Ford GT40 Mark IV|accessdate=2010-02-23|work=supercars.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of nine cars were constructed with J-car chassis numbers although six were designated as Mk IVs and one as the G7A.&lt;ref name=isr /&gt;

=== Mk IV ===
[[File:Ford GT40 Mk IV.jpg|thumb|right|Ford GT40 Mk IV]]
The Mk IV was built around a reinforced J chassis powered by the same 7.0 L engine as the Mk II. Excluding the engine, gearbox, some suspension parts and the brakes from the Mk.II, the Mk.IV was totally different from other GT40s, using a specific, all-new chassis and bodywork. It was undoubtedly the most radical and American variant of all the GT40's over the years. As a direct result of the Miles accident, the team installed a NASCAR-style steel-tube roll cage in the Mk.IV, which made it much safer, but the roll cage was so heavy that it negated most of the weight saving of the then-highly advanced, radically innovative honeycomb-panel construction. The Mk. IV had a long, streamlined shape, which gave it exceptional top speed, crucial to do well at Le Mans in those days (a circuit made up predominantly of straights)—the race it was ultimately built for. A 2-speed automatic gearbox was tried, but during the extensive testing of the J-car in 1966 and 1967, it was decided that the 4-speed from the Mk.II would be retained. Dan Gurney often complained about the weight of the Mk.IV, since the car was {{convert|600|lb}} heavier than the Ferrari 330 P4's. During practice at Le Mans in 1967, in an effort to preserve the highly stressed brakes, Gurney developed a strategy (also adopted by co-driver A.J. Foyt) of backing completely off the throttle several hundred yards before the approach to the Mulsanne hairpin and virtually coasting into the braking area. This technique saved the brakes, but the resulting increase in the car's recorded lap times during practice led to speculation within the Ford team that Gurney and Foyt, in an effort to compromise on chassis settings, had hopelessly "dialed out" their car. The car proved to be fastest in a straight line that year, thanks to its streamlined aerodynamics, achieving 212&amp;nbsp;mph on the 3.6-mile [[Mulsanne Straight]].

The Mk. IV ran in only two races, the [[1967 12 Hours of Sebring]] and the [[1967 24 Hours of Le Mans]] and won both events. Only one Mk.IV was completed for Sebring; the pressure from Ford had been amped up considerably after Ford's humiliation at Daytona two months earlier. [[Mario Andretti]] and [[Bruce McLaren]] won Sebring, [[Dan Gurney]] and [[A. J. Foyt]] won Le Mans (Gurney and Foyt's car was the Mk.IV that was apparently least likely to win), where the Ford-representing Shelby-American and Holman &amp; Moody teams showed up to Le Mans with 2 Mk.IV's each.&lt;ref name="supercars.net" /&gt; The installation of the roll cage was ultimately credited by many with saving the life of Andretti, who crashed violently at the Esses during the 1967 Le Mans 24 Hours, but escaped with minor injuries.

Unlike the earlier Mk.I - III cars, which were built in England, the Mk.IVs were built in the United States by Kar Kraft. Le Mans 1967 remains the only all-American victory in Le Mans history—American drivers, team, chassis, engine, and tires. A total of six Mk IVs were constructed.&lt;ref name=isr /&gt; One of the Mk IVs was rebuilt to the [[Ford G7]] in 1968, and used in the Can-Am series for 1969 and 1970, but with no success. This car is sometimes called the ''Ford Mk.IV''.&lt;ref name=isr /&gt;

;MkV
For years Peter Thorp had searched for a GT40 in good condition. Most of the cars had problems including the dreaded rust issue. His company, Safir Engineering, was building and fielding [[Formula 3]] race cars, in addition, had a Token Formula One car purchased from the [[Ron Dennis]] Company, Rondell Racing. Formula One events in which Safir Engineering competed included [[Brands Hatch]] and [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]]. Safir was also redesigning [[Range Rover]]s modifying the unit to six-wheel drive and exporting them. Safir technical capabilities were such that they could rebuild GT40s. It was with this in mind that Thorp approached John Willment for his thoughts. It was soon decided that there would be a limited, further run of the significant GT40. JW Engineering would oversee the build, and Safir was to do the work. The continued JW Engineering/Safir Engineering production would utilize sequential serial numbers starting at the last used GT40 serial number and move forward. Maintaining the GT40 Mark nomenclature, this continued production would be named GT40 MkV.

JW Engineering wished to complete the GT40 chassis numbers GT40P-1087, 1088 and 1089. This was supposed to take place prior to the beginning of Safir production, however, the completion of these three chassis’ was very much delayed.

Ford's Len Bailey was hired to inspect the proposed build and engineer any changes he thought prudent to ensure the car was safe, as well as minimize problems experienced in the past. Baily changed the front suspension to [[Alan Mann Racing|Alan Mann]] specifications, which minimized nose-dive under braking. Zinc coated steel replaced the previous uncoated rust-prone sheet metal. The vulnerable drive donuts were replaced with CV joints and the leak-prone rubber gas tanks were replaced with aluminum tanks. The GT40 chassis was upgraded without making any major changes.

Tennant Panels supplied the roof structure and the balance of the chassis was completed by Safir. Bill Pink, noted for his electrical experience and the wiring installation of previous GT40s, was brought in. Also, Jim Rose was hired for his experience with working at both Alan Mann and Shelby. After the manufacture of chassis 1120, John Etheridge was hired to manage the GT40 build. The chassis was supplied from Adams McCall Engineering and parts supplied from Tennant panels.

For the most part, the MkV resembled very closely the MkI car, although there were a few changes, and, as with the 60s production, very few cars were identical.

The first car, GT40P-1090, had an open-top in place of roofed doors. Most motors were Ford small block, Webers or 4 Barrel Carburetor. Safir produced five Big Block GT40s, serial numbers GT40P-1128 to GT40P-1132. These aluminum big block cars all had easily removable door roof sections. Most GT40s were high-performance street cars however some of the MkV production can be described as full race. Two road cars GT40P-1133 (roadster) and GT40P-1142 (roofed doors) were built as lightweights which included an aluminum honeycomb chassis and carbon fiber bodywork.

Several [[kit car]]s and replicas inspired by the Ford GT40 have been built. They are generally intended for assembly by the customer in a home workshop or garage. There are two alternatives to the [[kit car]] approach, either [[Continuation car|continuation]] models (exact and licensed replicas true to the original GT40) or [[modernization]]s (replicas with upgraded components, ergonomics &amp; trim for improved usability, drivability, and performance).

At the 1995 [[North American International Auto Show]], the [[Ford GT90]] concept was shown and at the 2002 show, a new GT40 Concept was unveiled by Ford.

[[File:2005 Ford GT.jpg|thumb|left|2005 [[Ford GT]] ]]
While similar in appearance to the original cars, it was bigger, wider, and 3 inches (76&amp;nbsp;mm) taller than the original 40&amp;nbsp;inches (1020&amp;nbsp;mm). Three production prototype cars were shown in 2003 as part of Ford's centenary, and delivery of the production Ford GT began in the fall of 2004. The Ford GT was assembled in the Ford Wixom plant and painted by [[Saleen|Saleen, Incorporated]] at their [[Saleen Special Vehicles]] plant in [[Troy, Michigan]].

A British company, [[Safir Engineering]], who continued to produce a limited number of GT40s (the '''MkV''') in the 1980s under an agreement with Walter Hayes of Ford and John Wilmont of J.W. Automotive Engineering, owned the GT40 trademark at that time, and when they completed production, they sold the excess parts, tooling, design, and trademark to a small American company called '''Safir GT40 Spares, Limited''' based in [[Ohio]]. Safir GT40 Spares licensed the use of the GT40 trademark to Ford for the initial 2002 show car, but when Ford decided to make the production vehicle, negotiations between the two failed, and as a result, the new Ford GT does not wear the badge GT40. Bob Wood, one of three partners who own Safir GT40 Spares, said: "When we talked with Ford, they asked what we wanted. We said that Ford owns Beanstalk in New York, the company that licenses the Blue Oval for Ford on such things as T-shirts. Since Beanstalk gets 7.5 percent of the retail cost of the item for licensing the name, we suggested 7.5 percent on each GT40 sold."&lt;ref name="Nixed"&gt;{{Cite news|title=A GT by any other name is nixed by Ford|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|location=Chicago|date=31 October 2003|first=Jim|last=Mateja|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-119462642.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924100216/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-119462642.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 September 2015|accessdate=23 June 2014}} {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this instance, Ford wished to purchase, not just license the GT40 trademark. At the then-estimated $125,000 per copy, 7.5% of 4,500 vehicles would have totalled approximately $42,187,500.&lt;ref name="Nixed" /&gt; It was widely and erroneously reported following an ''Automotive News Weekly'' story that Safir "demanded" the $40 million for the sale of the trademark. Discussions between Safir and Ford ensued. However, in fact, the Ford Motor Company never made an offer in writing to purchase the famed GT40 trademark. Later models or prototypes have also been called the Ford GT but have had different numbering on them such as the Ford GT90 or the Ford GT70. The GT40 name and trademark is currently licensed to Superformance in the USA.

A second-generation Ford GT was unveiled at the 2015 [[North American International Auto Show]]. It features a 3.5L twin-turbocharged V6 engine, carbon fiber monocoque and body panels, pushrod suspension and active aerodynamics. It [[Ford GT#2016 Ford GT Race Program|entered the 2016 season]] of the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]] and the [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship|United SportsCar Championship]], and started being sold in a street-legal version at Ford dealerships in 2017.

The '''Ford Focus (third generation)''', also known as the [[Ford Focus|Focus]] '''Mk III''', (Code name: C346) debuted at the [[North American International Auto Show#2010|2010 North American International Auto Show]] as a 2012 model. The cars shown were a 4-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]] and 5-door [[hatchback]], also debuting a new 2.0L [[Fuel injection#Direct injection|direct injection]] I4 engine. A 5-door estate (wagon) was previewed at the Geneva auto show a month later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=33304 |title=Exciting New Next-Generation Ford Focus Gears Up For Launch &amp;#124; Ford Motor Company Newsroom |publisher=Media.ford.com |accessdate=June 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006104752/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=33304 |archivedate=October 6, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This generation of Focus would be the first [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] vehicle designed under the tenure of CEO [[Alan Mulally]] and his "One Ford" plan, which aimed to leverage Ford's global resources into creating more competitive vehicles that could be sold globally in each segment with minimal changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ford Focus chief quits |url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/ford-focus-chief-quits |accessdate=June 30, 2015 |work=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "One Ford" plan would reunite the North American and global Focus line. The [[Ford Focus (second generation, North America)|previous North American version]] was thus discontinued, and the new model was launched simultaneously in North America and Europe on March 2, 2011, both having started production near the end of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20100118/DETROIT/100119915 |title=Detroit auto show: 2012 Ford Focus, most significant by AW Editors' Choice Awards |publisher=Autoweek.com |date=January 18, 2010 |accessdate=November 29, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121171755/http://www.autoweek.com/article/20100118/DETROIT/100119915 |archivedate=January 21, 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=31755 |title=DYNAMIC NEXT-GENERATION FORD FOCUS DEBUTS |date=January 11, 2009 |accessdate=January 11, 2010 |publisher=[[Ford Motor Company]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118065808/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=31755 |archivedate=November 18, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Production in Asia, Africa, and South America followed later.

Ford debuted the all-electric Ford Focus Electric at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in 2011 to compete with the [[Nissan Leaf]] and the [[Chevrolet Volt]] and announced the [[hot hatch]] ST model at the [[Paris Motor Show]] in September 2010.

The Ford Focus was the best-selling car in the world for 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://editorial.autos.msn.com/blogs/autosblogpost.aspx?post=619afc64-1886-4110-a3f0-a1df03b47726 James Tate, Ford Focus is best-selling model worldwide in 2012, editorial.autos.msn.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412024912/http://editorial.autos.msn.com/blogs/autosblogpost.aspx?post=619afc64-1886-4110-a3f0-a1df03b47726 |date=April 12, 2013 }}. Retrieved April 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
The design was built on Ford's [[Kinetic Design]]. The lights at the front have a different shape. The trapezoidal grille has triangular features. At the rear, the hatchback tail lights are positioned lower, similar to the [[Ford Fiesta]]. The interior has been changed from the second generation in the NA and International versions. Ford wanted to make the Focus more upmarket so it offers two types of central consoles: the basic is associated with smaller engines and the premium is available to more powerful engines.

This generation of Focus incorporated a redesigned cabin, changed materials, and a new "infotainment" system. Following the industry trend towards decontenting, and in keeping with the sedan's downmarket "economy car" image vs. the "premium" hatchback, the earlier sedan's space-saving gas strut trunk hinges are replaced with cheaper, intrusive goose neck hinges. The Focus also has Ford's patented capless fuel tank, which doesn't require a cap to prevent [[siphon]]ing.

== Production ==

The Focus is being promoted as a global car,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Campaign Tactics: Ford Focus Global Launch |url=http://www.brandchannel.com/home/post/2011/02/25/Ford-Focus-Global-Launch.aspx |work=Brand Channel |accessdate=July 10, 2012 |date=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; built in several different factories around the world, with changes to engine line-ups and trim levels to suit regional markets and regulations.

== Transmission reliability issues ==

Along with the Ford Fiesta, the Focus equipped with the Ford DPS6 PowerShift transmission has received much criticism due to transmission shuddering, including several lemon law claims.&lt;ref name="WTAE"&gt;{{cite news |last=Van Osdol |first=Paul |date=February 6, 2014 |url=http://www.wtae.com/investigations/investigation-finds-hundreds-of-complaints-about-ford-transmissions/24333878 |title=Investigation finds hundreds of complaints about Ford transmissions |publisher=WTAE-TV |accessdate=March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue is due to the dry type clutches associated with gasoline models. Ford's current response is to replace the clutch pack assembly (with updated parts) when shuddering exceeds 250&amp;nbsp;rpm (upon customer complaint). 

There have been at least 6 revisions of clutch packs and transmission control modules since inception. Newer clutch packs and transmissions are more resistant to wear and fluid contamination, as the source of many shudder issues involved an improperly installed seal which was leaking transmission fluid onto the dry clutches.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.focusfanatics.com/forum/mk3-tsb-recall-problems-archive/695105-14m01-now-new-clutches-avail.html|title=14M01 - now with new clutches avail.. - Ford Focus Forum, Ford Focus ST Forum, Ford Focus RS Forum|website=www.focusfanatics.com|language=en|access-date=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford also claims there are "Changes to the clutch material for better performance across temperature ranges (new for 2016)."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some consumer complaints are due to the normal operating characteristics of the transmission, because the DPS6 does not contain a torque converter fluid coupling and does not behave similarly to traditional torque converter transmissions, instead sharing some characteristics found in traditional manual transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;https://az25411.vo.msecnd.net/pdf/6/602_basic_br_verb_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== North American market ==
Like in most other non-European markets, only the 4-door sedan and 5-door hatchback are offered in the United States and Canada. The EPA rated fuel economy at 28 city/38 hwy MPG for the 6-speed automatic, and 26 city/ 36 hwy MPG for the [[Manual transmission|5-speed manual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.cars.com/kickingtires/2011/03/my-entry.html |title=2012 Ford Focus to Get 38 MPG |publisher=cars.com |date=March 2, 2011 |accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SFE package, which can only be added to the sedan SE trim with [[PowerShift]] [[semi-automatic transmission|semi-automatic]] [[dual-clutch transmission]], improves highway fuel economy to 40 MPG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.cars.com/kickingtires/2011/02/2012-ford-focus-sfe-gets-2840-mpg-rating.html |title=2012 Ford Focus SFE Gets 28/40 MPG Rating |publisher=cars.com |date=February 25, 2011 |accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform that the new Focus is based on is 25% stronger than the previous North American version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.automoblog.net/2010/09/17/focused-on-more-gusto-the-2012-ford-focus-st/ |title=Focused on More Gusto: The 2012 Ford Focus ST |publisher=Automoblog.net |date=September 17, 2010 |accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Engine lineup in North America ===
The Focus was launched with only one engine option, a 2.0-litre [[Mazda L engine#2.0 L (LF-DE, LF-VE, LF-VD)|Duratec 20]] [[gasoline direct injection|direct injected]], [[Variable Cam Timing#Ti-VCT|Ti-VCT]] [[Inline-four engine|4-cylinder]], producing {{convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Mid-2012, [[Flexible-fuel Vehicle|Flex Fuel]] capability was added.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=33438 |title=ALL-NEW FORD FOCUS ACHIEVES FUEL EFFICIENCY WITH HIGH-TECH 2.0-LITER DIRECT-INJECTION I-4 ENGINE &amp;#124; Ford Motor Company Newsroom |publisher=Media.ford.com |date=October 20, 2010 |accessdate=November 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221220234/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=33438 |archive-date=December 21, 2010 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; except for states in the [[United States]] that adhere to [[partial zero-emissions vehicle]] regulations. The engine is a derivative of the port fuel-injected 2.0-liter engine in the previous generation Focus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insideline.com/ford/focus/2012/20-liters-is-now-a-large-engine-at-ford.html 2.0-Liters Is Now a "Large" Engine at Ford March 24, 2011 Insideline&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2012, the range was joined by the Focus ST, with a turbocharged 2.0-litre producing {{convert|252|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} (available only with a manual transmission).

For the 2015 refresh, the EcoBoost 1.0 litre three-cylinder began to be offered in North America as an extra-cost option for SE trim level.

2016 model added 2.3 litre  EcoBoost for the new  RS trim level

=== Running changes ===
Color choices were restricted during summer 2011, due to supply issues caused by the 2011 Japanese earthquake/tsunami. When black and dark blue returned they were replaced by different shades, although the phaseout of Kona Blue in favor of Sonic Blue had been planned.

In January 2012, Ford announced that the formerly automatic-only Titanium model would be offered with a manual transmission. In March 2012, Ford revised the ordering guide for the Titanium models to also have a [[MyFord Touch]] delete option, replacing it with the non-touch version of MyFord. Although MyFord Touch is an $995 option on SEL models and the PowerShift automatic a $1095 option on S and SE, no discount is applied to either manual or non-Touch Titanium models.

2013 model year changes for non-STs are; SE models gain standard SYNC and alloy wheels, the SEL trim is discontinued in favor of an "SE Appearance package" that includes most of the SEL features but with standard trim choices limited to black leather, while Titanium models also pick up standard leather upholstery and lost the auto-dimming rearview mirror and rain-sensing windshield wipers. All now come standard with the 5-speed manual leaving the SFE pack as the last remaining automatic-only Focus (apart from the direct-drive electric), and color choices are rearranged.

=== Reliability issues ===
Along with the Ford Fiesta, the Focus equipped with the Ford PowerShift transmission has received much criticism due to transmission shuddering, including several [[lemon law]] claims.&lt;ref name="WTAE"/&gt; The issue is due to the dry type clutches associated with petrol models. Ford's current response is to replace the clutch pack assembly (with updated parts) when shuddering exceeds 250&amp;nbsp;rpm (upon customer complaint).

Ford claims that the transmission, a semi-automatic transmission, is designed to improve fuel economy and has issued several software upgrades for the transmission. To date, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not required Ford to issue a recall, nor has Ford done so voluntarily. Focus models equipped with the conventional manual transmission have not been affected by the reliability issues.&lt;ref name="WTAE"/&gt;

== European market ==

The UK range is available in hatchback and estate (wagon) in a large number of trim variants including. Most other European countries, including the Republic of Ireland, also include the four-door saloon, unlike Britain, as previous generation sales did not sell as well in comparison with the hatchback and estate.

=== Engine lineup in Europe ===
* '''1.0 litre [[Ford EcoBoost engine|EcoBoost]]''': this three-cylinder turbocharged engine is produced in two variants, producing {{convert|100|and|125|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. It replaced the 1.6-litre Ti-VCT Duratec in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.ford.com/news/allnewfuelefficient10litrefordEcoBoostenginetodebutineuropeanfocusrange.htm |title=Ford introduce 1.0&amp;nbsp;L EcoBoost in Frankfurt |publisher=media.ford.com |date=September 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008060211/http://media.ford.com/news/allnewfuelefficient10litrefordEcoBoostenginetodebutineuropeanfocusrange.htm |archivedate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1.6-litre [[Ford Sigma engine|Duratec]] Ti-VCT''': this engine is an updated version of the same engine from the [[Ford Focus (second generation, Europe)|previous model]], with improved intake and exhaust manifolds. The improvements also mean that the engine has been updated to [[European emission standards#Toxic emission: stages and legal framework|Euro 5 and Euro 6 emissions standards]]. The 1.6-litre Ti-VCT is available in three versions, {{convert|85|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, {{convert|105|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|125|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. Torque figures are {{convert|141|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}}, {{convert|150|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|159|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}}, respectively.
* '''1.5-litre [[Ford EcoBoost engine|EcoBoost]]''': this engine came with the [[Ford Durashift|Durashift]] B6 manual transmission. It was available with {{convert|150|or|182|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, both versions produced {{convert|240|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} of torque along with {{convert|270|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} with the overboost function. The {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}} engine is rated for {{convert|0|to|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 7.6&amp;nbsp;seconds while the {{convert|182|hp|kW|abbr=on}} completed it in 7.1&amp;nbsp;seconds. The 1.6-litre engine was replaced by the 1.5-litre engine in 2015.
* '''1.6-litre [[Ford Duratorq engine|Duratorq]]''': just like the petrol ''Duratec'', the diesel is upgraded for emissions and economy. This engine has eight valves instead of 16 on the previous model. The basic version produces {{convert|95|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|230|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}}, while the top-of-the-range version generates {{convert|115|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|270|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} with {{convert|285|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} in the overboost function. For the Focus Econetic model, the engine produces {{convert|105|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.
* '''2.0-litre [[Ford Duratorq engine|Duratorq]]''': top of the range diesel engine is highly updated and available with [[Ford PowerShift transmission]], it comes in two versions, {{convert|150|and|185|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, which produce {{convert|370|and|400|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} of torque, respectively.

===Safety and recall===
In 2017, Ford recalled Ford Focus with 1.6 EcoBoost engines because of a risk of engine fires caused by a “lack of coolant circulation”. There were 29 fires related to the engine in the U.S. and Canada reported to Ford. The recall partly contributed to a charge of US$300 million by Ford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lynch|first1=Jim|title=Ford recalls 230,000 cars over potential engine fires|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2017/03/29/ford-recall/99771750/|accessdate=April 1, 2017|work=The Detroit News|date=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krisher|first1=Tom|title=Ford recalls 570,000 vehicles for engine fire risk, door latch trouble|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/ford-recalls-570000-vehicles-for-engine-fire-risk-door-latch-trouble/article34471584/|accessdate=April 1, 2017|work=The Globe and Mail|agency=AP|date=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ford Focus mid-cycle facelift (Mk 3.5) was shown at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show, and features a raft of changes made to both the exterior, interior and engine line up.

Revisions made to the body were thinner and sharper headlights, a new trapezoidal grille, giving the front more sporting intent than the previous model. The new front end is similar to that of the [[Ford Mondeo (fourth generation)|2014 Mondeo]] as well as the facelifted [[Ford Fiesta|2013 Fiesta]], while also inspired by the 2011 [[Ford Evos]] concept as well as various [[Aston Martin]] vehicles. (Ford owns an 8% interest in Aston Martin.) The [[Ford C-Max|2015 facelifted Ford C-Max and Grand C-Max]], [[Ford S-Max|the 2015 S-Max]] and [[Ford Galaxy|Galaxy]], have also incorporated the new family face. On Titanium and Titanium X the grille is chrome, and on other versions it is black mesh. The ST features a Black honeycomb grille. The front fog-lights were also changed. At the rear on the hatchback, the rear lights were changed, so that they appear sharper, and less clumsy. The estate and saloon, (saloon is not available in Britain), also had subtle revisions to their rears too.

Inside, the multitude of buttons on the dashboard were been removed, and replaced by an all-new eight-inch touchscreen. The quality of plastics improved, and the steering wheel was changed to a three-spoke. Trim levels in the UK consist of Studio, Style (instead of [[Ford Edge|Edge]] due to the [[Ford Mondeo]] based SUV), Zetec, Zetec S (including special Red and Black editions) - later replaced in 2016 by Zetec Edition, ST-Line (and later ST Line X), Titanium, Titanium X and ST. Trim levels in Europe are similar to the pre-facelift model including Ambiente, Trend, Trend +, Titanium and ST. The new 1.5 TDCi Duratorq diesel (95 and 120&amp;nbsp;hp) and 1.5 EcoBoost (150 and 180&amp;nbsp;hp) has been added to the line-up. The 2.0 TDCi Duratorq diesel has been updated to produce 150 and 185&amp;nbsp;hp.

The new third-generation RS model went on sale in 2016, with pricing from around £31,000 and the new 2.3 EcoBoost from the [[Ford Mustang]], but updated to produce 350&amp;nbsp;hp. It was revealed in the production variant at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show, and featured at the 2015 Goodwood Festival of Speed.

Mechanical improvements to the facelifted [[Ford Focus]] are chassis revisions to all versions, to make the car more planted on the road, and the steering is also sharper than the pre-facelift model, while also offering greater feedback for greater driving pleasure and fun, which has been the trademark of the Focus since it launched back in 1998.

=== Engine lineup in Europe ===

==== 1.0 litre EcoBoost ====
Award-winning three-cylinder engine is produced in two variants, with {{convert|100|and(-)|125|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|138|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}

==== 1.6-litre Duratec Ti-VCT ====
This engine - an updated version of the same engine from the previous model, allowing it to breathe better with improved intake and exhaust manifolds. The improvements also mean that the engine has been updated to EU5 norms (from 2015 - EU6 norms). From 2014, the 1.6 Ti-VCT was available in three versions: {{convert|85|hp|abbr=on}}, {{convert|105|and(-)|125|hp|abbr=on}}, but in some European markets also as {{convert|86|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} with factory LPG (i.e.: German market - as 1.6 LPG Bivalenten Autogasmotor/ English: BiFuel LPG Engine). It was discontinued in 2016.

==== 1.5-litre EcoBoost ====
This all-new engine replaces the 1.6-litre EcoBoost with the same power, but with improved economy. The engine comes equipped with either Ford-Getrag's Durashift B6 manual gearbox or with a new Torque Converter automatic (6F35) available on the Focus for the first time. In the Focus it is available with {{convert|177|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|240|Nm|lb·ft|0|abbr=on}} of torque, the only engine on offer in the Australian Trend, Sport and Titanium models.

==== 2.0 litre EcoBoost ====
Exclusive to the ST range, this engine continues to produce {{convert|252|hp|abbr=on}}, and is available only with the 6-speed manual, producing {{convert|360|Nm}} of torque.

==== 2.3-litre EcoBoost ====
This all-new engine is already used in the new-generation Ford Mustang, and used by the third-generation Focus RS since 2016 with an output of {{convert|350|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

==== 1.6-litre TDCi Duratorq ====
Just like the petrol Duratec, this diesel engine was upgraded for emissions and economy for the third-generation Focus. It produced {{convert|95|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|230|Nm}} in the basic version and {{convert|115|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|270|Nm}} of torque in the more potent version. For the Focus Econetic model, the engine produced {{convert|105|hp|abbr=on}}. The engine as of 2016 has been replaced by the 1.5-litre TDCi engine

==== 1.5-litre TDCi Duratorq ====
An all-new engine as of 2014, replaces the older 1.6-litre Duratorq diesel (despite running side-by-side for a few years) from 2016, and comes in three variants: {{convert|95|hp|abbr=on}} with {{convert|250|Nm}} of torque, and {{convert|120|hp|abbr=on}} with {{convert|270|Nm}} of torque. An Econetic option is also available, with {{convert|105|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, but tuned for economy rather than performance.

==== 2.0-litre TDCi Duratorq ====
The top of the range diesel engine is highly revised and updated and available with Ford PowerShift transmission, and the 6-speed manual. It now comes in two new versions, {{convert|163|hp|abbr=on}} with {{convert|370|Nm}} of torque and {{convert|185|hp|abbr=on}} with {{convert|400|Nm}} of torque, the latter also available in the ST.

[[File:2017 Ford Focus ST-3 Turbo Estate 2.0.jpg|thumb|right|Ford Focus ST wagon]]

Beginning Summer 2012 (UK)/late 2012 in the US, Ford offered a new performance-oriented [[hot hatch]] Focus ST, as first revealed at the [[2010 Paris Motor Show]] and then at the 2011 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]] when more details were announced, including the availability of an estate(wagon) version for European markets, and the possibility of a [[sports sedan]] version for North American markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/News/Search-Results/First-Official-Pictures/Ford-Focus-ST-2012-at-the-Frankfurt-motor-show/ |title=Ford Focus ST (2012) at the Frankfurt motor show |work=Car Magazine |date=September 12, 2011 |accessdate=November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ST features a new, more aggressive exterior design, including a redesigned front bumper with larger air intakes and grille, larger rear wing, wider side sills, center exit exhaust, and alloy wheels. Inside, the car receives a trio of additional gauges mounted in the dashboard, faux-carbon fiber trim, and sport seats with body colored inserts and stitching. The car will be offered three trim options: ST1, ST2 and ST3; the same three options that were available with the MkII ST.

Differences between the US and European models besides the lack of the wagon model outside Europe and Federally-required amber side reflectors are limited to paint and trim: Euro ST1s get all-cloth Recaro seats while U.S.-spec ST1s use the same seats as the 2012 SE Sport Package; Red seat accents on the Recaro seats are not available on American ST2s; Euro ST3s feature a leather Recaro rear seat setup; The rear headrests are different in each market; Red is the only exterior color included in the base price in Europe while yellow is the only extra-cost color in the U.S.; The optional MyFord Touch system that is fitted to ST2/ST3 models in the U.S. is not offered in Europe; The North American ST utilizes a full-size spare tire while the Euro ST features a mini spare or fix-a-flat setup, depending on what audio system is fitted; The Euro ST offers further options (some grouped in option packages) compared to the North American models including: red brake calipers (standard on all ST trim levels in U.S.), pop-out door guards, heated windshield, lane departure system, and active speed limiter; Headlight washers are fitted to the Euro ST3; Only the ST3 model in the United States features the handbrake, armrest, and cup holder design from the Focus Titanium, while all Euro and Canadian Focus STs have that setup; The Euro Focus ST features a height-adjustable front passenger seat.

The ST will use a {{convert|252|hp|abbr=on}} &amp; {{convert|366|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on}} version of the 4-cylinder 2.0L EcoBoost engine, a gain of 25&amp;nbsp;hp above the previous Focus ST which used a larger 2.5L 5-cylinder engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insideline.com/ford/focus/2012/2012-ford-focus-st-2010-paris-auto-show.html |title=2010 Ford Focus ST – 2010 Paris Auto Show |publisher=Edmunds Insideline |date=September 15, 2010 |accessdate=September 15, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916150725/http://www.insideline.com/ford/focus/2012/2012-ford-focus-st-2010-paris-auto-show.html |archive-date=September 16, 2010 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is resultantly estimated that the ST will reach {{convert|100|km/h}} in 6.1&amp;nbsp;seconds, while its top speed will be {{convert|248|km/h}}. Compared to the previous ST, the new model has the same 0 to 100&amp;nbsp;km/h time and has a 2&amp;nbsp;mph higher top speed.

The ST was featured in the 2012 film ''[[The Sweeney (2012 film)|The Sweeney]]'', a remake of the 1970s TV series of the same name. Ford gave six ST-badged Focuses to the production team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fordstnation.com/top-stories/49-ford-focus-st-lead-car-sweeney-movie-2012-a.html |title=2012 Ford Focus ST To be lead in Sweeney Movie |publisher=Ford ST Nation |date=November 23, 2011 |accessdate=December 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

=== Facelift (2015–2018) ===
[[File:2018 Ford Focus ST-3 TDCi Automatic 2.0.jpg|thumb]]
For the 2015 model year, the ST continued to use the {{convert|252|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 2.0L EcoBoost with a 6-speed manual gearbox in ST1, ST2 and ST3 trims for the European and US markets, and the single ST trim in the Australian market. Updates were made to the front and rear fascias to coincide with the changes implemented in the standard Focus, including the lights, grille, and rear diffuser. The availability of 5-door hatchback and estate (wagon) body styles remained unchanged. For the European markets, a 2.0L TDCi Duratorq Diesel engine was available for the ST with a 6-speed Powershift Automated-Manual gearbox to rival the likes of the [[Volkswagen Golf]] GTD and the [[SEAT León]] FR. The 2.0L Duratorq's rated output is {{convert|182|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|300|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque in the ST. Pricing and badging is the same for petrol and diesel models.

The pickup would compete for the AMBR trophy twice, winning both times, and be withdrawn from the 1960 competition.

The truck would suffer an engine fire in the 1960s and be rebuilt by the [[Alexander Brothers (customizers)|Alexander Brothers]],&lt;ref name="Hot Rods Online" /&gt; and repainted, not in the original pearl white.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Darryl Hollenbeck by Jim Aust, 7 October 2008.

''Ala Kart'' would ultimately be purchased by John Mumford, who had it restored in 2008 by [[Junior Conway]] at Junior's House of Color and [[Bill Ganahl]] at [[Roy Brizio]]'s shop ([[Brizio Street Rods]]) for entry in that year's GNRS; it would lose.&lt;ref name="hotrod1929"&gt;[http://www.hotrod.com/cars/featured/0812rc-1929-ford-roadster-pickup-1949-mercury-coupe/ ''Hot Rod'' Magazine online] (retrieved 23 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ala Kart'' is now on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, MI.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://blog.thehenryford.org/2015/11/george-barris//&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction details ==
''Ala Kart'' began life as a '29 [[Ford Model A (1927–1931)|Ford Model A]] [[pickup truck|pickup]]. The [[chassis]] work was done by long-time friends Peters and "Blackie" Gejeian at their [[Fresno, California]] shop, with the body and styling by Barris (at [[Barris Kustoms]] in [[Los Angeles]]).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Peters, interview by Jim Aust, 7 October 2008.

[http://www.hotrod.com/features/history/stories/0810rc-blackie-gejeian/ ''Hot Rod'' Magazine] online (retrieved 24 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; The frame had a new centrally-located crossmember, and was completely chromed. The front end was also chromed, including a {{convert|4|in|cm|abbr=on}} [[dropped axle]], [[coil spring]]s (not the factory [[leaf spring]]s), split [[Double wishbone suspension|wishbone]]s, [[Panhard rod]], and tube [[shock absorber|shock]]s. 1940 Ford [[drum brake]]s were used. In back, a 1932 Ford rear axle was fitted, along with specially-fabricated coil springs, Panhard rod, all chromed, and Ford drum brakes. All four corners were equipped with Cadillac airbag suspension pieces.&lt;ref name="hotrod2"&gt;Written by Jim Aust, 19 September 2008 [http://www.hotrod.com/news/0809rc-1929-ford-roadster-pickup-ala-kart/ ''Hot Rod'' Magazine online] (retrieved 23 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:'ala kart' kit 1.jpg|thumb|The AMT kit.

The engine was a '54 Dodge {{convert|266|cid|cc|abbr=on}}&lt;!--clarification is needed, here: the WP page says 241 or 270ci; was this bored &amp;/or stroked?--&gt; [[Chrysler Hemi engine#Dodge|Red Ram hemi]] from a Peters' wrecked racing boat.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Peters, interview by Jim Aust, 7 October 2008 [http://www.hotrod.com/cars/featured/0812rc-1929-ford-roadster-pickup-1949-mercury-coupe/ ''Hot Rod'' Magazine online] (retrieved 23 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; It was outfitted with [[Ed Iskendarian|Isky]] cam,&lt;ref name="Hot Rods Online"/&gt; [[Stuart Hilborn|Hilborn]] [[fuel injection]], a [[Scintilla (company)|Scintilla]] Vertex [[magneto]] and [[Sanderson Headers|Sanderson]] custom [[Exhaust manifold|headers]]. It was mated to a '39 Ford transmission with [[Lincoln-Zephyr|Zephyr]] gears through a [[Cragar]] adapter.&lt;ref name="hotrod2"/&gt; Exhaust was routed through four pipes which passed through the rear roll pan.&lt;ref name="hotrod2"/&gt;
[[File:Ala Kart engine view.jpg|left|thumb|''Ala Kart'' engine view (after restoration)]]
The '29's body was given a '27 Ford roadster back section. The stock fenders were reshaped, "peaked and bobbed using half-inch round rod". A new grille shell was fabricated from steel and filled with clear plastic tubing; it was given a forward rake. A three-piece hood was made created from aluminum, while [[louver]]ed steel splash aprons were mounted. The bed was scratchbuilt from steel, with candy gold inserts (found by Barris at a hardware store&lt;ref name="Hot Rods Online" /&gt;) and chrome strips. The quadruple headlights, vertically stacked in pairs, were from a '57 Chrysler. The front bumper was a pair of [[nerf bars]]. Taillights were '56 DeSoto lenses in '58 [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]] bezels, protected by hairpins. Painted overall in Swedish White Pearl with candy gold scallops, striping was done by master pinstriper [[Dean Jeffries]]&lt;ref name="hotrod2" /&gt; (early in his career).&lt;ref name="Hot Rods Online" /&gt;[[File:'ala kart' pic 2.JPG|thumb|Closeup of the front of the kit. The slant of the headlights here is not apparent in photos of the full-size truck.]]

[[Roy Gilbert]] did the "intricate original upholstery", which was one of ''Ala Kart''{{'}}s outstanding features.&lt;ref name="hotrod2"/&gt; Finished in white pearl [[Naugahyde]] fitted with chrome beads,&lt;ref name="Hot Rods Online"/&gt; plus black [[velvet]] trim inside, the [[tonneau]] had a combination of black and white vinyl, set off with gold piping.&lt;!--too close paraphrase!--&gt; The gauge cluster came from a '57 [[Chevrolet Corvette (C1)|Corvette]] (fitted with Stewart Warner gauges), while the steering wheel was taken from a '57 Lincoln Continental (modified with a gold bullet at the center).&lt;ref name="Hot Rods Online"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hotrod2"/&gt;

''Ala Kart'' rode on  Ford {{convert|15|in|cm|abbr=on}} centers, trimmed and fitted with reversed {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on}} outer rims, which were then chromed. Center bullets in candy gold were mounted, as were whitewall tires (5.60-14 front, 8.00-14 rear).&lt;ref name="hotrod2"/&gt;

== Restoration ==
The 2008 restoration to 100-point status was done by Junior Conway and Bill Ganahl on the exterior at Brizio's, with the interior by long-time ''Ala Kart'' [[Howdy Ledbetter]]. The restoration was meticulous, even preserving the original scalloping.&lt;ref name="hotrod2"/&gt;

That year, ''Ala Kart'' would again be entered in the Oakland Roadster Show. It would lose&lt;ref name="hotrod1929"/&gt; (to Rudy Necoechea's [[1932 Ford|deuce]] roadster, ''Undisputed'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myrideisme.com/Blog/2008-americas-most-beautiful-roadster/ My Ride is Me] (retrieved 24 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
''Ala Kart'' is considered "[o]ne of the coolest full-custom trucks ever built"&lt;ref name="hotrod1"/&gt; (a sentiment widely shared among [[Custom car|customizers]], [[Hot rod|rodder]]s, and fans of both rods and customs) and "more iconic than all the rest."&lt;ref&gt;Bill Ganahl, interviewed by  Jim Aust 7 October 2008.  [http://www.hotrod.com/cars/featured/0812rc-1929-ford-roadster-pickup-1949-mercury-coupe/ ''Hot Rod'' Magazine] online (retrieved 23 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

== In other media ==
''Ala Kart'' was reproduced as a 1/25 [[scale model|scale]] [[model kit]] by [[Aluminum Model Toys|AMT]] in 1961&lt;ref name="hotrod1"/&gt; becoming one of the best-selling kits in history.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Aust interview with George Barris, 7 October 2008.

In addition, it was issued as a [[Hot Wheels]] car.&lt;ref&gt;George Barris, interviewed by Jim Aust 7 October 2008.

''Ala Kart'' also made numerous film appearances, usually in the background of [[drive-in]] shots, before its importance to rodders and customizers was recognized.&lt;ref name="Hot Rod, 12/86, p.29 sidebar"/&gt;

'''''Bronco Buster''''' is an American [[wheelstander]] exhibition [[funny car]] built by [[Doug Nash]].&lt;ref name=Burgess&gt;Burgess, Phil, NHRA National Dragster Editor. “Remembering Doug Nash”, written 24 July 2015, at [http://www.nhra.com/news/2015/remembering-doug-nash NHRA.com] (retrieved 23 May 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nash built ''Bronco Buster'' for [[National Hot Rod Association|NHRA]]'s new A/FX (A/Factory Experimental) class,  a precursor to [[Funny Car]],&lt;ref&gt;McClurg, Bob.  "50 Years of Funny Cars:  Part 2" in ''Drag Racer'', November 2016, pp.&amp;nbsp;35–50.&lt;/ref&gt; which debuted in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, p.32 caption.&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on a 1966 [[Ford Bronco]], with a reproduction two-piece body, fitted over an aluminum tube chassis; the cab, hood, and front fenders came off in one piece for easy maintenance.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;

It was powered by the same {{convert|289|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford Windsor engine#289|Ford V8]] Nash used in his previous B/FX car.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt; (It is rumored Nash turned down a [[Overhead camshaft#Single overhead camshaft|SOHC]] [[Ford FE engine#427 SOHC "Cammer"|427 “cammer”]] so he could keep the four-speed [[Transmission (mechanics)|manual transmission]], instead of switching to a [[Ford C4 transmission|C4]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]].)&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt; Published reports put ''Bronco Buster''{{'}}s weight at {{convert|1700|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, but it may have been as little as {{convert|1400|lb|kg|abbr=on}}; Nash's target was {{convert|1200|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt; The 289 was kept mostly stock, beyond O-rings and a cast aluminum girdle, but it propelled the truck to passes in the high 8s; with a [[Supercharging|supercharger]], later in 1966, Nash turned in passes in the 8.30 second range with speeds around {{convert|180|mph|abbr=on}}, and only difficulties with keeping the truck running in a straight line prevented even lower e.t.s.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;

''Bronco Buster'' was popular on the [[match racing]] circuit, until NHRA banned aluminum chassis (in favor of steel) and Jeep and pickup bodies,&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt; following the success of [[Gene Conway]] in the [[Chrysler Hemi engine|hemi]] Jeep funny car [[Destroyer (funny car)|''Destroyer'']],&lt;ref&gt;McClurg, Bob.  "50 Years of Funny Cars:  Part 2" in ''Drag Racer'', November 2016, p.40 caption.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1967.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;

''Bronco Buster'' was the [[centerfold]] in [[Drag Strip Magazine|''Drag Strip'']]'s  February 1967 issue, as well as appearing on the cover in an [[inset photo]].&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;

The '''Ford Quadricycle''' was the first vehicle developed by [[Henry Ford]]. Ford's first car was a simple frame with a gas-powered engine and four bicycle wheels mounted on it.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

The earliest cars were hand built, one by one, and very expensive. The peculiar machines were seen as toys for the rich.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book |title=Crazy Cars |last=Doeden |first=Matt |year=2007 |publisher=Lerner Publications |isbn= 978-0-8225-6565-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Nzvq_4WqIjQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=quadricycle+ford&amp;ots=uzqmRIUD-D&amp;sig=0qmQCUnGkdmFpU_AGOCrTSOJB5M#v=onepage&amp;q=quadricycle%20ford&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1890s, the "horseless carriage" was a relatively new idea, with no one having a fixed, universal idea of what a car should look like or how it should work. Most of the first car builders were inventors, rather than businessmen, working with their imaginations and the parts they had on hand.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;  Thus, the invention of the Quadricycle marks an important innovation as a proto-automobile that would lay the foundation for the future, with more practical designs to follow.

On June 4, 1896 in a tiny workshop behind his home on 58 Bagley Avenue, Detroit,&lt;ref name="Clymer"&gt;Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877–1925'' (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hfha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hfha.org/ford-timeline/|publisher=hfha.org|title=Henry Ford Story Timeline - Henry Ford Heritage Association|accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the [[Michigan Building]] now stands, Ford put the finishing touches on his pure ethanol-powered motor. After more than two years of experimentation, Ford, at the age of 32, had completed his first experimental [[automobile]]. He dubbed his creation the "Quadricycle," so named because it ran on four bicycle tires, and because of the means through which the engine drove the back wheels.&lt;ref name="Brinkley"&gt;Brinkley, David, ''Wheels for the World: Henry Ford, His Company, and a Century of Progress'', (New York: Penguin Group, 2003), p.22&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the little vehicle led to the founding of the [[Henry Ford Company]] and then later the [[Ford Motor Company]] in 1903.&lt;ref name="hfmgv"&gt;[http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/showroom/1896/quad.html The Showroom of Automotive History: 1896 Quadricycle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615125140/http://hfmgv.org/exhibits/showroom/1896/quad.html |date=2010-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two cylinder engine could produce 4 horsepower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://remarkablecars.com/wiki/index.php/1896_Ford_Quadricycle 1896 Ford Quadricycle] RemarkableCars.com&lt;/ref&gt; The  Quadricycle was driven by a chain. The [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] had only two gears (first for {{convert|10|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, 2nd for {{convert|20|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}), but did not have a reverse gear. The [[tiller]]-steered machine had wire wheels and a {{convert|3|usgal|L|abbr=on}} fuel tank under the seat.&lt;ref name="Clymer"/&gt; Ford test drove it on June 4, 1896, after various test drives, achieving a top speed of {{convert|20|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Clymer"/&gt; Ford would later go on to found the Ford Motor Company and become one of the world's richest men.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

Today the original Quadricycle resides at [[The Henry Ford|The Henry Ford Museum]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]], Michigan.

The '''Ford B-series''' is a bus chassis that was manufactured by the [[Ford Motor Company]].  Produced across six generations from 1948 to 1998, the B-series was a variant of the [[Ford F-series (medium duty truck)|medium-duty Ford F-Series]].  As a cowled-chassis design, the B-series was a bare chassis aft of the firewall, intended for bodywork from a [[Second stage manufacturer|second-stage manufacturer]].  While primarily used for [[school bus]] applications in the United States and Canada, the chassis was exported worldwide to manufacturers to construct bus bodies for various uses.

Prior to 1969, Lincoln-Mercury dealers in Canada marketed the B-series as part of the [[Mercury M-series]] truck line.  At the time, rural Canadian communities were serviced by either a Ford or a Lincoln-Mercury dealer network, but not both networks concurrently.  

Coinciding with the late 1996 sale of the [[Ford L-Series|Louisville/AeroMax heavy-truck line]] to [[Freightliner Trucks|Freightliner]], Ford phased out the medium-duty F-Series and the B-Series following the 1998 model year.  For 2000, Ford re-entered the medium-duty segment with the F-650/F-750 Super Duty.  As of the 2019 model year, Ford has not developed a cowled-chassis derivative of the F-Series, instead concentrating on  [[Cutaway van chassis|cutaway chassis vehicles]].  In the cowled-chassis segment, the role and market share of the B-series was largely superseded by the [[Freightliner FS-65]] (introduced in late 1997).  

==Series overview==
For 1948, the B-Series (B=bus) was introduced as a variant of the all-new [[Ford F-series]] truck line, designed as a cowled chassis variant of the [[Ford F series first generation|F-5 and F-6]] (1 ½ and 2-ton) medium-duty conventional.  For 1953, the B-series shifted to a 3-digit model nomenclature that remains in use by Ford today.  Subsequently, Ford sold the B-600, B-700, and B-800 (prior to 1991, diesel-powered versions were badged with an extra "0").  

For its entire 50-year production run, the B-series paralleled the medium-duty F-series in its development.  Before 1967, the medium-duty F-Series shared its front bodywork with F-Series pickup trucks; from 1967, medium-duty trucks were given wider front axles and their own front bodywork, with the B-Series cowl shared entirely from medium-duty trucks.   One further generation was produced, introduced in 1980 (with a minor update in 1995).

==First generation (1948-1952)==
[[File:EM-ford-f-8-1948-1.jpg|thumb|1948–1951 B series located in Israel|alt=]]
For 1948, as Ford introduced the Ford F-series as its first dedicated truck platform, the B-series made its debut.  Based on the medium-duty [[Ford F series first generation|F-5 and F-6]] (1½ and 2-ton), the B series was slotted between the pickup trucks and the "Big Job" conventionals.  In 1951, the grille trim was redesigned, with the horizontal grille bars replaced by wider-spread vertical ones.

Sharing the engines with the F-5 and F6, a 95hp 226 inline 6 was standard, with a 100hp Flathead V8 and a 110hp 254 inline-six as options.

==Second generation (1953-1956)==
In 1953, Ford celebrated their 50th anniversary and the B series saw a redesign with new B-"00" designations added to the name.  The redesign implemented a set back front axle that made the front look nose heavy, but allowed for a tighter turning radius. The hood was also longer and flowed into the fenders. The grille was still horizontal, but was two bars as opposed to the one large one in the previous model. 1954 buses received a refreshed grille and a new OHV V8 engine option to replace the old 239 Flathead V8. The 1956 buses got a new wraparound windshield and restyled dashboards as well as a new grille that was similar to the 1953 model year.

[[File:NORTHERN CALIFORNIA - NARA - 543026.jpg|thumb|1958–1960 Ford-chassis school bus in California]]

In 1957 the B series got a redesigned front end and a new dash area. The front hood was now flush with the fenders creating a more boxy look. The 1958 models saw a new grille and quad headlamps along with new circular gages.

==Fourth generation (1961–1966)==
[[File:FORD-B-SERIES-1961.jpg|thumb|1961 Ford B Series with new designed front grill]]

The B series was redesigned for 1961 offering a new horizontal grille and fenders that were flared just above the front wheel to allow for larger wheels. The new chassis and front fascia made the truck look lower and wider than previous years. The quad head lamps were replaced with single lights integrated into the grille. The frame and suspension were also redesigned to be tougher than before. This generation of B series would be the last to utilize the same front fascia as light duty Ford trucks.  Both the B series and medium duty F series were to gain their own look.

==Fifth generation (1967–1979)==
[[File:HK Shatin Snoopy Playground School Bus New Town Plaza a.jpg|thumb|right|Early 1970s Ford B series located in Hong Kong]]
Ford completely redesigned both the B series and medium-duty F series and departed from using the same grilles as the lighter duty F-series trucks. The new buses were taller and wider with a large grille utilizing much of the space of the front fascia. The new grille was rectangular with the single headlights being placed very near the far ends of the grille.  The fenders were even more flared than before to allow for a wider track and larger wheels and tires needed to make the necessary gain in GVW to remain competitive.  This generation was also the first to receive the option of a diesel engine in place of the strictly gasoline lineup in the past.  An extra "0" was added to the series notation on diesel models.  After 1968, the Mercury-branded version of the B series was discontinued in the Canadian market.  For 1973, the grille was updated with longer teardrops around the headlights and F O R D block lettering appeared on the front of the hood just above the grille.

== Sixth generation (1980-1998) ==

===1980–1994===
[[File:1980sThomasFordFront.jpg|thumb|right|1980–1994 B-series Diesel located in the UK]]
In 1980, Ford redesigned the F series medium-duty trucks and B series to look more like their heavy duty siblings.  They were an all new design implementing styling cues from the [[Ford L-Series Trucks|Louisville]] line of trucks.  Although the medium duty F series had the revised interior from the lighter duty trucks, the B series carried over the dashboard from the previous generation. To complement the new design there was a new set of gasoline and diesel engines that became available starting in 1980 and more in 1983. In 1985, Ford took out the "F-O-R-D" lettering in the center of the grille and replaced it with a larger version of the blue-oval logo being phased in on most Ford vehicles starting in 1982.  For the most part during the 1980s the B series saw minimal changes in design.  This version of the B series is available with two different hood designs: a rear-hinged hood and a tilt-forward hood.  During the mid-1980s, the rear-hinged hood was discontinued as the tilt-forward hood improved engine access and it was a design that had been adopted by Ford's competitors.

[[File:Blue Bird IMG 9720.JPG|thumb|right|1997 Ford B series located in Alabama, USA.]]
In 1995, Ford updated the hood on the medium-duty F series to a more aerodynamic design.  For the B series swan song, the chassis stayed the same but the new aerodynamic cowl was applied.  Inside, the 1980s instrument panel and steering column were retained, although a tilt steering wheel became an option.  Buses with this option are distinguished by their Navistar-sourced steering wheels.  This generation became the first of the B series to be powered exclusively by diesel engines; their increasing popularity in conventional school buses led to their standardization in 1990, following suit with International (Navistar).

By the end of the 1990s, the number of major school bus manufacturers had dwindled from five to three; faced with potential closure, the remaining manufacturers entered into business agreements with chassis suppliers.  This made it increasingly difficult for Ford to find buyers for the B-series chassis.  This prompted Ford to take a serious look at a possible elimination of the B-series platform or the purchase of their own body manufacturer to guarantee a demand{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.  The answer came as a bombshell in 1998 with the sale of the heavy-duty [[Ford L-Series Trucks|"Louisville"]] truck division to Freightliner, less than a year after the line had been completely redesigned; the final result was the now-defunct [[Sterling Trucks|Sterling]] brand of trucks.  A condition of the sale required an absence of Ford from competing directly against Freightliner for ten years after the contract was signed. As a result, after 50 years, the production run of the B series came to an end.

==Discontinuation==
After a 50-year production run, the 1998 model year marked the end of the Ford B series.  At the time, Ford Motor Company decided to end production of cowled school bus chassis for several reasons.  Alongside the B series, the medium-duty F series was discontinued and replaced by a new model developed in a joint venture with Navistar International; this became the 2000-2015 F-650/F-750 Super Duty.  As part of the late 1996 sale of the Class 8 truck line to the Freightliner subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, a 10-year non-compete agreement stipulated the two companies would not introduce products in direct competition with one another{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}; Ford would be unable to market a replacement for the B series as it would be in competition with the newly developed [[Freightliner FS-65]] (until 2007 at the earliest).  Although developed entirely separate from the sale of the Ford truck line (which created the Sterling brand), the FS-65 would inherit much of the cowled-chassis market share vacated by the B series.

Aside from the sale to Freightliner, the discontinuation of the B series was also heavily influenced by factors affecting school bus body manufacturers.  During the 1990s, the practice of customers choosing cowled chassis separate from the body manufacturer began to fade as body manufacturers, in order to stay competitive, entered into supply agreements or were purchased outright by chassis suppliers.  In 1992, General Motors and [[Blue Bird Corporation]] entered into a 10-year contract to supply the B7 chassis exclusively; other chassis became an extra-cost option.  [[AmTran]] and [[Thomas Built Buses]] were purchased outright in 1995 and 1998 by truck manufacturers Navistar and Freightliner, respectively.  As the GM/Blue Bird contract expired in 2003, Ford sought a supply agreement with the company, leading to a few prototypes based on the all-new [[Ford F-650|F-650 Super Duty]]; it did not lead to a production vehicle.  As a result, Blue Bird designed the Type C [[Blue Bird Vision|Vision]] chassis in-house and once again Ford was left without potential customers for any chassis orders after the non-compete agreement had expired.

As of the 2015 model year, Ford no longer produces a cowled-chassis bus in North America.  Currently, all Ford buses are based on cutaway vehicles, using the [[Ford E-Series|E series]], [[Ford Super Duty|F-450/F-550 Super Duty]], and F-650 Super Duty.  Ford bus chassis are used not only for school buses, but also for shuttle buses, paratransit, and various other commercial uses.

==Body manufacturers==
The B series was widely available and was used by many manufacturers throughout its production run.

The '''Ford E series''' (also known as the '''Ford Econoline''' and '''Ford Club Wagon''' throughout various stages of its production) is a range of [[full-size van]]s produced by the [[United States|America]]n automaker [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] since 1960.  Introduced for the 1961 model year as the replacement for the [[Ford F-series]] [[panel van]], four generations of the model line have been produced. In addition to [[panel van|cargo van]] and [[minivan|passenger van]] body styles, the Ford E-series has been produced as a [[cutaway van chassis]] and stripped chassis (a chassis without bodywork).

From 1980 to its 2015 discontinuation, the E-series van was the best-selling full-size van in the United States, holding a nearly 80% share of the segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110118031634/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=33233|title=Key Milestones in 50-Year History of Ford E-Series, America's Favorite Full-size Van for 31 Years {{!}} Ford Motor Company Newsroom|date=2011-01-18|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=27379|title=Crossovers, Lincoln highlight Ford's 2007 sales performance; further growth expected in 2008|date=January 3, 2009|work=Media.Ford.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525175615/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=27379|archivedate=May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of its final redesign, 95% of sales were to commercial or fleet users, with nearly half of production represented by cargo vans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blueovalnews.com/index.php?categoryid=12&amp;p2_articleid=498|title=Ford Introduces The New 2008 E-Series Van|last=|first=|date=March 7,  2007|website=Blue Oval News|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008202734/http://www.blueovalnews.com/index.php?categoryid=12&amp;p2_articleid=498|archive-date=2007-10-08|access-date=2019-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the 2015 model year, the Ford E-series cargo/passenger vans were replaced in North America by the [[Ford Transit]]; since then, only cutaway and stripped chassis configurations of the E-series are produced.

With a 59-year production run, the E-Series nameplate is outlasted only by the [[Ford F-Series]] (1948-present) in terms of longevity (for a Ford nameplate).  From 1961 to 2005, Ford assembled the model line at [[Lorain Assembly]] ([[Lorain, Ohio]]); subsequent assembly has been located at [[Ohio Assembly]] ([[Avon Lake, Ohio]]).

The first generation of the Ford Econoline made its debut on September 21, 1960. Introduced for the 1961 model year as a cargo van, pickup truck, and a passenger van (Station Bus/Club Wagon), the Econoline began development based on design sketches that were dated 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CbbzCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT69&amp;dq=1961+Ford+Econoline|title=Ford Transit: Fifty Years|last=Lee|first=Peter|publisher=Crowood|year=2015|isbn=9781847978745|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

While introduced alongside the Chevrolet Corvair van for 1961, the Ford Econoline established many design precedents adopted by successive designs of American vans, including the Chevrolet Van and Dodge A100 (and the European Ford Transit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UmxabOGWX7wC&amp;pg=PA72#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Ford Pickup Trucks|last=Statham|first=Steve|publisher=Motorbooks|year=1995|isbn=9780879389871|pages=71–72|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While remaining a forward-control vehicle, Ford adopted a [[Mid-engine design#FMR layout – Front Mid-engine / Rear-wheel drive|mid-engine configuration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uaugkWcuACUC&amp;pg=PA212#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=American cars of the 1960s|last=Gunnell|first=John|publisher=2005|isbn=9780896891319|page=212|accessdate=29 February 2016|date=2005-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the engine was placed between the front seats instead of behind the rear axle as on the Corvair, a larger rear door and flat load floor was created, allowing for additional load capacity.  

[[cab over|''&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;'']]

The first-generation Ford Econoline was produced from 1961 to 1967.  

=== Chassis ===
The first-generation Ford Econoline was based on the [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]] compact car range.  To accommodate its 90-inch wheelbase (the shortest for a Ford since 1908), the Econoline adopted a mid-engine configuration, placing the engine behind the front axle; consequently, the layout precluded the use of a V8 engine.    

The Econoline was initially powered by the {{convert|85|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 144 cubic-inch inline six that was the standard engine of the Falcon.  Later, it was offered with a {{convert|101|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 170 cubic-inch inline-six as an option.  In 1965, a 240 cubic-inch inline-six became the optional engine, with the 170 six becoming standard. A three-speed manual was standard, with a Dagenham four-speed manual introduced for 1963 and discontinued in 1964; the 170 cubic-inch engine was offered with a 3-speed automatic in 1964 and the larger two engines were both offered with a 3-speed automatic as an option thereafter. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econoline.org/transmission.php?s=id|title=Econoline Transmissions|website=econoline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In contrast to the Falcon, the Econoline was fitted with a solid front axle and a solid rear axle suspension with leaf springs for all four wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/FMC%20Trucks-Vans/1961_Trucks-Vans/1961_Ford_Econoline_Van_Brochure/1961%20Ford%20Econoline%20Van%20Brochure-02.html|title=Directory Index: FMC Trucks-Vans/1961_Trucks-Vans/1961_Ford_Econoline_Van_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Body ===
In its layout, the Ford Econoline adapted several elements of the Volkswagen Type 2, while making major departures with other design features, with many elements of its design derived from its mid-engine layout. In line with Volkswagen, the Econoline positioned the front seats above the front axle, making it a [[Cab over|cabover]]-style configuration, similar to the [[Jeep Forward Control]]. Other elements of its design were borrowed loosely from the [[Ford Thames 400E]] produced by [[Ford of Britain]] (the predecessor of the [[Ford Transit]]), including its grille configuration.  

The use of a mid-engine layout enlarged the cargo area, as the engine compartment was relocated forward of the load floor (which was flattened). While Volkswagen would market the Type 2 in the United States until 1979, the configuration of the Econoline was adopted by Chevrolet/GMC in 1964 (replacing the Corvair-based [[Chevrolet Greenbrier|Greenbrier van]]) and the 1964 [[Dodge A100]].  

Through its production, the first-generation Ford Econoline was offered in several variants, with four versions of the cargo van. Along with the 6-door windowless cargo van, Ford introduced an 8-door cargo van in 1963, adding two doors to the driver side. In 1964, a panel van variant was introduced, deleting the side loading doors. Cargo vans (with the exception of the panel van) were offered with or without windows in several configurations.

In 1965, Ford introduced a "Super Van" variant of the Econoline, extending the body 18 inches behind the rear axle.&lt;gallery mode="packed-hover" heights="150"&gt;

=== Variants ===
Alongside the Ford Falcon, the Ford Econoline was expanded into a product line including several vehicles.  In Canada, the Econoline was marketed through both the sales networks of both Ford and Lincoln-Mercury (as a Mercury), to increase its presence outside of urban areas.  

==== Passenger van ====
Introduced alongside the cargo van in 1961, Ford introduced two passenger variants of the Econoline (branded as part of the Falcon range).  Alongside the Station Bus (branded as both a Falcon and Econoline), Ford marketed the Club Wagon.  While the Station Bus was largely intended for commercial/fleet use, the Club Wagon was marketed as an alternative to station wagons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/FMC%20Trucks-Vans/1963_Trucks-Vans/1963_Ford_Falcon_Van_Brochure/1963%20Ford%20Falcon%20Van%20Brochure-02.html|title=Directory Index: FMC Trucks-Vans/1963_Trucks-Vans/1963_Ford_Falcon_Van_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A five-seat configuration was standard, with an eight-seat configuration offered as an option.

==== Pickup truck ====
Introduced as part of the Econoline model line for 1961, the Ford Econoline pickup truck was based upon the cargo van.  Sharing the forward-control configuration of the [[Chevrolet Greenbrier|Chevrolet Corvair pickup]], through its mid-engine chassis, the Econoline pickup truck saw no engine intrusion into the cargo bed. Although, in 1965 with the offering of the larger 240 cubic-inch engine there was a slight intrusion into the cargo bed providing clearance for the larger transmission bellhousing. The Econoline pickup was offered in two window configurations: 3 windows and 5 windows with windows in the rear cab corners to provide better visibility.  Early in 1965 the pickup was offered as a Spring Special with a special trim package. While far shorter than an F-100, the pickup was configured with a seven-foot long cargo bed.

The Econoline pickup was only produced during the first generation of production, ending production after the 1967 model year. In 1961, Ford projected the pickup leading the van in sales; however, buyer preferences weighed heavily towards the van configuration. The pickup accounted for only ten percent of 1961 Econoline production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2014/01/19/hemmings-find-of-the-day-1961-ford-econoline-pickup/|title=Hemmings Find of the Day – 1961 Ford Econolpne pickup|last=Ernst|first=Kurt|date=19 January 2014|work=Hemmings|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Mercury Econoline====
The first-generation Econoline was sold by [[Ford Motor Company of Canada|Ford of Canada]] by both Ford and Mercury. Alongside the [[Mercury M series|M-series]] truck line, the Mercury Econoline allowed for Ford of Canada to maximize its presence in rural areas served by either a Ford dealer or a Lincoln-Mercury dealer, but not both. Largely identical to its Ford counterpart with only minor exceptions of badging, the Mercury Econoline product line was sold as a pickup, cargo van, and passenger van.  

In 1961, the pickup truck commenced production at [[Oakville Assembly]] in Canada; later that year, Mercury Econoline pickup production shifted to the Lorain, Ohio assembly plant.&lt;ref name="Truesdell-dare"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vintagetruckmagazine.com/mercury-trucks-dare-different/|title=Mercury Trucks Dare to Be Different|last=Truesdell|first=Rich|date=November 3, 2014|work=Vintage truck magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112131511/https://www.vintagetruckmagazine.com/mercury-trucks-dare-different/|archive-date=17 April 2018|url-status=|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1962 to 1965, Mercury sourced Econoline vans and pickups from Oakville, with all later vehicles imported from the United States.&lt;ref name="Truesdell-dare" /&gt;    

Production numbers of Mercury Econolines were low; for example, a total of 1,291 Mercury Econoline pickup trucks were built in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.americandreamcars.com/1965mercuryeconolinepkup021613.htm |title=1965 Mercury Econoline pickup truck for sale |work=American Dream Cars |accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1968, Mercury ended its sale of light trucks, discontinuing the M-series. Subsequently, the next van sold by Mercury was the 1993 [[Mercury Villager]] minivan.

As the result of a lengthy [[United Auto Workers]] strike in 1967, the launch of the second-generation Econoline van was delayed almost four months until January 1968. Instead of calling it a 1968 or 1968.5 model, Ford decided to call it the 1969 model. Shedding its Falcon roots, the second-generation Econoline became a heavier-duty vehicle, sharing many of its underpinnings with the F-series full-size pickups.

=== Chassis ===
While the unibody construction of the previous-generation van was carried over, a major change was made in the overall layout in the body and chassis of the Econoline. To build a heavier-duty chassis, the mid-engine forward-control layout was abandoned in favor of a front-engine layout with the axle placed forward; this also allowed the use of the "[[Twin I-Beam]]" front suspension used in the F-series trucks. The redesign in the configuration resulted in major growth; the Econoline grew 15 inches in wheelbase; an 18-inch longer long-wheelbase model became the largest full-size van offered in North America at the time.

As they had become introduced as options in Dodge and Chevrolet/GMC vans, Ford introduced a V8 engine option into the powertrain line.

=== Body ===
With the change of chassis and axle configurations, the Econoline gained a conventional hood for engine access (though most engine access remained from the interior). To aid in engine compartment ventilation, the model was given a conventional grille, styled similar to the F series.

For 1971, the grille was redesigned to match the updated F series. For 1972, a sliding rear door became an option; introduced on a [[cutaway van chassis]] was the Hi-Cube van, a cab-chassis version of the Econoline with a box-van body. The introduction of the cab-chassis variant would become popular in the recreational-vehicle industry (a Class C RV), a segment still dominated by the E series in the 2010s.

=== Interior ===
Inside of the Econoline, the shift of the engine location moved the engine housing from between the seats to in front of the driver and front passenger, under the windshield. While the Econoline cargo van remained, it was joined by an Econoline passenger van (replacing the Falcon van). To attract more buyers to passenger vans, Ford introduced two new trims of the passenger van, the Ford Club Wagon and Ford Club Wagon Chateau. Based on the long-wheelbase version, the Chateau had air conditioning, [[houndstooth]] fabric on all seats, an AM/FM sound system, and the option of 12-passenger seating.

For 1975, the Econoline/Club Wagon were given a complete redesign. Based on [[Ford VN platform|an all-new chassis]], Ford became the first American manufacturer to adapt body-on-frame construction to a full-size van.

The new-generation Econoline would become common not only in its own right, but as the basis for other vehicles. With a full frame, the Econoline became popular as a [[cutaway van chassis]]; the design served as a basis for many ambulances, and various types of trucks and buses. The shared drivetrain with the F series marked the beginning of aftermarket four-wheel drive conversions. During the 1970s, the Econoline became popular as a basis for [[Conversion van|van conversions]]. Using the sparsely-equipped Econoline cargo van as a basis, a luxurious interior was fitted, along with extensive customization of the exterior.

A stillborn variant of the Econoline, the [[Ford Carousel]], nearly reached production as the first American minivan. While a running prototype was produced and planned for a potential 1975–1976 introduction, lack of funding led to the discontinuation of the project.

=== Chassis ===
[[File:Ford E150 Chateau (1975-78).jpg|left|thumb|1975–1978 Ford Econoline 150 Chateau]]
[[File:1988 Ford Econoline 350.JPG|left|thumb|1988 Econoline 350 cutaway van]]
[[File:83-91 Ford Club Wagon XLT.jpg|left|thumb|1980s Ford Club Wagon XLT]]
To increase the versatility of the full-size van line, the Econoline was developed using body-on-frame construction for the first time. In addition to increasing the strength of the chassis, the configuration allowed more commonality with the F-series trucks. As before, the Twin I-Beam front suspension was used. In its new configuration, the engine was moved further forward and lowered, relative to the body. In a massive growth spurt, the short-wheelbase configuration was 0.5 inches longer than the previous long-wheelbase chassis; the new long-wheelbase chassis was 138 inches, the longest wheelbase full-size van sold until 1990. In 1988, the 124-inch wheelbase was discontinued, leaving the 138-inch wheelbase as standard.

In 1982, to increase the fuel economy of the Econoline without a major loss in engine output, Ford introduced the option of a 6.9-liter IDI diesel V8 produced by International Harvester; in 1988, this was enlarged to 7.3L. The diesel V8 engines were available only in Econoline 350s (or Club Wagons sold on the same chassis).

Due to the popularity of automatic transmissions in full-size vans, Ford discontinued the 3-speed manual and 4-speed manual transmissions after the 1987 model year.

=== Body ===
Unlike its predecessors, Ford designed the 1975 Econoline with a true "two-box" layout. Similar to the [[Ford Transit]] of the time, the configuration moved the engine as far forward as possible and lower in the chassis than in its predecessor; although the hood was nearly twice as long, the hoodline was much lower. A higher degree of parts commonality with the F series made itself known in the bodystyling: the vent windows, taillights, bumpers, and wheels were common items between the two vehicles.

During its sixteen-year production run, the exterior of the Econoline/Club Wagon would remain nearly unaltered. In 1978, the Super Van/Super Wagon was introduced; based on the 138-inch wheelbase, it was a rear body extension allowing for extra cargo room or an extra row of seating (for up to 15 passengers). In 1979, a minor facelift updated the grille design; round headlights were replaced by rectangular units. In 1983, the Ford Blue Oval was added to the grille, replacing the "FORD" lettering on the hood.

Although the 1986 [[Ford Aerostar]] minivan would introduce styling far different from the Econoline, the basic styling of the full-size van would heavily influence the [[Ford Ranger (North America)|Ford Ranger]] (and its SUV offspring, the [[Ford Bronco II]]).

=== Interior ===
Inside, the redesign of the chassis expanded interior room, though the rear of the engine still remained between the front seats; an engine cover still provided access for servicing. Sharing many controls with the F series, the new design also improved interior ergonomics. In three body sizes, the Econoline was produced in a cargo van and passenger van, with the latter produced in three trim levels; base, Custom and Chateau. In addition, the Club Wagon was produced solely as a passenger van. After 1980, this was replaced by F-series nomenclature of XL and XLT. In line with the F series, the Econoline/Club Wagon was sold in 100/150/250/350 variants, with the Econoline 100 discontinued in 1983 (Club Wagon chassis variants were not denoted).

}}For the 1992 model year, Ford introduced the fourth generation of the Econoline/Club Wagon.  While the third-generation chassis was largely carried over, the body and interior underwent a complete redesign.  As with the smaller [[Ford Aerostar]], the fourth-generation model line was offered two body lengths on a common wheelbase.

The fourth-generation Econoline/Club Wagon underwent several revisions during its production.  For 1999, to adopt a nomenclature closer in line to that of Ford full-size trucks, the Econoline was renamed the E-Series.

In June 2014, production of E-Series passenger and cargo vans was discontinued as sales of the [[Ford Transit#Fourth%20generation%20(2013%E2%80%93present)|Ford Transit]] began in North America.  From 2015 onward, the E-Series has remained in production solely for commercial markets in cutaway-cab and stripped chassis configurations.&lt;ref name="Jonathon Ramsey2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2014/04/18/ford-e-series-chassis-cabs-continued-production//|title=Ford E-series chassis cabs and cutaways to survive mass transit onslaught|author=Jonathon Ramsey|date=April 18, 2014|work=autoblog.com|accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2019, Ford unveiled its first revision to the E-Series in its production as a commercial vehicle chassis, with revisions to its drivetrain, a new steering column, and wiring updates to improve functionality of equipment installed during manufacturing; it is announced for the 2021 model year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fordauthority.com/2019/03/new-2021-ford-e-series-chassis-cab-debuts/|title=New 2021 Ford E-Series Chassis Cab Debuts|date=2019-03-05|website=Ford Authority|access-date=2019-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chassis specifications ===
The fourth-generation E-Series (Econoline/Club Wagon) shares the VN platform of the third-generation Econoline, introduced in 1975.  Sharing many components with F-Series trucks, the E-Series retained the "Twin I-Beam" front suspension used by rear-wheel drive Ford trucks in North America from the 1960s to the early 1990s.  The rear suspension was a live rear axle with rear leaf springs.

For the 2008 model year, the chassis underwent its largest revisions of the fourth generation.  In an effort to improve handling and safety, larger brakes were added, improved steering, [[Electronic stability control|rollover stability control]], and a higher GVWR.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=119929|title=Ford Rolls Out Super Duty-Inspired 2008 E-Series Vans|date=March 9, 2007|work=Edmunds Inside Line|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320050155/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=119929|archivedate=March 20, 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The twin I-beam layout was retained, making it the last Ford vehicle to use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hemmings.com/magazine/hmn/2008/06/Ford-s-Twin-I-Beam-Front-Suspension/1641228.html|website=www.hemmings.com|title=Ford’s Twin I-Beam Front Suspension|access-date=2019-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Powertrain ====
At its 1992 launch, the fourth-generation E-Series (Econoline/Club Wagon) carried over its powertrain line from the third-generation model line (sharing it with the [[Ford F-Series (ninth generation)|ninth-generation F-Series]]).   A 4.9L inline-6 was standard, with a 4.9L V8, a 5.8L V8 offered as options.  On 250 or 350-series vans, a 7.5L V8 and 7.3L Navistar diesel V8 were also optional; the diesel became turbocharged in 1993.  During 1994, the IDI diesel was replaced by a 7.3L Ford Powerstroke diesel V8 (also sourced from Navistar).

For 1997, the E-Series underwent a revision of its engine lineup, retaining only the 7.3L diesel.  Sharing its gasoline engines with the [[Ford F-Series (tenth generation)|tenth-generation F-Series]], a 4.2L V6 replaced the inline-6 and a 6.8L V10 replaced the 7.5L V8.  The 4.9L I6 and the 5.8L V8 were replaced by 4.6L and 5.4L V8s, respectively.

For 2003, the 7.3L diesel was replaced by a 6.0L diesel from Navistar.  While gaining an intercooler over its predecessor, due to the lack of airflow in the engine compartment (compared to Super Duty trucks), Ford had to detune the E-Series version of the 6.0L V8.  For 2004, the 4.6L V8 became the standard engine (the first American full-size van with a standard V8 engine)

The 6.0L Power Stroke was offered until 2009 in the Ford Econoline vans (model year 2010), even though Ford Super Duty trucks were upgraded to the 6.4 version in 2007. Diesels were no longer offered after the 2010 model year. For 2009, the E-Series gained [[Flexible-fuel vehicle|flexible-fuel capability]] with 4.6L and 5.4L engines (allowing them to use [[E85]]).

In May 2014, the final 4.6L V8 was produced for the E-Series, with the 5.4L V8 becoming the standard engine for 2015.  For 2017, the 6.8L V10 replaced the 5.4L V8 as the standard engine, with a [[Ford Boss engine#6.2-L|6.2L V8]] becoming the optional engine; along with flex-fuel capability, both engines were offered with options for conversion to CNG or LPG/propane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2016/03/01/2017-ford-transit-lineup-new-engine-for-e-series-chassis-cutaway.html|title=New ergonomic and tech options enhance 2017 Ford Transit lineup; new engine for E-series stripped chassis, cutaway|date=March 1, 2016|work=Ford Motor Company Media Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For its 2021 model year revision, the E-Series cutaway cab adopts the 7.3L V8 of the 2020 Super Duty trucks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Body ===
During its production, the fourth-generation vans underwent minor revisions in 1997 and 2003, with a major revision in 2008; cutaway-chassis vans have undergone a revision for the 2021 model year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In line with the F-Series, the Econoline was sold in 150, 250, and 350 series, denoting &lt;big&gt;½&lt;/big&gt;, &lt;big&gt;¾&lt;/big&gt;, and 1-ton chassis (the Club Wagon was not designated by chassis size).  The body was available in two lengths, with the extended-length version exclusive to the 350-series (1-ton) chassis for both cargo and passenger vans.  The cargo van was sold as a two-passenger vehicle, with the passenger van sold in various configurations, including 5, 8, 9, 12, and 15 passengers.

==== 1992–1996 ====
[[File:Ford-Club-Wagon.jpg|thumb|1992–1994 Ford Club Wagon (15-passenger)]]
[[File:Ford E-350 U-Haul.JPG|thumb|1997–2002 Ford E-350 cutaway chassis (outfitted as a [[U-Haul]] vehicle)]]
For the 1992 model year, the body of the Econoline underwent a complete redesign.  The two-box configuration made a return, although the hood was angled downward slightly and the windshield raked back; all window glass (if specified) was flush-mounted.  Flush-mounted taillamp lenses were specific to the model line, along with flush-mounted headlamps (the latter were an option, standard on Club Wagons).  For 1992, the Econoline/Club Wagon became the first full-size vans produced with a center-mounted brake light.

For 1995, the taillamps were revised, removing the amber turn signals.

When redesigning the interior of the E-series for 1992, Ford chose to modernize the driver compartment of the vehicle. Sharing its controls and components with the Ford F-series and Aerostar, the E-series/Club Wagon was notable for being the first full-size van equipped with a driver's side airbag as standard equipment (on all models except the Econoline 350).  While space between the front seats was again dominated by the front engine cover, the redesign freed up additional passenger room.  While the model line offered only analog instruments (and no tachometer), a 6-digit LCD odometer replaced the previous 5-digit analog odometer.

For 1994, CFC-free R134a air-conditioning refrigerant was adopted beginning with September 1993 production.

==== 1997–2002 ====
For 1997, the grille was redesigned.  To bring the exterior of the Econoline in line with other Ford trucks, the egg-crate grille was replaced with an eight-hole oval-shaped cutout (matching the Ford Explorer and F-150).  The interior saw a complete redesign of the dashboard, adopting dual airbags (for all models).  The "brick"-style steering wheel was replaced with one using a horn mounted in the center; a double-DIN radio was added, along with an analog odometer.
[[File:03-07 Ford E-Series.jpg|thumb|2003–2007 Ford E-350 extended-length cargo van]]

==== 2003–2007 ====
For 2003, the entire E-Series adopted the grille of the E-550, shifting the Ford Blue Oval from the hood to the grille (for the first time since 1991).  In another revision, the front turn signal lenses become amber in color.  For 2004; the front bumper is revised with additional cooling slots.

For 2003, coinciding with the exterior facelift, the interior received a new engine cover with redesigned cup holders. For the first time since 1974, the E series was given a glove box, shared with the Super Duty trucks. For 2004,  the instrument panel was given a digital odometer, last used in 1996, certain versions were available with a tachometer.
[[File:2005 Ford E-550 KABC-TV ENG van.jpg|thumb|Ford E-550 Super Duty (outfitted as mobile broadcasting vehicle)]]

===== Ford E-550 Super Duty =====
For 2002, a heavy-duty E-550 variant was introduced.  Sharing chassis components with the [[Ford Super Duty|Super Duty]], the E-550 was distinguished by a grille styled in line with Super Duty pickup trucks (with a three horizontal slots between two vertical openings).  In addition, the heavier-duty front axle required the use of a larger front bumper and plastic fender flares (shared with the F-550 truck).  Depending on trim, E-550s were fitted with either chrome grilles, chrome bumpers, and flush headlamps, or gray plastic grilles, bumpers, and sealed-beam headlamps.  After the 2003 model year, the E-550 was discontinued.
[[File:2008 Ford E-250 (Econoline) Cargo Van 4.6L front 1.23.19.jpg|thumb|2008 Ford E-250 cargo van]]

==== 2008–present  ====
For the 2008 model year, the E-Series underwent a major update.  Largely concentrated forward of the windshield, the E-Series received new fenders, hood, and a larger grille.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For 2009, the dashboard was completely redesigned, with only the steering column carried over. Designed to share components with the Super Duty trucks, the E series now comes with the Ford Sync system, in-dash navigation as an option, and integrated auxiliary switches. The glovebox was relocated from the engine cover to forward of the passenger seat. Another option first introduced on the vehicle is a rear-view backup camera; widely available on smaller vehicles, it is the first in the full-size van segment.

=== Trim ===
During its production, the fourth-generation model line underwent several name changes.  As with the previous generation, the Econoline was sold as both a cargo van and as a passenger van (Econoline Wagon) with the Ford Club Wagon sold only as a passenger van.  For 1992, the luxury-oriented Chateau trim line of the Club Wagon made its return (dormant since 1980), slotted above the XL and XLT trims.  For 1992, the Club Wagon Chateau was awarded [[Motor Trend Car of the Year|Truck of the Year]] by ''[[Motor Trend]].''

Toward the end of the 1990s, Ford began to phase out the use of the Econoline and Club Wagon nameplates.  For 1999, the Club Wagon nameplate was discontinued (in favor of Econoline Wagon).  After the 2000 model year, the Econoline was renamed the Ford E-Series in the United States, in line with the Ford F-Series trucks (done by Ford Canada in 1995).  For 2001, the Chateau was dropped, replaced by the E-150 Traveler; due to low sales, it was dropped after a single model year.

For 2011, to commemorate the 50th year of production, Ford offered a 50th Anniversary Edition of the E-Series.  Offered on XLT Wagons, the option package was distinguished by blue metallic paint, embroidered seatbacks, and exterior badging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=33232|title=Ford's E-Series Vans Celebrate 50 Years of Success; 2011 lineup features special anniversary edition|date=September 13, 2010|publisher=Media.ford.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912092237/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=33232|archivedate=September 12, 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

===Current production (2015-present) ===
[[File:Ford E350 800-RV ITB 2017 (3).JPG|left|thumb|dashboard, 2009–2015 Ford E-Series]]
For the 2015 model year, the E-Series passenger and cargo vans were discontinued, replaced by the fourth-generation [[Ford Transit#Fourth%20generation%20(2013%E2%80%93present)|Ford Transit]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2014/12/24/transit-continues-series-success/20882215/|title=Ford's Transit Van continues E-Series' success|website=Detroit News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the E-Series had remained the best-selling vehicle in the full-size van segment since 1980, the Transit was introduced to offer additional body configurations, cargo capacity, and increased fuel economy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;    Sold outside of North America since 1965, two generations of the Transit were co-developed by Ford in North America.          

To accommodate demand for second-stage manufacturers, from the 2015 model year onward, the E-Series has continued production for commercial use solely in cutaway and stripped-chassis configuration.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.pickuptrucks.com/2014/04/ford-will-continue-e-series-cutawaystripped-chassis.html|title=Ford Will Continue E-Series Cutaway/Stripped Chassis – PickupTrucks.com News|website=news.pickuptrucks.com|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Initially planned to continue production through the 2010s&lt;ref name="Jonathon Ramsey2" /&gt;, the lifespan of the E-Series was extended further in 2019 as Ford unveiled a 2021 update for the E-Series cutaway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  While the exterior remains unchanged since its 2008 redesign, Ford announced an optional 7.3L V8, replacing the long-running 6.8L V10.  The interior sees several revisions, with an all-new steering column (for the first time since 1997), a redesigned instrument cluster, and increased [[Internet access|connectivity]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:Ford E350 Cutaway.png|thumb|2019 Model Year E350 "Cutaway" Chassis with aftermarket installed walk-in service type body]]

For 2019, the E-Series lineup has been reduced to offer Cutaway versions only, and buyers wanting a Chassis Cab will be required to purchase a [[Ford Transit]] Chassis Cab. The Transit 350 and 350HD are also sold as a cutaway-cab chassis.

=== 2021 revision ===

In 2019, Ford unveiled a revised version of the Ford E-Series for 2021 production at the 2019 International Work Truck Show.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fordauthority.com/2019/03/new-2021-ford-e-series-chassis-cab-debuts/|title=New 2021 Ford E-Series Chassis Cab Debuts|date=2019-03-05|website=Ford Authority|access-date=2019-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Remaining in production solely as a cutaway-cab vehicle, the 2021 E-Series replaces the 6.8L Triton V10 with an all-new 7.3L V8 (no transmission selection is currently announced).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The dashboard received a new instrument cluster (for the first time since 2009) and a new steering column (for the first time since 1997).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  While sharing the same dashboard layout to lower production costs, Ford added radios with Bluetooth compatibility,  auxiliary and USB inputs, and steering wheel-mounted audio controls.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The North American variant of the '''Ford Escort''' is a [[small family car|small family]]/[[compact car]] introduced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in 1980 for the 1981 model year.  Sharing its name with the [[Ford Escort (Europe)#Third generation (1980–1986)|third-generation European Ford Escort]], the model line is the first front-wheel drive Ford developed and sold in North America.  The direct successor of the [[Ford Pinto]], as the smallest Ford car in North America, the Escort largely replaced the European-imported [[Ford Fiesta (first generation)|Ford Fiesta]].  

Overcoming the tarnished reputation for quality and safety established by the [[Ford Pinto#Fuel_system_fires.2C_recalls.2C_and_litigation|fuel tank defect]] of the Pinto, the Escort became highly successful in the American marketplace.  After 1982, the model line became the best-selling car in the United States, a position it held during most of the 1980s.  

The 1981 replacement of the Pinto by the Escort was the first Ford model line to adapt front-wheel drive.  By the end of the 1980s, nearly the entire Ford car range would adopt the powertrain layout (with the sole exception of the Mustang, Thunderbird, and LTD Crown Victoria/Country Squire).

The Escort was produced across three generations.  The first was the first Ford "world car", designed as [[Ford of Europe]] transitioned the Escort Mk III to front-wheel drive.  In North America, the model line was also sold as the Mercury Lynx and the two-seat [[Ford EXP|Ford EXP/Mercury LN7]] (no version was sold by the Lincoln division).  Introduced for 1991, the second generation became a near-twin of the Mazda-designed [[Ford Laser]] (a model line sold in Asia and Oceania); sharing a platform and powertrain with the [[Mazda 323]], the Escort grew into the [[compact car]] segment.  The second generation was also sold as the [[Mercury Tracer]].  For 1997, the third generation was an extensive redesign of the second-generation platform Escort sedan, introducing the ZX2 coupe; Mercury continued to sell the Tracer sedan/wagon.  

For the 1999 model year, the [[Ford Focus]] succeeded the Escort as the compact model line as a new-generation "world car"; after the 2000 model year, the Escort shifted primarily to fleet sales, ending production after the 2002 model year.  

During its entire production, the Escort was produced by [[Wayne Stamping &amp; Assembly]] ([[Wayne, Michigan]]) and [[Hermosillo Stamping and Assembly]] ([[Hermosillo|Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico]]); the first generation was also produced by [[Edison Assembly]] ([[Edison, New Jersey]]), [[San Jose Assembly Plant]] ([[Milpitas, California|Milpatas, California]]), and [[Oakville Assembly]] ([[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville, Ontario, Canada]])

The first North American Escort went on sale on October 3, 1980 for the 1981 model year, along with its corporate twin, the '''Mercury Lynx'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/73180393/|title=The Pantagraph from Bloomington, Illinois on September 30, 1980 · Page 13|author=|date=|website=newspapers.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended to share common components with the European Mk III Escort. It was launched with a {{convert|65|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|adj=on}}, 1.6-liter hemi overhead cam inline-four.&lt;ref name=RT82&gt;{{cite journal | ref = 81bg | journal = Road &amp; Track's Road Test Annual &amp; Buyer's Guide 1981 | issue = January–February 1981 | title = 1981 Buyer's Guide | editor-first = Tony | editor-last = Hogg | page = 97 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was available as a three-door hatchback and as a five-door station wagon, with a four-speed manual or a three-speed automatic.&lt;ref name=RT82/&gt; The five-door hatchback was first shown in May 1981.&lt;ref name=spin&gt;{{cite magazine | magazine = [[Popular Mechanics]] | editor-last = Assenza | editor-first = Tony | date = September 1981 | volume = 156 | number = 3 | issn = 0032-4558 | publisher = Hearst Magazines | page = 168 | title = Detroit Shifts Gears | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ldgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA168#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The North American Escort had considerably more chrome than Escorts sold elsewhere (except for the 1981 SS model and 1982+ GT models which feature blacked out trim). 1981 models never had the blue oval logo; on the front fenders there was an Escort badge which included a globe representing the earth, which implied this was a "World Car".

The car was freshened in 1982, and added Ford's blue oval logo for the first time along with a new grille. For 1982 models, the base price of the Escort 3-door was $5,518.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Consumer Guide|date=January 1982|publisher=Warner Publishing Services|pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine was also uprated, to {{convert|70|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. In March 1982 a HO (High Output) version of the engine was added, originally only in the EXP and with an automatic transmission, but soon thereafter available with a manual and also in the sporting Escort GT.&lt;ref name=DCR1&gt;{{cite magazine | magazine = [[Autoweek]] | last = Ross | first = Daniel Charles | page = 26 | date = 1982-05-03 | title = Ford's new butterfly | issn = 0192-9674 | volume = 32 | number = 18 | publisher = Crain Press Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This unit produces {{convert|80|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, thanks to a higher compression ratio, a new exhaust system, and larger venturis in the carburetor. In addition to the HO engine, the GT featured cosmetic changes such as "GT" emblems and stripes, while under the shell there were uprated brakes and a close-ratio four-speed gearbox. Also included were metric TR sport wheels with [[Michelin TRX]] tires.&lt;ref name=DCR1/&gt;

For 1984, the GLX model was dropped and replaced with a fuel injected LX model, available as a five-door hatchback or wagon, with a GT engine, blackout trim, and "Butterfly" styled cast aluminum wheels. The interior received a new dashboard, and a new rubber shift boot for manual models; automatic models received a new gear selector lever with a straight line for gear selection instead of the twisting "?" mark pattern of the previous models.  Flush headlamps, revised taillamps and restyled steel wheels appeared when the Escort was revised and introduced as the 1985½ Ford Escort. There was also the [[Ford EXP]], and sister version Mercury LN7, targeting the sports car market, essentially a two-seat hatch with lower roofline which was not as successful as other body styles.

Although the basic silhouette was the same, it was almost completely different from the European version, apart from the Ford CVH engine. There was a 1.6 L engine, a 4-speed MTX-2 and a 5-speed MTX-3 manual transmission as standard options, and an optional 3-speed ATX/FLC automatic transmission. A 1.3&amp;nbsp;L engine was designed and prototyped but did not see production due to lack of power, and an inability to get it certified.&lt;ref name=RT82/&gt; Beginning in 1983, a GT model offered a multi-port EFI version of the 1.6&amp;nbsp;L four-cylinder that increased power by 20&amp;nbsp;hp over the base carbureted version. It also came with a 5-speed transmission, TRX handling package, front and rear spoilers, metric-sized alloy wheels and fog lights. Also beginning with the 1984 model year, the Ford EXP received the option of the turbocharged 1.6&amp;nbsp;L four-cylinder rated at {{convert|120|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and matching torque.&lt;ref name=popmen&gt;{{cite magazine | magazine = [[Popular Mechanics]] | last = Witzenburg | first = Gary | date = September 1983 | volume = 160 | number = 3 | issn = 0032-4558 | publisher = Hearst Magazines | page = 158 | title = Detroit '84 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gNQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA158#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The turbo engine then found its way into the Escort GT (and Lynx RS) as well during the 1984 model year. 1984 was also the year that Mazda's 2-liter diesel engine became available in the Escort and Lynx.&lt;ref name=popmen/&gt;

===1985–1990===
The 1985½ model received a facelift (less chrome, restyled tail lamps, flush headlights), and the 1.6 L engine was replaced with a 1.9&amp;nbsp;L. GT models featured a high output engine with revised intake manifold, cylinder head and a real header available only with a manual transmission. The Lynx was retired for 1987, but was replaced by the [[Mazda 323]]-derived ''Tracer'' model. [This Mazda platform was revamped in 1989 and debuted as the 1990 Mazda Protege. The updated platform would form the basis for the next generation (1990–1996) Escort/Tracer.]

The Escort saw another minor facelift in mid-1988, which smoothed out the front and rear fascias. New plastic bumpers (which replaced the metal bumpers), larger rear side windows, a more rounded rear-end design and larger (14&amp;nbsp;inch versus 13&amp;nbsp;inch) wheels modernized the look of the cars. Three-door hatchback models had a curving windowline along the side towards the rear of the car. The engine was also updated with a slightly revised camshaft and roller lifters. The new design is commonly referred to as the "88.5" year, and existed until the end of the 1990 model year.

Finding some popularity during the final three years of this generation was the Pony model, which was the least-expensive U.S.-built Ford at the time. Pony models used plainer interior trim with greater use of vinyl and plastic instead of cloth, and a 4-speed manual transaxle was standard, although buyers could opt for the 5-speed found in LX models or the 3-speed ATX automatic. The list of available options was very limited, to the extent that such luxuries as power steering and factory-installed air conditioning were not offered (a dealer-installed A/C system was available). Given their lighter weight, Pony models were known for their ability to deliver excellent fuel economy—mileage upwards of {{convert|40|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|lk=on|abbr=on}} in highway driving was not uncommon.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

For 1991, the Escort and the [[Mercury Tracer]] were replaced by models based on the [[Mazda B platform]] (BG), which was also used by the [[Mazda 323]], [[Mazda Familia#BG|Protegé]] and first generation [[Kia Sephia]]. Ford, which owned a 25% stake in [[Mazda]], already sold a version of the 323/Familia in [[Asia]] and [[Australasia]], called the [[Ford Laser#KF|Ford Laser]], which had replaced the old [[rear-wheel drive]] [[Ford Escort (European)|Escort]] there. Although the Escort was now essentially a twin of the Laser instead of the European Escort, it kept the Escort name in North America due to strong brand equity on the Escort name as well as [[Chrysler]] already using the Laser name on the [[Plymouth Laser|Plymouth equivalent]] of the [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]].

The prior Escort used localized engines and shared some elements of design with the European model. The Escort for the 1990s, however, would be almost identical to the Ford Laser and its derivatives, with minor differences in appearance and base engine. While the Laser would feature identical powertrains to the [[Mazda Familia]], the Escort carried over the 1.9 liter 8-valve Ford-designed [[Ford CVH engine|CVH]] engine from the previous Escort, with the GT and LX-E receiving the Mazda-built 1.8&amp;nbsp;L [[Mazda B engine#BP|''BP'']] [[Straight-4|I4]]. Much of the external styling mimicked the [[Ford Taurus (first generation)|first generation Ford Taurus]], no doubt Ford's hope to give the Escort the appeal of that successful model.

This generation of the Escort was one of the first Ford automobiles to feature, on the 1.9&amp;nbsp;L engine, distributorless ignition (known as EDIS, [[Electronic Distributorless Ignition System]]). It also featured a new electronically controlled 4-speed automatic transmission, as well as an independent rear suspension, both (at the time) relatively uncommon in cars in this class.

The Mazda-based model sold sluggishly in [[United States|America]] at first, since only hatchback models were offered upon launch, but became popular later by 1992, after the sedan was introduced, available in either LX or LX-E trim levels.

For the 1993–1995 model years, Ford offered the Escort on a "one price" basis, with the same price for a three- or five-door [[hatchback]], a [[sedan (car)|sedan]] or a [[station wagon|wagon]] when equipped with the most popular options (3-doors quickly added alloy wheels to the "one price" specification). The LX-E, equipped with the same sporting equipment as the GT and Mazda Protegé LX (four-wheel disc brakes, larger front brakes, larger clutch, equal-length driveshafts, larger anti-roll bars, dual-outlet exhaust, sport interior and 1.8&amp;nbsp;L Mazda DOHC 16-valve engine), lasted only until 1993. The Pony departed in 1992, replaced by the Standard trim level.

Trim levels were originally Pony, LX, and GT.  The GT was the North American equivalent of the Laser XR3i version, featuring a 1.8&amp;nbsp;L Mazda DOHC engine. The LX and Standard or Pony were equipped with the 1.9&amp;nbsp;L overhead cam 8-valve [[Ford CVH engine|CVH]] inline 4. The Pony or later Standard was the base trim level, lacking most features like power steering or a radio. The LX was the upscale trim level, and a Sport package could be added to make it look like a GT. Subtle differences can be noticed in all three Escort models (sedan, hatchback and wagon) from 1990 to 1996. In 1992, the grill oval hall around the "Ford" emblem became a little larger in order to allow more air to enter under the hood to cool the engine. In 1993, the wheel size was changed from 13&amp;nbsp;inches to 14&amp;nbsp;inches and the black exterior door handles were changed to match the exterior color of the car. A driver's airbag was introduced in 1993 as well, and by 1994, both driver and passenger airbags were standard with the redesigned dash for the 1995 model year.

The restyle dropped the hatchbacks and added a new sporty [[coupe]] for the 1997 model year.

The 1998 Escort ZX2 replaced the [[Ford Probe]] as Ford's [[sport compact]] car. The ZX2 was a much lower-slung and rakish car than either the Escort sedan and wagon, aimed squarely at the youth market as a replacement for the Escort GT (although lacking the latter's rear [[disc brake]] setup) and was built exclusively at Ford's [[Hermosillo, Sonora]], [[Mexico]] assembly plant. The interior was refreshed for 1999, and the model was retired after 2003.  It had a completely redesigned dashboard, and included a panel that unified the heat and radio controls, similar to that of the third generation Ford Taurus.

The 1998 '''Escort ZX2''' coupe featured the 2.0&amp;nbsp;L, {{convert|130|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Zetec]] [[DOHC]] four-cylinder engine as standard equipment, an option unavailable on the sedan or wagon. Intended for use as the base engine in the larger European [[Ford Mondeo]] and its American cousins, the [[Ford Contour|Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique]], the Zetec gave the ZX2 more-than-respectable performance, running 0–60 in 7.4 seconds.

The 1999 and 2000 models offered a performance limited edition [[ZX2 S/R]] which further enhanced the car's performance in every aspect.

The Escort sedan and wagon used the lower-powered [[Ford CVH engine#2.0|CVH SPI2000]] engine with {{convert|110|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. Subtle differences can be noticed in the Escort sedan from 1996 to 2002. The trim lines for 1997 were base and '''LX''', for 1998–2002 it was offered in '''LX''' and '''SE''' trims.  For 1999, the reverse lights were moved into the same piece as the tail lamps; they were previously below the tail lamp on the body.

A very rare trim package could be found with chrome {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on}} wheel covers and other features. It was offered in 1999.

[[File:97-99 Ford Escort wagon.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Ford Escort LX wagon]]

The Escort was offered in a '''Sport''' package as well. The Mercury Tracer's version was called the '''Trio''' or '''Sport''' depending on the year. A basketweave type of wheel was put on the Tracer Trio while a flower petal pattern was used on the Tracer Sport. The Sport/Trio package included aluminum wheels, sport exhaust tip, a tachometer, and a rear decklid spoiler.

The Escort wagon largely retained the same body style, gaining only the new interior, front end &amp; fascia, side-view mirrors, door handles, badging, and slightly restyled taillamps &amp; reflectors. The black window frames on the doors of some models became body-colored.

Both the Escort wagon and the Mercury Tracer sedan and wagon were discontinued after 1999. The Escort sedan was discontinued in 2002, but continued to be sold as fleet &amp; rental cars only. It was replaced by the [[Ford Focus]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}. The last Ford Escort rolled off the assembly line on February 20, 2002.  The last ZX2 rolled off the assembly line on March 21, 2003. In [[Mexico]], it was replaced by the smaller [[Ford Ikon]].

For 2001, the 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] was limited to fleet sales only and the Escort moniker on the Escort ZX2 was quietly dropped, making the car officially just ZX2 as a 2-door [[notchback]] [[coupe]].

The [[Ford Focus (first generation)|Ford Focus]] debuted in 1998 (1999 in U.S.) and was produced concurrently with the ZX2. Though not without its fans, both then and now, and still fairly well represented in the automotive [[aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]], the ZX2 was replaced by the Focus ZX3, ZX4 and ZX5. Though the two cars shared the same Zetec engine, there were a few differences. The Focus lacked the exhaust-side VCT, and contained less aggressive camshafts that pushed the [[power band]] down a few hundred RPM. The two models shared the same block but, due to the different camshafts and the different cylinder head, the torque output for the Focus was bumped up by {{convert|8|ftlbf|Nm|abbr=on}}. Thanks to better gearing and less weight, the ZX2 continued to outperform the [[Ford Focus (North America)|Focus]]. The ZX2 continued with little more than {{convert|15|in|cm|abbr=on}} alloy wheels and a rear defroster now offered as standard equipment, and for 2003, a revised front fascia. Production ceased at the end of the 2003 model year.

===ZX2 S/R===
The increased presence and success of tuner models from overseas in the late 90s caused Ford to create their own performance model, the ZX2 S/R. Meant to compete with cheap factory performance [[sport compact]]s such as the [[Honda Civic Si]] or the [[Dodge Neon]] ACR, Ford created the ZX2 S/R to show that they had plenty to bring to the table. Its initial debut was at [[SEMA]]'s Import Auto Salon in Pomona in 1999. The ZX2 S/R was the first product jointly developed by Ford Racing and Ford Motor Company's Small Vehicle Center Product Development.

Ford's final limited production count was 2,110 units, consisting of 110 yellow S/Rs for 1999, the first two of which were sold in [[Columbus, Ohio]], and the other 108 in California; and for 2000, 500 black, 500 red and 1,000 yellow S/Rs were sold. The upgrade price to the S/R package was $1,500 in both years. It is believed that only 35 of those 2000 S/Rs were sold in Canada, making it a very rare trim there.

The optional S/R package adds stiffer suspension parts (Eibach springs (M-5560-Z2), Tokico struts (M-18000-Z2) and Energy Suspension brand polyurethane suspension bushings), more power (through a Ford Racing PCM (M-12650-Z2)), more efficient intake (Roush or Iceman), rear disc brakes (M-2300-Z2), a stronger clutch (Centerforce dual friction M-7560-Z2), a short-throw B&amp;M manual-transmission shifter (M-7210-Z2), an S/R-unique shift knob (M-7213-Z2) and boot (M-7277-Z2), upgraded seats, a unique blue valve cover, a different speed cluster that goes up to {{convert|150|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and a unique tire/wheel package. Engine power was increased 10% over the base Zetec engine used in the ZX2 to {{convert|143|bhp|kW PS|abbr=on}}, courtesy of a recommended premium fuel re-calibration, new air inlet system, the performance PCM, improved Borla muffler and pipe (M-5230-Z2). All ZX2 S/R have a special "S/R" badge on the back, either silver (on a red car) or red (on a yellow or black car). Some S/R went out of the assembly plant without some of the performance mods (example: missing the Centerforce clutch). The suspension bushings were not installed at the factory but instead packaged with the car for installation at the dealership. This also led to many cars leaving the showroom without the full complement of S/R parts.

'''''Winged Express''''' is a [[supercharger|supercharged]] A [[Nitromethane|Fuel]] [[Altered (drag racing)|Altered]] (AA/FA). On 28 September 1967, it was the first Altered to exceed {{convert|200|mph|abbr=on}}.

== History ==
''Winged Express'' was built in 1960 by driver [[Willie Borsch|William "Wild Willie" Borsch]] and partner [[Al Marcellus]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motorsport.com/nhra/news/nhra-s-50-greatest-drivers-willie-borsch/61147/ Motorsport.com] (retrieved 14 September 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; assisted by [[Howard Johansen]] ([[Howard's Cams]]), Don Reynolds, Phil Johnson, Dale Young, and Jerry Hyatt.&lt;ref&gt;McClurg, Bob. ''Diggers, Funnies, Gassers and Altereds: Drag Racing's Golden Age''. (CarTech Inc, 2013), p.47.&lt;/ref&gt; The car's [[Chrysler Hemi engine#392|392 hemi]] was built by [[Jim Harrell (drag racer)|Jim Harrell]] (of Jim's Auto Parts).&lt;ref&gt;McClurg, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The body, donated by [[Curt Hamilton]],&lt;ref&gt;McClurg, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt; was the first [[Cal Automotive]] fiberglass 1923 [[Ford Model T|Model T]] used on an Altered.&lt;ref&gt;McClurg, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;  When completed, the car had a simple hoop rollbar and narrow slicks, with the engine tilted upward to aid traction, and was missing the rollbar-mounted wing that later became its trademark.&lt;ref&gt;McClurg,  p.47 &amp; caption.&lt;/ref&gt;

The car was first entered in [[National Hot Rod Association|NHRA]]'s A/Roadster class, at [[Riverside International Raceway|Riverside]] in 1960, where it set an A/R class record of 10.28 at {{convert|148.27|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;McClurg, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Borsch raced ''Winged Express'' for ten years, winning AA/FA at the [[NHRA Winternationals]] in 1967 and 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motorsport.com/nhra/news/nhra-s-50-greatest-drivers-willie-borsch/61147/ Motorsport.com] (retrieved 14 September 2019)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since AA/FA was not recognized as a class by NHRA until 1967, ''Winged Express'' never earned a national title.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motorsport.com/nhra/news/nhra-s-50-greatest-drivers-willie-borsch/61147/ Motorsport.com] (retrieved 14 September 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September 1967 at Irwindale, ''Winged Express'' made the first {{convert|200|mph|abbr=on}} pass by an Altered, at 7.91 seconds and {{convert|200.44|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce, Doug. ''1001 Drag Racing Facts'' (North Branch, MN: CarTech, Inc, 2015), p.175, item #513.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Winged Express'' qualified for the [[1968 NHRA Winternationals]], a 32-car field in [[Top Fuel]], at an AA/FA record [[elapsed time]] of 7.29 seconds, only to have the rest of the field refuse to race Borsch, for fear of the ill-handling Altered. It turned out they were right: in Round One of Super Eliminator, Borsch went from guardrail to centerline, in a wild ride, captured, and made famous, by photographer Bob McClurg; it "became one of the most famous drag racing photos of all time".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motorsport.com/nhra/news/nhra-s-50-greatest-drivers-willie-borsch/61147/ Motorsport.com] (retrieved 16 September 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning In November 2005, Ford marketed a mildly [[Facelift (automotive)|facelifted]] Fusion with revised front and rear lights, bumper fascias, side mouldings, door mirrors, brighter exterior color palette, revised interior design with 'soft touch' materials and revised analogue instrument display.

Ford of Brazil and a number of Latin American countries marketed a [[crossover SUV]] variant as the [[Ford EcoSport]] with revised styling and increased ground clearance for light off-roading. 

The Fusion received Four star NCAP crash safety rating, and was succeeded in November 2012 with the [[Ford B-Max|B-Max]].

In December 2002, [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]] presenter [[Richard Hammond]] described the Fusion as "a Ford Fiesta, in a hat."

==Equipment==
Options included power folding mirrors, automatic and 'home safe' headlights, automatic windscreen wipers, [[Bluetooth]] with voice control, trip computer, MP3 player connectivity and the Electronic Stability Program. In the United Kingdom, the car was available in Style+, Zetec and Titanium trim levels. (1, 2, 3 and '+' were the trim levels for the original Fusion).

Equipment on the entry level ''1'' included central locking, and dual front airbags. The ''2'' featured electric heated mirrors, electric front windows, a CD player and air conditioning. The ''3'' added alloy wheels, front fog lights and an alarm. The + model, introduced in May 2002, added larger alloys and privacy glass.

The '''Ford SVT Mustang Cobra''' (also known as '''SVT Mustang Cobra, SVT Cobra,''' or simply as '''Cobra''') is a [[muscle car]]/[[pony car]] model that was built in model years 1993 through 2004 by [[Ford Motor Company]]'s '''[[Special Vehicle Team]]''' division (or '''SVT,''' for short). The SVT Cobra was a high-performance version of the [[Ford Mustang]], considered as top-of-the-line as it was positioned above the Mustang GT and Mach 1 models during its era of production. On three occasions, the race-ready, street-legal '''SVT Cobra R''' variant was produced in limited numbers. The SVT Cobra was succeeded by the [[Shelby Mustang#2007.E2.80.932009 Ford Shelby GT500|2007 Shelby GT500]].

=== 1993 ===

The 1993 Ford Mustang SVT Cobra was launched during the 1992 [[Chicago Auto Show]]. It was the premier vehicle of Ford's newly established SVT division, designed to showcase SVT's four hallmarks of Performance, Substance, Exclusivity and Value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=History of SVT| url=http://www.muscularmustangs.com/2005/svthistorypress.php| accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exterior of the 1993 SVT Cobra was similar to that year's GT model with differences explained below.

The upgrades were beneath the [[monocoque#Automobiles|bodywork]] and featuring a [[Ford small block engine#302|{{cvt|302|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine]], producing {{convert|235|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,600 rpm and {{cvt|280|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] at 4,000 rpm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1993 SVT Mustang Cobra |url= https://performance.ford.com/enthusiasts/collector-vehicles/svt/mustang-cobra/1993.html |website=performance.ford.com |accessdate=27 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Road &amp; Track,'' this could send a Cobra through the [[Dragstrip|1/4 mile]] in 14.5 seconds at a trap speed of 98&amp;nbsp;mph (158&amp;nbsp;km/h). Acceleration from zero to {{convert|60|mph|abbr=on}} took 5.9 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=The 1993 Ford Mustang Cobra |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1987-1988-1989-1990-1991-1992-1993-ford-mustang11.htm |date=25 February 2007 |accessdate=27 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drivetrain received an upgraded transmission, rear disc brakes, and for the first time on a factory Mustang, 17" unidirectional wheels. Cobra models received a softer, more compliant ride compared to the GT model. This was accomplished with model-specific springs and sway bars.

{{hatnote|Ford part numbers are listed below. In many cases, Ford has two separate numbers for each part, the Ford production number (the fourth character is a Z), and an engineering number. The engineering number is usually what is stamped/cast on the part itself (the fourth character is E for engine parts, F for electronics, and C for chassis).}}

==== ''Engine'' ====

The 1993 SVT Cobra's [[short block]] (cylinder block, crankshaft, rods, and pistons) was carried over from the GT model. To this, Ford SVT engineers added the following performance items:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=1993 Cobra Specifications
|url= http://www.1993cobra.com/data.htm| accessdate=9 Aug 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[cylinder head|Cylinder Heads]] — GT-40 "High Flow" [[Cast Iron]] heads were installed. They were milled for 62.5&amp;nbsp;cc [[combustion chamber]]s. [[poppet valve|Valves]] measure 1.84" (46.7&amp;nbsp;mm) intake, and 1.54" (39.1&amp;nbsp;mm) exhaust. The valves are actuated by Cobra-specific 1.7 ratio roller rockers, constructed of aluminum and produced for Ford by Crane Cams. Part Numbers: ''F3ZZ-6049-B'' (head), ''F3ZZ-6507-A'' (intake valve), ''F3ZZ-6505-A'' (exhaust valve), and ''F3ZE-6529-AB'' (rockers).
* [[Inlet manifold|Intake Manifold]] — The Cobra upper manifold was unique to the 1993 Cobra and had a 2.75" (70.0mm) [[diameter]] round [[throttle body]] opening, diverting air into (8) round staggered [[Cylinder head porting|ports]], each 1.64" (41.7&amp;nbsp;mm) diameter. The lower manifold was identical to the GT-40 manifold used by Ford Racing; it redirects airflow to a rectangular port configuration as needed by the cylinder heads.  Part Numbers: ''F3ZZ-9424-C'' (upper manifold) and ''F3ZZ-9424-D'' (lower).
* [[Camshaft]] —  The cam is of the hydraulic roller type (same as the GT).  However, the Cobra cam has unique specifications of 0.479"/0.479" (12.2&amp;nbsp;mm/12.2&amp;nbsp;mm) intake/exhaust lift, (209°/209°) duration at 0.050" (1.27&amp;nbsp;mm), and a lobe separation of 118.3°, Part Number: ''F3ZE-6250-CA.''
* [[Fuel injection|Air/Fuel Delivery]] —  The increased airflow and fuel consumption of the Cobra required these upgraded components: Larger (compared to the GT) 24&amp;nbsp;lb/hr fuel injectors, 2.75" (70.0&amp;nbsp;mm) [[mass flow sensor|MAF meter]], 2.56" (65.0&amp;nbsp;mm) throttle body, and matching [[exhaust gas recirculation|EGR plate]] handle the increased breathing of the motor. A specially calibrated X3Z [[Intel 8061|EEC-IV]] [[engine control unit]] runs the system. Part Numbers: ''F1TZ-9F593-C'' (injectors), ''FIZF-12B579-AA'' (meter), and ''F3ZF-12A650-CA'' (ECU).
* [[Automobile accessory power|Accessories]] — The [[crankshaft]] [[pulley]] diameter decreased by 14% (as compared to the GT) in order to under-drive the [[alternator]], [[gas compressor|A/C]], and [[secondary air injection|smog pump]], all to increase power. The [[water pump]] pulley also decreased in diameter by the same amount in order to preserve the ratio of pump speed, and thus coolant flow.  These smaller accessory pulleys necessitated a shorter [[serpentine belt]]. Part Numbers: ''F3ZZ-6A312-A'' (crank pulley), ''F3ZZ-8509-A'' (water pump pulley), and ''F3ZZ-8620-A'' (belt).
* [[exhaust system|Exhaust]] — To extract the maximum amount of power from the Cobra's powerplant, Ford engineers used tuned mufflers with lower restriction (as compared to the GT).  While the factory headers and H-pipe remained the same, the tailpipes were similar to that of a Mustang LX 5.0L (Sport) model in that they had straight stainless steel tips (instead of turn-down tips on the GT). This is because the Cobra had a revised rear fascia, allowing (unlike the GT) for an exposed dual exhaust.  Part Numbers: ''F3ZZ-5230-A,'' stamped ''F3ZC-5230-CC'' (RH muffler) and ''F3ZZ-5230-A,'' stamped ''F3ZC-5232-DC'' (LH muffler).

==== ''Drivetrain'' ====

With the increased engine output of the new Mustang SVT Cobra, the Borg-Warner World Class T-5 transmission needed an internal upgrade, which allowed it to yield a higher torque capacity compared to the standard World Class T-5. This upgrade consisted of custom gearing 1–3 (which were reduced 10% and hardened), 4th/5th (just hardened) gear was the same as standard T-5s found in the LX/GTs. The holding capacity of the Cobra's clutch was increased by way of a higher clamping force pressure plate using the same 10 inch diameter as the GT/LX.

==== ''Suspension'' ====

* [[Shock absorber|Shocks/Struts]] — The Cobra outsourced production of shocks and struts to the aftermarket manufacturer Tokico.  The components used were specifically valved for the new car. Part Numbers: ''F3ZZ-18124-A'' (front struts) and ''F3ZZ-18125-A'' (rear shocks).

==== ''Exterior Styling'' ====
The Cobra featured a more subdued styling than the GT.

==== ''Paint and Interior Trim'' ====

The 1993 Cobra was available in four exterior paint choices,&lt;ref name = "MRB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sessler|first1=Peter C.|title=Mustang Red Book: 1964 1/2 to 2000|date=2000|publisher=MBI Publishing Company|location=Osceola, WI|isbn=0-7603-0800-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|150–1}} as shown in the table below. Interior color choices were Opal Gray cloth, Black cloth, and Opal Gray leather.{{r|PbSVT|p=146}}

=== 1993 Cobra R ===

The 1993 Cobra R was the first of three Cobra R models produced, and it was an extremely exclusive vehicle.{{r|PbSVT|p=62}} As the "R" designation in its name stood for "Race", the car did not have a radio, speakers, wiring and antenna, air conditioner, foglights, sound deadener, rear seat, rear safety belts, rear carpeting, and roll-up cargo cover, among other items.{{r|PbSVT|p=62}} There were no power options; the car had power steering, roll-up windows, manual door locks, and manual-adjustable mirrors.{{r|PbSVT|p=62}} Also, manually-adjustable Opal Gray cloth bucket seats from the Mustang LX were lighter than the GT/Cobra sport seats, and a piece of thin gray carpeting secured by Velcro covered the bare hatch and rear seat area.{{r|PbSVT|p=64}} The deletion of all this equipment shed some 450 pounds, but it was somewhat offset by the necessary addition of heavy-duty hardware to enable the car to handle the rigors of competition.{{r|PbSVT|p=64}}

To stiffen the chassis, a strut tower brace was installed to tie the cowl together, and a pair of V-braces (used on all 1983–1993 Mustang convertibles) attached in an X-pattern tied the subframes together.{{r|PbSVT|p=64}} The Cobra R featured Eibach springs that were a bit too stiff for the street, but perfect on a racetrack.{{r|PbSVT|p=62}} The Cobra R also benefitted from the adjustable Koni shocks and struts, helping to cement the car's reputation as a serious driving machine.{{r|PbSVT|p=62}}

The car also featured massive 13" Kelsey-Hayes vented rotors in front and 10.5" vented rotors in back.{{r|PbSVT|p=64}} According to Neil W. Ressler, the executive director of vehicle engineering for Ford Motor Company at the time and one of the founding fathers of SVT, the 1993 Cobra R's brakes ''"were the most expensive brakes ever fitted to a'' [production] ''Mustang. I bought the brakes for the R model out of my engineering budget. I wanted big brakes, and we didn't have them. The program couldn't afford it. Unbeknownst to the higher-ups at Ford, I spent like $2,100 per car to buy those big brakes. But the last thing I wanted was a fast car that didn't stop. We ended up putting good brakes on all those'' [Cobra R] ''vehicles."''{{r|PbSVT|p=64}}

The same 5.0L V8 from the street-spec Cobra was used in the race-ready Cobra R. However, the radiator was unique to the Cobra R, and a purge tank was installed for improved cooling. A power steering cooler (located behind the left foglight bezel) and an engine oil cooler were standard.{{r|PbSVT|p=64}}

The Cobra R wheels were actually the optional 17" x 8" five-lug wheels from the soon-to-be-released 1994 Mustang GT, but they were painted gloss black with a chrome lug cover. The wheels were wrapped with Goodyear Gatorbacks, which were the standard Cobra tires. To give the car better front-end geometry, lower control arms from the 1994 Mustang were fitted.{{r|PbSVT|p=62}}

Contrary to SVT's stated wishes, many of these Cobra R models were purchased by private collectors and never actually driven, but several competed successfully in the [[International Motor Sports Association]] (IMSA) Firestone Grand Sport Series and [[Sports Car Club of America]] (SCCA) World Challenge Class B Series.{{r|MSE|p=126}} Of the three Cobra R models produced, the 1993 model had the benefit of being the lightest and the smallest.{{r|PbSVT|p=64}}

Only 107 of these Cobra R models were produced, and all were painted in Vibrant Red Clearcoat. According to Ford's official announcement on April 7, 1993, the Cobra R was produced to take the Fox-bodied Mustang out in grand style, a "best of the last" model.{{r|MSE|p=126}} According to SVT, each one could go 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph in 5.7 seconds and do a top speed of 140&amp;nbsp;mph.{{r|PbSVT|p=152}} With the 1993 SVT Cobra, the 1993 SVT Cobra R, and the 1993 [[Ford F-Series#SVT Lightning|SVT F-150 Lightning]] combined for a freshman effort, Ford's Special Vehicle Team appeared to be off to a good start in producing some of the most instantly collectible Fords from this time period.

=== 1994 ===

Ford introduced the newly-redesigned 1994 Mustang in December 1993.{{r|PbSVT|p=31}} It was the first major redesign since the Fox-bodied Mustang bowed for 1979. Known as Fox-4 (because it was based on the Fox platform as a 1994 model), the new 1994 Mustang was a vast improvement over the outgoing 1993 model.{{r|PbSVT|p=31}} The new car's ride, handling, styling, ergonomics, and standard and optional equipment were all a major step forward from the previous model. As nice as the new 1994 Mustang was, it still left Ford enthusiasts yearning for more power. The [[Chevrolet Camaro#Fourth generation: 1993.E2.80.932002|Chevrolet Camaro Z/28]] and [[Pontiac Firebird#Fourth generation .281993.E2.80.932002.29|Pontiac Firebird Formula and Trans Am]], all redesigned for 1993, came standard with {{convert|275|hp|abbr=on}}.{{r|PbSVT|p=31}} The 1994 Mustang GT engine only put out {{convert|215|hp|abbr=on}}.{{r|PbSVT|p=34}} Thus, a new SVT Cobra model was needed to bridge that performance gap.

The 1994 Cobra was introduced midway through the model year with the same beefed-up engine from the 1993 Cobra. With its GT-40 cast-iron heads and lower intake and its Cobra-specific upper intake,{{r|PbSVT|p=36}} power increased incrementally to {{convert|240|hp|abbr=on}}.{{r|PbSVT|p=34}} However, the actual output of the Cobra's GT-40 enhanced engine was probably higher.{{r|PbSVT|p=34}} Ford claimed a modest 6.3 seconds to hit 60&amp;nbsp;mph and a top speed of 140&amp;nbsp;mph. ''Muscle Mustangs &amp; Fast Fords'' magazine tested a 1994 Cobra coupe and ran 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph in 5.7 seconds and the quarter mile in 13.87 seconds at 99.49&amp;nbsp;mph.{{r|PbSVT|p=36}}

Initially, the 1994 SVT Cobra was only available as a coupe, but the first factory-produced SVT Cobra convertible was the [[Ford Mustang SVT Cobra#1994 Indy 500 Pace Car Replica|1994 Indy 500 Pace Car Replica]]. On the same day that the new 1994 Cobra coupe was launched, SVT announced that it would be building a Cobra convertible (the first factory-produced "Cobra" convertible since the 1970 Shelby models) and that this new convertible had been selected to pace the 1994 Indianapolis 500 (see the next section).{{r|PbSVT|p=36}} The new Cobra convertible, or Indy 500 Pace Car Replica, was made available later in the 1994 model year.

==== ''SVT Cobra versus Mustang GT'' ====

If the 1993 Cobra and Cobra R laid the groundwork for super performance, then the 1994 Cobra began the tradition of offering refinements and subtle touches that made the car stand apart from its lesser Mustang brethren. Every subsequent model year, SVT's hallmarks of performance, substance, exclusivity, and value were met and exceeded, and the 1994 Cobra started this pattern of raising the bar over each previous model year.{{r|PbSVT|p=10}}

According to Jim Campisano's finely-written book ''Powered by SVT: Celebrating a Decade of Ford Performance,'' below is a list of items that set the 1994 SVT Cobra apart from the run-of-the-mill 1994 Mustang GT:{{r|PbSVT|p=33}}

'''Body and Appearance Components'''
* Unique front fascia with round foglights (versus rectangular on GT).
* Unique complex-reflector headlights (Cobra only).
* Chrome Cobra badges on front fenders (versus GT emblems).
* Unique rear spoiler with integrated LED stop lamp (versus the non-LED stop lamp integrated into the decklid on GT).
* 160-mph speedometer, white-faced instrument gauges, and black lettering (versus 150-mph speedometer, black-faced gauges, and white lettering in GT).
* Leather-wrapped shift knob, boot, and parking brake (Cobra only).
* Magnesium front seat-cushion frames (Cobra only).
* Unique Cobra floor mats.

'''Engine and Chassis'''
* GT-40-style 5.0L Cobra V8 engine (versus High Output 5.0L V8 on GT).
* 13" vented front disc brakes, 11.65" rear discs with dual-piston calipers, and standard ABS (versus 10.8" vented front discs, 10.5" rear discs with single-piston calipers, and optional ABS on GT).
* Unique 17" x 8" cast-aluminum wheels.
* Standard Goodyear GS-C P255/45ZR17 tires (versus Goodyear Eagle P225/55ZR16 standard on GT, P245/45ZR17 optional on GT).
* Unique chassis tuning.

==== ''Paint and Interior Trim'' ====

The 1994 Cobra was available in three exterior paint colors,&lt;ref name = "1994 SVT MC"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford Motor Company|first1=New Vehicle Brochure|title=1994 Ford SVT Mustang Cobra|date=Nov 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; as shown in the table below. Interior color choices were Black cloth, Saddle cloth, Black leather, and Saddle leather.&lt;ref name = "1994 SVT MC"/&gt; On the 1994 Cobra convertible (see the next section about the [[Ford Mustang SVT Cobra#1994 Indy 500 Pace Car Replica|1994 Indy 500 Pace Car Replica]]), the vinyl top was only available in saddle,{{r|MSE|p=17}} and this convertible top was the same one used on regular Mustang convertibles.

=== 1994 Indy 500 Pace Car Replica ===

The Ford Mustang turned 30 years old in 1994 and was met with corporate-sponsored enthusiasm. As a demonstration of this renewed enthusiasm, a trio of SVT Cobra convertibles served as pace cars for the [[1994 Indianapolis 500|78th Indianapolis 500]] race on May 29, 1994. The three cars were modified by [[Jack Roush]] at his shop in Allen Park, Michigan, for heavy-duty pacing on race day. The pace cars were installed with heavy-duty four-speed automatic transmissions, 15-gallon racing fuel cells, heavier rear springs (to accommodate the weight of television camera equipment), a Halon fire-extinguisher system, a rollbar with 50,000-watt strobe lights built in, and special lights in the rear spoiler. [[Parnelli Jones]], a seven-time Indy 500 competitor who won the 1963 race, drove the official pace car at the event.{{r|MSE|p=15, 17}}

To commemorate the special occasion, SVT produced 1,000 Indy 500 Pace Car Replicas for the buying public. All 1,000 cars were painted Rio Red and fitted with Saddle leather interiors and matching Saddle vinyl tops. These special editions had the Indy 500 winged-tire logo emblazoned as a chrome cloisonné badge on the decklid and embroidered on the front seatbacks. A set of "Official Pace Car" decals came with each special-edition Cobra. These decals were not installed at the factory; rather, they were shipped inside the trunk and left to the buyer's discretion to install them.{{r|MSE|p=15–7}} There was one very small difference between the decals worn by the three official pace cars and the replicas' decals. The tire logo on the official decals was white, and on the replica decals, it was gray.{{r|MRB|p=153}}

The 1994 SVT Mustang Cobra was only the third Ford Mustang chosen for [[Indianapolis 500 pace cars|official pace car duties at the Indianapolis 500 race]]. The other two Mustangs that served as official Indy 500 pace cars were [[Ford Mustang#First generation .281964.C2.BD.E2.80.931973.29|the very first Mustang in 1964]] and [[Ford Mustang#Third generation .281979.E2.80.931993.29|the newly-redesigned Fox-bodied Mustang in 1979]].{{r|CBM|p=15}}

=== 1995 ===

The 1995 Cobra was essentially a carryover of the 1994 model. The chrome SVT badge on the decklid was new for all SVT vehicles this year. A new vertical spat was added to the leading edge of each rocker panel extension to prevent rock damage to the lower body.{{r|CBM|p=283}}

The Cobra convertible returned this year for a limited production run of 1,003 units, and all were painted Black and fitted with Saddle leather interiors and Black convertible tops. Newly available for the 1995 Cobra convertible was a removable hardtop option. This was a one-year-only option due to its $1,825 price and 90 pounds of additional weight; thus, only 499 of the 1,003 Cobra convertibles built this year had this option. Removing or installing the hardtop was a two-person job, and this hardtop could not easily fit any other Mustang or Cobra convertible from this vintage due to the latching mechanisms of the fiberglass top and the dome light wiring. Included with this option, a convenient carrier that rolled on four casters allowed for easier storage of the hardtop when it was not being used. This hardtop option was originally supposed to be an available option for the all-new 1994 Mustang convertible, but it was delayed due to supply problems and quality-control concerns.{{r|CBM|p=283}} This hardtop option was also available on the 1995 Mustang GT convertible.

The biggest news for 1995 was the return of the street-legal, race-ready [[Ford Mustang SVT Cobra#1995 Cobra R|SVT Cobra R]] (see the next section).

==== ''Paint and Interior Trim'' ====

=== 1995 Cobra R ===
In the wake of the '93 R's unexpected success, SVT engineers developed a more powerful R-model based on the 1995 Cobra. Top priority became addressing customer requests for a larger, more powerful engine and more fuel capacity. In response to those requests, SVT replaced the Cobra's 5.0 L V8 with an SVT modified version of Ford's 5.8 liter Windsor V8, re-engineered to produce {{convert|300|hp}} and installed a 22-gallon fuel cell. To handle the torque of the more powerful engine, a Tremec 3550 5-speed manual transmission was installed. See also 5-speed [[Borg-Warner T-5 transmission|T-5]] [[manual transmission|manual]]. Again, weight-savings was targeted, so there was no back seat, radio, power windows/seats or air-conditioning—not even fog lights, which were omitted to provide ducts for getting cool air onto the front disk brakes. Heavy-duty progressive-rate springs, thicker stabilizer bars and a front strut tower brace helped improve handling on the racetrack. The 95 R was available only in white with saddle cloth interior, each with a unique center-tiered fiberglass hood tall enough to clear the engine and induction system. Only 250 vehicles were built; Ford kept 18 examples for its press and engineering fleets.

Unlike the 93 Cobra R, one could only obtain a 95 R if they held a valid competition license (or owned a race team).  This provision was added after Ford discovered that most of the 93 R's that were sold ended up in the hands of collectors.  Nevertheless, several 95 R's found their way into collectors' hands.

=== 1996 ===

For 1996, Ford finally retired the aging [[Ford small block engine#302|5.0L]] V8 in the Mustang GT and SVT Cobra, replacing it with a new aluminum 4.6L [[DOHC]] [[Ford Modular engine|modular]] unit that was smoother and had slightly better fuel economy.{{r|PbSVT|p=36, 38}} Starting with the 1996 model year, every Cobra engine was hand-assembled by two-person teams at the [[Ford Romeo Engine Plant]] in Romeo, Michigan, a practice that continued through the remainder of SVT Cobra production.{{r|PbSVT|p=37}} Each engine had a label (later, a metal plaque on the 2003–2004 Cobra engines) bearing the names and signatures of the two engine builders.{{r|CBM|p=288}} The Romeo engine,{{r|PbSVT|p=38}} as it was called, produced {{convert|305|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|300|lb.ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque, enabling the new Cobra to go 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph in 5.9 seconds and do the quarter mile in 13.99 seconds at 101.6&amp;nbsp;mph.{{r|PbSVT|p=151}} However, ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine was able to hit 60&amp;nbsp;mph in 5.4 seconds and the quarter mile in 14.00 seconds at 102&amp;nbsp;mph during a comparison test in their December 1995 issue.{{r|PbSVT|p=41}} The 1996 Cobra engine redlined at 6,800 rpm, with fuel shut-off occurring at 7,000 rpm.&lt;ref name="1996 SVT MC"&gt;{{cite book|title=1996 Ford SVT Mustang Cobra|last1=Ford Motor Company|first1=New Vehicle Brochure|date=July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford's modular V8 debuted in the all-new 1992 [[Ford Crown Victoria]] as a single-overhead-cam (SOHC) setup, and then the engine really displayed its power potential with 32 valves, dual overhead cams (DOHC), and {{convert|285|hp|abbr=on}} in the all-new 1993 [[Lincoln Mark VIII]].{{r|PbSVT|p=38}}

The modular engine's aluminum block was cast in Italy by Teksid, a firm that produces parts for Ferrari and Formula One racers.{{r|PbSVT|p=38}} SVT fitted the 1996 Cobra with the [[Borg Warner]] T-45 5-speed [[manual transmission]],&lt;ref name = "1996 SVT MC"/&gt; which was also used in the Mustang GT.{{r|MSE|p=73}} (Tremec bought the production rights for the T-45 in late 1998, although the unit remained unchanged in terms of strength.){{r|MRB|p=169}}

==== ''Paint and Interior Trim'' ====

The 1996 Cobra was available in four exterior paint colors, as shown in the table below. Interior color choices were the same as before: Black cloth, Saddle cloth, Black leather, and Saddle leather. On Cobra convertibles, the vinyl top was available in black, saddle, or white, and this convertible top was the same one used on regular Mustang convertibles.&lt;ref name = "1996 SVT MC"/&gt;

=== 1996 Mystic Cobra ===

To promote the technological advances and mechanical achievements of its new modular engine, Ford introduced the Mystic Cobra for 1996, which featured high-tech, color-shifting paint formulated by BASF. Utilizing color-shifting ChromaFlair pigments from Flex Products, the Mystic paint shifted from green to amber to gold to purple depending on the angle and the availability of light.{{r|MSE|p=72–4}} The research and development process for this paint took three years to complete.{{r|CBM|p=287}} Only available on the Cobra coupe, the Mystic paint option cost only '''$815''' at the time, and the 1996 Mystic Cobra was the first production vehicle to wear a color-shifting factory paint job.{{r|MSE|p=74}} Only 1,999 Mystic Cobras were produced,{{r|MSE|p=74}} and of these, 1,990 had black leather interiors and nine had black cloth interiors.{{r|PbSVT|p=146–7}}{{r|MRB|p=161}} Since the paint continues to have special proprietary uses, any remaining quantities are tightly controlled and thus require a VIN verification through a complying Ford body shop to obtain the special paint in order to repaint any damaged areas.&lt;ref&gt;SVT Cobra Recognition Guide, 1996 SVT News pamphlet&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1997 ===

The 1997 Cobra was basically a carryover of the 1996 model. Only an astute observer noticed that the honeycomb grille from before was now absent to allow more airflow into the larger radiator included across the entire Mustang lineup,{{r|CBM|p=290}} and the 1997 Cobra had a larger diameter fan. Also new was a parallel-flow air conditioning condenser that was exclusive to the SVT Cobra.{{r|MRB|p=164}} The rear spoiler was now optional, as it had been standard on all previous models.{{r|CBM|p=290}}

==== ''Paint and Interior Trim'' ====

The only other major changes for 1997 was in the color palette. The 1997 Cobra was available in four exterior colors, as shown in the table below. The interior choices were the same as what was offered in 1996: Black cloth, Saddle cloth, Black leather, and Saddle leather. On Cobra convertibles, the vinyl top was again available in black, saddle, or white, and this convertible top was the same one used on regular Mustang convertibles.&lt;ref name="1997 SVT MC"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford Motor Company|first1=New Vehicle Brochure|title=1997 Ford SVT Mustang Cobra|date=Aug 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1998 ===

The 1998 Cobra continued to remain virtually unchanged from previous model years. One noticeable change was the wheels, which were similar to the cast-aluminum units used on the 1995 Cobra R.{{r|CBM|p=291}} Only this time, the wheel cutouts were painted gray,{{r|MRB|p=166}} and the wheels measured 17" x 8", instead of 17" x 9" on the 1995 Cobra R.{{r|PbSVT|p=151–2}} The wheels continued to be wrapped in the same BF Goodrich Comp T/A tires from before.{{r|PbSVT|p=151–2}} Other minor changes included a redesigned console in which the dashboard-mounted digital clock pod was deleted, and the clock function was then integrated into the radio's digital display.{{r|MRB|p=166}} Also, the standard premium sound system now included a single-disc CD player.{{r|MRB|p=166}}

This was also the last year of the return-style fuel system, as it was replaced with a newer returnless system for 1999.

==== ''Paint and Interior Trim'' ====

The 1998 Cobra was available in five exterior colors,&lt;ref name="1998 SVT MC"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford Motor Company|first1=New Vehicle Brochure|title=1998 Ford SVT Mustang Cobra|date=Aug 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; as shown in the table below. Chrome Yellow was added midyear on the 1998 Cobra.&lt;ref name="1998 SVT MC"/&gt;{{r|PbSVT|p=41}} The interior choices were the same as before: Black cloth, Saddle cloth, Black leather, and Saddle leather.&lt;ref name="1998 SVT MC"/&gt; However, the leather pattern changed.{{r|MRB|p=166}} On Cobra convertibles, the vinyl top was again available in black, saddle, or white,&lt;ref name="1998 SVT MC"/&gt; and this convertible top was the same one used on regular Mustang convertibles.

=== 1999 ===
For the 1999 model year, Ford restyled the fourth-generation [[Ford Mustang|Mustang]] utilizing Ford's "''[[New Edge]]''" design language.{{r|PbSVT|p=44, 47}}{{r|CBM|p=293}} The facelifted car featured newly redesigned body panels that followed Ford's new worldwide styling direction. Thus, the interior was basically a carryover from the 1994–1998 Mustangs, and most of the parts were interchangeable. All 1999–2004 SVT Cobras featured independent rear suspension, unique to only the Cobra.&lt;ref name="1999 SVT MC"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford Motor Company|first1=New Vehicle Brochure|title=1999 Ford SVT Mustang Cobra|date=Dec 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new returnless fuel system was used which helped Ford meet tightening emission standards.

The new 1999 Cobra had an upgraded 4.6L DOHC V8 engine rated at {{Convert|320|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|317|lb.ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque.&lt;ref name="1999 SVT MC"/&gt; However, when the new 1999 Cobras were put through their paces by their new owners, it was revealed that 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph times were slower than a comparably-equipped 1998 model, and dyno tests suggested that the advertised power output was closer to {{Convert|285|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, even though Ford claimed that the engine was outputting 15&amp;nbsp;hp more than the 1998 Cobra engine. Due to this outcry, on August 6, 1999, Ford halted the sales of all unsold 1999 Cobras on dealership lots and recalled all 1999 Cobras that had been sold. Ford replaced the intake manifold, certain computer components, and the exhaust system from the catalytic converters to the tailpipes in order to achieve a "true" 320&amp;nbsp;hp at the crankshaft.{{r|PbSVT|p=47}}&lt;ref name = "IFLF"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moriarty|first1=Frank|title=Iron Fist, Lead Foot|date=2006|publisher=IUniverse|location=Lincoln, NE|isbn=978-0-595-40970-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}}{{r|CBM|p=294}}

==== ''Paint and Interior Trim'' ====

The 1999 Cobra was available in four exterior paint colors, as shown in the table below. Interior color choices were limited to two offerings: Dark Charcoal and Medium Parchment. The standard leather seats were the same optional leather units used in the 1999 Mustang GT, but without the embroidered running pony logo on the front seatbacks. Cloth seats were no longer offered on the Cobra, as they were never popular with buyers in previous model years. On Cobra convertibles, the vinyl top was available in black, parchment, or white, and this convertible top was the same one used on regular 1999 Mustang convertibles.&lt;ref name="1999 SVT MC"/&gt;

=== 2000 Cobra R ===

For 2000, the SVT Cobra R returned for a limited production run of 300 units.&lt;ref name="2000 SVT MC"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford Motor Company|first1=New Vehicle Brochure|title=2000 Ford SVT Mustang Cobra|date=Dec 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|MRB|p=170–1}} As the standard 2000 Cobra was cancelled due to problems with the 1999 Cobras, the Cobra R was SVT's sole high-performance Mustang for the 2000 model year. The new Cobra R came standard with a {{cvt|5409|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} [[DOHC]] [[V8 engine]] with a 6,500&amp;nbsp;rpm [[redline]] that was rated at {{Convert|385|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,700 rpm and {{Convert|385|lbft|abbr=on}} of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] at 4,500 rpm.{{r|PbSVT|p=152–3}} However, independent dyno tests have shown that the Cobra R produced rear-wheel output that nearly matched both of those numbers, suggesting the engine may have been underrated. The cast iron block was based on the 5.4L block that Ford used in its trucks at the time.{{r|PbSVT|p=72}} The cylinder heads were later used in the 2005–2006 [[Ford GT]], albeit slightly modified.{{r|PbSVT|p=138–9}} Some sources claimed that the Australian FPV GT's engine was very similar to the Cobra R's mill. As with previous Cobra R models, the 2000 model was designed to be a race-ready, high-performance vehicle in a perfectly street-legal package; as such, it lacked many of the creature comforts that the standard Cobra enjoyed.{{r|PbSVT|p=77}} This model had no radio/audio equipment, no air conditioning, no cruise control, and no rear seat.&lt;ref name="2000 SVT MC"/&gt; Each of the 300 units produced featured a Performance Red exterior and a Dark Charcoal interior with cloth [[Recaro]] bucket seats.&lt;ref name="2000 SVT MC"/&gt;

The 2000 Cobra R had several distinguishing visual and performance features that set it apart from the standard 1999 or 2001 Cobra. The "power dome" hood, for instance, was taller than the standard Cobra hood, and it had gills that could be cut out to help reduce engine compartment temperatures.{{r|PbSVT|p=70}} The rear spoiler was tall and wide, providing much needed downforce at track speeds.{{r|PbSVT|p=77}} The Cobra R was equipped with Eibach springs that lowered the car 1.5&amp;nbsp;inches in front and 1.0&amp;nbsp;inch out back.{{r|PbSVT|p=78}}{{r|CBM|p=297}} This model also used Bilstein shocks and struts, Brembo 4-piston front calipers acting on 13-inch rotors cooled by large ducts, along with a race-style fuel cell that was clearly protruding under the Mustang V6-style rear bumper.{{r|PbSVT|p=78}}{{r|CBM|p=296–7}} The front fascia was adorned with a low-riding, removable [[splitter (automotive)|splitter]].{{r|PbSVT|p=77}} The wheels were also uniquely styled, silver-painted, five-spoke, {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on}} x {{convert|9.5|in|mm|adj=on}} alloys wrapped in aggressive BF Goodrich G-Force KD tires.{{r|PbSVT|p=78}}{{r|CBM|p=296–7}} The hand-built SVT engine employed special DOHC cylinder heads, a "trumpet-style" intake manifold, aggressive camshafts, short tube headers connected to Cobra catalysts, a Bassani X-pipe, and a unique Borla dual side-exiting exhaust system, which was necessitated by the large fuel cell.{{r|PbSVT|p=72, 77, 78}} This model also featured 3.55 gears, a Gerodisc hydro-mechanical differential with speed and torque sensitivity, and a Tremec T-56 6-speed manual transmission that was closely geared for drag racing or road course usage.{{r|PbSVT|p=78}}{{r|CBM|p=296}} Despite these close ratios, the 2000 Cobra R also enjoyed a 177&amp;nbsp;mph (282&amp;nbsp;km/h) top speed.{{r|PbSVT|p=153}}

A number of well-known makers of aftermarket performance parts for the Mustang were involved in this project, including [[Recaro]], [[Brembo]], McLeod, Eibach, [[BF Goodrich]], [[Tremec]],  Borla, [[Dana Holding Corporation|Dana]], [[Federal-Mogul|Federal Mogul]], and [[K&amp;N]] (among others).{{r|PbSVT|p=70–9}}{{r|CBM|p=296–8}}

The following is a list of parts on the 2000 Cobra R that differ from the standard 1999 Cobra:

'''Exterior'''
* Only available as a coupe.
* Only available in Performance Red (paint code ES).
* V6-style rear bumper with no exhaust cutouts.
* 20-gallon Fuel Safe fuel cell, visible from behind and the side.
* Borla side exhaust, since the standard exhaust would not fit due to the fuel cell.
* Large unique wing on the rear decklid.
* 18" five-spoke wheels.
* Removable splitter on the front fascia.
* Blacked-out headlights, which became standard on all 2001–2004 Mustangs.
* Omitted fog lights (air ducts to the front brakes instead).
* Special hood with large dome to clear the huge intake.
* Omitted antenna (covered with a black plastic piece).

'''Interior'''
* Only available in Dark Charcoal (trim code DW).
* Cloth-upholstered Recaro seats (manually adjustable).
* Backseat delete.
* No air conditioning.
* No radio.
* No cruise control.

'''Drivetrain'''
* 5.4L DOHC V8 engine based on Ford's truck engines.
* Tremec T-56 6-speed transmission.
* 3.55:1 gears.
* Hydro-mechanical lock differential.
* 13" Brembo vented brake disks with 4-piston calipers in the front.
* Vented brake disks in the rear.
* Special Eibach shocks and springs, lowering the car by 1.5" in front and 1.0" in rear.

'''A Quick Word on the 2000 SVT Cobra that never was...'''

Because of the 1999 Cobra performance debacle, the standard 2000 SVT Cobra was pulled from production, only to return in 2001 rated at a true 320&amp;nbsp;hp.{{r|PbSVT|p=47}}{{r|IFLF|p=8}}{{r|CBM|p=294}} The production run of the 2000 SVT Cobra R (see below) went ahead without issue. Ford still printed brochures for the 2000 Cobra, with a print date of December 1999, four months after the 2000 model was officially cancelled. The reason for this was because these brochures talked about the upcoming 2000 Cobra R.

According to the 2000 Cobra brochure, if the 2000 Cobra had been produced, it would have been available in six exterior paint colors: Crystal White Clearcoat, Ebony (Black) Clearcoat, Laser Red Tinted Clearcoat, Medium Atlantic Blue Clearcoat Metallic, Silver Clearcoat Metallic, and (most notable) Mystic Gold.&lt;ref name="2000 SVT MC"/&gt; Apparently, Mystic Gold was supposed to be available in limited numbers late in the model year.&lt;ref name="2000 SVT MC"/&gt; After the 1996 Mystic Cobra, the 2000 Mystic Gold Cobra would have been the second time that a color-shifting paint was used on the Cobra. It was said that the Mystic Gold paint had a color shift from burnt orange to gold to yellow to pale green. Unfortunately, Ford made some changes to the painting process for the 2001 model year, and the Mystic Gold paint was incompatible with the new process.{{r|PbSVT|p=48}} Thus, the 2000 Mystic Gold Cobra never saw the light of day, but a photograph of a prototype painted Mystic Gold will forever be memorialized in the 2000 Cobra brochure.&lt;ref name="2000 SVT MC"/&gt;

Aside from paint colors, the standard 2000 SVT Cobra was pretty much a carryover of the 1999 model. Even the interior was supposed to be the same as in 1999. Only two color choices, Dark Charcoal and Medium Parchment, were supposed to be offered again.&lt;ref name="2000 SVT MC"/&gt;

==== ''Paint and Interior Trim'' ====

The 2000 Cobra R was only available in one exterior paint color, as shown in the table below. The sole interior color choice was Dark Charcoal. The standard cloth Recaro bucket seats had a stylized red "R" with an intertwined Cobra logo embroidered on the front seatbacks.&lt;ref name="2000 SVT MC"/&gt;

=== 2001 ===
While the 2001 Cobra shared almost all the same components of the 1999 Cobra, some changes were made including:

[[File:TeksidCJW.jpg|thumb|right|A Teksid block]]
[[File:WAPCJW.jpg|thumb|right|A Windsor Aluminum Plant block]]
* The engine block was changed from the Teksid block to the Windsor Aluminum Plant (or WAP) block. The WAP block is regarded to be weaker than the previous Teksid block. Some 2001 Cobras received the Teksid block, either from the factory or as a replacement motor. In the pictures at right, note the extra ribs designed to impart strength to the weaker WAP. Also, note that the hatching in the valley of the Teksid is square, while the WAP has diagonal hatching.
* Revised cylinder heads. Cobra owners have reported a "ticking" or "pinging” noise coming from the driver-side head of their cars. Due to insufficient cooling around cylinders #6/#7/#8 which caused the valves to overheat and therefore seat improperly, Ford remedied the situation by issuing a technical service bulletin (TSB#03256/NHTSA#10008278 and TSB#03164/NHTSA#10003118) to remove and replace the affected heads with a version that featured improved coolant flow.
* Cobra-specific seats with a combination of leather bolsters, Alcantara (suede-like microfiber) inserts, and larger headrests.&lt;ref name="2001 SVT MC"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford Motor Company|first1=New Vehicle Brochure|title=2001 Ford SVT Mustang Cobra|date=Jan 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1999 Cobras had regular Mustang GT seats.
* A rear bumper that reads "COBRA"&lt;ref name="2001 SVT MC"/&gt; instead of "MUSTANG" like on the 1999 Cobra.
* A rear badge on the trunklid was changed to read "SVT"&lt;ref name="2001 SVT MC"/&gt; instead of "SVT COBRA" like on the 1999 Cobra.
* A new steering wheel and an upgraded Mach audio system.&lt;ref name="2001 SVT MC"/&gt;
* The wheels for both the 1999 and 2001 Cobras were 17" x 8". Silver-powdercoated, five-spoke aluminum wheels were available in 1999 and 2001, and chrome wheels of the same design were an available option for the 2001 Cobra.&lt;ref name="2001 SVT MC"/&gt;
* The Tremec T-45 transmission in 1999 was replaced by the [[Tremec TR-3650 transmission]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="2001 SVT MC"/&gt;
* The axleshafts and differential were changed from 28 splines in 1999 to 31 splines in 2001.&lt;ref name="2001 SVT MC"/&gt;
* The rear decklid spoiler was redesigned.&lt;ref name="2001 SVT MC"/&gt;
* The 1999 two-piece audio unit consisting of a radio with tape deck and a separate single-CD player was upgraded to a larger, single-face, 6-disc unit in 2001.&lt;ref name="2001 SVT MC"/&gt;
* The center console and trim were redesigned.&lt;ref name="2001 SVT MC"/&gt;
* The buttons for the fog lights, the rear window defroster, and the anti-skid system were moved to a panel below the new radio unit.&lt;ref name="2001 SVT MC"/&gt;
* The emergency brake was fitted with a boot of leather to cover the cutout in the console.&lt;ref name="2001 SVT MC"/&gt;
* The headlights were changed from a chrome background to a black background.&lt;ref name="2001 SVT MC"/&gt; The newer headlights are sometimes referred to as "smoked" or "tinted", but this only refers to the black background. The actual lenses are clear for both years. These blacked-out headlights were actually first used on the 2000 Cobra R and then across the entire Mustang lineup for the 2001 model year.
* The color of the odometer digits and instrument cluster lighting was slightly changed.&lt;ref name="2001 SVT MC"/&gt;

With the above list of changes, the 2001 Cobra was able to go 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph in 5.4 seconds and do the quarter mile in 13.8 seconds at 102&amp;nbsp;mph. The cars were electronically limited to a top speed of 150&amp;nbsp;mph.{{r|PbSVT|p=152}}

==== ''Paint and Interior Trim'' ====

The 2001 Cobra was available in eight exterior paint colors, as shown in the table below. There were only two interior color choices: Dark Charcoal (the interior environment was Dark Charcoal, and the seats had Dark Charcoal leather bolsters with Medium Graphite Alcantara inserts) or Medium Parchment (the interior environment was Medium Parchment, but the seats had Chocolate Brown leather bolsters with Medium Parchment Alcantara inserts). In keeping with SVT's attention to detail, the Cobra emblem on the front seatbacks was embroidered in a somewhat darker color than the suede inserts to provide a subtle contrast. On Cobra convertibles, the vinyl top was available in black, parchment, or white, and this convertible top was the same one used on regular 2001 Mustang convertibles.&lt;ref name="2001 SVT MC"/&gt;

=== 2002 ===

Although many enthusiasts believe there were no 2002 Cobras, approximately 100 vehicles were partially built in the US and shipped to Australia for right-hand-drive conversion and final assembly by [[Ford Tickford Experience]] (FTE). The vehicles were based on the 2001-spec SVT Cobra.{{r|CBM|p=299}} Other changes included additional driving lights in the lower front fascia to meet Australian lighting specifications, and the steering wheel was moved to the right side of the car. This was part of a $4 million program by [[Ford Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.just-auto.com/analysis/ford-australia-invests-a4-million-to-build-250-right-hook-mustangs-a-year_id86706.aspx |title=Ford Australia Invests A $4 Million to Build 250 'Right-Hook' Mustangs a Year |date=15 Feb 2001 |accessdate=2013-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; to combat the rival [[Holden Monaro]], which eventually formed the basis of the reborn 2004–2006 [[Pontiac GTO]] in the U.S.

=== 2003 ===
Debuting in the spring of 2002, the 2003 Cobra came with a supercharged, 32-valve DOHC, 4.6-liter V8 engine rated at {{Convert|390|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|390|lb.ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque.&lt;ref name="2003 SVT MC"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford Motor Company|first1=New Vehicle Brochure|title=2003 Ford SVT Mustang Cobra|date=Jan 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Code-named "Terminator" by the SVT development crew led by John Coletti,{{r|IFLF|p=22}} numerous improvements were made to the powertrain and driveline to handle the power increase from the previous model's set-up. A cast-iron block was used, instead of the previous Teksid aluminum unit, with stronger internals including Zollner pistons and forged Manley H-beam connecting rods that were modified with a wrist pin oiling hole by the SVT engineers.&lt;ref name="2003 SVT MC"/&gt; These upgrades were critical in order to support the {{convert|8|psi|bar|abbr=on}} of boost delivered from the stock Eaton M-112 roots-type supercharger.&lt;ref name="2003 SVT MC"/&gt; Other improvements included the use of a lightweight aluminum flywheel connected to a [[Tremec T-56 transmission|Tremec T-56 six-speed transmission]], 3.55:1 rear axle ratio, and stronger 31-spline halfshafts with revised upper and lower control arms.&lt;ref name="2003 SVT MC"/&gt; These modifications enabled the Cobra to go 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph in 4.5 seconds and do the quarter mile in 12.67 seconds at 110.11&amp;nbsp;mph.{{r|PbSVT|p=152}} Although electronically-governed to a top speed of 153&amp;nbsp;mph, a factory-stock Terminator Cobra can reach a top speed of just under 180&amp;nbsp;mph if the governor is removed.

The 2003 Cobra boasted visual and functional improvements designed by Camilo Pardo, the chief designer of the 2005–2006 [[Ford GT]] supercar.{{r|IFLF|p=24–5}} These exterior differences included a new front fascia with an integrated spoiler and front brake air ducts, a new rear fascia with a black insert which visually integrated the exhaust pipes, a composite hood with dual functional heat extractors, newly designed side scoops, and foldable sideview mirrors painted in the matching body color.{{r|IFLF|p=26–30}} The side skirts were designed specifically for the Terminator Cobra body kit, featuring a smooth body line from the door to the bottom of the car. As a visual departure from the 1999, 2000 and 2001 Cobras (there was no 2002 Cobra model), which featured the Canadian Mustang taillights with separate amber turn signals, the 2003–2004 Cobras used standard red Mustang taillights with integrated turn signals. SVT also introduced new five-spoke 17" x 9" rims, available in standard machined-faced aluminum with metallic argent-painted pockets or optional chrome. Finally, the Terminator Cobra sported a new decklid spoiler with an integrated LED brake light, as opposed to the wing-type spoiler seen on previous Cobras and the standard Mustang V6 and GT models. It was optional to delete the spoiler, and the brake light was then integrated into the decklid using conventional bulbs.&lt;ref name="2003 SVT MC"/&gt;

==== ''Paint and Interior Trim'' ====

By the end of the model year, the 2003 Cobra was offered in ten exterior paint colors, but initially, it was available in seven colors. Early 2003 Cobras built between May and September 2002 were produced concurrently with the 2002 Mustang V6 and GT models. Since Satin Silver and Mineral Grey were 2002 colors, they were replaced with Silver Metallic and Dark Shadow Grey Metallic, respectively, at the start of regular 2003 Mustang production on September 29, 2002. Redfire Metallic replaced Torch Red only because it was a new color for the 2003 model year; however, Torch Red would make a comeback at the end of the model year on the [[Ford Mustang SVT Cobra#2003 10th Anniversary Edition|10th Anniversary Edition]] (see the next section). All 2003 Cobras had Dark Charcoal interiors. The seats were upholstered with Dark Charcoal Nudo leather bolsters and suede inserts in either Medium Graphite (light gray) or Medium Parchment (tan). The Cobra emblem on the front seatbacks was embroidered in a color that matched the suede inserts; however, on the 10th Anniversary Edition, this same emblem was embroidered in dark charcoal-colored thread to contrast with the special red leather inserts. On Cobra convertibles, the canvas convertible top was either black or parchment depending on the color of the chosen suede seat inserts, and on 10th Anniversary Edition convertibles, the canvas convertible top was only available in black.&lt;ref name="2003 SVT MC"/&gt;{{r|IFLF|p=162, 166}}

=== 2003 10th Anniversary Edition ===

For 2003, SVT offered a limited-edition 10th Anniversary Cobra to celebrate ten years since the introduction of the first SVT Mustang Cobra in 1993.{{r|PbSVT|p=61}}{{r|MSE|p=89–91}} The car featured unique seven-spoke, dark argent-painted, 17" alloy wheels; Dark Charcoal interior with Colorado Red leather inserts on the seats; red inserts in the door panels; red-painted brake calipers; and special 10th Anniversary badges on the decklid and floormats.&lt;ref name="2003 SVT MC"/&gt;{{r|PbSVT|p=61}} Also included was special carbon fiber-patterned leather wrapped around the shifter; emergency brake handle; and on the steering wheel at the 10, 2, and 6 o'clock positions.&lt;ref name="2003 SVT MC"/&gt;{{r|PbSVT|p=60}} The Anniversary model was the first Cobra to feature a steering wheel with grip humps at the 10 and 2 o'clock positions. SVT produced 2,003 (same number as the model year) units of the Anniversary model at the end of the model year during June and July 2003, totaling 1,003 coupes and 1,000 convertibles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Special Editions, 2003: 10th Anniversary | url=http://terminator-cobra.com/special_editions.htm| accessdate=30 Dec 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 10th Anniversary models were only available in three exterior colors: Black (775 models), Torch Red (734 models), and Silver Metallic (494 models).{{r|IFLF|p=163–4}} The 10th Anniversary Edition package (order code 375A) was a '''$1,495 option.'''{{r|MSE|p=89}}{{r|CBM|p=344}}

=== 2004 ===

[[File:2004 Ford SVT Cobra Mustang.jpg|thumb|right|2004 SVT Cobra coupe]]

The 2004 Cobra was a carryover of the 2003 Cobra but with a few minor updates, including a slightly updated exhaust system and rumors of a 20+ horsepower increase over the 2003 model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=2003-2004 Cobra Differences/Changes; SVTPerfomance | url=http://www.svtperformance.com/forums/showthread.php?188494-2003-2004-Cobra-differences-changes| accessdate=30 Dec 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of a newly integrated shift light negated the $1,000 gas guzzler tax that was charged on the 2003 models. One notable new option across the entire Ford lineup was the available Sirius satellite radio; the distinguishing feature between the 2003 and 2004 factory sound systems was the "SAT" button on the 2004 system.&lt;ref name="2004 Ford Mus"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford Motor Company|first1=New Vehicle Brochure|title=2004 Ford Mustang|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2004 Cobra was produced between November 2003&lt;ref name="SVTPR"&gt;{{Cite web| title=Ford SVT Press Release, 16 April 2003 | url=http://www.mystichrome.com/about/page2.html| accessdate=30 Dec 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and March 2004. It was a short model year for the 2004 Terminator Cobra, as well as the entire 2004 Mustang lineup, due to a number of reasons. The 2004 Mustangs and Cobras were the last Mustangs to be built at Ford's historic [[Dearborn Assembly Plant]] in Dearborn, Michigan, and Ford Motor Company had made the decision to end Mustang production there rather than updating the plant for the 2005 models. Thus, 2004 production was scheduled to wrap up by May 2004. Another reason was the hype over the all-new 2005 Mustang, which meant that Ford needed to start production as soon as possible at the newly updated [[Flat Rock Assembly Plant]] in Flat Rock, Michigan, then known as AutoAlliance International.{{r|IFLF|p=147–9, 166}}

==== ''Paint and Interior Trim'' ====

The 2004 Cobra was available in eight exterior paint colors,&lt;ref name="2004 SVT MC"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford Motor Company|first1=New Vehicle Brochure|title=2004 Ford SVT Mustang Cobra|date=July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; as shown in the table below. Zinc Yellow was replaced by Screaming Yellow&lt;ref name="2004 Ford Mus"/&gt; across the Mustang lineup for 2004; however, Sonic Blue Metallic and Dark Shadow Grey Metallic were still available on regular 2004 Mustangs.&lt;ref name="2004 Ford Mus"/&gt; The seats were upholstered with Dark Charcoal Nudo leather bolsters and suede inserts in either Dark Charcoal or Medium Graphite.&lt;ref name="2004 SVT MC"/&gt; Medium Parchment suede inserts were no longer offered. The Cobra emblem on the front seatbacks was embroidered in a medium graphite-colored thread regardless of the color of the suede seat inserts; however, on the [[Ford Mustang SVT Cobra#2004 Mystichrome Cobra|Mystichrome Cobra]] (see the next section), this same emblem was embroidered in dark charcoal-colored thread to contrast with the special Mystichrome leather inserts. On all 2004 Cobra convertibles, the canvas convertible top was only available in black, regardless of the color and material of the seat inserts.&lt;ref name="2004 SVT MC"/&gt;

=== 2004 Mystichrome Cobra ===

The limited-edition 2004 Mystichrome Cobra debuted at the 2003 New York International Auto Show&lt;ref name="FMCPR"&gt;{{Cite web| title=Ford Motor Company Press Release, 16 April 2003 | url=http://www.muscularmustangs.com/2005/svtcobramystic04press.php| accessdate=30 Dec 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside the 2004 40th Anniversary Mustang GT and V6 models. According to SVT's press release, the Mystichrome Cobra was produced to help commemorate the Mustang's 40th anniversary year.&lt;ref name="SVTPR"/&gt; SVT had recognized the importance of this milestone, and shortly after the success of the 1996 Mystic Cobra, SVT worked with Ford's product planners and outside vendors to build the ultimate special edition Cobra.&lt;ref name="FMCPR"/&gt; DuPont was commissioned to work on an improved formulation of color-shifting paint that would be easier to use and match. The resulting Mystichrome paint, sold to BASF who finally supplied the paint to Ford, contained ChromaFlair pigments that rendered a shift from a bright topaz green to cobalt blue, then to royal purple, and finally to a deep onyx black.&lt;ref name="FMCPR"/&gt; A high amount of metallic aluminum flakes were added to give the Mystichrome paint some sparkle. The paint is called "2004 Ford Mustang Cobra MystiChrome Metallic" and cost, at the time, about $150 per pint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=The Truth About Mystichrome Paint; SVTPerfomance | url=http://www.svtperformance.com/forums/terminator-talk-229/493729-truth-about-mystic-chrome-paint.html | accessdate=9 Aug 2013 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709102331/http://www.svtperformance.com/forums/terminator-talk-229/493729-truth-about-mystic-chrome-paint.html | archivedate=2009-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Mystichrome paint is still very expensive, any kind of exterior damage to the car is financially problematic. If a damaged Mystichrome Cobra requires repainting at a reputable Ford dealer's body shop, a Ford employee from Dearborn headquarters is required to bring the paint in person and supervise the usage of the special paint. The damaged car must be verified that it is a factory-built Mystichrome Cobra. Once the body shop is finished using the Mystichrome paint, all unused paint must be put back in the can and sealed, and the supervising Ford employee returns to Dearborn with the unused paint.

SVT worked with Garden State Tanning to produce the Mystichrome leather{{r|MSE|p=76}} found on the car's seat inserts and the steering wheel at the 10, 2, and 6 o'clock positions. The production process for the Mystichrome leather included tanning and dying the leather jet black, spraying the Mystichrome paint directly onto the leather, and sealing it with a clear layer to protect and prevent damage to the Mystichrome-painted leather.&lt;ref name="FMCPR"/&gt; Like the 2003 10th Anniversary Cobra, the Mystichrome Cobra featured a steering wheel with grip humps at the 10 and 2 o'clock positions. The Mystichrome Cobra came standard with the five-spoke 17" chrome wheels.&lt;ref name="2004 SVT MC"/&gt;

The Mystichrome Cobra was produced between December 2003 and January 2004. A total of 1,010 Mystichrome Cobras were produced, 515 coupes and 495 convertibles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=2004 Mystichrome Cobra Facts | url=http://www.mystichrome.com/about/page6.html| accessdate=30 Dec 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mystichrome Appearance Package (order code 68M), as it was officially called by Ford, was only a '''$3,650 option.'''&lt;ref name="SVTPR"/&gt;

A definitive history of the Terminator Cobra and John Coletti's SVT operations was captured in the non-fiction book ''Iron Fist, Lead Foot'' by Frank Moriarty.

The '''Ford Model T''' ([[colloquially]] known as the '''Tin Lizzie''', '''Leaping Lena''', '''jitney''' or '''flivver''') is an [[automobile]] produced by [[Ford Motor Company]] from October 1, 1908, to May 26, 1927.&lt;ref name="Ford Motors"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Model T Facts |url=https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2013/08/05/model-t-facts.html |publisher=Forid |location=US |accessdate=2013-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928165026/https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2013/08/05/model-t-facts.html |archive-date=2013-09-28 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gordon |first1=John Steele |authorlink=John Steele Gordon |title=10 Moments That Made American Business |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/1/2007_1_23.shtml |access-date=2017-03-18 |work=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]] |issue=February/March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420194514/http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/1/2007_1_23.shtml |archive-date=2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally regarded as the first affordable [[automobile]], that made car travel available to middle-class Americans. The relatively low price was partly the result of Ford's efficient fabrication, including [[assembly line]] production instead of individual hand crafting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Division of Labor, Assembly Line Thought – The Paradox of Democratic Capitalism|url=http://www.rationalrevolution.net/articles/division_of_labor.htm|last=Price|first=R. G.|publisher=RationalRevolution.net|date=2004-01-29|accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ford Model T was named the most influential car of the 20th century in the 1999 [[Car of the Century]] competition, ahead of the [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]] [[Mini]], [[Citroën DS]], and [[Volkswagen Beetle|Volkswagen Type 1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/24/automobiles/this-just-in-model-t-gets-award.html|newspaper=New York Times|last=Cobb|first=James G.|title=This Just In: Model T Gets Award|date=1999-12-24|accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford's Model T was successful not only because it provided inexpensive transportation on a massive scale, but also because the car signified innovation for the rising middle class and became a powerful symbol of the United States age of modernization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With 16.5&amp;nbsp;million sold, it stood eighth on the top ten list of most sold cars of all time, {{as of|2012|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2012/02/top-10-best-selling-cars-of-all-time.html |title=Top 10 Best Selling Cars of All Time|publisher=Autoguide.com|accessdate=2013-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[history of the automobile|automobiles had been produced from the 1880s]], until the Model T was introduced in 1908, they were mostly scarce, expensive, and often unreliable. Positioned as reliable, easily maintained, mass-market transportation, it was a runaway success.  In a matter of days after the release, 15,000 orders had been placed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Henry Ford|last = Curcio|first = Vincent|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0195316926|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first production Model T was built on August 12, 1908&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/27629/chronicle/1908.html |title=Chronicle of 1908 |publisher=Library.thinkquest.org |year=1908 |accessdate=2012-10-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211154043/http://library.thinkquest.org/27629/chronicle/1908.html |archivedate=2013-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and left the factory on September 27, 1908, at the [[Ford Piquette Avenue Plant]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]. On May 26, 1927, [[Henry Ford]] watched the 15&amp;nbsp;millionth Model T Ford roll off the assembly line at his [[Highland Park Ford Plant|factory in Highland Park, Michigan]].&lt;ref name=15million&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wiley.com/legacy/products/subject/business/forbes/ford.html |title=Henry Ford and the Model T |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1996 |accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry Ford conceived a series of cars between the founding of the company in 1903 and the introduction of the Model T. Ford named his first car the [[Ford Model A (1903–04)|Model A]] and proceeded through the alphabet up through the Model T, twenty models in all. Not all the models went into production. The production model immediately before the Model T was the [[Ford Model S|Model S]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ritzsite.nl/FORD_1/05_eford.htm |title=Early Ford-models from the years 1903–1908 |page=5 |first=André |last=Ritzinger |accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; an upgraded version of the company's largest success to that point, the [[Ford Model N|Model N]]. The follow-up to the Model T was the [[Ford Model A (1927–1931)|Ford Model A]], rather than the "Model U". The company publicity said this was because the new car was such a departure from the old that Ford wanted to start all over again with the letter A.

The Model T was Ford's first automobile [[mass production|mass-produced]] on moving assembly lines with completely [[interchangeable parts]], marketed to the [[American middle class|middle class]].&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984"&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Ford said of the vehicle:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I will build a motor car for the great multitude. It will be large enough for the family, but small enough for the individual to run and care for. It will be constructed of the best materials, by the best men to be hired, after the simplest designs that modern engineering can devise. But it will be so low in price that no man making a good salary will be unable to own one&amp;nbsp;– and enjoy with his family the blessing of hours of pleasure in God's great open spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922|p=73}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although credit for the development of the assembly line belongs to [[Ransom E. Olds]], with the first mass-produced automobile, the [[Oldsmobile Curved Dash]], having begun in 1901, the tremendous advances in the efficiency of the system over the life of the Model T can be credited almost entirely to the vision of Ford and his engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Domm|first=Robert W.|title=Michigan Yesterday &amp; Today|publisher=Voyageur Press|location=Minneapolis|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HQdTa9ZXlVAC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=Ransom+Olds+and+assembly+line&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bBlsTvDoBNG9tgf-uungBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a retroactive classification scheme; the concept of model years as understood today did not exist at the time. The nominal model designation was "Model T", although [[#Body|design revisions did occur]] during the car's two decades of production.

===Engine===
{{main article|Ford Model T engine}}
[[File:Fordsidevalve.jpg|thumb|Model T engine]]

The Model T had a front-mounted {{convert|177|cuin|L|1|adj=on}} [[inline-four engine|inline four-cylinder]] engine, producing {{convert|20|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, for a top speed of {{convert|40|–|45|mph|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtfca.com/coils/Coils.htm |title=The Model T Ignition Coil |first1=Trent E. |last1=Boggess |first2=Ronald |last2=Patterson |publisher=Plymouth State College |location=US |access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ford Motor Company, the Model T had fuel economy on the order of {{convert|13|-|21|mpgus|mpgimp L/100 km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="MediaFordCom"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2013/08/05/model-t-facts.html |title=Model T Facts |publisher=Ford |accessdate=2012-12-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928165026/https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2013/08/05/model-t-facts.html |archive-date=2013-09-28 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine was capable of running on gasoline, [[kerosene]], or [[Ethanol fuel|ethanol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/main.jhtml?xml=/motoring/2008/07/25/mnmodel125.xml |title=Ford Model T reaches 100 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=2008-07-25 |accessdate=2012-12-24 |first=Andrew |last=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journeytoforever.org/ethanol.html#ethintro |title=Ethanol fuel: Journey to Forever |first=Keith |last=Addison |work=Journey to Forever |accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the decreasing cost of gasoline and the later introduction of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] made ethanol an impractical fuel for most users. The engines of the first 2,447 units were cooled with [[pump|water pumps]]; the engines of unit 2,448 and onward, with a few exceptions prior to around unit 2,500, were cooled by [[thermosiphon|thermosiphon action]].&lt;ref name="Kimes1989p551"&gt;{{Harvp|Kimes|Clark Jr.|1989|p=551}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ignition system]] used in the Model T was an unusual one, with a low-voltage [[magneto]] incorporated in the flywheel, supplying alternating current to [[trembler coil]]s to drive the [[spark plug]]s. This was closer to that used for stationary [[gas engine]]s than the expensive high-voltage [[ignition magneto]]s that were used on some other cars. This ignition also made the Model T more flexible as to the quality or type of fuel it used. The system did not need a starting battery, since proper hand-cranking would generate enough current for starting. Electric lighting powered by the magneto was adopted in 1915, replacing acetylene and oil lamps, but electric starting was not offered until 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.modelt.ca/history |title=History of the Ford Motor Company – Fast Facts |website=The Frontenac Motor Company &amp; The Ford Model T |access-date=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Model T engine was produced for replacement needs, as well as stationary and marine applications until 1941, well after production of the Model T had ended. 

The [[Fordson]] Model F tractor engine, that was designed about a decade later, was very similar to, but larger than, the Model T engine.&lt;ref name="Manly1919p268"&gt;{{Harvnb|Manly|1919|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmission and drive train===
[[File:Model T pedals.jpg|thumb|The three pedal controls of the Model{{nbsp}}T]]
[[File:1920 Ford Model T Controls (1495288990).jpg|thumb|View of the driver's controls, 1920 Model{{nbsp}}T]]
The Model T was a [[rear-wheel drive]] vehicle. Its [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] was a [[planetary gear]] type billed as "three speed". In today's terms it would be considered a two-speed, because one of the three speeds was reverse.

The Model T's transmission was controlled with three floor-mounted pedals and a lever mounted to the road side of the driver's seat. The [[throttle]] was controlled with a lever on the [[steering wheel]]. The left pedal was used to engage the transmission. With the floor lever in either the mid position or fully forward and the pedal pressed and held forward, the car entered low gear. When held in an intermediate position, the car was in neutral. If the left pedal was released, the Model T entered high gear, but only when the lever was fully forward – in any other position, the pedal would only move up as far as the central neutral position. This allowed the car to be held in neutral while the driver cranked the engine by hand. The car could thus cruise without the driver having to press any of the pedals.

The first 800 units were sent in reverse with a lever; all units after that were sent in reverse with a pedal between the [[car controls#Pedals|clutch and brake pedals]].&lt;ref name="Kimes1989p551"/&gt; The middle pedal was used to engage reverse gear when the car was in neutral. The right pedal operated the [[transmission brake]] – there were no brakes on the wheels. The floor lever also controlled the [[parking brake]], which was activated by pulling the lever all the way back. This doubled as an emergency brake.

Although it was uncommon, the drive bands could fall out of adjustment, allowing the car to creep, particularly when cold, adding another hazard to attempting to start the car: a person cranking the engine could be forced backward while still holding the crank as the car crept forward, although it was nominally in neutral. As the car utilized a [[wet clutch]], this condition could also occur in cold weather, when the thickened oil prevents the clutch discs from slipping freely. Power reached the [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]] through a single [[universal joint]] attached to a [[torque tube]] which drove the rear [[axle]]; some models (typically trucks, but available for cars, as well) could be equipped with an optional two-speed Ruckstell rear axle shifted by a floor-mounted lever which provided an underdrive gear for easier hill climbing. The heavy-duty ''[[Ford Model TT|Model TT]]'' truck chassis came with a special [[worm gear]] rear differential with lower gearing than the normal car and truck, giving more pulling power but a lower top speed (the frame was also stronger; the cab and engine were the same). A Model TT is easily identifiable by the cylindrical housing for the worm-drive over the axle differential. All gears were [[vanadium steel]] running in an oil bath.

====Transmission bands and linings====
Two main types of band lining material were used:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordmodelt.net/transmission.htm |title=Ford Model T Transmission |website=FordModelT.net |access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Cotton''' – Cotton woven linings were the original type fitted and specified by Ford.  Generally, the cotton lining is "kinder" to the drum surface, with damage to the drum caused only by the retaining rivets scoring the drum surface. Although this in itself did not pose a problem, a dragging band resulting from improper adjustment caused overheating of the transmission and engine, diminished power, and&amp;nbsp;– in the case of cotton linings&amp;nbsp;– rapid destruction of the band lining.
* '''Wood''' – Wooden linings were originally offered as a "longer life" accessory part during the life of the Model T. They were a single piece of steam bent wood and metal wire, fitted to the normal Model T transmission band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pagé|first=Victor Wilfred |date=1917 |title=The Model T Ford Car, Its Construction, Operation and Repair: A Complete Practical Treatise Explaining the Operating Principles of All Parts of the Ford Automobile, with Complete Instructions for Driving and Maintenance|page=241 |publisher=Norman W. Henley Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bands give a very different feel to the pedals, with much more of a "bite" feel. The sensation is of a definite "grip" of the drum and seemed to noticeably increase the feel, in particular of the brake drum.

===Suspension and wheels===
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2017}}
[[File:Ford model t suspension.triddle.jpg|thumb|The suspension components of a Ford Model T. The coil-spring device is an aftermarket accessory, the "Hassler shock absorber".]]

Model T suspension employed a transversely mounted semi-elliptical spring for each of the front and rear beam axles which allowed a great deal of wheel movement to cope with the dirt roads of the time.

The front axle was [[drop forged]] as a single piece of vanadium steel. Ford twisted many axles through eight full rotations (2880 degrees) and sent them to dealers to be put on display to demonstrate its superiority. The Model T did not have a modern service brake. The right foot pedal applied a band around a drum in the transmission, thus stopping the rear wheels from turning. The previously mentioned parking brake lever operated [[band brake]]s acting on the inside of the rear brake drums, which were an integral part of the rear wheel hubs. Optional brakes that acted on the outside of the brake drums were available from aftermarket suppliers.

Wheels were wooden [[artillery wheel]]s, with steel welded-spoke wheels available in 1926 and 1927.

Tires were [[Tire|pneumatic]] [[Clincher tire|clincher]] type, {{convert|30|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, {{convert|3.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} wide in the rear,  {{convert|3|in|cm|abbr=on}} in the front. Clinchers needed much higher pressure than today's tires, typically {{convert|60|psi|abbr=on}}, to prevent them from leaving the rim at speed. Horseshoe nails on the roads, together with the high pressure, made flat tires a common problem.

Balloon tires became available in 1925. They were {{convert|21|x|4.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} all around. Balloon tires were closer in design to today's tires, with steel wires reinforcing the tire bead, making lower pressure possible – typically {{convert|35|psi|abbr=on}} – giving a softer ride. The steering gear ratio was changed from 4:1 to 5:1 with the introduction of balloon tires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Model T Ford Service |publisher=Ford}}&lt;/ref&gt; The old nomenclature for tire size changed from measuring the outer diameter to measuring the rim diameter so {{convert|21|in|abbr=on}} (rim diameter) × {{convert|4.5|in|abbr=on}} (tire width) wheels has about the same outer diameter as 30 in (76&amp;nbsp;cm) clincher tires. All tires in this time period used an [[inner tube]] to hold the pressurized air; [[tubeless tire]]s were not generally in use until much later.

[[Wheelbase]] was 100&amp;nbsp;inches (254&amp;nbsp;cm) and standard track width was 56 inch (142&amp;nbsp;cm); 60 inch (152&amp;nbsp;cm) track could be obtained on special order, "for Southern roads", identical to [[Track gauge in the United States#5ft|the pre-Civil War track gauge]] for many railroads in the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. The standard 56 inch track being very near the standard {{frac|4 foot 8|1|2}} inch railroad track gauge meant that Model Ts could be and frequently were, fitted with flanged wheels and used as railway vehicles; the availability of a 60in (5ft) version meant the same could be done on the few remaining Southern 5ft railways (these being the only nonstandard lines remaining, except for a few narrow-gauge lines of various sizes).  Although a Model T could be adapted to run on track as narrow as 2ft gauge (Wiscasset, Waterville and Farmington RR, Maine has one), this was a more complex alteration.

===Colors===
By 1918, half of all the cars in the U.S. were Model Ts. In his autobiography, Ford reports that in 1909 he told his management team, "Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black."&lt;!-- DO NOT TRY TO COPY EDIT THIS QUOTE; IT IS ALREADY *VERBATIM* AND ALREADY ACCEPTABLY WRITTEN. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922|p=72}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the first years of production from 1908 to 1913, the Model T was not available in black&lt;ref name="McCalley 1994"&gt;{{Harvnb|McCalley|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but rather only gray, green, blue, and red.  Green was available for the touring cars, town cars, coupes, and Landaulets. Gray was only available for the town cars, and red only for the touring cars. By 1912, all cars were being painted midnight blue with black fenders. Only in 1914 was the "any color so long as it is black" policy finally implemented. It is often stated Ford suggested the use of black from 1914 to 1926 due to the low cost, durability, and faster drying time of black paint in that era. Paint choices in the American automotive industry, as well as in others (including locomotives, furniture, bicycles, and the rapidly expanding field of electrical appliances), were shaped by the development of the [[chemical industry]]. These included the disruption of dye sources during [[World War I]] and the advent, in the mid-1920s, of new [[Lacquer#Nitrocellulose lacquers|nitrocellulose lacquer]]s that were faster-drying and more scratch-resistant, and obviated the need for multiple coats;&lt;ref name="Dutton_1942"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dutton|1942}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|261–301}} understanding the choice of paints for the Model T era and the years immediately following requires an understanding of the contemporary chemical industry.&lt;ref name="Dutton_1942"/&gt;

During the lifetime production of the Model T, over 30 types of black paint were used on various parts of the car.&lt;ref name="McCalley 1994"/&gt; These were formulated to satisfy the different means of applying the paint to the various parts, and had distinct drying times, depending on the part, paint, and method of drying.

Although Ford classified the Model T with a single letter designation throughout its entire life and made no distinction by model years, enough significant changes to the body were made over the production life that the car may be classified into several style generations.  Among the most immediately visible and identifiable changes were in the hood and cowl areas, although many other modifications were made to the vehicle.
* 1909–1914 – Characterized by a nearly straight, five-sided hood, with a flat top containing a center hinge and two side sloping sections containing the folding hinges. The firewall was flat from the windshield down with no distinct cowl.
* 1915–1916 – The hood design was nearly the same five-sided design with the only obvious change being the addition of louvers to the vertical sides.  A significant change to the cowl area occurred with the windshield relocated significantly behind the firewall and joined with a compound-contoured cowl panel.
* 1917–1923 – The hood design was changed to a tapered design with a curved top. The folding hinges were now located at the joint between the flat sides and the curved top. This is sometime referred to as the "low hood" to distinguish it from the later hoods. The back edge of the hood now met the front edge of the cowl panel so that no part of the flat firewall was visible outside of the hood.  This design was used the longest and during the highest production years, accounting for about half of the total number of Model Ts built.
* 1923–1925 – This change was made during the 1923 calendar year, so models built earlier in the year have the older design, while later vehicles have the newer design.  The taper of the hood was increased and the rear section at the firewall is about an inch taller and several inches wider than the previous design.  While this is a relatively minor change, the parts between the third and fourth generations are not interchangeable.
* 1926–1927 – This design change made the greatest difference in the appearance of the car.  The hood was again enlarged, with the cowl panel no longer a compound curve and blended much more with the line of the hood.  The distance between the firewall and the windshield was also increased significantly.  This style is sometimes referred to as the "high hood".

The styling on the last "generation" was a preview for the following Model A, but the two models are visually quite different, as the body on the A was much wider and had curved doors as opposed to the flat doors on the T.

===Diverse applications===

When the Model T was designed and introduced, the infrastructure of the world was quite different from today's. Pavement was a rarity except for sidewalks and a few big-city streets. (The sense of the term "pavement" as equivalent with "sidewalk" comes from that era, when streets and roads were generally dirt and sidewalks were a paved way to walk along them.) Agriculture was the occupation of many people. [[Power tool]]s were scarce outside factories, as were power sources for them; electrification, like pavement, was found usually only in larger towns. [[Rural electrification]] and motorized [[mechanization]] were embryonic in some regions and nonexistent in most. Henry Ford oversaw the requirements and design of the Model T based on contemporary realities. Consequently, the Model T was (intentionally) almost as much a tractor and [[portable engine]] as it was an automobile. It has always been well regarded for its all-terrain abilities and ruggedness. It could travel a rocky, muddy farm lane, cross a shallow stream, climb a steep hill, and be parked on the other side to have one of its wheels removed and a pulley fastened to the hub for a [[flat belt]] to drive a [[bucksaw]], [[threshing machine|thresher]], silo blower, conveyor for filling [[corn crib]]s or haylofts, [[baler]], water pump, electrical generator, and many other applications. One unique application of the Model T was shown in the October 1922 issue of ''Fordson Farmer'' magazine. It showed a minister who had transformed his Model T into a mobile church, complete with small organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Casey|first=Robert|title=The Model T A Centennial History|url=https://archive.org/details/modeltcentennial0000case|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0-8018-8850-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/modeltcentennial0000case/page/148 148]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this era, entire automobiles (including thousands of Model Ts) were even hacked apart by their owners and reconfigured into custom machinery permanently dedicated to a purpose, such as [[Doodlebug tractor|homemade tractors]] and ice saws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1926 Ford Model T Ice Saw |url=http://owlshead.org/collections/detail/1926-ford-t-ice-saw |accessdate=2012-12-24 |publisher=Owl's Head Transportation Museum}} Used for harvesting winter ice from ponds in [[Maine]].&lt;/ref&gt; Dozens of [[aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] companies sold [[prefabrication|prefab]] kits to facilitate the T's conversion from car to tractor.&lt;ref name="PrippsMorland1993p28"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pripps|Morland|1993|p=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Model T had been around for a decade before the [[Fordson tractor]] became available (1917–18), and many Ts had been converted for field use. (For example, [[Harry Ferguson]], later famous for his hitches and tractors, worked on Eros Model T tractor conversions before he worked with Fordsons and others.) During the next decade, Model T tractor conversion kits were harder to sell, as the Fordson and then the [[Farmall]] (1924), as well as other light and affordable tractors, served the farm market. But during the [[Great Depression|Depression]] (1930s), Model T tractor conversion kits had a resurgence, because by then used Model Ts and junkyard parts for them were plentiful and cheap.&lt;ref name="Leffingwell2002pp43-51"&gt;{{Harvnb|Leffingwell|2002|pp=43–51}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many popular car engines of the era, the Model T engine was also used on home-built aircraft (such as the [[Pietenpol Sky Scout]]) and [[motorboat]]s.

An [[armored car (military)|armored-car]] variant (called the [[Ford FT-B|FT-B]]) was developed in Poland in 1920 due to the high demand during the [[Polish-Soviet war]] in 1920.

Many Model Ts were converted into vehicles which could travel across heavy snows with kits on the rear wheels (sometimes with an extra pair of rear-mounted wheels and two sets of [[continuous track]] to mount on the now-tandemed rear wheels, essentially making it a [[half-track]]) and skis replacing the front wheels. They were popular for rural mail delivery for a time.  The common name for these conversions of cars and small trucks was "snowflyers". These vehicles were extremely popular in the northern reaches of Canada, where factories were set up to produce them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yt8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA878 |title=Snowflyers Replace Dogs in Frozen North |work=Popular Mechanics |issue=December |year=1934 |page=878 |accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of companies built Model T–based [[railcar]]s.&lt;ref name=mtfca_Model_T_railcar&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Model T Ford Club of America |year=2011 |title=Model T Ford Forum: Forum 2011: Old Photo – Model T Rail Car |url=http://www.mtfca.com/discus/messages/179374/185052.html?1296125299 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Great Railway Bazaar]]'', Paul Theroux mentions a rail journey in India on such a railcar.

==Production==
===Mass production===
[[File:Ford assembly line - 1913.jpg|thumb|right|Ford assembly line, 1913]]
The knowledge and skills needed by a factory worker were reduced to 84 areas. When introduced, the T used the building methods typical at the time, assembly by hand, and production was small. The [[Ford Piquette Avenue Plant]] could not keep up with demand for the Model T, and only 11 cars were built there during the first full month of production. More and more machines were used to reduce the complexity within the 84 defined areas. In 1910, after assembling nearly 12,000 Model Ts, Henry Ford moved the company to the new [[Highland Park Ford Plant|Highland Park complex]]. During this time the Model T production system ([[Vertical integration|including the]] [[supply chain]]) transitioned into an iconic example of assembly line production.&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Abernathy/&gt; In subsequent decades it would also come to be viewed as the classic example of the rigid, first-generation version of assembly line production, as opposed to flexible mass production&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984"/&gt; of higher quality products.&lt;ref name=Abernathy&gt;{{cite web |last1=Abernathy |first1=William J. |last2=Wayne |first2=Kenneth |title=Limits of the Learning Curve |url=https://hbr.org/1974/09/limits-of-the-learning-curve |website=[[Harvard Business Review]] |date=1 September 1974 |quote=Ford’s objective was to reduce the price of the automobile and thereby increase volume and market share. &lt;br&gt; "Ford’s long devotion to the experience-curve strategy made the transition to another strategy difficult and very costly" (going from reducing Model T cost to increasing Model A price) "From the time it introduced the Model A, Ford was compelled to compete on the basis of product quality and performance — a strategy in which it was not skilled" &lt;br&gt; The rate of capital investment showed substantial increases after 1913, rising from 11 cents per sales dollar that year to 22 cents by 1921. The new facilities that were built or acquired included blast furnaces, logging operations and saw mills, a railroad, weaving mills, coke ovens, a paper mill, a glass plant, and a cement plant. &lt;br&gt; In its effort to keep reducing Model T costs while wages were rising, Ford continued to invest heavily in plant, property, and equipment. These facilities even included coal mines, rubber plantations, and forestry operations (to provide wooden car parts). By 1926, nearly 33 cents in such assets backed each dollar of sales, up from 20 cents just four years earlier, thereby increasing fixed costs and raising the break-even point. |url-access=limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, Ford's cars came off the line in three-minute intervals, much [[Experience curve effects|faster than previous methods]], reducing production time from 12.5 hours before to 93 minutes by 1914, while using less manpower.&lt;ref name="Georgano1985"&gt;{{Harvnb|Georgano|1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, Ford produced more cars than all other automakers combined. The Model T was a great commercial success, and by the time Ford made its 10 millionth car, half of all cars in the world were Fords. It was so successful Ford did not purchase any advertising between 1917 and 1923; instead, the Model T became so famous, people considered it a norm. More than 15&amp;nbsp;million Model Ts were manufactured in all, reaching a rate of 9,000 to 10,000 cars a day in 1925, or 2&amp;nbsp;million annually,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Martin |last=Sandler |title=Driving Around the USA: Automobiles in American Life |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Douglas |last=Brinkley |title=Wheels for the world: Henry Ford, his company, and a century of progress, 1903–2003 |url=https://archive.org/details/wheelsforworldhe00brin |url-access=registration |publisher=Viking |year=2003 |page=[https://archive.org/details/wheelsforworldhe00brin/page/475 475]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=My forty years with Ford |first1=Charles E. |last1=Sorensen |first2=David Lanier |last2=Lewis |first3=Samuel T. |last3=Williamson |publisher=Wayne State University Press |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than any other model of its day, at a price of just $260.

}}Henry Ford's ideological approach to Model T design was one of getting it right and then keeping it the same; he believed the Model T was all the car a person would, or could, ever need. As other companies offered comfort and styling advantages, at competitive prices, the Model T lost market share and became barely profitable.&lt;ref name=Abernathy/&gt; Design changes were not as few as the public perceived, but the idea of an unchanging model was kept intact. Eventually, on May 26, 1927, Ford Motor Company ceased US production&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/last-day-of-model-t-production-at-ford |title=Last day of Model T production at Ford|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]]|accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nac&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modelt.ca/background.html |publisher=Frontenac Motor Company|title=The Model T Ford|accessdate=2015-03-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150315112906/http://www.modelt.ca/background.html |archivedate=2015-03-15|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capecentralhigh.com/cape-photos/last-model-t-produced-in-1927 |title=Last Model T Produced in 1927|publisher=Cape Girardeau History and Photos|accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began the [[changeover]]s required to produce the [[Ford Model A (1927–1931)|Model A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michigan History |url=http://info.detnews.com/history/story/index.cfm?id=189&amp;category=business |work=Detroit News |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710135903/http://info.detnews.com/history/story/index.cfm?id=189&amp;category=business |archivedate=2012-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the other Model T factories in the world continued a short while.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wagner|first=Michael F.|url=http://vbn.aau.dk/files/18846741/Domesticeringen_af_Ford_i_Danmark |title=Domesticeringen af Ford i Danmark|trans-title=The domestication of Ford in Denmark|page=14|publisher=[[Aalborg University]]|location=Denmark|year=2009 |accessdate=2014-09-06|quote=Model T production in Denmark stopped in August 1927 for factory recondition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Model T engines continued to be produced until August 4, 1941. Almost 170,000 were built after car production stopped, as replacement engines were required to service already produced vehicles. Racers and enthusiasts, forerunners of modern hot rodders, used the Model T's block to build popular and cheap racing engines, including [[Cragar]], [[Navarro (hot rodder)|Navarro]], and famously the [[Frontenac (racing car)|Frontenacs]] ("Fronty Fords")&lt;ref name=nac/&gt; of the [[Chevrolet]] brothers, among many others.

The Model T employed some advanced technology, for example, its use of [[vanadium steel]] alloy. Its durability was phenomenal, and some Model Ts and their parts are in running order over a century later. Although Henry Ford resisted some kinds of change, he always championed the advancement of [[materials engineering]], and often mechanical engineering and industrial engineering.

In 2002, Ford built a final batch of six Model Ts as part of their 2003 centenary celebrations. These cars were assembled from remaining new components and other parts produced from the original drawings. The last of the six was used for publicity purposes in the UK.

Although Ford no longer manufactures parts for the Model T, many parts are still manufactured through [[Privately held company|private companies]] as replicas to service the thousands of Model Ts still in operation today.

On May 26, 1927, Henry Ford and his son Edsel drove the 15-millionth Model T out of the factory.&lt;ref name=15million/&gt; This marked the famous automobile's official last day of production at the main factory.

Other factors reduced the price such as material costs and design changes.&lt;ref name=Abernathy/&gt;

In current equivalent dollars, the cost of the Runabout started at ${{Inflation|US|825|1909|fmt=c}} in 1909 and bottomed out at ${{Inflation|US|260|1925|fmt=c}} in 1925.

The figures below are US production numbers compiled by R.E. Houston, Ford Production Department, August 3, 1927. The figures between 1909 and 1920 are for Ford's fiscal year. From 1909 to 1913, the fiscal year was from October 1 to September 30 the following calendar year with the year number being the year in which it ended. For the 1914 fiscal year, the year was October 1, 1913, through July 31, 1914. Starting in August 1914, and through the end of the Model T era, the fiscal year was August 1 through July 31. Beginning with January 1920, the figures are for the calendar year.

===Recycling===
Henry Ford used wood scraps from the production of Model Ts to make charcoal briquettes. Originally named Ford Charcoal, the name was changed to [[Kingsford (charcoal)|Kingsford Charcoal]] after the Iron Mountain Ford Plant closed in 1951 and the Kingsford Chemical Company was formed and continued the wood distillation process. E. G. Kingsford, Ford's cousin by marriage, brokered the selection of the new sawmill and wood distillation plant site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kingsford.com/our-heritage/ |title=Our Heritage |publisher=Kingsford |accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lumber for production of the Model T came from the same location, built in 1920 called the Iron Mountain Ford which incorporated a sawmill where lumber from Ford purchased land in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan was cut and dried. Scrap wood was distilled at the Iron Mountain plant for its wood chemicals, with the end by product being lump charcoal. This lump charcoal was modified and pressed into briquettes and mass marketed by Ford.&lt;ref name="Chronicle"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forstrom|first1=Guy|title=The Burning History of the Charcoal Briquette|journal=Historical Society of Michigan|date=Summer 2017|volume=40|issue=2|pages=13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Aeroford]] was an English [[automobile]] manufactured in [[Bayswater]], London, from 1920 to 1925.  It was a Model T with distinct hood and grille to make it appear to be a totally different design, what later would have been called [[badge engineering]]. The Aeroford sold from £288 in 1920, dropping to £168–214 by 1925. It was available as a two-seater, four-seater, or [[coupé]].&lt;ref&gt;David Culshaw &amp; Peter Horrobin: ''The Complete Catalogue of British Cars 1895–1975''. Veloce Publishing plc.

==Advertising and marketing==
Ford created a massive publicity machine in Detroit to ensure every newspaper carried stories and advertisements about the new product. Ford's network of local dealers made the car ubiquitous in virtually every city in North America. A large part of the success of Ford's Model T stems from the innovative strategy which introduced a large network of sales hubs making it easy to purchase the car.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Folkmann|first=Mads Nygaard|year=2011|title=Encoding Symbolism: Immateriality and Possibility in Design|journal=Design and Culture|volume=3|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As independent dealers, the franchises grew rich and publicized not just the Ford but the very concept of automobiling; local motor clubs sprang up to help new drivers and to explore the countryside. Ford was always eager to sell to farmers, who looked on the vehicle as a commercial device to help their business. Sales skyrocketed&amp;nbsp;– several years posted around 100 percent gains on the previous year.

*In the alternate history series ''[[Southern Victory]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]], the Model T was the most popular car in the United States before the [[Great War (series)|Great War]]. It was so desirable that it was even exported to the [[Confederate States]], which won the [[American Civil War]] in 1862. However, Model T's in the Confederacy proved difficult to maintain as none had been built locally. During the Great War, many Model T's served as Staff Cars for US generals and officers.

'''''Uncertain T''''' is a [[show car]] built by ''[[Car Craft]]'' photographer Steve Scott in 1965.

== Construction details ==
The chassis is steel tube, painted red.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl records ''Car Craft'' calling it 6061-T6 aluminum, but believes Scott would have polished rather than painted it, in that event. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.76 and caption.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1957 [[Buick]] [[Buick V8 engine#Buick "Nailhead" V8 (2nd generation)|nailhead]],&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt; block painted brown with red detailing,&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.76 caption.&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Hot Rod#Language|bored and stroked]] to {{convert|386|cid|cc|abbr=on}} and equipped with 11:1 [[compression ratio|compression]] [[Jahns]] [[piston]]s, [[Stuart Hilborn|Hilborn]] [[Fuel injection|injector]]s, [[Scheiefer]] [[Ignition magneto|magneto]], 1963 Buick [[cylinder head]]s, and [[Exhaust manifold|open headers]].&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.74 caption and photo.&lt;/ref&gt; The transmission and quick-change rear axle casing were painted brown, the [[rack and pinion]] and [[torsion bar]] tube yellow.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.76 caption.&lt;/ref&gt;

The body was [[fiberglass]],&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; resembling the [[Ford Model T|Model T]] "phonebooth" [[coupé]], steeply raked forward, with a "wind-up key" in the rear section.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.75 photo.&lt;/ref&gt; When it debuted, the body was painted a deep candy red (applied by [[Bill Cushenberry]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; The upholstery was done by [[Lee Wells]].&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; The steering wheel was a four-spoke design, mounted vertically.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.76 photo.&lt;/ref&gt;

The car ran on narrow spoked motorcycle wheels in front and wide five-spoked wheels in back.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Torsion bar front suspension was a rarity in customs (or any cars) at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott's use of a 1960 [[MG MGA|MGA]] rack and pinion to operate the [[drag link]] was also innovative.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.76.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the car ran, it had no suspension, no shock absorbers, and no front brakes, effectively making it a [[Custom car#Language|trailer queen]].&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.76 caption.&lt;/ref&gt;
== History ==

''Uncertain T'' debuted at a carshow as part of the [[1965 NHRA Winternationals|1965 Winternats]] at [[Auto Club Raceway Pomona|Pomona]] in February 1965, and appeared in the  May issue of ''Car Craft''.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was on the cover of November's ''Car Craft'', which had a three-page feature (with only black and white photos) inside.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt;

About a month after completion, Scott had the car repainted metalflake brick orange by [[Junior's House of Color]], before entering "Uncertain T" in the [[1965 Oakland Roadster Show|Oakland Roadster Show]];&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, pp.75-6.&lt;/ref&gt; in this new color scheme, it toured the U.S., and won a number of trophies.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.76.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some time later, the engine and chassis details were repainted yellow.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.76 caption.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Uncertain T" also appeared in [[Hot Rod (magazine)|''Hot Rod'']] in July, August, and September 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt; In the September issue, it was listed as for sale, with a price of US$7000; usual for a used [[custom car]] was $2000 to $3000.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, "Uncertain T" was offered as a [[Monogram]] [[Scale model|model kit]].&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1970, the car, then painted metallic gold, was sold to a California resident. Ownership could not be established, and in 2003 was still unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''0032''''' is a [[Custom car|custom]]-built [[1932 Ford]] [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]] built by [[Chip Foose]] for Chuck Svatos. It won the 2000 [[America's Most Beautiful Roadster]] award.

== History ==
''0032'' started life as a [[Hot Rods by Boyd]] project, [[Boydster II (custom car)|''Boydster II'']]. After Hot Rods by Boyd went [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]], the car was taken in hand by Foose. It was repainted black, over the original yellow, reupholstered, and entered in the [[2000 Oakland Roadster Show|2000]] [[Grand National Roadster Show|Oakland Roadster Show]].  It won that year's America's Most Beautiful Roadster award.&lt;ref&gt;Geisert, Eric.

As built, the car rode on a set of Foose's custom-designed five-spoke knockoff wheels, one of only two sets to exist (the other used on his [[Detroit Autorama|Ridler]]-winner, [[The Stallion (custom car)|''The Stallion'']]), as [[Hot rod#Language|"big'n'little"]]s:  {{convert|7|x|16|in|cm|abbr=on}} in front, {{convert|8|x|17|in|cm|abbr=on}} in back.&lt;ref&gt;Geisert, Eric.

== History ==
''Impact'' was inspired by Ron Whiteside's 1934 [[Three window coupe|3-window]].&lt;ref name="geisert"&gt;{{cite magazine |last = Geisert |first = Eric |title = Ron Whiteside's Ridler Winner |magazine = Street Rodder |date =  July 2003 |page = 80 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whiteside began building his '34 in 1986. He showed pictures to [[Boyd Coddington]], asking Coddington to finish it, hoping to have a [[Ridler Award]]-winning project.&lt;ref&gt;It would be featured in {{harvp|Geisert|2003|pp=78-82}}, and won the 2003 Ridler.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chip Foose]], who worked for Coddington at the time, also saw the pictures, and conceived a sister car, a '34 roadster, for Betty DiVosta, whose husband Buz&lt;!--this is how it's spelled, don't change it--&gt; owned two other Coddington creations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Geisert|2003|pp=79–80}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, as a result of the failure of [[Boyds Wheels]], Coddington's rod shop closed. The unfinished roadster was sold at auction to Berg, who completed it as ''Impact''.&lt;ref name="geisert"/&gt;

''Impact'' was entered in the [[2001 Oakland Roadster Show|2001]] [[Grand National Roadster Show|Oakland Roadster Show]].  It won that year's America's Most Beautiful Roadster award.&lt;ref name="geisert"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.rodshows.com/gnrs/show-history.html |title = Oakland Roadster Show winners |access-date = November 15, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ford Transit''' is a range of [[light commercial vehicle]]s produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] since 1965. Sold primarily as a [[panel van|cargo van]], the Transit is also built as a passenger van (marketed as the '''Ford Tourneo''' since 1995), [[minibus]], [[cutaway van chassis]], and as a [[pickup truck]]. Over 8,000,000 Transit vans have been sold, making it the third best-selling van of all time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 20 best-selling vans of all time |url=http://parkers.co.uk/vans/news-and-advice/2015/august/top-20-best-selling-vans-of-all-time/ |work=Parkers Van News |publisher=Bauer Media |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been produced across four basic platform generations (debuting in 1965, 1986, 2000, and 2013 respectively), with various "facelift" versions of each.

The first product of the merged [[Ford of Europe]], the Transit was marketed through Western Europe and Australia; by the end of the twentieth century, it was marketed nearly globally with the exception of North America until 2013 when it replaced the [[Ford E-Series]] in 2015. The Transit has been the best-selling light commercial vehicle in Europe for forty years, and in some countries the term "Transit" has passed into common usage as a [[generic trademark]] applying to any light commercial van in the Transit's size bracket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/transit |title=Meaning of "transit" in the English Dictionary |website=Cambridge Dictionaries Online |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="topgear"/&gt; While initially designed for the European market, the Ford Transit is now produced in Asia, North America, and Europe for worldwide buyers. Upon production in North America, the Transit won second place in [[Motor Trend]]'s 2015 '[[Truck of the Year]]' award, behind the newly introduced mid-size [[Chevrolet Colorado]] pickup and ahead of the new [[Ford F-150]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Welch |first=David |date=3 December 2014 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-03/ford-s-new-f-150-loses-truck-of-year-award-to-chevy |title=Ford’s New F-150 Loses Truck of Year Award to Chevy |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, the Transit is the best-selling van of any type in the United States, minivan sales included. The Transit drives Ford's 57&amp;nbsp;percent share of the [[full-size van]] market in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cain |first=Timothy |date=29 April 2016 |url=http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2016/04/ford-transit-americas-best-selling-van-minivans-included/ |title=Ford Transit Is America’s Best-Selling Van, Minivans Included |work=[[The Truth About Cars]] |accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Predecessor of the German and British-built Transit, the first production Ford to wear the "Transit" badge was a van built in Ford's Köln ([[Cologne]]) plant in Germany. It was introduced in 1953 as '''FK 1000''' (carrying 1,000&amp;nbsp;kg) with a 1.2-litre [[inline-four engine]] from the contemporary Taunus. In 1955 the engine capacity was enlarged to 1.5 litres. From 1961, this vehicle was called the '''Ford Taunus Transit'''. Production of this model ceased in 1965.

=== Brief historical view ===
{{essay|section|date=November 2019}}
On 9 May 1945, the day after the [[unconditional surrender]] of the [[German Wehrmacht]] in the [[Second World War]], production at the German [[Ford-Werke AG]] in [[Cologne]] resumed. Due the fact that the production of civilian cars in the [[occupied zone]] was reserved for the British (for instance for [[Ford of Britain]]), Ford-Werke AG limited itself to the production of trucks (until 1948). Those trucks based on the slightly modified war models V 3000 S, B 3000 S und V 3000 A as they were already produced before and during the 2nd World War in the Ford production facilities in the [[Third Reich]]. Those trucks were now called "Rhein" and "Ruhr".

At that time neither Ford of Britain nor Ford Werke AG were 100% subsidiaries of [[Ford Motor Company]] in [[Detroit]] and before the Second World War each company had its own more or less protected market. [[War declaration WWII|Until Germany declared war on the US in December 1941]], almost half of the [[shares]] of the Ford-Werke AG were in German hands, as well as its production sites were managed by the Reich Commissioner for the Treatment of Hostile Property - Johannes Krohn. Just as Ford also had to comply with the type restrictions of the [[Schell-Plan]], which were introduced in March 1939 in anticipation of the war.

After the war, several economical boundaries were abolished and local markets did not exist anymore in the same way that they existed before. With this, Ford of Britain and Ford-Werke AG suddenly became more competitive on the whole European Continent than local market subsidiaries of their parent company in Detroit.

In 1951 Ford Werke AG launched the FK commercial vehicle series, FK standing for Ford Köln, with different-sized vehicles (FK2000 with 2 tons payload, FK3000 with 3 tons payload, FK3500 with 3,5 tons payload, etc.). The FK series was successor of the "Rhein" and "Ruhr" trucks. In 1953, the FK series were rounded off with the light delivery van FK1000/FK1250 (1ton/1,25tons payload), in competition to the [[Volkswagen]] Type 2 [[VW Type 2|VW Bus]], the [[DKW]] Type [[DKW Schnellaster|F89L ''Schnellaster'']] or the [[Vidal &amp; Sohn Tempo Werke|Vidal &amp; Sohn Tempo Matador]].

As usual in the [[Anglo-Saxon countries]] in those days, Ford's marketing experts attached more importance to the model/series designation than to the "Ford" label as a brand. Rumors that Ford banned the German Ford-Werke AG from using the Ford logo and instead introduced the Taunus brand are untenable. Also most British Ford products had no Ford emblem.

The commercial vehicles produced at Ford-Werke AG were marketed with the FK logo, while the passenger cars produced from 1948 onwards were offered under the name Taunus referring to the re-produced pre-war model [[Ford Taunus G93A]].

Due to continental European habits, the original series and model designations "FK" and Taunus mutated into real brands, each with its own emblem and different models, comparable with [[Daimler Benz]] [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] models or [[General Motors]] [[Opel]] models.
The FK emblem consists of two slightly overlapping ovals with the "F" from the well-known Ford emblem in the first and a "K" in the same font in the second oval. The Taunus emblem first depicted the [[Cologne Cathedral]]; from 1953 on until its discontinuation in 1967, Cologne's city flag inspired the Taunus emblem.

In 1961, Ford discontinued the entire truck production in Germany and took the FK brand off the market due to serious defects and therefore strongly decreasing demand.
The van FK1000/FK1250, not affected by these defects due to its completely different construction-design, continued to sell well and was now offered under the successful Taunus brand with the model name Transit in addition to the cars [[Ford Taunus P1|Taunus 12M/15M]] and the [[Ford Taunus P3|Taunus 17M]]. A comparable program to Volkswagen, that offered its vehicles [[VW Beetle]], [[VW Type 3|VW 1500]] and [[VW Type 2|VW Bus]] the same way on the continental European market. The "new" Transit Taunus van was now labelled with the Transit model name (instead of the FK logo) in big chrome letters and a big "Taunus" emblem as well as a small Taunus lettering which was also mounted on the back of the vehicle. New, however, was a small Ford logo underneath the right B-column.

From 1957 onwards, with the launch of the [[Ford Thames 400E]] by Ford of Britain, the situation arose that Ford, together with the FK1000/FK1250 by Ford Werke AG, was now present on the continental European markets with two competing products. For example, the British Ford Thames 400E was also assembled and improved as a left-hand drive version in the Ford assembly plants in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, as well as the German FK1000 was assembled in [[Azambuja]], Portugal too. In the French, Spanish, Italian, Swiss, [[Benelux]] and Scandinavian markets, both products were found. This turned out to be disadvantageous and cost-intensive especially after the fall of various trade barriers within the newly founded [[EEC]].

For this reason, such a situation with internal competition and parallel developments was very unsatisfactory for the Ford headquarters in Detroit. The aim was to not only standardize the vehicle production ([[world car]]), but also merge the company structures in Europe.
Under parent's dictate, Ford of Britain and Ford-Werke AG started the "Redcap-Project" in the commercial vehicle sector in 1963, from which the Ford Transit was launched in 1965, based on a new unified [[Car platform|platform]].

Two years later in 1967, Ford of Britain and Ford-Werke AG merged to [[Ford of Europe]] with the headquarters in [[Cologne]], Germany. The brand Taunus was taken off the market. Ford forced the standardization of platforms and even model-names overall European market under the Ford brand and logo. After the Ford Transit in 1965, a second unified platform ([[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]]) was launched in 1967. With the discontinuation of the [[Ford Zephyr]] (British) and [[Ford P7]] (German) 1972 all Ford platforms for the European market are unified. Since 1994 (discontinuation of the [[Ford Scorpio|Ford Granada name]]) even the Ford model-names are the same for the European market.

=== Naming system ===
The German vehicle was not widely exported, and the "Mark 1" tag has commonly been applied, retrospectively, to the 1965 to 1978 British model (see below). Whilst there have only been four basic platforms since 1965, the various facelifts and upgrades over the years have been referred to using a conflicting range of "Mark" numbers, with some sources counting a facelift as a new "Mark", some not. Ford's own historical look back at Transit production, published for the launch of the 1994 model, avoids the issue by referring to generations of Transit by years produced.&lt;ref&gt;"Van World" marketing periodical; in article "1965–1995: 30 years and 3,000,000 Transits later"; pub. Ford Motor Company Ltd., Brentwood, UK; Autumn 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; This article attempts to make mention of all the common naming systems.

The first generation Transit, or the '''Transit Mark I''' in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref name="mk_1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ford Transit van club signs 1,000th member |url=http://www.ford.co.uk/experience-ford/AboutFord/News/VehicleNews/2012/Transit-Club-1000th-Member |publisher=Ford UK |accessdate=14 August 2013 |date=23 April 2012 |quote=Darren, whose 1986 Mk II long wheelbase Transit is in daily use [...] was delighted to find himself a milestone member: [...] "The Transit has been part of my life since I first started driving one in 1996, and now I have bought a second classic model, a 1969 Mk I camper van, as a restoration project."}}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced in October 1965, taking over directly from the [[Ford Thames 400E|Thames 400E]].  This generation had the longest production run of any Transit to date, staying largely unaltered for 12 years until the major facelift of 1978, with overall production lasting for over 20 years before finally being replaced by the all-new VE6 platform in 1986.

The van was produced initially at Ford's [[Langley, Slough|Langley]] facility in Berkshire, England (a former Second World War aircraft factory which had produced [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighters), but demand outstripped the capability of the plant, and production was moved to [[Ford Southampton plant|Southampton]] until closure in 2013 in favour of the Turkish factory.&lt;ref name=BBC23432322&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-23432322 |title=Last shift at Ford's Transit van factory in Swaythling |publisher=BBC |date=26 July 2013 |accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transits were also produced in Ford's [[Genk]] factory in Belgium and also Turkey. Transits were produced in Amsterdam for the local market from the mid-1970s until the end of 1981. This factory had ample capacity, since the [[Ford Transcontinental]] produced there had little success (total production 8000 in 6 years). Although the Transit sold well in the Netherlands, it was not enough to save the factory, which closed in December 1981.

The Transit was introduced to replace the [[Ford Thames 400E]], a small mid-engined [[forward control]] van noted for its narrow track which was in competition with similar-looking but larger vehicles from the [[Morris Commercial J4|BMC J4]] and [[Morris Commercial J2|J2]] vans and [[Rootes Group]]'s [[Commer]] PB ranges. In a UK market segment then dominated by the [[Bedford CA]], Ford's Thames competitor, because of its restricted load area, failed to attract fleet users in sufficient numbers. Ford switched to a front-engined configuration, as did the 1950s by Bedford with their well-regarded CA series vans. [[Henry Ford II]]'s revolutionary step was to combine the engineering efforts of [[Ford of Britain]] and Ford of Germany to create a prototype for the Ford of Europe of today—previously the two subsidiaries had avoided competing in one another's domestic markets but had been direct competitors in other European markets.

The Transit was a departure from the European commercial vehicles of the day with its American-inspired styling—its broad track gave it a huge advantage in carrying capacity over comparable vehicles of the day. Most of the Transit's mechanical components were adapted from Ford's car range of the time. Another key to the Transit's success was the sheer number of different body styles: panel vans in long and short wheelbase forms, pick-up truck, minibuses, crew-cabs to name but a few.

The engines used in the UK were the [[Ford Essex V4 engine|Essex V4]] for the [[petrol]]-engined version in 1.7&amp;nbsp;L and 2.0&amp;nbsp;L capacities. By using relatively short V-4 engines Ford were able to minimise the additional length necessitated to place the engine ahead of the driver.&lt;ref name=Autocar196804&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Autocar |volume=128 |issue=3766) |author=Maurice A Smith (Ed) |title=The Ford Light Commercials |page=105 |date=18 April 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another popular development under the bonnet was the equipping of the van with an [[Alternator (auto)|alternator]] at time when the UK market competitors expected buyers to be content with a [[dynamo]].&lt;ref name=Autocar196804/&gt; A 43&amp;nbsp;bhp (32&amp;nbsp;kW) [[diesel engine]] sourced from [[Perkins Engines|Perkins]] was also offered. As this engine was too long to fit under the Transit's stubby nose, the diesel version featured a longer bonnet - which became nicknamed as the "pig snout". The underpowered Perkins proved unpopular, and was replaced by Ford's own [[Ford York engine|York]] unit in 1972. For mainland Europe the Transit had the German [[Ford Taunus V4 engine]] in Cologne 1.3, 1.5, and 1.7- or Essex 2.0-litre versions. The diesel version's long nose front was also used to accommodate the Ford 3.0 L [[Ford Essex V6 engine (UK)]] for high performance applications such as vans supplied to police and ambulance services. In Australia, in 1973, to supplement the two Essex V4 engines that were available the Transit was released with the long-nose diesel front used to accommodate an [[Straight-six engine|inline 6-cylinder]] engine derived from the [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]].

The [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] reported on this vehicle in 1972 via a [[Scotland Yard]] spokesman that 'Ford Transits are used in 95 per cent of [[Bank robbery|bank raids]]. With the performance of a car, and space for 1.75 tonnes of loot, the Transit is proving to be the perfect getaway vehicle...', describing it as 'Britain's most wanted van'.&lt;ref name="topgear"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Series 06, Episode 07 |series=Top Gear |serieslink=Top Gear (2002 TV series) |network=BBC |airdate=10 July 2005 |seriesno=6 |number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://media.ford.com/content/dam/fordmedia/Europe/gb/2015/07/Transit%2050%20Wonderful%20Facts%204.pdf|title=Ford Transit: 50 Wonderful Facts|date=July 2015|website=Ford Motor Company|access-date=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.topgear.com/car-news/british/ford-transit-50-today-so-we-drove-oldest-surviving-example|title=The Ford Transit is 50 today, so we drove the oldest surviving example|date=9 October 2015|website=www.topgear.com|language=en|access-date=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adoption of a front beam axle in place of a system incorporating independent front suspension that had featured on its [[Ford Thames 400E|UK predecessor]] might have been seen as a backward step by some, but on the road commentators felt that the Transit's wider track and longer wheelbase more than compensated for the apparent step backwards represented by Ford's suspension choices.&lt;ref name=Autocar196804/&gt; Drivers appreciated the elimination of the excessive noise, smell and cabin heat that resulted from placing the driver above or adjacent to the engine compartment in the Thames 400E and other forward control light vans of the 1950s and early 1960s.&lt;ref name=Autocar196804/&gt;

The Transit was also assembled in [[South Africa]] between 1967 and 1974, the last Transit to be sold in that country until 2013, when a fully imported model was introduced.&lt;ref name="Wheels24"&gt;[http://www.wheels24.co.za/News/Ford-Transit-Long-wait-worth-it-20130424 Ford Transit: Long wait worth it], [[News24|Wheels24]], 25 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1978 Ford Transit van, ice cream van conversion (22381174286).jpg|thumb|left| Ford Transit [[Ice cream van]] with the restyled longer bonnet]]

In August 1977, a facelifted version—codenamed within Ford as the "Transit {{frac|1978|1|2}}"—but usually referred to as the '''Transit Mark II''',&lt;ref name="mk_1"/&gt; debuted with a restyled, longer nose section which could now properly accommodate an in-line engine in place of the Essex and Cologne V4s - therefore the [[Ford Pinto engine|Pinto]] engine from the [[Ford Cortina|Cortina]] became the Transit's dominant power unit. Many fleet owners experienced premature camshaft wear in early Pinto units in the Cortina and for two years the Transit 75 was available with the 1.6&amp;nbsp;L Ford Kent cross-flow engine. High-performance versions intended for police or ambulance use used the 3.0&amp;nbsp;L [[V6]] version of the [[Ford Essex V6 engine (UK)|Essex engine]], Australian variants had 4.1&amp;nbsp;L (250&amp;nbsp;cu in) [[Straight-six engine|inline 6-cylinder]] engines, from September 1978. The {{convert|100|PS|kW hp|0|adj=on|abbr=on}} 3.0 was also available in some heavier duty models.&lt;ref name="inufa82"&gt;{{citation | ref = INK82 | title = Internationaler Nutzfahrzeug-Katalog (Inufa) 1982 | trans-title = International Commercial Vehicle Catalog | language = German | volume = 24 | location = Solothurn, Switzerland | publisher = Vogt-Schild AG | date = 1982 | page = 77 | editor-first = Hans U. | editor-last = Rohrbach }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new frontal styling brought the Transit back into line with the rest of Ford of Europe's passenger car range of the period with square headlamps and the black louvred grille, although the rear styling remained unaltered. The rather spartan metal dashboard of the Mk1 with its single instrument binnacle was replaced with a full width plastic fascia with a more comprehensive instrument cluster and switchgear taken from the Taunus/Cortina Mk.4.

In 1984, the York diesel engine was redesigned into the 2.5&amp;nbsp;L "DI" (direct injection) unit. At this time this generation received a minor facelift including a grey plastic front grille with integrated headlamp surrounds, wraparound indicators, longer bumper end caps and multifunction rear lights incorporating fog, indicator, reversing and side lights for the panel van. This facelift did not commonly result in a new "Mark" number.

The Mark II was available in 6 body styles: Van, Kombi, Chassis Cab, Parcel Van, Bus and Crewbus all available in short-wheelbase (2690&amp;nbsp;mm) and long-wheelbase (3000&amp;nbsp;mm) versions. A selection of 5 engines was available: 1.6-litre OHC Petrol, 1.6-litre OHV Petrol (Kent), 2.0-litre OHC Petrol, 2.0-litre OHC Petrol (Economy) and 2.4-litre Diesel. On top of this were 32 door combinations, 6 axle ratios and options for 12 – 17 interior seats. All of these were available in any combination when purchased with Ford's highly customizable custom plan. At the time this gave the business sector an unprecedented amount of flexibility, which was a major factor in the vehicles' ultimate success.&lt;ref&gt;"The New Ford Transit – Confidential for Ford Salesmen Only (Mark II)."{{Clarify|reason=Clarify reference using Citation Style 1 templates|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, for mainland European market only, the Transit Clubmobil was introduced by the Hymer company. This was fitted with a 1.6 / 2.0 OHC engine, and featured a custom interior – captain style swivel seats in velour, pile carpet, motorsport steering wheel, unique Ronal 14" alloy wheels, unique side windows, folding back seat, luggage box, unique front spoiler, tinted glass, power assisted steering, spare wheel carrier and rear door ladder. In 3 years of production 150 were produced and less than 20 are thought to still exist.

In late 1982 the well-equipped Transit Ghia was introduced to some markets, only as a nine-seater bus. This offered a velour interior, full carpeting, tinted windows, sunroof, etcetera. Externally it can be identified by chrome dog-dish hubcaps and extra lamps in the grille.&lt;ref name=TV218255&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Lyxbuss | trans-title = Luxury bus | ref = TVn21 | language = Swedish | magazine = [[Teknikens Värld]] | publisher = Specialtidningsförlaget AB | location = Stockholm, Sweden | page = 55 | date = 6 October 1982 | issue = 21 | volume = 34 | editor-first = Börje | editor-last = Isakson }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 a four-wheel drive version was added to the German market, called the SIRA-Ford Transit. This was developed together with Rau GmbH, a Ford dealer in [[Stuttgart]].&lt;ref name="Truck9.82"&gt;{{ cite journal | journal = TRUCK | date = September 1982 | ref = truck982 | page = 25 | editor-last = Kennett | editor-first = Pat | title = Intertruck: Germany | last = Kacher | first = Georg | location = London, UK | publisher = FF Publishing Ltd }}&lt;/ref&gt; "SIRA" is a [[portmanteau]] of "[[Sinpar]]" and "Rau" - in addition to selling Fords, Rau was the agent for French four-wheel-drive specialist Sinpar in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The SIRA Transit used a Sinpar transfer case and other parts, and was available with the 2-liter petrol four or the 2.4-liter Diesel, on either wheelbase.&lt;ref name="inufa82262"&gt;[[#INK82|''Inufa 1982'']], pp. 262-265&lt;/ref&gt; The 4x4 Transit was later offered in other markets as well.

=== Pre-facelift (1986–1995) ===
[[File:Blue Ford Transit Mk4 Jasło.JPG|thumb|left|Pre facelift Ford Transit rear]]

Codenamed ''VE6'', the second generation Transit platform appeared in January 1986 and was notable for its all-new bodyshell which was of "one-box" design (''i.e.'' the windscreen and bonnet are at close to the same angle), and the front suspension was changed to a fully independent configuration on SWB versions. The engine range was carried over largely unchanged from the last of the 1978–1985 Mk.1 facelift model, although in 1989 the high-performance 3.0 Essex [[V6]] petrol was replaced by the Cologne 2.9 EFI V6, mainly because of emissions regulations as the Essex V6 design was nearly 25 years old by then and still used a carburettor. The third generation Transit was developed under the "Triton" code name.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | journal = TRUCK | date = September 1982 | ref = truck982 | page = 37 | editor-last = Kennett | editor-first = Pat | title = The Great European Retreat | first = Alan | last = Walker | location = London, UK | publisher = FF Publishing Ltd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subtle facelift in 1992 saw the fully independent front suspension adopted across the range, whilst a redesigned floor plan allowed the use of single, rather than paired, rear wheels on the LWB derivative, further increasing payload—these models are identifiable by the slightly more rounded front headlamps. In Australia, the third generation Transit did not go on sale until March 1994, after a 13-year absence from that market.

=== Facelift (1995–2003) ===
[[File:Ford transit 5 v sst.jpg|thumb|left|1992–1995 Ford Transit (first facelift)]]
[[File:Ford transit 6 v sst.jpg|thumb|left|1995–2000 (in Europe) Ford Transit (second facelift)]]

A major facelift to the Transit in 1994 gave the Transit a new nose and [[dashboard]], along with the [[Ford I4 DOHC engine|2.0&amp;nbsp;L DOHC 8-valve]] engine as found in the 1993 to 1998 Ford Scorpio. It is similar to the earlier Sierra DOHC unit but without the distributor and uses the updated [[OBD II]]-compliant EEC-V level [[engine control unit]]. Some of Ford's 16-valve engines, such as those found in the [[Ford Scorpio|Scorpio]], [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Escort RS2000]] and [[Ford Galaxy|Galaxy]] were also based on this block. At the same time [[air conditioning]], electric windows, central locking, electric mirrors and airbags were all made available as optional extras.

The turbo diesel version came in {{convert|85|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|100|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|115|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} version with an electronic fuel pump.

For the 30th anniversary of the Transit in 1995 Ford released a limited edition model called the Transit Hallmark. Six hundred were made and were available in three colours with 200 being made in each.

In Europe the VE83 Transit was available up to 2000, but in Vietnam it was built up to 2003 when it was exchanged in June for the new generation.&lt;ref name="Ford: Facilities"/&gt;

Developed by Ford in the United States, the main innovation is that it is available in either front- or rear-wheel drive. Ford nomenclature makes this the V184 ([[rear-wheel-drive]]) or V185 ([[front-wheel-drive]]) model. This model features the "Puma"-type [[Ford Duratorq|Duratorq]] turbo diesel engine also used in the 2000 [[Ford Mondeo|Mondeo]] and [[Jaguar X-Type]], with the petrol versions moving up to the 2.3&amp;nbsp;L 16-Valve edition of the [[straight-4]] engine. A demonstration of this model's speed with the 2.4 Duratorq turbo diesel engine and 6 speed manual gearbox was shown in [[Top Gear (series 6)|series 6]] of ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' in 2005, where German race driver [[Sabine Schmitz]] attempted to drive it around the [[Nürburgring]] in under ten minutes, matching [[Jeremy Clarkson]]'s time in a turbodiesel [[Jaguar S-Type]]; she was unsuccessful, marking her fastest lap at 10m 8s.

This version won the [[International Van of the Year]] 2001.

[[File:Ford Transit rear 20071231.jpg|left|thumbnail|Ford Transit pre-facelift]]

The [[Durashift]] EST [[automatic transmission]] (optional on all rear-wheel-drive models) features controls mounted on the dashboard, a specially adapted manual mode, tow-haul mode, economy mode and winter mode. This is known as the ASM (automatically-shifting manual) system in the Australian market.

2002 saw the introduction of the first [[Common rail|High Pressure Common Rail]] diesel engine in the Transit, with the launch of the {{convert|125|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} HPCR 2.0-litre in the FWD. Production of the van started at the new Ford-Otosan plant in Kocaeli, Turkey which saw the end of all production at the Genk, Belgium plant which had been producing Transits since 1965. This coincided with the introduction of the [[Ford Transit Connect|Transit Connect]] (also produced in Kocaeli), a smaller panel van based on the [[Ford C170 platform|C170]] (Focus) platform and aimed at replacing the older [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Escort]] and [[Ford Fiesta|Fiesta]] based models. Despite the name, the Connect has no engineering commonality with the full-size Transit.

2003 saw a new instrument cluster with a digital odometer.

2004 saw the launch of the first RWD HPCR, the {{convert|135|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} 2.4-litre variant that also introduced the 6-speed MT-82 RWD [[manual gearbox]].

The five millionth Transit rolled off the Southampton line on Monday, 18 July 2005 and was donated to an English charity.

=== Facelift (2006–2014) ===

[[File:Ford Transit VI 110 T300 20090910 rear.JPG|thumb|right|Ford Transit (facelift)]]
[[File:Transit XXL.jpg|thumb|right|Ford Transit XXL]]

The third-generation Transit received a facelift to the body, introduced in August 2006, including new front and rear lights, a new front end and a new interior featuring the [[gearstick]] on the dashboard and Ford's new corporate radio design. Besides the styling changes, the powertrains were revised. The old petrol engine was replaced with one from the [[Ford Ranger]], the front-wheel-drive diesel went from 2.0 to 2.2 litres capacity, and all diesel engines gained high-pressure common rail ([[TDCi]]) systems. The powertrains were changed to meet new emissions legislation. Additionally, the facelift introduced [[CAN bus]] electronics to the Transit for the first time. The new version (Ford nomenclature V347 for front-wheel drive and V348 for rear-wheel drive) won [[International Van of the Year]] for 2007 despite tough competition from several all-new rivals. This Transit arrived in Mexico to replace the [[Ford Freestar|Freestar]] after the 2007 model year. This was the first Transit having a [[Straight-five engine|five-cylinder engine]].

Mid-2006 saw the launch of the "Sport Van", a production van featuring the {{convert|130|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine with additional styling parts, "Le Mans" stripes and 18-inch alloy wheels.

Late-2007 saw the launch of the {{convert|140|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine for front wheel drives (replacing the 130 PS) complete with the VMT6 6-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] transaxle to cope with the extra power.

The 6-speed transaxle was introduced on the mid-power FWD in late 2008 when the {{convert|110|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine was upped to {{convert|115|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

In late 2008, the "coated Diesel Particulate Filter" (cDPF)—designed to meet higher emission standards than the current Euro IV requirement—was introduced as an option on all diesel engines. Production ended in 2013, with the Southampton plant closing down making this generation the last of the British built Transits, but returned in China in two modified forms.

===XXL===
To celebrate the Transit's status as International Van of the Year 2007, Ford built a [[stretch limousine]] style van – the Transit XXL. It is a unique special that is the most expensive Transit ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Ford Transit |url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/car-reviews/16759/ford-transit |accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SuperSportVan ===
The Ford Transit SuperSportVan was a one-off, high-performance version of the third-gen Transit built by Ford Europe. It uses a 3.2L turbocharged [[DuraTorq TDCi|Duratorq]] I5, producing 198 horsepower, borrowed from a larger Transit model, mated to a 6-speed transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ford U.K. Builds Transit SuperSportVan, Makes Us Want the Big Transit More |url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/ford-u-k-builds-transit-supersportvan-makes-us-want-the-big-transit-more |website=Car and Driver |accessdate=29 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese market===
[[File:2013 JMC-Ford Transit Campervan.jpg|thumb|250px|2013 facelift]]
The third generation Ford Transit commenced production in China in 2008 for the 2009 model year. Engine choices consisted the 2.2-litre turbo diesel, a 2.3-litre petrol for 2009 models and a 2.4-litre turbo diesel. As of 2019, the 2.2-litre turbo diesel engine and 6 speed manual gearbox is standard across the range. The Transit in China was given a facelift for the 2013 model year onwards with new headlights and taillights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://car.autohome.com.cn/photo/1001784/1/100041172.html#pvareaid=2042264|title=新世代全顺 2013款 2.4T豪华型长轴中顶国III 100041172图片_福特_汽车图库_汽车之家|website=car.autohome.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://car.autohome.com.cn/photo/1001784/1/100041166.html#pvareaid=2042264|title=新世代全顺 2013款 2.4T豪华型长轴中顶国III 100041166图片_福特_汽车图库_汽车之家|website=car.autohome.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}The fourth-generation Transit was launched in January 2013 at the [[North American International Auto Show#2013|2013 North American (Detroit) International Auto Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20130117/BUSINESS03/301170102/2014-Ford-Transit|title=2015 Ford Transit|work=Detroit Free Press|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619145253/http://www.freep.com/article/20130117/BUSINESS03/301170102/2014-Ford-Transit|archive-date=19 June 2013|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the previous generation developed in the United States (but never sold there), the fourth-generation Transit was co-designed by [[Ford of Europe]] and Ford in North America.    [[File:2014 Ford Transit Custom (VN) 290S van (2015-07-03) 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ford Transit Custom]] van]]
[[File:2014 Ford Transit (VO) 350E van (2015-06-03) 02.jpg|thumb|left|Ford Transit 350E van]]

The introduction of the fourth generation marks a split of the Transit model line; the previous front-wheel drive version has now become the [[Ford Transit Custom]], sized between the Transit and the (much smaller) Transit Connect; intended to compete against the [[Mercedes-Benz Vito|Mercedes-Benz Vito/Viano]] and [[Volkswagen Transporter (T6)|Volkswagen Transporter]], it is not currently sold in North America.  The rear-wheel drive Transit serves as the replacement for the long-running [[Ford E-Series|Econoline/E-Series]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford.com/commercial-trucks/transit/|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802102427/http://www.ford.com/commercial-trucks/transit/|archivedate=2 August 2013|accessdate=1 June 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the E-series remains in production solely as a cutaway chassis cab).

While the front-wheel drive Transit was sold in Mexico from 2007 to 2013 (replacing the Freestar), the Transit was excluded from the United States and Canada (largely due to model overlap with the E-Series) from its 1965 introduction.  As part of its development, Ford imported previous-generation examples of the Transit into the United States for evaluation purposes and durability testing.

In a design shift, the Transit (and Transit Custom) moved from the New Edge styling of the previous generation to the ''[[Kinetic Design|Kinetic]]'' design language; the interior was influenced by the [[Ford Focus (third generation)|third-generation Ford Focus]].

Worldwide production of Ford Transits takes place in two facilities; all European and Asian Transit production is from [[Ford Otosan]] in [[Kocaeli Province]], Turkey; this factory provides a percentage of global exports. North American and South American production is primarily sourced from [[Ford Kansas City Assembly Plant|Kansas City Assembly]] in [[Claycomo, Missouri]]; production at the Kansas City Assembly Plant began on 30 April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2014/04/30/new-kansas-city-employees-celebrate-start-of-2015-transit-production.html |title=2,000 New Ford Kansas City Employees Celebrate Start of Production of Game-Changing 2015 Ford Transit Van |work=ford.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, the model line was launched as a 2015 model, adopting the Transit name across both cargo and passenger vans (rather than using the Tourneo name used in other markets for passenger vans).

=== Body configuration ===
The fourth-generation Transit is available in both cargo van and chassis cab/cutaway cab configurations; the pickup truck has been discontinued.  Along with two different wheelbases, Transit vans are offered in three different roof heights; extended-length vans are offered with dual rear wheels.  As with the smaller Transit Connect (and other Ford trucks), the Transit is sold in XL and XLT trims.

The high use of [[boron steel]] in the body allows for a 600-pound increase in payload capacity in the Transit (when compared to a similar E-Series/Econoline).&lt;ref name="US_Transit_press_release"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2014/06/04/all-new-ford-transit.html|title=ALL-NEW FORD TRANSIT: BETTER GAS MILEAGE THAN E-SERIES; BEST-IN-CLASS GAS ENGINE TORQUE, CARGO CAPACITY|publisher=Ford Motor Company|accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Powertrain ===
At its launch, the fourth-generation Transit retained several diesel engines from its predecessor, including 2.0L, 2.2L, and 2.4L inline-4s, along with a 3.2L inline-5.  For North American production, several revisions were made, with the adoption of a 275&amp;nbsp;hp 3.7L [[Ford Cyclone engine#Duratec 37|Ti-VCT]] V6 (as the standard engine), a 310&amp;nbsp;hp 3.5L [[Ford Ecoboost engine#3.5 L EcoBoost V6|EcoBoost]] twin-turbo V6, and a 3.2L inline-5 diesel (under PowerStroke branding); the diesel is the sole engine shared with Otosan-production vehicles.  Each engine is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.

As an option through Ford, the 3.7L engine can be converted to run on [[compressed natural gas|compressed natural gas (CNG)]] or [[Autogas|liquefied petroleum gas (propane)]].&lt;ref name="US_Transit_Alt_Fuel"&gt;{{cite web |title=2014 Transit: Alternative Fuel Capability |url=http://www.ford.com/commercial-trucks/transit/2014/features/#page=Feature13 |publisher=Ford Motor Company |accessdate=1 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603022724/http://www.ford.com/commercial-trucks/transit/2014/features/#page=Feature13 |archivedate=3 June 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facelift (2020–)===
For the 2020 model year, the Ford Transit undergoes a mid-cycle model revision, including an update of the front fascia and dashboard.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a26657959/2020-ford-transit-van-photos-info/|title=The 2020 Ford Transit Van Brings AWD and New Engines to the Scene|date=5 March 2019|website=Car and Driver|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ford.com/trucks/transit-passenger-van-wagon/2020/|title=2020 Ford Transit Passenger Van {{!}} New and Improved Full-Size Van {{!}} Ford.com|website=Ford Motor Company|language=en-US|access-date=15 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; For versions produced in North America, the powertrain undergoes several revisions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The 3.5L EcoBoost twin-turbo V6 is retained, with an all-new 3.5L naturally-aspirated V6 and a 2.0L 4-cylinder turbodiesel ([[EcoBlue]]);&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the latter is shared with the Ranger (outside of North America).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In line with the F-Series and Ranger, a [[Ford-GM 10-speed automatic transmission|10-speed automatic transmission]] replaces the previous 6-speed automatic.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As an option, all-wheel drive is offered for the first time for the model line.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Introduced in 2006, the Ford Transit VJX6541DK-M is a license-built version of the Transit assembled by [[Jiangling Motors|Jiangling Motors (JMC)]] in [[Nanchang]].  Produced solely for the Chinese domestic market, it was derived from the second-generation VE6/VE83/VE94 platform.  Over its Ford predecessor produced from 1986 to 2000, JMC made 70 major updates to the design.  The exterior was distinguished by revision to the front fascia, including larger front headlamps and a redesigned grille and front bumper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foongleongsoon.blogspot.com/2007/07/ford-transit-facelift-parts-arrived.html|title=Ford Transit facelift parts arrived!|date=18 July 2007|publisher=Foongleongsoon.blogspot.com|accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interior saw several ergonomic improvements, along with the standardization of power windows.  ABS was offered as an option.  The top speed is specified at {{convert|68.35|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.

Sharing its underpinnings with the second-generation Transit, the JMC-built Transit differed substantially in its powertrain configuration.  In place of Ford produced engines, the model line used a 92&amp;nbsp;kW Mitsubishi-produced 2.4L inline-4.  Two Isuzu-produced 2.8L inline-4 diesels were offered; a naturally-aspirated version offering 67.6&amp;nbsp;kW-68&amp;nbsp;kW and a turbocharged, intercooled version, offering 80–85&amp;nbsp;kW.

In 2008, Ford commenced sales of the V347/V348 Transit in China alongside its JMC-produced counterpart, branded the Ford-produced van as the ''New Transit'' and the JMC van as the ''Transit Classic''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Between the two manufacturers, a combined 210,000 examples of both generations were sold in China; in 2012, Ford expanded operations, allowing production capacity to expand to 300,000 vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20100718/bs_nm/us_ford_jiangling_china|title=Ford breaks ground on $300 million China plant|author=Press|date=18 July 2010|publisher=Yahoo!

===JMC Teshun===
{{main|JMC Teshun}}
Starting from May 2017, Jiangling Motors replaced the license-built Ford Transit with the [[JMC Teshun]] range of vans.  While sharing much of its body with its predecessor, the Teshun underwent a redesign of the front fascia with a larger front bumper and grille.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://carnewschina.com/2017/05/12/jmc-teshun-ford-tansit-turned-storm-trooper/|title=The JMC Teshun Is A Ford Tansit Turned Storm Trooper|last=Wang|first=Author Joey|date=12 May 2017|website=CarNewsChina.com|language=en-US|access-date=15 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://carnewschina.com/2016/10/10/jmc-is-going-stormtrooper-with-new-old-mini-van/|title=JMC Is Going Stormtrooper With New-Old Mini Van|last=Ning|first=Author W.

Retaining the VE83 platform of the second-generation Transit, the Teshun is offered with a Mitsubishi-produced 136&amp;nbsp;hp 2.4L inline-4 and an Isuzu-produced 116&amp;nbsp;hp 2.8L inline-4 diesel; both engines are paired to a 5-speed manual.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;   &lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

=== County 4×4 ===
[[File:Ford Transit County 4x4.jpg|thumb|left|Mk3 County 4×4 Transit]]
A handful of companies offered four-wheel-drive conversions, such as County Tractors of Knighton in Powys,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.transitcounty4x4.co.uk/ |publisher=Ford Transit County 4X4 |accessdate=17 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108002600/http://www.transitcounty4x4.co.uk/ |archivedate=8 November 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; who converted vans on behalf of Ford as a [[Special Vehicle Operations]] factory option. The first Transit County models were based on the Mk2 Transit model, both long and short wheelbase. The conversion used a [[Dana Holding Corporation|Dana]] 44F front axle and a NP208 transfer box, both lifted from the Ford Bronco, coupled to the regular Transit engine, gearbox and rear axle using three custom propshafts. The Transit rear axle was retained, mounted to a rear subframe or 'lift cradle' to give the extra ride height. Other modifications were 16-inch wheel rims, locking front hubs, a heavy-duty steering box and 305&amp;nbsp;mm diameter front brake discs.

With the introduction of the Mk3 Transit in 1986 came the next generation of the County 4×4. This would prove to be a very popular and successful version of the County Transit 4×4, and the last to use the Dana beam axle layout. Later County 4×4 models switched to using an independent front suspension setup which was inherently more complex in design than the earlier beam axle models. Later panel vans also lost the twin-wheel rear axle that had been fitted on earlier LWB versions.

Mainly used by utility companies such as [[National Grid plc|National Grid]], the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], and by mountain rescue teams, the Transit County 4×4 proved to be a capable vehicle both on and off-road, with the ability to carry both crew and equipment just about anywhere.

Design and supply of drivetrain components for County 4×4 models passed to Countytrac, a division of M.J. Allen Ltd, who are still involved in the development of the latest Mk7 AWD Transit and Connect models.{{Clear left}}

=== Tourneo ===
[[File:Metropolitan Police Ford Tourneo.JPG|thumb|left|Ford Tourneo with [[Metropolitan Police]]]]
[[File:Ford Tourneo, Mark 5, rear view.jpg|thumb|right|Ford Tourneo]]

Introduced as part of the 1995 redesign of the Transit, the Tourneo is a Transit-based 8 or 9-seat minibus, but over the years has become increasingly better trimmed up to the point where it can almost be classified as a large MPV. Featuring back seats and back windows similar to a [[minivan]], the Tourneo is also considered an [[Executive car|executive]] transport vehicle and is often supplied with alloy wheels. Since its introduction, the Tourneo has followed the same development cycle as the Transit; both versions receive updates at the same time.

A smaller minivan version of the Tourneo was introduced in 2002; branded the [[Ford Transit Connect#Tourneo Connect|Tourneo Connect]], it was based on the Transit Connect [[mini MPV]].

'''Monarch''' was an [[automobile]] [[marque]] first sold by [[Ford Motor Company of Canada|Ford Canada]] in 1946. It was produced through 1957 and revived for 1959 to 1961.

== The cars ==
The first Monarchs debuted in 1946, as contemporary Mercury models with Canadian market-specific trim, unique grilles, taillights and other trim to marginally differentiate them from their Mercury relatives.  Monarch model names included Richelieu, Lucerne and Sceptre; these were variations of the [[Mercury Eight]] (later the [[Mercury Monterey|Monterey]]), [[Mercury Montclair|Montclair]] and [[Mercury Park Lane|Park Lane]] models, respectively.  The Monarch line provided Canadian Ford dealerships a product to sell in the medium-price field, similar to Ford of Canada offering the [[Meteor (automobile)|Meteor]] line of lower-price vehicles which were actually Ford models with Mercury-like trim and model names.  This was typical practice in the Canadian market, where smaller towns might have only a single dealer who was expected to offer a full range of products in various price classes.

[[File:1961 Mercury Monarch.jpg|thumb|right|1961 Monarch]]
The Monarch line of vehicles was dropped for 1958 when the [[Edsel]] was introduced, but the poor acceptance of the Edsel led Ford to reintroduce Monarch for 1959. With a drop in medium-priced vehicle sales in the early 1960s, and the introduction of the similarly priced [[Ford Galaxie]], the Monarch brand was dropped after the 1961 model year, with approximately 95,450 cars built in 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zavitz |first1=Perry |title=Canadian Cars, 1946-1984 |date=1985 |publisher=Bookman Publishing |location=Baltimore |isbn=0934780439 |pages=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cars Of Lincoln-Mercury|last=Dammann, George H.|first=Wagner, James K.|publisher=Crestline Publishing Co.|year=1987|isbn=978-0912612263|location=Sarasota, Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ford Explorer''' is a range of SUVs manufactured by [[Ford Motor Company]]. Introduced in 1990 for the 1991 model year, the Explorer was the first four-door SUV produced by Ford, replacing the two-door [[Ford Bronco II|Bronco II]]. Six generations of the Explorer have been produced. The sixth generation  was unveiled in January 2019. As with the [[Ford Ranger|Ranger]], the Explorer derives its name from a trim package used on the [[Ford F-Series|F-Series]], used from 1967 to 1986. Originally slotted below the full-size [[Ford Bronco|Bronco]] in the Ford truck line, the current Explorer is slotted between the [[Ford Edge|Edge]] and standard-wheelbase [[Ford Expedition|Expedition]].

For its first two generations, the Explorer was produced in both two-door (as the ''Explorer Sport'') and four-door configurations. Upon the introduction of the third generation, the Explorer was produced exclusively as a four-door SUV; the Explorer Sport was discontinued in 2003. The Sport name was resurrected in 2011 for the 2012 year model, but as a performance version of the standard four-door Explorer. The Explorer has been offered with a number of powertrain layouts during its production. The first four generations offered rear-wheel drive as standard, with part-time four-wheel drive and all-wheel drive options; the fifth generation offered front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive, while the sixth generation reverted to rear-wheel drive with optional all-wheel drive.

During its production, numerous variants of the Explorer have been marketed, with Lincoln-Mercury selling the four-door Explorer as the [[Mercury Mountaineer]] (1996–2010) and the [[Lincoln Aviator]] (2002–2005; 2019–); Mazda sold the Explorer Sport as the Mazda Navajo (1990–1994). The [[Ford Explorer Sport Trac|Explorer Sport Trac]] is a mid-size [[pickup truck]] derived from the four-door Explorer; two generations were produced from 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fordauthority.com/fmc/ford-motor-company-plants-facilities/ford-motor-company-usa-plants-facilities/ford-motor-company-louisville-assembly-plant-louisville-kentucky-usa/ |title=Ford Louisville |work=Fordauthority.com |date= |accessdate=May 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 2010. For police use, Ford developed the '''Ford Police Interceptor Utility''' from the fifth-generation Explorer (replacing the [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]]); a specially modified ''Special Service Vehicle'' version is also available from Ford Fleet for [[law enforcement agencies]], [[Firefighting worldwide|fire departments]], and [[Emergency medical services|EMS agencies]].

[[File:1993 Explorer Interior.jpg|thumb|left|Interior]]
The Ford Explorer was introduced in March 1990 for the 1991 model year.  To better compete against the [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer]] and [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]] mid-size sport-utility vehicles, Ford sought to replace the Ford Bronco II with a vehicle sized closer to its competitors. In an effort to attract family buyers, a four-door version was developed alongside the two-door (launched the same month as the four-door S-10 Blazer).

As with the Ford Bronco II, the first-generation Ford Explorer shares its chassis and underpinnings with the first-generation (1983-1992) Ford Ranger. In comparison to the Bronco II, the Explorer is far larger, with the two-door Explorer Sport gaining 12.6 inches in length and 2.1 inches of width; a four-door is {{Convert|22.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} longer and {{Convert|730|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} heavier.

As with its predecessor, the Ford Explorer has a large degree of commonality with the Ford Ranger, sharing its front bumper, fenders (modified), headlights, grille, and wheels; with the exception of its steering wheel hub, the Explorer shares its entire dashboard with the 1989-1992 Ford Ranger. In a major change from the Bronco II, the Explorer was given its own front door stampings. In addition for creating a four-door layout, the lack of commonality with the Ranger allowed for two major aerodynamic improvements; along with the elimination of exterior drip rails (by wrapping the doors into the roof), the sideview mirrors were integrated onto the doors (rather than bolted on).

=== Chassis ===
Sharing its engine with the Ranger and four-wheel drive Ford Aerostar, the Explorer was fitted with a German-produced {{Convert|155|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 4.0 L [[Ford Cologne V6 engine#4.0|''Cologne'']] V6 as the sole engine offering, replacing the previous 2.9 L V6.  A Mazda [[Mazda M5OD transmission|M5OD]] 5-speed manual was the standard transmission offering, with the option of the Ford 4-speed [[Ford C3 transmission#A4LD|A4LD]] overdrive automatic transmission. For 1993, the engine output was increased to {{Convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

Along with the standard rear-wheel drive powertrain, at its launch, the Explorer was also offered with various configurations of part-time four-wheel drive, powered by a [[Borg Warner]] 13–54 transfer case.  In addition to a manually shifted transfer case, Ford offered "Touch Drive" electronic push-button shifting; both were "shift-on-the-fly" designs that allowed the vehicle to be shifted from [[two-wheel drive]] to "four-high" at any speed and into "four-low" when the vehicle was stopped.  All Explorers were equipped with the [[Ford 8.8 axle]] in either a limited slip differential, or open version with a variety of available gear ratios. Four-wheel-drive front axles were the TTB ("[[Twin Traction Beam]]") [[Dana 35]] with some [[Dana 44|Dana 44-spec]] components.

=== Trim ===
At its launch, the Ford Explorer followed the Aerostar, Bronco, Econoline, F-Series, and Ranger in model trim. The XL was sold as the base trim, with XLT as the upper range, with the outdoors-themed [[Eddie Bauer]] trim as the top trim.  The XL was distinguished by a black grille (chrome optional) with steel wheels, while the XLT offered a chrome grille and alloy wheels; the Eddie Bauer offered alloy wheels and two-tone paintwork.

The Ford Explorer Sport was offered solely on the two-door body style.  Offering black lower bodywork and grille and alloy wheels, the Sport was intended as a replacement for the Bronco II.  From 1990 to 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Snow Country|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iA3VKGz_rOoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA84|date=October 1990|page=84|issn=0896-758X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mazda marketed the two-door Ford Explorer as the Mazda Navajo; the model was awarded the 1991 ''[[Motor Trend]]'' [[Truck of the Year]] award.

The Ford Explorer Limited was introduced for 1993 as a luxury-trim model slotted above the Eddie Bauer. Largely introduced as a competitor to the [[Oldsmobile Bravada]], the Explorer Limited was offered only as a four-door with an automatic transmission. Distinguished by its color-matched grille, headlight trim, and model-specific bodywork and wheels, the Limited was offered with several model-specific features, including automatic headlights, an [[Automatic Dimming Mirror|auto-dimming rearview mirror]], [[foglamps]], and center roof console (with compass and outside thermometer).

The second-generation Ford Explorer made its debut in late 1994 as a 1995 model.  Retaining the same footprint as its predecessor, the 1995 Ford Explorer underwent extensive modifications to its chassis to improve its road manners.  In an effort to better differentiate the model line from the Ford Ranger, Ford stylists redesigned the vehicle, giving the Explorer a model-specific exterior.  As with its predecessor, the second generation was sold in both three-door and five-door configurations.  Rear-wheel drive was standard, with four-wheel drive offered as an option.

Following the January 2001 introduction of the third-generation five-door Ford Explorer, the three-door Explorer became a stand-alone model on the second-generation design; the Explorer Sport was produced through the 2003 model year.

This generation of the Ford Explorer marks the debut of the 1997 [[Mercury Mountaineer]], introduced in 1996 by Mercury.  In early 2000, the [[Ford Explorer Sport Trac]] was introduced, which was a mid-size pickup truck; offered with a crew cab with a short pickup bed, the Sport Trac was based on the five-door Explorer.  The Explorer Sport Trac was produced through the 2005 model year (until it was redesigned for 2007).

Outside of North America, this generation of the Explorer was marketed in right-hand drive configurations{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}  As of 2018, RHD countries (such as Japan) export used examples of the Explorer to other countries (such as Australia and New Zealand) where there is demand for right-hand drive SUVs. Due to Japan's strict [[Motor-vehicle inspection (Japan)|Shaken Laws]], used vehicles tend to have low mileage with detailed repair histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rightdrive.ca/cars/view/204|title=Right Hand Drive JDM Imports – RightDrive – Est. 2007|work=Right Drive|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104021358/http://www.rightdrive.ca/cars/view/204|archivedate=November 4, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, the second-generation Ford Explorer has the (dubious) distinction of being two of the top five vehicles traded in under the 2009 "[[Car Allowance Rebate System|Cash for Clunkers]]" program, with the 4WD model topping the list and the 2WD model coming in at number 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikipedia [[Car Allowance Rebate System|Cash for Clunkers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chassis ===
The second-generation Ford Explorer is based upon the Ford U1 platform shared with its predecessor, adopting the UN105/UN150 model codes.  Alongside similar changes in development for the [[Ford Ranger (North America)#Third generation (1998–2012)|1998 Ford Ranger]], the long-running [[Swing axle#Twin I-Beam|Twin I-Beam]]/[[Twin Traction Beam]] front suspension was retired in favor of a [[Double wishbone suspension#Short long arms suspension|short/long-arm (SLA) wishbone]] front suspension configuration.  Along with more compact packaging of front suspension components, the design allowed for improved on-road handling/feel.

==== Powertrain ====
The optional engine of the Ford Ranger and Ford Aerostar, the 160&amp;nbsp;hp 4.0 L V6 was carried over from the first-generation Ford Explorer. To match the V8 engine of the similar-sized [[Jeep Grand Cherokee (ZJ)|Jeep Grand Cherokee]], for the 1996 model year, Ford introduced a 5.0 L V8 as an option. Initially available on rear-wheel drive XLT models, the availability of the {{Convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} V8 was expanded to many versions of the five-door Explorer, and came standard with all-wheel-drive starting in 1997.  For 1997, revised cylinder heads increased output of the 5.0 L V8 to {{Convert|215|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Following the January 1996 introduction of the 4.6 L SOHC V8 by the [[Ford F-Series (tenth generation)|Ford F-Series]] and [[Ford E-Series|E-Series]], the Explorer became the final vehicle sold by Ford Motor Company sold with a gasoline pushrod V8.

For 1997, the Ford Explorer gained a third engine, as Ford introduced an overhead-cam version of the 4.0 L Cologne V6.  Using a common displacement with the pushrod 4.0 L V6, the {{Convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} SOHC V6 rivaled the V8 in engine output.  Offered as standard equipment on the top-trim Eddie Bauer and Limited trims, the engine became an option on all other versions of the Explorer and Explorer Sport. For 2001, the pushrod V6 was discontinued, with the SOHC becoming the standard engine in all versions of the Explorer (and the sole engine of the 3-door Explorer Sport).

For 2000, Ford added flex-fuel capability to the Explorer for the first time.

A Mazda-produced 5-speed manual was standard with OHV V6 engine. The SOHC did not receive the 5-speed until 2000, but it was a stronger unit than the one behind the OHV. All V8 examples were equipped with a 4-speed heavy-duty automatic (shared with the F-150, Mustang, and Crown Victoria). 

The four-wheel drive system was redesigned for the 1995 Explorer. 
For the V6 models, in place of Touch Drive from the previous generation, [[ControlTrac]] was an electronically controlled full-time four-wheel drive system with a two-speed transfer case, with software controlling a multi-disc clutch (in place of a center differential). Along with traditional two-wheel drive and high and low-range four-wheel drive, "Auto" mode allowed software to maintain the amount of torque sent to the front wheels; if the front axle begins to spin slower, torque is shifted from the rear wheels to the front wheels until traction is achieved. Similar to TouchDrive, ControlTrac is dash-controlled, with a rotary selector for two-wheel drive (1995-1996, 2001-2003 Sports), auto (1997-2001), high range, and low range. 

The V8 models came equipped with a different full-time AWD system, without the 4x4 High-Range/Low-Range feature. The system required no driver input and torque distribution was entirely managed by a viscous clutch with a 40/60 split.

While visibly similar to its predecessor, many exterior panels from the 1995 Ford Explorer were changed, with only the roofline and the side doors carrying over.  As part of the changes related to the redesigned front suspension, the entire front fascia was redesigned, with the Explorer gaining model-distinct styling.  In a styling theme that would be used in several other Ford small trucks, the 1995 Explorer was given an oval grille; the headlamps were changed from rectangular to oval as well, wrapping into the fenders.  Depending on trim, the grille and bumpers were painted gray (XLT), body color (Limited/Sport), or chromed.  In contrast to the front fascia, the rear fascia saw relatively few changes, with the rear bumper nearly unchanged.  Along with slightly reshaped taillamps (with amber turn signals), the 1995 Ford Explorer marked the debut of a neon CHMSL (center brake light).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/1084360/Ford-Explorer.html|title=1995 Explorer first production vehicle to use a neon stop lamp|accessdate=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside the redesigned exterior, the interior of the second-generation Ford Explorer was given a redesign.  Maintaining commonality with the Ranger, the Explorer was given a new dashboard (marking the debut of dual airbags in an American-produced SUV), a new instrument panel; to improve user ergonomics, the Ford Explorer introduced a double-DIN radio panel and rotary-style climate controls.

For 1997, a third-row seat was introduced as an option; expanding seating to seven passengers, the design was only offered in export markets.

For 1998, the exterior of the Ford Explorer was given a mid-cycle update.  Distinguished by the addition of fender flares, the rear fascia was restyled, with larger taillamps; to better accommodate export, the license plate was shifted from the bumper to the liftgate; the neon CHMSL was replaced by an LED version.  16-inch wheels replaced 15-inch wheels (shared with the Ranger).  For 1999, the front bumper was redesigned, allowing for larger lower grille and fog lights.

The interior was given redesigned front and rear seats, along with second-generation airbags; side airbags were introduced (as an option).  Other options included load-leveling air suspension (on Eddie Bauer and Limited) and a reverse-sensing warning system.

=== Trim ===
At its launch, the second-generation Ford Explorer retained the use of the previous trim nomenclature; the standard trim was the XL, with the XLT serving as the primary model upgrade.  Along with the two-tone Eddie Bauer trim, the highest trim Explorer was the monochromatic Ford Explorer Limited.  For 2000, XLS replaced XL as the base trim (introduced as an appearance package for 1999).

In contrast to five-door Explorers, second-generation three-door Ford Explorers shifted to a separate trim nomenclature.  While the XL remained the base model (largely for fleets), most examples were produced under a single Sport trim level.  In 1995, the Expedition trim was introduced; roughly the 3-door equivalent of the Eddie Bauer, the trim was discontinued at the end of the model year as Ford reserved the name for the [[Ford Expedition]] full-size SUV (which entered production in mid-1996).

For 1998, the Explorer Sport became the sole version of the three-door; following the introduction of the third-generation Explorer, the Explorer Sport became a distinct model through the 2003 model year.

}}The third-generation Ford Explorer went on sale in January 2001 (as an early 2002 model). The U152 program began in 1995, with the final design being chosen in 1997 and frozen for production in February 1998, with development ending in 2000. The primary objective behind the third-generation Ford Explorer was to make the vehicle line more competitive in both domestic and export markets.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europe.autonews.com/article/20010326/ANE/103260845#axzz2hlp6op7Q|title=Ford Explorer project leader aimed at a global standard|work=Automotive News|date=March 26, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with tuning the Explorer for higher-speed European driving, the Explorer was benchmarked to lead against the [[Lexus RX]]300 and the then-in-development [[Volkswagen Touareg]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:2002 Ford Explorer (UT) XLT wagon (2015-06-25) 02.jpg|thumb|left|Ford Explorer XLT (Australia)]]
To make the Explorer more competitive, Ford shifted away from typical SUV design, abandoning the use of the Ford Ranger chassis architecture in favor of designing a purpose-built platform.  As part of the change, the Explorer became only the second rear-wheel drive American Ford platform fitted with four-wheel independent suspension (behind the MN12 platform).  In another major change, the third-generation Explorer was developed solely as a five-door vehicle. Retaining the previous-generation chassis architecture, the three-door Explorer Sport continued production through the 2003 model year; the Explorer Sport Trac four-door pickup truck continued through 2005.

The third-generation Ford Explorer was marketed by all three divisions of Ford Motor Company: by Mercury as the second-generation Mercury Mountaineer; Lincoln marketed the third-generation Explorer from 2002 to 2005 as the [[Lincoln Aviator]].

=== Chassis ===
The third-generation is based on the body-on-frame [[Ford U platform#U1|Ford UN152 platform]].  No longer derived from the Ford Ranger, the UN152 chassis was designed specifically for the five-door Explorer and its Lincoln-Mercury counterparts.  In a major shift from its predecessors, the third-generation Explorer adopted a four-wheel [[independent suspension]] configuration, never before used on a Ford truck (on American-produced SUVs, fully independent suspension was previously exclusive to the [[Hummer H1]]).  Similar to the layout used on the Ford MN12-chassis cars (1989-1998 Thunderbird/Cougar and Lincoln Mark VIII), each rear wheel was connected to the rear-axle differential with two half-shafts.

While the third-generation Ford Explorer was in development during the late 1990s a controversy involving the [[Firestone and Ford tire controversy|Explorer and Firestone tires]] developed, thus the increased stability of the configuration was designed in part to reduce rollover risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/26/business/explorer-model-raises-doubts-about-safety.html?p=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=Explorer Model Raises Doubts About Safety|author=Bradsher, Keith|date=April 26, 2001|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autosafety.org" /&gt;  In another change, Firestone tires (which had caused the rollovers and crashes of the Ford Explorers)  were not made available on any version of the third-generation Explorer.  Ford's AdvanceTrac RSC (Roll Stability Control) system became available as a standard feature on the Explorer for the 2005 model year.

Along with rear-wheel drive, the third-generation Explorer was offered with both four-wheel drive and permanent all-wheel drive; the latter was offered on the Explorer for the first time.

Carried over from the previous generation, the base engine for the third-generation Explorer was a {{convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 4.0 L V6.  Becoming the final V8-powered American Ford to adopt to the [[Ford Modular engine|Modular V8]], the third-generation Explorer offered a {{convert|239|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 4.6 L SOHC V8 (shared with the Crown Victoria/Grand Marquis) as its optional engine.  A five-speed manual transmission was offered for 2002 before its discontinuation; as of the 2020 model year, it is the final year a Ford Explorer was available with a manual transmission.  As an option for both the 4.0L and 4.6L V8 engines, the Ford 5R55 transmission was offered, becoming standard from 2003 to 2005.

=== Body ===
In contrast with the second-generation (a major revision of the 1991-1994 generation), the exterior and interior of the third-generation Ford Explorer were completely new designs. While sharing a number of design elements with the 1997 F-Series and Ford Expedition, the Ford Explorer also served as the introduction of a new design theme for several Ford vehicles; the 2003 Ford Expedition, the Ford Freestar, Ford Freestyle, and Ford Five Hundred would share various elements of the 2002 Ford Explorer design.  Retaining nearly the same proportions as the first two generations, the third-generation Explorer was an inch shorter in length and two inches wider, gaining two inches in wheelbase.

With the addition of independent rear suspension, several functional changes were brought as part of the redesign.  The cargo floor was lowered several inches, adding nearly 10 cubic feet of total cargo room.  Coinciding with the lower cargo floor, on nearly all models, a folding third-row seat was either standard or an option, bringing seating capacity to seven.  The rear liftgate was redesigned, with the upper hatch enlarged.

=== Trim ===
Ford produced the third generation Explorer in five trim levels: XLS, XLT, NBX, Eddie Bauer, and Limited.  Slotted below the XLS were two major trim packages, Sport Value, Sport Choice, with Sport Premium between XLS and XLT.  The outdoors-themed Eddie Bauer continued production with a two-tone exterior (with a tan lower body); the Limited wore a monochromatic body. The NBX trim was only made for 2003 and 2004, and was a loaded up XLT with Eddie Bauer-esque features. It was more like a bang-for-your-buck Eddie Bauer model rather than an actual trim level, as it didn't really set itself apart in any way like XLS did from XLT.

The ''Ford Explorer'' and the ''[[Mercury Mountaineer]]'' were both updated for the 2006 model year on a new frame, produced by ''[[Magna International]]'' rather than ''[[Tower Automotive]]''. Along with this new, stronger chassis, Ford updated the interior, redesigned the rear suspension and added power-folding third-row seats. Also, a [[tire pressure monitoring system]] and [[electronic stability control]] became standard equipment. Power [[running boards]], like the ones from the [[Lincoln Navigator]], were also made available on the Explorer and Mountaineer; the running boards lower to allow easier access when entering the vehicle, then retract upon door closure. Unlike previous generations, there was no [[right hand drive|right-hand drive]] option available for order, causing Ford to market Explorers in Japan in [[left hand drive|left-hand drive]] configuration. The LHD Explorers were desirable there because LHD vehicles are considered prestigious in Japan. Moreover, Ford switched to a one-piece rear liftgate design due to the problems associated with the previous generation's design.

The {{convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 4.0L [[multi-valve|12-valve]] [[SOHC]] V-6 was once again the standard engine. A more powerful {{convert|292|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 4.6L [[multi-valve|24-valve]] [[SOHC]] V-8, similar to the [[Fifth-generation Ford Mustang]]'s engine, was available as an option. The 6-speed [[Ford 6R transmission|6R]] [[automatic transmission]], built by Ford and based on a [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] design, was made standard equipment with the V-8 engine as well. The five-speed [[Ford C3 transmission#5R55E|5R55W]] automatic transmission was advanced. It was the only transmission available for the V-6 engine, because the [[Mazda]] five-speed [[manual transmission]] was dropped in the previous generation.

The 2006 Ford Explorer was nominated for the ''[[North American Car of the Year|North American Truck of the Year]]'' award for 2006.

===Model year changes===
For 2007, The Explorer received a few minor updates including standard AUX input on all stereos and optional power running boards,  heated windshield, Ironman Package, XLT Appearance Package, and heated leather seat package.

For 2008, Ford added side curtain airbags across the Explorer range. Also, the optional satellite navigation system was also upgraded with voice control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/ford/explorer/2008/review.html |title=2008 Ford Explorer Review |publisher=Edmunds.com |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2009, the Explorer received a trailer sway control system as standard equipment, and the navigation system received [[traffic]] flow monitoring with updated gas prices from nearby stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/ford/explorer/2009/review.html |title=2009 Ford Explorer Review and Specs |publisher=Edmunds.com |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2010 model year, Ford's [[MyKey]] became standard on all Explorers equipped with the Sync system, while V8s were restricted to 4-wheel-drive models.

===Ford Explorer Sport Trac===

The second generation '''[[Ford Explorer Sport Trac|Sport Trac]]''' came out in early 2006 for the 2007 [[model year]]. Unlike its predecessor sold through 2005, it featured the V-8 engine as an option and was based on this generation Explorer's platform. ''AdvanceTrac'' with ''Roll Stability Control'' was made standard on the Sport Trac.

===Sport Trac Adrenalin===

[[File:2008 Adrenalin.jpg|thumb|2010 Sport Trac Adrenalin]] 
For the 2007 model year, the Ford [[Special Vehicle Team]] built the ''Sport Trac Adrenalin'' concept with a [[supercharged]] version of the 4.6&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Ford Modular engine|Modular]]'' [[V8 engine|V-8]], with {{convert|390|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, and featuring {{convert|21|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheels. The model was planned by Ford SVT to be the successor to the [[Ford F-Series#Lightening|F-150 Lightning]] [[sport car|sports]] [[pickup truck]]. However, the SVT version of the Adrenalin was cancelled in a cost-cutting move as part of ''[[The Way Forward]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=109191 |title=Death Row: Ford Pulls Plug on GT Supercar, Lincoln LS and Explorer Sport Trac Adrenalin |work=Edmunds Inside Line |date=February 6, 2006 |accessdate=October 15, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624041928/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId%3D109191 |archivedate=June 24, 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Adrenalin was subsequently sold as an appearance package from 2007-2010. It had blacked-out headlights, black grill, monochrome color interior, unique front and rear bumpers, front fender vents, and molded-in running boards. It also came standard with 20" polished aluminum wheels, and the fender flares that came on the Explorer and standard Sport Trac were deleted.

The 5th generation 2011 Explorer bore similarity to the Explorer America concept's construction, and includes a unibody structure based on the [[Ford D3 platform#D4|D4 platform]], a modified version of the D3 platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/hot_lists/car_shopping/future_cars_2010_and_beyond/2011_ford_explorer_car_news |title=2011 Ford Explorer – Car News |author=Quiroga, Tony |work=Car &amp; Driver |date=May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511162051/http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/hot_lists/car_shopping/future_cars_2010_and_beyond/2011_ford_explorer_car_news |archivedate=May 11, 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/03/31/2011-ford-explorer-reportedly-to-be-built-in-chicago-on-taurus-x/ |title=2011 Ford Explorer reportedly to be built in Chicago on Taurus X platform |work=Autoblog |date=March 31, 2009 |author=Shunk, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move from traditional SUV to crossover effectively vacated the midsize SUV segment for Ford until the sixth generation [[Ford Bronco|Bronco]] arrives in 2020.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

The fifth generation Explorer features blacked-out A, B, and D-pillars to produce a ''floating roof'' effect similar to Land Rover's floating roof design used on its sport utility vehicles; a design which Ford previously used on the [[Ford Flex]]. The fifth generation Explorer features sculpted body work with stepped style headlamps similar to the [[Ford Flex|Flex]], [[Ford Edge|Edge]], [[Ford Escape#2008–present|Escape]], [[Ford Expedition#Third generation (2007–present)|Expedition]] and [[F-150]], as well as new stepped style tail lamps. The grille features Ford's corporate three-bar design with upper and lower perforated mesh work, similar to that of the [[Ford Taurus (sixth generation)|sixth-generation Ford Taurus]].

The development of the fifth generation Explorer was led by chief engineer Jim Holland from February 2008 to October 2010, who was also a chief engineer for [[Land Rover]]; heading development of the Land Rover [[Range Rover#Third generation (2002-)|Range Rover]] (L322) 2005 facelift from December 2001 to December 2004. Holland also worked on the Ford Expedition (U324) during its initial development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=32661 |title=Jim Holland: Bringing Luxury Levels Of Content, Craftsmanship To Reinvigorated Ford Explorer, Ford Motor Company Newsroom |publisher=Media.ford.com |accessdate=October 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524001259/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=32661 |archivedate=May 24, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth generation Explorer made its debut online on July 26, 2010. Ford had set up a Ford Explorer Facebook page ahead of its debut.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/mashable/20100721/tc_mashable/ford_to_unveil_2011_explorer_on_facebook_1]{{dead link|date=April 2011}} from Yahoo.com (July 21, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Assembly of the fifth-generation Explorer moved to Ford's [[Chicago Assembly]] plant commencing December 1, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trucktrend.com/news/163-news101202-2011-ford-explorer-production/|title=All-new 2011 Ford Explorer Begins Production in Chicago - Auto News|date=December 2, 2010|website=Truck Trend}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it is built alongside the Ford Taurus and Lincoln MKS. The Louisville plant, where the previous generation was built, was converted to produce cars based on Ford's global [[Ford C1 platform|C platform]] (potentially including the [[Ford Focus (international)|Ford Focus]], [[Ford C-Max]], and [[Ford Kuga]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=31941 |publisher=Ford Motor Company |date=January 26, 2010 |title=FORD TO BRING NEXT-GENERATION FORD EXPLORER, 1,200 JOBS TO CHICAGO MANUFACTURING FACILITIES |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728215959/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=31941 |archivedate=July 28, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Escape, the Explorer will continue to be marketed as an "SUV" rather than a "crossover SUV". It went on sale in December 2010, after pre-launch sales had by the end of November 2010 totaled around 15,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report: Ford Explorer orders nearly double expectations|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2010/11/28/report-ford-explorer-orders-nearly-double-expectations/|publisher=Autoblog|date=November 28, 2010|accessdate=November 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA rated fuel economy of 20/28 mpg city/highway for the four-cylinder EcoBoost engine option.

===Features===
Available features on the fifth generation Explorer include intelligent access with push button start, remote engine start, power liftgate, power adjustable pedals with memory, premium leather trimmed seating, heated and cooled front seats, dual headrest DVD entertainment system, [[adaptive cruise control]], [[active park assist]], [[Sirius XM|SIRIUS Travel Link]], [[MyFord Touch]], [[Ford SYNC]] by [[Microsoft]], [[Sony]] audio system with [[HD radio]] and [[Apple iTunes]] tagging, in-dash advanced [[GPS navigation device|navigation system]], SoundScreen laminated [[Acoustics|acoustic]] and solar tinted [[windshield]] with [[rain-sensing]] wipers, 20-inch polished V-spoke aluminium wheels, and [[High-intensity discharge headlamp]]s (HID) and [[LED]] tail lamps.

Unlike the Explorer America concept vehicle which only seats five occupants, the production Explorer holds two rows of seating with available ''PowerFold'' fold flat third row seating (like the previous generation) and accommodates up to seven occupants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordvehicles.com/suvs/explorer/2011/features/#page=Feature2 |title=Ford – Cars, SUVs, Trucks &amp; Crossovers, Ford Vehicles, The Official Site of Ford Vehicles |publisher=FordVehicles.com |accessdate=October 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930183135/http://www.fordvehicles.com/suvs/explorer/2011/features/#page=Feature2 |archivedate=September 30, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capability===
The Explorer is available in either [[front-wheel drive]] or full-time [[all-wheel drive]]. At first only one engine was available: the {{convert|290|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|255|lbft|abbr=on}} of torque) 3.5 liter TiVCT (Twin independent [[Variable Camshaft Timing]]) V-6 attached to either the 6-speed 6F automatic or 6-speed 6F ''SelectShift'' automatic.

Soon thereafter, Ford offered the economical{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} {{convert|240|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|270|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque) 2 liter ''EcoBoost'' [[turbocharged]], [[Gasoline direct injection|direct-injected]] I-4 mated to the 6-speed 6F automatic.

Off-road electronics include [[Hill Descent Control system|Hill Descent Control]] (HDC), [[Hill-start assist|Hill Ascent Assist]] (HAA), [[Traction control system#Use of traction control|four-wheel electronic traction control]] and Terrain Management.

Four-wheel electronic traction control (ABS braking) is employed to simulate front and rear [[Locking differential#Alternatives|differential locks]] via aggressively "brake locking" the front or rear differentials, transferring up to 100 percent of torque from side-to-side.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="motortrend1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceDD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1065366_2012-ford-explorer_performance_3 |title=2012 Ford Explorer |publisher=thecarconnection.com |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the right conditions, the Explorer can keep moving even if only one wheel has traction, regardless of which wheel it is.

Terrain Management includes four selectable modes. Each mode is selected via a rotary control dial on the center console, aft of the transmission shifter.

Depending on the mode selected, Terrain Management will control, adjust, and fine tune the engine, transmission, center multi-disc differential lock, throttle response, [[Traction control system#Use of traction control|four-wheel electronic traction control]] and electronic stability control (ESC) to adapt the SUV for optimal performance on the corresponding terrain.

Off-road geometry figures for approach, departure and ramp breakover angles are 21°, 21° and 16° respectively.&lt;ref name="fordvehicles.com"/&gt; Minimum running ground clearance is {{Convert|7.6|in|mm|0}}.&lt;ref name="fordvehicles.com"/&gt; Standard running ground clearance is {{Convert|8.2|in|mm|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kbb.com/car-news/all-the-latest/2011-ford-explorer-revealed |title=2011 Ford Explorer Revealed – Kelley Blue Book |publisher=Kbb.com |date=July 26, 2010 |accessdate=January 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low hanging running boards are no longer offered from the factory to help increase side obstacle clearance.

Moving to a monocoque body usually has a negative impact on towing capacity. The new Explorer will be available with an optional trailer tow package. The package includes a Class III trailer hitch, engine oil cooler, trailer electrics connector, trailer sway control (TSC), wiring harness and a rear-view camera with trailer alignment assistance to help in backing up to a trailer. If equipped with the trailer tow package the new 2011 Explorer will be able to tow up to {{Convert|5000|lb|0|abbr=on}} of braked trailer. That is {{Convert|1500|lb|0|abbr=on}} greater than the towing capacity stated for the Explorer America concept and {{Convert|2115|lb|abbr=on}} less than the outgoing Explorer's towing capacity, although that was only available with the 4.6 L V8 engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordvehicles.com/suvs/explorer/2011/features/#page=Feature11 |title=Ford – Cars, SUVs, Trucks &amp; Crossovers, Ford Vehicles, The Official Site of Ford Vehicles |publisher=FordVehicles.com |accessdate=October 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930183135/http://www.fordvehicles.com/suvs/explorer/2011/features/#page=Feature11 |archivedate=September 30, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordvehicles.com/suvs/explorer/specifications/towing/ |title=2010 Ford Explorer, View Towing Specifications |publisher=FordVehicles.com |accessdate=October 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117015020/http://www.fordvehicles.com/suvs/explorer/specifications/towing/ |archivedate=January 17, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety and security===
Safety features include: Dual front adaptive SRS air bags, dual front seat side impact air bags, dual rear safety belt air bags (available first quarter, 2011) and side curtain head, torso and rollover protection air bags. Other optional safety features include BLIS [[blind spot information system]] with [[Intersection assistant|rear cross traffic alert]], [[forward collision warning with brake support]] [[precrash system]], [[Auto high-beam]], [[Roll Stability Control]] (RSC), [[Electronic stability control]] (ESC) and [[Curve Control]].

The fifth-generation Explorer was the first-ever vehicle to be equipped with dual rear [[inflatable safety belt]]s. Air bags are sewn into the inside of the seat belts, and inflate with cold air to prevent burns. Ford claims it will be released as an option and to introduce inflatable seat belts on other Ford models eventually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rumors.automobilemag.com/6574402/news/2011-ford-explorer-will-offer-inflatable-seatbelts-to-rear-seat-passengers/index.html |title=2011 Ford Explorer Will Offer Inflatable Seatbelts to Rear Seat Passengers – Automotive News &amp; Car Rumors at Automobile Magazine |publisher=Rumors.automobilemag.com |date=November 5, 2009 |accessdate=October 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519123200/http://rumors.automobilemag.com/6574402/news/2011-ford-explorer-will-offer-inflatable-seatbelts-to-rear-seat-passengers/index.html |archive-date=May 19, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global recall===
On June 12, 2019, Ford announced a global recall of 1.2 million Explorers produced from 2011 to 2017 citing suspension issues. Ford stated if the car was subjected to frequent rides over rough terrain that the toe link on the rear suspension could fracture which would affect steering and lead to greater risks of traffic accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/12/business/ford-explorer-recall/index.html |title=Ford recalling 1.2 million Explorers over suspension issue |publisher=CNN |author=Chris Isidore |date=June 12, 2019 |accessdate=June 16, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 facelift===
[[File:Ford Explorer V facelift China 2016-04-13.jpg|thumb|right|2016 facelift]]
The refreshed 2016 model year Ford Explorer debuted at the 2014 [[Los Angeles Auto Show]], with a redesigned front fascia, hood and lower bumper, standard LED low-beam headlights, and fog lamps that were inspired by the [[Ford F-Series thirteenth generation|thirteenth generation Ford F-150]]. The rear of the Explorer was also refreshed with restyled LED tail lamps and dual exhaust outlets. The 2016 refresh bumped the [[I4 engine]]  to a 2.3 Liter EcoBoost four-cylinder engine from the 2015 [[Ford Mustang]]. A newly introduced Platinum trim now tops out the range, slotting above the Sport and Limited trims. Similar to the Platinum editions of the F150 and Ford Super Duty trucks, the Platinum trim features front and rear cameras, enhanced active park assist with perpendicular park assist, park-out assist and semi-automatic parallel parking, hands-free liftgate from the [[Ford Escape]], an exclusive 500-watt [[Sony]] surround sound system, and a heated steering-wheel. The '''Platinum''' trim is paired with a 3.5 Liter EcoBoost [[Twin-turbo]] V6 with {{convert|365|bhp|kW||abbr=on}} which was previously only available with the '''Sport''' trim. The 2016 Explorer went on sale at dealerships in the Summer of 2015. Other than the addition of the top-of-the-line Platinum trim, as well as standard eighteen-inch [[alloy wheels]] on the base Explorer trim, the changes are mainly in styling, exterior and interior color combinations, technology, and power.

===2018 facelift===
[[File: '18 Ford Explorer.jpg|thumb|right|2018 facelift]]
The Ford Explorer received a second facelift which include a refreshed front end with revised LED headlights and redesigned LED fog lights plus new exterior colors, new interior colors, and new wheel designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford.com/suvs/explorer/2017/features/design/?intcmp=cmod-fv-vhp-explorer-170411#the_2018_explorer |title=2017 Ford Explorer SUV &amp;#124; Features Designed for Comfort and Style |publisher=Ford.com |date= |accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of initial Explorer and Aviator vehicles were shipped to Ford's [[Flat Rock Assembly Plant]] for repairs due to quality control problems.  Later models have been shipped from the Chicago plant to dealerships; however, many required dealer repairs before they could be sold.

== Variants ==

=== Ford Explorer Sport (1991-2003) ===
As the direct successor of the Bronco II, Ford developed a three-door version of the Explorer for the 1991 model year; while 10 inches shorter than its five-door counterpart, the three-door was still nearly 13 inches longer than the Bronco II.  For the first generation, the three-door was available in any trim (except Limited), with Sport offered as a trim exclusive to the three-door.  Distinguished by black-colored wheelwells and rocker panels, Sport was slotted between XL and XLT.  For 1995, Expedition was offered as an trim package for the three-door Explorer; replacing the Eddie Bauer trim, the nameplate was retired after 1995 in preparation for the 1997 full-size four-door SUV.

During the second generation, the XL and XLT trims were retired for the 1998 model year, with all three-door Explorers becoming Explorer Sports.  For 2001, the Explorer Sport was split from the four-door Explorer, retaining the second-generation body and chassis and adopting the front fascia of the Explorer Sport Trac.

Ford discontinued the Ford Explorer Sport following the 2003 model year, with the final vehicle produced in July 2003.&lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Ford Explorer Sport Trac (2001-2010) ===
Introduced in 2000 as a 2001 model, the [[Ford Explorer Sport Trac|Explorer Sport Trac]] is a mid-size pickup truck derived from the second-generation Explorer, becoming the first mid-size Ford pickup.  In contrast to the Ranger, the Sport Trac was marketed primarily as a personal-use vehicle rather than for work use.

Offered solely as a four-door crew cab, the design of the Sport Trac shared commonality with multiple vehicles.  Sharing the frame and wheelbase of the Ranger SuperCab, the Sport Trac combined the front fascia of the Explorer Sport with a crew cab derived from the four-door Explorer; the pickup bed (designed for the model line) shared its tailgate with the F-150 SuperCrew.

The 2001-2005 Sport Trac was the final version of the Explorer derived from the Ranger.  After skipping the 2006 model year, a second-generation Sport Trac was produced from 2007 to 2010 (derived from the fourth-generation Explorer).&lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

===Ford Police Interceptor Utility===
[[File:California Highway Patrol Ford Interceptor Utility (28137041810).jpg|alt=|thumb|Ford Police Interceptor Utility vehicle operated by the [[California Highway Patrol]].]]
[[File:City of Las Vegas Deputy City Marshals Cars.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|2013-2015 Police Interceptor Utility (next to Police Interceptor Sedan); operated by City of Las Vegas Deputy City Marshals]]
Following the end of production of the [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]] in 2011, Ford began development of a police-service variant of the Ford Explorer. For the 2013 model year, Ford introduced the Police Interceptor Utility; as with the related Police Interceptor Sedan variant of the Ford Taurus, the Utility is referred to as a Ford Police Interceptor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.ford.com/news-center/press-releases-detail/hot-selling-ford-police-interceptor-utility-vehicle-now-offers-3|title=Ford Motor Company Official Global Corporate Homepage &amp;#124; Ford.com|author=|date=March 13, 2017|website=Corporate.ford.com|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in lieu of being a Ford Explorer.

As with the Police Interceptor Sedan and the Ford Expedition SSV, the Utility is not sold for retail sale and is specifically designed for use by law enforcement or use by other emergency service agencies.  Along with fleet-specific options such as steel wheels and provisions for user-specific paint schemes (such as contrasting doors), the Utility comes with provisions for fitting emergency equipment such as radios, [[lightbar]]s and sirens. To free up interior space on the center console for equipment, the transmission is fitted with a column-mounted shifter.

The Police Interceptor Utility comes with an all-wheel drive powertrain standard. Over a standard Explorer, the Utility is fitted with larger brake rotors, more advanced ABS and traction control systems, a more efficient cooling system and other standard police equipment.

At its launch, the initial engine fitted was a {{Convert|305|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.7 L version of the Ti-VCT V6, shared with the Ford Mustang and F-150. For 2014, Ford added the {{Convert|365|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.5 L EcoBoost V6 (shared with the Police Interceptor Sedan and Ford Taurus SHO).

The California Highway Patrol now uses the '''''Police Interceptor Utility''''' because the current Ford Taurus, Chevrolet Caprice and Dodge Charger patrol cars did not meet the payload the CHP requires for a universal patrol car.&lt;ref name="motortrend.com" /&gt;  In May 2014, statisticians R.L. Polk declared the PI Utility the most popular police vehicle, based on 2013 U.S. sales figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20140324/BUSINESS01/303240049|title=Auto news - Detroit Free Press - freep.com|work=Detroit Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2020 Ford Police Interceptor Utility====
[[File:2020 Ford Explorer Hybrid Interceptor spec front NYIAS 2019.jpg|thumb|2020 Police Interceptor Utility (Hybrid version)|alt=]]

For the 2020 model year, Ford has created a second-generation Police Interceptor Utility, derived from the sixth-generation Explorer.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a21289331/this-is-the-new-2020-ford-explorerin-cop-car-form/|title=This Is the New 2020 Ford Explorer—in Cop-Car Form|work=Car and Driver}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Offered exclusively in an all-wheel drive configuration, the Utility is offered with a twin-turbocharged 3.0L V6 and as a hybrid, with a 3.3L V6 and an electric motor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Following the shift from the D4 to the CD6 architecture, the Police Interceptor Utility gains cargo space (even with hybrid batteries onboard) over its predecessor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In total, the hybrid system increased the combined fuel economy of the Utility from 19 MPG to 24 MPG,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; a 26% increase.

=== Mazda Navajo (1991-1994) ===
[[File:Mazda Navajo -- 06-16-2012.JPG|thumb|Mazda Navajo]]
The first-generation Ford Explorer was sold by Mazda from 1991 to 1994 as the '''Mazda Navajo'''.  Offered solely in a three-door configuration, only minor design details differed the Navajo from its Ford counterpart.  Along with significantly reducing the development costs of the model line for Mazda, the assembly of the Navajo by Ford in the United States allowed Mazda to circumvent the [[chicken tax]] (in contrast to intended Japanese-brand competitors [[Nissan Pathfinder]] and [[Toyota 4Runner]]).  

Along with a revised front fascia, the Navajo received new taillamps and wheels; the bumpers were painted dark gray (resulting in the deletion of all chrome trim).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://autoweek.com/article/classic-cars/rare-anywhere-mazda-navajo|title=Rare anywhere: Mazda Navajo|date=2018-03-15|website=Autoweek|language=en|access-date=2020-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The interior was largely shared between the two model lines, with the Navajo receiving its own lettering for the instrument panel (in line with other Mazda vehicles); Mazda lettering was added to the Ford steering wheel hub.     

In place of the three trims offered on the three-door Ford Explorer, Mazda offered the Navajo in base DX and top-tier LX trim&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; (roughly the equivalent of the Explorer Sport and three-door Explorer XLT).  Offered only with four-wheel drive at its launch, a rear-wheel drive version of the Navajo was introduced for 1992.  As with the first-generation Explorer, all Navajos were fitted with a 4.0L V6; a five-speed manual was standard, with a four-speed automatic offered as an option (on both the DX and LX&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;).  

In the early 1990s, SUVs transitioned into alternatives to station wagons, leading to a decline in demand for two-door SUVs.  After the 1994 model year, Mazda withdrew the Navajo, returning in 2000 with the four-door [[Mazda Tribute|Tribute]] (a counterpart of the [[Ford Escape]]).  

=== Mercury Mountaineer (1997-2010) ===
{{Main|Mercury Mountaineer}}
The Ford Explorer was sold by the Mercury division as the [[Mercury Mountaineer]] from 1997 to 2010.  Developed as a competitor for the [[Oldsmobile Bravada]] and the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee (ZJ)#Jeep Grand Wagoneer (1993)|1993 Jeep Grand Wagoneer]], the Mountaineer was a four-door premium SUV slotted above the Explorer Limited.  Marking the reintroduction of the waterfall grille to the Mercury brand, the model line was distinguished by two-tone (and later monochromatic) styling different from the Explorer. 

Coinciding with the 2010 closure of the Mercury brand, the Mountaineer was withdrawn after the 2010 model year; three generations were produced, with the Mountaineer serving as the largest Mercury SUV (above the [[Mercury Mariner|Mariner]]).&lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

[[File:2019 Lincoln Aviator prototype 01.jpg|thumb|2020-present Lincoln Aviator]]{{Main|Lincoln Aviator}}
The Ford Explorer has been sold twice by the Lincoln division as the [[Lincoln Aviator]].  From 2003 to 2005, the Lincoln Aviator was marketed as a counterpart of the third-generation Explorer.  The first mid-size SUV sold by Lincoln, the model line was slotted between the Mercury Mountaineer and the Lincoln Navigator.  Following the introduction of the fourth-generation Explorer, the model line was repackaged as a CUV based on the [[Ford Edge]] and renamed the [[Lincoln MKX]] (today the Lincoln Nautilus).

For 2020, the Lincoln Aviator was revived (after a 14-year hiatus) as a mid-size SUV; as before, the model line is a Lincoln counterpart of the Ford Explorer (now the sixth generation) and the Lincoln Navigator.  The second-generation Aviator is the first Lincoln vehicle offered as with [[plug-in hybrid]] capability as an option; its 494 hp combined output is the highest-ever for a Lincoln vehicle.

== Export sales ==

===UK models===
In the UK, the Ford Explorer was initially available as just one model, with the 4.0-litre engine and with a high specification – the only dealer options being leather interior. Second and third-generation Explorers for the UK and other RHD markets utilised a center console-mounted shifter and hand parking brake instead of the steering column-mounted shifter and parking brake pedal used in the North American models. In 1998, a facelifted Explorer was available with minor cosmetic interior changes and a revised rear tail lift which centered the rear number plate. In 1999 the model range was revamped slightly, the base model becoming the XLT and a special edition North Face version marketed with a tie in to North Face outdoor clothing. The North Face version was available in a dark green or a silver, with body-colored bumpers, heated leather seats and a CD multichanger as standard. In 2000, the North Face was also available in black.

===Middle East and Asia===
In the Middle East, Taiwan, and China, the 2012 Ford Explorer is currently available in several trims, all of which have a 3.5-liter V6 engine and an automatic gearbox. Some GCC markets offer the front-wheel-drive version as a base model, while most of the trims have standard all-wheel-drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.drivearabia.com/news/2011/08/24/ford-explorer-2011-2012-gcc-specifications-dubai-uae-gcc/|title=Ford Explorer 2011-2012 full GCC spec-sheets|website=Drive Arabia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest generation Explorer was made available in Japan the Fall of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ford.co.jp/|title=Ford Japan|work=ford.co.jp|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001082041/https://www.ford.co.jp/|archivedate=October 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current exports===
As of 2009, the Explorer is also sold in Bolivia, Chile, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Dominican Republic, People's Republic of China, Japan, South Korea, Israel, Republic of China (Taiwan), The Philippines, Turkey, Russia, Iceland, the Middle East, and certain countries in South America and Africa.

As of 2014, the Explorer is also available in Ukraine and Belarus. As of 2018, American-made Explorers are also exported to Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ford.com.vn/suvs/explorer/ |title=Ford Explorer |work=Ford.com.vn |date= |accessdate=May 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other usage===
Gothic black Ford Explorer vehicles are also used by federal agencies, such as the [[United States Secret Service]].

==Criticism and controversies==

===Rollover and Firestone Tire controversy===
{{Main|Firestone vs Ford Motor Company controversy}}
240 deaths and 3,000 catastrophic injuries resulted from the combination of early generation Explorers and [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] tires.&lt;ref name="autosafety.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autosafety.org/ford-explorer-firestone-tire|title=Ford Explorer-Firestone Tire|work=autosafety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tire tread separated and the vehicle had an unusually high rate of [[Vehicle rollover|rollover]] crash as a result. Both companies' reputations were tarnished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizen.org/autosafety/article_redirect.cfm?ID=5413|title=Public Citizen Auto Safety|work=citizen.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event led to a disruption in the 90-year-old Ford/Firestone partnership.

Rollover risk is inherently higher in truck-based vehicles, like the Explorer, than in ordinary passenger cars, as modification for bulky 4-wheel-drive hardware requires increases in height to avoid compromising ground clearance (raising the center of gravity), while a short wheelbase further reduces stability.&lt;ref name="autosafety.org"/&gt; The previous Bronco II had already been cited by ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' for rollover tendencies in turns.&lt;ref name="autosafety.org"/&gt;

The Explorer was cleared by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|NHTSA]] as no more dangerous than any other truck when driven unsafely. It used the same tires as the Ford Ranger with a relatively low rating for high temperatures. Lowering tire pressure recommendations softened the ride further and improved emergency stability through increased traction, but increased the chances of overheating tires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/how-to/a9399/why-blowouts-happen-and-how-to-avoid-them-15832078/|title=Why Blowouts Happen—and How to Avoid Them|author=Mac Demere|work=Popular Mechanics}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1995 redesign with a new suspension slightly raised the Explorer's center of gravity, but it was called inconsequential by a Ford spokesman. Memos by Ford engineers suggested lowering the engine height, but it would have increased the cost of the new design.

Explorer rollover rates, at the time of the controversy, were higher than any of its competitors. While Firestone turned out millions of sub-standard and potentially defective tires, and was the initial cause of loss of control on many Ford Explorer Firestone tire tread separation rollovers, the blame shifted towards Ford for a defectively designed and unstable vehicle .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pat McCarty |url=http://www.fordexplorerrollover.com |title=Ford Explorer Rollover |publisher=Ford Explorer Rollover |date=July 17, 2001 |accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2000, the US [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) contacted Ford and [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] about a higher than normal incidence of tire failures on Ford Explorers, [[Mercury Mountaineer]]s, and [[#Mazda Navajo (1991-1994)|Mazda Navajo]]s fitted with Firestone tires (later including Ford Ranger and Mazda B-Series pickup trucks). The failures all involved ''tread separation'', in which the outer tread carcass would [[delamination|delaminate]] and cause a rapid loss of tire pressure. Ford investigated and found that several models of {{convert|15|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} Firestone tires (''ATX'', ''ATX II'', and ''Wilderness AT'') had higher failure rates, especially those made at Firestone's [[Decatur, Illinois]] plant.

Ford recommended a tire inflation of only {{convert|26|psi|0}} likely contributing to the tread separation problem by causing the tires to operate at higher than normal temperatures.&lt;ref name="autosafety.org"/&gt;

Ford argued that Firestone was at fault, noting that the tires made by Firestone were very defective. Nevertheless, Ford subsequently recommended that front and rear tires should be inflated to {{convert|30|psi|0}} on all Explorer models and mailed a replacement tire pressure door sticker indicating the same to all registered owners.

Some have argued that poor driver reaction to tire blowout was a contributing factor.&lt;ref name="Wards"&gt;"Bad Drivers, Good Credibility – car makers face uphill struggle against public perception", ''Ward's Auto World'', April 2001&lt;/ref&gt; When a tire blew, the vehicle would experience a sudden sharp jerk, and many drivers reacted by counter-steering in an attempt to regain control. This action would cause a shift of the vehicle's weight, resulting in a rollover especially at higher speeds (many reports of rollovers were of vehicles being driven at speeds of {{convert|70|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and above). In a test simulating dozens of tire blowouts, Larry Webster, a test-driver for ''[[Car and Driver|Car &amp; Driver]]'' magazine, was repeatedly able to bring a 1994 Explorer to a stop without incident from speeds of {{convert|70|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Wards"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Doron Levin]] column, ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', October 27, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, car experts and NHTSA claim that the vast majority of crash accidents and deaths were caused not by the vehicle, but by the driver, by road conditions or some combination of the two.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Ackman, "Ford, Firestone Face Off", ''[[Forbes]]'', June 19, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Many vehicle injury attorneys dissent from this view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psblaw.com/2010/08/31/tire-separation-causes-california-auto-accident-involving-police-officer/|title=Tire Separation Causes California Auto Accident Involving Police Officer|last=|first=|date=August 31, 2010|website=Panish, Shea &amp; Boyle LLP|publisher=Panish, Shea &amp; Boyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cdrb-law.com/legal-articles/Tire-Tread-Separation-2-Theories-of-Liability.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Tire Tread Separation - 2 Theories of Liability.doc |website=Cdrb-law.com |accessdate=March 27, 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328225419/https://cdrb-law.com/legal-articles/Tire-Tread-Separation-2-Theories-of-Liability.pdf |archivedate=March 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Firestone's allegations of the Explorer's design defects, NHTSA undertook a preliminary investigation and reported that further action was not required. Its conclusion was that the Explorer was no more prone to rollover than other SUVs given their high [[center of gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=U.S. Department of Transportation News |url=http://www.dot.gov/affairs/nhtsa01102.htm |title=NHTSA Denies Firestone Request For Ford Explorer Investigation |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020613053037/http://www.dot.gov/affairs/nhtsa01102.htm |archive-date=June 13, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent introduction and proliferation of [[Electronic stability control#Effectiveness|electronic stability control]] systems have essentially addressed and mitigated this shortcoming.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In May 2001, Ford announced it would replace 13 million Firestone tires fitted to Explorer vehicles.&lt;ref name="autosafety.org"/&gt;

===U-Haul trailers===
On December 22, 2003, [[U-Haul]], the largest American equipment rental company, announced it would prohibit its outlets from renting trailers to persons planning to tow behind Ford Explorers due to liability concerns, with no published data to substantiate the claim.&lt;ref name="Mayne"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2004-01-08-uhaul-ford_x.htm |work=USA Today |title=U-Haul rejects Explorers |first=Eric |last=Mayne |date=January 14, 2004 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unofficial reports from employees indicated that it was due to the rear bumper separating from the vehicle, including the tow hook assembly. U-Haul did not alter its policies regarding the renting of trailers to persons planning to tow behind the [[Mercury Mountaineer]], [[Mazda Navajo]] or earlier versions of the [[Lincoln Aviator]], which are all mechanically identical to the Ford Explorer.&lt;ref name="Mayne" /&gt;  In mid-2013, U-Haul began allowing Ford Explorers of model year 2011 and newer to tow their trailers. All other Ford Motor Company vehicles are allowed to tow U-Haul trailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uhaul.com/trucks/faq.aspx#equipment |title=Frequently asked questions: Truck rentals |publisher=U-Haul |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reliability===

The 4.0L SOHC V6 engine found on second, third, and fourth generation Explorers was notorious for the plastic OEM timing chain guides, cassettes, and tensioners breaking resulting in timing chain ticking, rattle or "death rattle". This problem can occur as early as 45,000&amp;nbsp;mi (72,000&amp;nbsp;km) in some vehicles. When the engine is run for an extended period of time with this issue, the engine can jump timing or cease from running, damaging the heads and valves.

Timing chain rattle was mitigated in later years of the SOHC (in most vehicles, after 2002) with updated cassettes and tensioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.underhoodservice.com/exploring-service-needs-on-the-ford-4-0l-v6-engine/|date=Apr 15, 2013|title=‘Exploring’ Service Needs On The Ford 4.0L V6 Engine|first=Larry |last=Carley|website=Underhood Service|accessdate=July 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 5R55 series transmissions found on second through fourth generation Explorers was also notorious for premature failures. Common issues with this transmission include but are not limited to servo pin bore wear, premature transmission case wear, and excessive valve body wear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetransmissionshop.com/fords-four-versions-of-5r55/ |title=Ford "Four Versions of 5R55"|website=The Transmission Shop |accessdate=July 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Truck, Utility, ¼-Ton, 4×4, M151''' or simply '''M151''' was the successor to the Korean War [[Willys M38|M38]] and [[Willys M38A1|M38A1]] [[jeep]] [[Light Utility Vehicle]]s. The M151 had an [[unibody|integrated body]] design which offered a little more space than prior jeeps, and featured all-around [[independent suspension]] with coil springs. It has since been replaced by the larger [[Humvee|AM General HMMWV]] in most utility roles in frontline use. With some M151A2 units still in U.S. military service in 1999, the M151 series achieved a longer run of service than that of the WW2 [[Willys MB|MB/GPW]], M38, and M38A1 series combined.

== History ==
In 1951 [[Ford Motor Company]] was awarded the contract to design a ¼-ton 4×4 truck to replace the aging M38 and M38A1 model jeeps. The M151 was developed to specifications and guidance of the U.S. Army's Ordnance Tank Automotive Command. Design started in 1951 and testing and prototyping lasted through most of the fifties. Although the M151 was developed and initially produced by Ford, production contracts for the M151A2 were later also awarded to [[Kaiser Motors|Kaiser]] and [[AM General|AM General Corp]], a subsidiary of AMC.

== Design ==
[[File:JeepRightTopDownM151.jpg|thumb|M151A2 with top up and closed]]
Although the M151 mostly retained the same basic layout and dimensions of its predecessors, it was for all intents and purposes a completely new design. Unlike previous jeep designs, whose structure consisted of a steel tub bolted onto a separate steel frame, the M151 utilized an [[Vehicle frame|integrated frame]] design, which integrated the box frame rails and the sheet-steel body into a [[unibody]] structure. Eliminating the separate frame gave the M151 slightly more ground clearance, while at the same time lowering the center of gravity. Although the vehicle's dimensions were only slightly enlarged — the 85 inch wheelbase was 4 inches longer than its predecessor, or 5 inches compared to the [[Willys MB]], and the width was increased 3 inches — combined with the improved space efficiency of the integrated body design, the vehicle was a bit roomier than previous jeeps, while retaining the same light weight.
[[File:JeepFrontM151.jpg|thumb|Front has grille with horizontal slats]]
Another area improved upon in the M151 was the suspension. Dispensing with the rigid [[live axle]]s in the front and rear that all [[Willys MB|previous military jeeps]] used (a layout still used on modern day Jeeps, such as the [[Jeep CJ]] and [[Jeep Wrangler|Wrangler]]), the M151 was instead equipped with [[independent suspension]] and coil springs. This made it capable of high-speed, cross-country travel, while boasting high maneuverability and agility. The new suspension also had the added benefit of providing a more comfortable ride.

Due to copyright and trademark issues, the M151 did not feature Jeep's distinctive seven vertical slot grille, instead, a horizontal grille was used.

== Handling problems ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}
Unlike other military transports, such as the WWII and Korean War [[Jeeps]] and Dodge and Chevrolet transport trucks, the M151 was never widely released into the civilian market. This was partly because it did not meet federal highway safety standards for civilian vehicles, and because of a series of rollover accidents. While the high pivot rear [[swing axle]] geometry on the M151A1 was responsible for the rollovers, injuries and fatalities, the industry (Ford and the Army) claimed that they were primarily due to driver errors, with operators unprepared for the increased performance compared to the Jeeps, which it replaced. The swing axle rear suspension design was prone to significant [[Camber angle|camber]] changes when subjected to cornering, resulting in the rear lifting, the outside wheel tucking under which often led to a vehicle rollover.  Steering input as commonly found in a high-speed emergency avoidance maneuvers or hard cornering, was a recipe for disaster. The vehicle's tendency to lose control was reduced when there was weight in the rear, so drivers would often place an ammunition box filled with sand under the rear seat when no other load was being carried. The box could simply be emptied or abandoned when the extra weight was not needed. [[Recoilless rifle]] carrier models were especially prone to rollover accidents due to their stiffer rear springs and were typically subjected to severe speed restrictions any time the gun was not aboard.

Ford Motor Company designed the M151A1 beginning in 1951. By 1965 the world knew of the problems with swing axles (e.g. ''[[Unsafe at Any Speed]]'' by Ralph Nader). Nevertheless, when, in 1969, an automotive engineer at the Human Engineering Lab at Aberdeen Proving Ground wrote a report that included: 1) an analysis that showed the high pivot swing axle in the M151A1 was inherently unstable under cornering, 2) retrofits that had proven to solve the problem on Corvairs, VWs, and Formula Vees and, 3) ways of designing a replacement. The Director of the Human Engineering Lab rejected this report and when the solutions were forwarded to the Ford engineers they rejected them as well.

The handling issues were eventually resolved by a redesign of the rear suspension, introduced in the M151A2 model. However, due to liability concerns, the U.S. Department of Defense deemed all M151 series vehicles "unsafe for public highway use", limiting their public use. Continuing problems with vehicle roll-overs into the 1980s led the US military to retrofit many M151 series vehicles with the "[[Roll over protection structure]]" (ROPS), a roll cage intended to protect both front and rear seat passengers.

== Service ==
[[File:82d Airborne jeep Urgent Fury 1983.JPEG|thumbnail|Soldiers of the 82nd Airborne Division in a heavily loaded M151 during [[Operation Urgent Fury]]]]

First put into service in the [[Vietnam War]], the M151 played an active part in American military operations well into the 1980s, when it was phased out in favor of the [[Humvee|HMMWV]]. Despite its official replacement, the M151 had some distinct advantages over its much larger and heavier successor, like being small enough to fit inside a [[CH-53]] heavy transport helicopter. This flexibility was one of the reasons the U.S. Marine Corps deployed M151 Fast Attack Vehicle (FAV) variants up until 1999, in theatres such as Kosovo. It currently serves in U.S. special forces units as a FAV.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Various models of the M-151 have seen successful military service in 15 different [[NATO]] countries and M151s were sold to many countries, including [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], the [[United Kingdom]] and non-NATO countries like [[Egypt]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Pakistan]]. Currently, the M151 is used by over 100 countries worldwide.

== Post-military use ==

In the late 1980s the M151s began being phased out of service in favour of the HMMWV. A few (perhaps 1,000) were sold via Government Surplus auctions, and those that were not sold via [[Foreign Military Sales]] (FMS) overseas were cut into four pieces and scrapped. However some individuals were able to buy these "quartered" M151s and simply weld the four sections back together, and rebuilt them into drivable condition. Some vehicles sold in the United States were simply cut in half, some of which were simply welded back together and driven. Additionally, beginning in the late 1990s a few companies dealing in Military surplus items bought M151s from some of the foreign governments that received the vehicles via FMS for reconditioning and further sales.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===The Growler===
[[File:GrowlerCombatVehicle.jpg|thumb|right|A Growler Light Strike Vehicle, Prime Mover variant, for the U.S. Marine Corps in December 2005, with a towed mortar.]]
[[Growler Manufacturing and Engineering]] designs and sells the [[Growler (vehicle)|Internally Transportable Light Strike Vehicle]] based on the M151 drivetrain. The Internally Transportable Light Strike Vehicle is intended to replace Fast Attack Vehicle variants of the M151, and is reduced in size to fit into the [[V-22 Osprey]] tiltrotor transport. Although originally intended to utilize the M151 drivetrain, the final result is an all new design and contains no M151 parts or design elements.

* '''M151''' (1960) – Original, standard version of the [[Greenfield project#Other uses|clean-sheet]], Ford designed, all new jeep. Because of its simple [[independent suspension|independent rear suspension]], it had a dangerous tendency to flip over when cornered too aggressively by unaware drivers. The cheap [[swing axle|swing-axle]] rear suspension design (like that of the original [[VW Beetle]] and [[Chevrolet Corvair]]), would result in large rear-wheel [[camber angle]] changes, and could cause drastic [[Understeer and oversteer|oversteer]] and a subsequent roll-over.{{sfnp|Crismon|2001}}{{sfnp|Doyle|2003}}
* '''M151A1''' (1964) – Second version: minor changes in the rear suspension, mostly aimed at allowing the vehicle to carry heavier loads. Addition of turn signals to front fenders. The essentials of the rear suspension remained unchanged and the same applies to the handling problems in corners.{{sfnp|Crismon|2001}}{{sfnp|Doyle|2003}}{{sfnp|TM 9-2320-218-10|1968}}{{sfnp|TM 9-2320-218-20|1971|p=194}}
** '''M151A1C''' – The M151A1C equipped with a 106&amp;nbsp;mm recoilless rifle on a pedestal-mount. Capable of carrying six rounds of ammunition and weapon tools. Including the driver, it provides space for two men and has a cruising range of 442&amp;nbsp;km or 275 miles.{{sfnp|TM 9-2320-218-10|1968}}
** '''M151A1D''' – Tactical nuclear variant. This was an M151A1C modified to mount the [[Davy Crockett (nuclear device)|Davy Crockett Atomic Warhead Launcher]] (in parallel development with a similarly equipped M38A1 and other tactical vehicles).
** '''M718''' – Front-line ambulance variant with an extended rear body to enable the transport of wounded patients on litters.{{sfnp|TM 9-2320-218-10|1968}} Crewed by two — a driver and a medic, it could carry three litters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.military-today.com/trucks/m151.htm M151 MUTT Light Utility Vehicle – Military-Today]&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, although the M718 is larger than an M151 in all three dimensions – its greater length, width and height resulted from only minimal changes to the standard M151 design — retaining both the same [[wheelbase]] and [[axle track|track width]] unchanged. The spare wheel was moved from the rear to the side, to allow the rear body extensions, but also resulting in the increase in width. The ambulance "body" of the M718 consisted mostly just of taller bows, and a longer, taller, canvas top. The changes to the body and chassis, compared to the base M151 were remarkably minimal, considering its predecessor, the M170 jeep ambulance, had received a full {{convert|20|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase stretch from the base [[Willys M38A1|M38A1]] jeep.
* '''M151A2''' (1968) – The A2 fielded a significantly revised rear suspension that greatly improved safety in fast cornering. The M151 now had [[Semi-trailing arm suspension]]. Many smaller upgrades including improved turn signals. The A2 can be identified by the large combination turn signal/blackout lights on the front fenders, which also had been modified to mount the larger lights, as opposed to earlier A1's that had flat front fenders.{{sfnp|Crismon|2001}}{{sfnp|Doyle|2003}}{{sfnp|TM 9-2320-218-20|1971|p=194}}
** '''M151A2 TOW''' – tube-launched, optically-tracked, wire-guided (TOW) anti-tank missile variant.{{sfnp|TM 9-2320-218-10|1983|p=1-4}}
** '''M718A1''' – Front-line ambulance variant that featured an extended rear body to allow the transport of litters.{{sfnp|TM 9-2320-218-10|1983|p=1-4}}
** '''M825''' – Variant with M40 106&amp;nbsp;mm recoilless rifle mounted on rear. It had racks in the cargo bed to carry 4 shells.{{sfnp|TM 9-2320-218-10|1983|p=1-4}}
** '''M1051''' – Firefighting variant which saw exclusive use by the Marine Corps.
** '''MRC108''' – Forward Air Control variant, with multi-band communications equipment.
* '''Fast Attack Vehicles
** '''M151A2 FAV''' – Fast Assault Vehicle variant designed to be carried inside a [[Sikorsky CH-53E Super Stallion|CH-53 helicopter]]. Modification mainly involves adding a combination radiator grille armor plate and spare tire carrier, a field radio bracket between the front seats, roll bars or roll-cage, and high-beam lights. It has a heavy weapons pedestal mount post mounted on the rear deck (capable of carrying a [[M2 Browning|Browning M2HB]], [[Mk 19 grenade launcher|Mark 19 Automatic Grenade Launcher]] or [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW II Missile]]). The rear bustles had brackets to mount large storage baskets and the front bustles had brackets to mount small storage baskets for fuel jerry cans or single ammo boxes.
** '''Marine FAV Mk I "Super Jeep"''': Fast Attack Vehicle. Models originally had a flat black paint job and a velcro-fastened cloth "blackout panel" that covered the dashboard gauges. The front-mounted roll bar, which replaced the front folding windshield, was made from threaded heavy-gauge pipe.
** '''Marine FAV Mk II''': Fast Attack Vehicle. Models originally had an ERDL "woodland" camouflage paint job and a welded roll-bar that was reinforced with two angled support braces of heavy-gauge welded pipe between the front seats. Had two high-beam lights mounted under the top of the rollbar. Highly customized by the units converting it, leading to numerous unique modifications.
** '''[[82nd Airborne Division|Airborne]] FAV (AKA Ranger FAV)''': Fast Attack Vehicle. Has a forward-facing [[M60 machine gun|M60 GPMG]] or [[M240 machine gun|M240 MAG GPMG]] in a M32 45° weapons mount welded to the dashboard on the front passenger side, a horizontal storage box containing an [[AT4|AT-4 Anti-Tank Rocket]], and a vertical storage rack behind the front seats that holds 8 to 10 [[M72 LAW]] Rockets. The rear bustles can mount locker baskets that can each contain 4 × M2/M2A1 ammo boxes for the main gun and the front bustles can contain single ammo boxes for the M60.
** '''Air Force FAV''': Has a roll cage and a 360° ring mount over the rear seat. This model was designed by Marine Sgt. David Ferry&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/m151.htm "M151A2 FAV"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306152347/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/m151.htm |date=2007-03-06 }}, GlobalSecurity&lt;/ref&gt; and saw service with the [[Marine expeditionary unit|MEUs]] and other Special Operations units. &lt;br /&gt;It got the nickname of "Air Force FAV" from a famous picture of U.S. Air Force Maj. Gen. [[William S. Hinton Jr.]], commander of [[Operation Shining Hope|Joint Task Force Shining Hope]], getting out of one.

The '''fourth generation Ford Ranger of the Americas''' is a midsize pickup truck. It was introduced by Ford at the 2018 [[North American International Auto Show|Detroit Auto Show]] after a seven-year hiatus.&lt;ref name="2019 Ranger"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/ranger/2019/2019-ford-ranger-first-look-review/|title=2019 Ford Ranger First Look: Welcome Home|date=January 14, 2018|work=Motor Trend|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:NAIAS 2019 Ford Ranger right rear.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view]]
In January 2018, one year after announcing the return of the Ranger to the United States and Canada, Ford introduced the 2019 Ranger at the 2018 North American International Auto Show, marking the first Ford entry into the mid-size pickup truck segment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/ranger/2019/2019-ford-ranger-first-look-review/|title=2019 Ford Ranger First Look: Welcome Home|date=January 14, 2018|work=Motor Trend|access-date=January 20, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The American Ranger is derived from the Ford T6 global midsize truck architecture designed by [[Ford Australia|Ford of Australia]]. While already designed to accommodate [[Left hand drive|left-hand drive]] use, the T6 chassis underwent further modifications for use in North America. To better accommodate American crash standards and increase its payload, the frame was revised to include fully boxed frame rails.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  All versions of the Ranger sold in the United States and Canada have a 127-inch wheelbase, regardless of cab or drivetrain configuration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Body==
[[File:2019 Ford Ranger XLT Super Cab FX4 front 6.1.19.jpg|thumb|2019 Ford Ranger XLT SuperCab FX4]]
The Ranger is sold in four-door SuperCab and four-door SuperCrew configurations (Ford has no current plans to market a two-door Ranger in North America).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/auto/2019-ford-ranger/preview/|title=Ford's new 2019 Ranger to take on Toyota Tacoma, Chevy Colorado|work=Roadshow|access-date=January 20, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While externally similar to its global counterpart, the Ranger features a number of exterior design changes. Most visibly, the front fascia was redesigned with a frame-mounted steel bumper. At the minor expense of frontal aerodynamics, the sturdier front bumper was designed to better comply with American crash standards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

To better market the vehicle towards private buyers in North America, the Ranger was given a distinct hood design and grilles related to trim level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Additional trim included color-contrasting fender molding and fender grilles (in line with the F-Series trucks).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The "RANGER"-embossed tailgate was modified; in the interest of aerodynamics, a spoiler was added (sharing the locking tailgate handle from the F-150).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As the global Ranger was designed before the current [[Ford F-Series (thirteenth generation)|F-Series]], usage of aluminum in the body is minor, with only an aluminum hood and tailgate.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Powertrain==
For North American production, the Ranger is produced with a single powertrain: a [[Ford EcoBoost engine#2.3 L|2.3L EcoBoost]] inline-4 paired with [[Ford-GM 10-speed automatic transmission|10-speed 10R80]] automatic transmission.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.automobilemag.com/news/seven-things-to-love-about-the-2019-ford-ranger/|title=Seven Things to Love About the 2019 Ford Ranger {{!}} Automobile Magazine|date=January 17, 2018|work=Automobile Magazine|access-date=January 20, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/news/2018/10/09/a-few-looks-at-the-new-ford-ranger-photos.html|title=2019 Ford Ranger specs released - Orlando Business Journal|website=www.bizjournals.com|access-date=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For increased fuel economy, the engine includes direct fuel injection, four valves per cylinder, and a twin-scroll turbocharger.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;[https://autofile.ca/en-ca/car-reviews/first-look-ford-resurrects-the-ranger "FIRST LOOK: Ford resurrects the Ranger"] from AutoFile.ca (January 13, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

While offered in both rear-wheel drive and part-time four-wheel drive, all Rangers in North America are produced using the "HiRider" chassis of the Ranger T6 4x4. For 2019 production, Ford has not announced sales plans for the Ranger Raptor nor the Ranger Wildtrak for the United States or Canada.

==Trim levels==
The fourth-generation Ranger shares the traditional trim levels used by Ford light trucks in North America, with base-trim '''XL''', mid-level '''XLT''', and top-trim '''Lariat.'''  To supplement each trim level, Chrome, Sport, and FX option packages are offered for all three trim levels'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/01/14/an-american-favorite-reinvented--new-ford-ranger-brings-built-fo.html|title=An American Favorite Reinvented: New Ford Ranger Brings Built Ford Tough Innovation to U.S. Midsize Truck Segment &amp;#124; Ford Media Center|website=media.ford.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

The base XL trim includes features such as sixteen-inch (16") silver-painted steel wheels, a four-speaker audio system with an AM/FM radio, auxiliary audio input, and USB port, along with cloth seating surfaces, power windows, and door locks. Options include aluminum-alloy wheels, a six-speaker audio system, and carpeted flooring with floor mats.

The mid-level XLT trim adds more convenience features to the base XL trim, such as an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD/MP3 player, auxiliary audio input and USB port, a FordPass [[4G]] [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] internet connection, seventeen-inch (17") aluminum-alloy wheels, keyless entry, carpeted flooring with floor mats, [[Ford SYNC]] with [[Bluetooth]] hands-free phone and wireless audio streaming capabilities, and a six-speaker audio system. Options include a SYNC 3 infotainment system with [[Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]] capabilities and GPS navigation, [[SiriusXM]] [[Satellite Radio]] and Travel Link, remote start and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.

The range-topping Lariat trim adds luxury features to the mid-level XLT trim, such as the SYNC 3 infotainment system with GPS navigation, [[SiriusXM]] [[Satellite Radio]] and Travel Link, and [[Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]] capabilities, polished aluminum-alloy wheels, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, additional chrome exterior accents, keyless access with push-button ignition, luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces, and [[LED]] front headlamps. Options include remote start, a [[Bang &amp; Olufsen]] B&amp;O Play premium amplified audio system, and rain-sensing windshield wipers.

There are several different appearance packages available for each trim level. The base XL trim offers the STX Appearance Package, which adds options such as aluminum-alloy wheels, [[Ford SYNC]], and a six-speaker audio system. Mid-level XLT and range-topping Lariat trims offer two different appearance packages: either the Sport Appearance Package, which adds features such as upgraded aluminum-alloy wheels and darkened exterior accents, and the Chrome Appearance Package, which adds features such as polished aluminum-alloy wheels, and additional chrome exterior accents. An FX-4 Off-Road Package is available on all 4X4-equipped models, adding features such as side pickup box FX-4 Off-Road decals, an off-road suspension package, and on/off-road tires.

==Interior==
To comply with American safety mandates, a rearview safety camera is standard.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Several sizes of interior touchscreens are offered, depending on trim packages ordered.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  To increase interior storage, waterproof storage compartments were added under the rear seats.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Ford Versailles''' name has been used for two different automobiles: between 1954–1957 in France and between 1992–1996 in Brazil

==France==
[[File:1957 Ford Vedette Versailles.jpg|thumb|1957 Ford Vedette Versailles]]
The former [[Ford SAF]] plant in [[Poissy]], acquired by [[Simca]] in 1954, manufactured a large car called the [[Simca Vedette]]. This was a descendant of the late 1940s/early 1950s [[Ford Vedette]], and was also marketed as Ford Vedette in the Netherlands, Germany and Sweden until 1957. It was available in four versions, each of which was also marketed with a separate model name - ''Trianon'', ''Versailles'', ''Régence'' and ''Marly'' - hence the "Ford Versailles" appearing in some markets.

==Brazil==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ford Sierra]] --&gt;
[[File:Ford_Versailles.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Autolatina]]-built Ford Versailles/Galaxy]]
In [[Brazil]], the Ford Versailles was a version of the [[Volkswagen Santana]] sold in the 1990s when Ford and [[Volkswagen]] shared models in [[South America]] in a joint venture known as [[Autolatina]]. It replaced the [[Ford Del Rey]] in 1991, and was available as a sedan (with two or four doors) and as a station wagon called the [[Ford Royale]], initially only as a three-door, even though the [[Volkswagen Quantum]] on which it was based was available with five doors. (It was alleged that Volkswagen did not want the Royale to be available as a five-door model, as this would have posed a competitive threat to the popular Quantum.). In 1995 and 1996, Ford also sold a five-door version of the Royale. It was also sold as the Ford Galaxy in [[Argentina]] (not to be confused with the [[Ford Galaxy|European MPV of the same name]]), where it replaced the [[Ford Sierra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ioe1AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22ford+galaxy%22+autolatina+volkswagen&amp;dq=%22ford+galaxy%22+autolatina+volkswagen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwig8trblpHLAhWBYg8KHY4BC6YQ6AEINTAA | title = The motor industries of South America and Mexico: poised for growth | first = Marco | last = Piquini | publisher = Economist Intelligence Unit | date = 1995 | page = 185 | isbn = 9780850588156 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Versailles and the Galaxy were eventually replaced by the [[Ford Mondeo]].

==Overview==
The Mach-E name is inspired by the [[Ford Mustang Mach 1|Mach 1]] variant of the [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|first-generation Mustang]].

Conventional door handles are absent on the Mustang Mach-E, and the vehicle instead features buttons that pop open the doors and a small door handle protruding from the front doors. Owners can use their smartphones as a key as well as a keypad built into the B-pillar.

The interior has a wide dashboard and built-in soundbar; the dash is equipped with a vertically mounted {{convert|15.5|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} touchscreen infotainment system with a rotary dial fixed onto it. The majority of the car’s systems are controlled through the screen, which uses Ford's recent SYNC 4 operating system that can accept wireless updates. A {{convert|10.2|in|cm|abbr=on}} digital cluster for the driver is also featured, while the steering wheel retains a number of physical buttons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/11/17/20967565/ford-mustang-mach-e-electric-suv-specs-price-la-auto-show-2019 |title=Ford's Mustang Mach-E is an electric SUV with up to 300 miles of range |website=[[The Verge]] |last=O'Kane |first=Sean |date=November 17, 2019 |accessdate=November 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mustang Mach-E is built on the Global Electrified 1 (GE1) platform which is a heavily reworked version of the C2 platform that is used on the [[Ford Focus#Fourth generation (2018–present)|fourth generation Focus]] and [[Ford Kuga#Third_generation (2019–present)|third generation Kuga]]/[[Ford Escape#Fourth generation (2020–present)|fourth generation Escape]].

The model will be launched with two battery pack sizes and three power outputs. The entry-level rear-wheel drive version is offered with either a 75.7 kWh battery producing 255 hp or a 98.8 kWh extended battery producing 282 hp. Both battery packs have a claimed 0-60 mph time of under seven seconds and an EPA range of around 230 and 300 miles respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://jalopnik.com/a-look-at-the-engineering-behind-the-2021-ford-mustang-1839911078 |title=A Look At The Engineering Behind The 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E |website=[[Jalopnik]] |last=Tracy |first=David |date=November 22, 2019|accessdate=November 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A dual-motor all-wheel-drive version is also offered with either the same 75.7 kWh battery producing 255 hp, or the 98.8 kWh extended battery producing 332 hp. Both versions have a claimed 0-60 mph time of under six seconds, with estimated EPA ranges of 210 and 270 miles. Charging is available via an AC home charger or DC fast chargers at up to 150 kW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/mustang-mach-e-reveal/|title=Ford Unveils All-Electric Mustang Mach-E|work=[[Digital Trends]]|last=Zurschmeide|first=Jeff|date=November 17, 2019|accessdate=November 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
Ford hired British actor [[Idris Elba]] (who once worked for [[Ford of Britain]] along with his father) to star in several teaser commercials for the car and host the Mustang Mach-E's official debut on November 17, 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.motor1.com/news/380346/ford-idris-elba-mustang-ev/ |title=Ford Hires Idris Elba To Help Launch Mustang-Inspired EV Crossover |first=Christopher |last=Smith |website=[[Motorsport Network]] |date=November 4, 2019 |accessdate=November 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a29685118/ford-idris-elba-electric-crossover/ |title=Ford and Idris Elba Partnering to Promote New Mustang-Inspired Electric Crossover |first=Connor |last=Hoffman |magazine=[[Car and Driver]] |date=November 4, 2019 |accessdate=November 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Unlike the [[Internal combustion engine|ICE]] Mustang models, the Mach E will not be assembled in the United States. Rather, it will be produced in [[Cuautitlán Assembly|Cuautitlán Izcalli, Mexico]].&lt;ref name="forbes1"/&gt; According to Ford CEO Jim Hackett, assembling the vehicle in Mexico will allow Ford to make a profit from the first vehicle, unlike other electric vehicles. He also stated that as Ford develops factory capacity for electric vehicle production in the United States, production could be moved there. The company is also considering production in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://business.financialpost.com/transportation/autos/ford-unveils-electric-mustang-suv-to-challenge-tesla-dominance |title=Ford bets Mustang Mach-E will be the electric that actually makes a profit |publisher=Postmedia |website=financialpost.com |date=November 18, 2019 |first=Keith |last=Naughton |agency=Bloomberg News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USS ''Eagle 56'' (PE-56)''' was a [[United States Navy]] [[World War I]]–era [[patrol boat]] that remained in service through [[World War II]]. On 23 April 1945, while towing targets for U.S. Navy bomber exercises off the coast of [[Maine]], ''Eagle 56'' was sunk by the {{GS|U-853}}. Only 13 of the 62 crew survived. The loss was classified as a [[boiler]] explosion until 2001, when historical evidence convinced the US Navy to reclassify the sinking as a combat loss due to enemy action.

==Service history==
''Eagle 56'' was one of 60 {{sclass2-|Eagle|patrol craft}} built by [[Henry Ford]] late in World War I as [[submarine chaser]]s, none of which saw action. Unpopular due to their poor sea handling, only eight remained in service at the time of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=6892|title= Navy Senior Archivist Helps Solve 57 Year Old USS Eagle 56 Mystery|author=Jack A.

When her [[depth charge]]s were expended, a small ship from [[Cape May, New Jersey]], would bring out a new supply.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt; ''Eagle 56'' rescued survivors of {{USS|Jacob Jones|DD-130|2}} off Cape May in February 1942.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt; It was damaged by collision with the submerged wreck of ''Gypsum Prince'' while rescuing survivors from the British freighter that had collided with the British tanker ''Voco'' on 4 March at the entrance to Delaware Bay,&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt; and was repaired using parts from another ''Eagle'' boat, and then assigned to the [[Key West]] [[sonar]] school in May 1942.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;

===Sinking and investigation===
''Eagle 56'' was assigned to [[Naval Air Station Brunswick]] from 28 June 1944.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt; At noon on 23 April 1945, ''Eagle 56'' exploded amidships, and broke into two pieces&lt;ref name="green"/&gt; {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} off [[Cape Elizabeth, Maine]].&lt;ref name="elizabeth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capeelizabeth.com/news/eaglememorial.html |title=Dedication of Navy warship marker set for Saturday at Portland Head Light |date=22 April 2005 |accessdate=2007-10-07 |publisher=capeelizabeth.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019105221/http://www.capeelizabeth.com/news/eaglememorial.html |archivedate=19 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[destroyer]] {{USS|Selfridge|DD-357|2}} was operating near ''Eagle 56'' and arrived 30 minutes after the explosion to rescue 13 survivors from the crew of 62.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt; ''Selfridge'' obtained a sharp, well-defined sonar contact during the rescue and dropped nine Mark IX Mod 2 [[depth charge]]s without obvious result.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt; According to a classified Navy report, {{GS|U-853||2}} had been operating in the waters off Maine.&lt;ref name="green"/&gt; At a [[Naval Board of Inquiry]] in [[Portland, Maine|Portland]] the following week, five of the 13 survivors claimed to have seen a submarine.

==Later events==
On 5 May 1945, ''U-853'' sank the [[Collier (ship type)|collier]] ''Black Point'' off the coast of [[Point Judith, Rhode Island]], causing the loss of 12 lives. During the ensuing [[German submarine U-853#Battle of Point Judith|Battle of Point Judith]], ''U-853'' was chased and sunk by Navy and [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] ships on 6 May.

Gygax]] wrote, "at least equal evidence to support the conclusion that the explosion was that of a device outside the ship, the exact nature of which is undetermined. It might have been an enemy [[naval mine|mine]] or an enemy [[torpedo]]." Ultimately, though, he endorsed the court's findings.&lt;ref name="holland"/&gt;

Because the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] had [[Ultra|cracked Germany's codes]], United States intelligence knew in 1945 that U-boats had been sent across the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] to disrupt shipping in hopes of obtaining better surrender terms. However, only general warnings rather than specific information about this plan were passed to commanders.&lt;ref name="boston"/&gt;

===Reclassification===

In 2001, the [[Naval Historical Center]] reviewed the case and reclassified the sinking as a combat loss. In June 2001, [[Purple Heart]] medals were awarded to three survivors and the next of kin of those killed.&lt;ref name="green"/&gt; As of 2007, this is the only time that the US Navy has overruled its own Court of Inquiry.&lt;ref name="boston"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/04/06/the_truth_about_the_uss_eagle_56/|title=The truth about the USS Eagle 56|author=Robert Knox|date=6 April 2006|publisher=boston.com|accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A commemorative plaque was erected on the grounds of [[Fort Williams Park]] near [[Portland Head Light]].

===Wreck discovery===
The ship's wreckage was located in June 2018, and visited by a civilian dive team later the same month.

'''''The Stallion'''''  is a [[Custom car|custom]]ized [[1932 Ford|1934 Ford]] [[Coupé#Three window coupe|3-window]] built by [[Chip Foose]] for Ron Whiteside. It won the Ridler Award at the 2003 [[Detroit Autorama]].

== Construction details ==
The chassis is custom-made by [[Larry Sergeff]], with a {{convert|114|in|mm|abbr=on}} [[wheelbase]], {{convert|2|in|mm|abbr=on}} more than stock.{{sfn|Geisert}}

Andy Wallin built the engine, starting with a 1996 {{convert|350|cid|cc|abbr=on}} [[Chevrolet Corvette (C4)|Corvette]] [[Chevrolet small-block engine#LT4|LT4]] [[crate engine]], with stainless steel [[Exhaust manifold|headers]], built by [[Steve Greninger]], and mufflers from Stainless Steel Specialties.{{sfn|Geisert}} Greninger custom-built a cover for the [[fuel injection]], and Karl Jonasson machined custom [[valve cover]]s.{{sfn|Geisert}} It is mated to a [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM700R4 / 4L60 / 4L60E / 4L65E / 4L70E|TH700-R4]] [[automatic transmission]], controlled by a 1998 Camaro shifter,{{sfn|Geisert}} connected to rear axle (ratio 3.55:1) by an aluminum driveshaft provided by Empire Driveline.{{sfn|Geisert}} The Jack Mattson radiator uses a [[Vintage Air]] fan.{{sfn|Geisert}} The [[alternator (automotive)|alternator]] is a 100 [[Ampere|amp]] Powermaster.{{sfn|Geisert}}

The [[Independent suspension#$RS|IRS]], based on a late-model Corvette, was carved from [[billet (semi-finished product)|billet]] aluminum by Larry Sergeff, who also did the IFS.{{sfn|Geisert}} The [[shock absorber]]s are [[Carrera (company)|Carrera]] coilovers, the brakes in [[Wilwood]] [[disc brake|disc]]s, mated to a [[master cylinder]] from a 1994 Corvette.{{sfn|Geisert}} The [[steering box]] is from a [[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]].{{sfn|Geisert}} The car rides on a set of Foose's custom-designed polished five-spoke Nitrous Thrust knockoff wheels, one of only two sets to exist (the other used on his [[America's Most Beautiful Roadster|AMBR]]-winner, [[0032 (custom car)|''0032'']]), as [[Hot rod#Language|"big'n'little"]]s:  {{convert|7|x|16|in|cm|abbr=on}} in front, {{convert|8|x|17|in|cm|abbr=on}} in back, with Nitto tires (195/50 front, 255/50 rear0).{{sfn|Geisert}}

The coupé's body is all steel (the hood sides aluminum).{{sfn|Geisert}} It has been slant-[[Chopping and channeling#Chopping|chopped]] {{convert|3|in|cm|abbr=on}} (measured at the windshield posts) and pie-[[Sectioning (automobile)|sectioned]] {{convert|4|in|cm|abbr=on}} (measured at the front fenders), then fitting hidden hinges on the doors, which were lengthened {{convert|2|in|cm|abbr=on}}{{sfn|Geisert}}
The door mirrors and door handles were shaved, as were all the badges.{{sfn|Geisert}} The stainless steel grille, designed by Foose, was fabricated by Don Fink Metalworks.{{sfn|Geisert}}

[[Jim Griffin (customizer)|Jim Griffin]], who also did [[Grand Master (custom car)|''Grand Master'']], [[Snyper (custom car)|''Snyper'']], and the [[Smoothster (custom car)|''Smoothster'']], built and upholstered ''The Stallion''; assisted by his son, James,{{sfn|Geisert}} he fabricated seats and covered them in two shades of tan leather, while the [[Headliner (material)|headliner]] is [[suede]].{{sfn|Geisert}} The steering wheel is an{{convert|18|in|cm|abbr=on}} piece from a 1950 [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]], resized to {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Geisert}} The [[Panasonic]] [[DVD player]] hides behind a Red Mountain Audio head unit.{{sfn|Geisert}} The dash had an aluminum insert, containing [[Classic Instruments]] gauges, while the interior rear view mirror came from [[Billet Specialties]].{{sfn|Geisert}} The [[air conditioning]] system was supplied by Vintage Air.{{sfn|Geisert}}

The exterior was painted in [[Glasurit]]'s Sedona Fire paint by [[Chris Guinn]], with final [[pin striping|striping]] by [[Dennis Ricklefs]].{{sfn|Geisert}}

Foose used Mercury badging throughout, saying the coupé was the kind of car Mercury would have built, had the [[marque]] existed at the time.{{sfn|Geisert}}

== History ==
Whiteside purchased the car in 1965 for US$150.{{sfn|Geisert}} It took the better part of two years for Whiteside to get the car road-worthy, before being forced to leave it the hands of his younger brothers, Randy and Steve, when he was [[Conscription in the United States|drafted]].{{sfn|Geisert}} The brothers [[Drag racing|drag raced]] the car; when Whiteside returned, he joined them, and the car was raced during 1972-75.{{sfn|Geisert}}

After that, Whiteside parked the car until 1986, when he began rebuilding it, with the aid of Ken Garman and Don Maki (who later went to work with Foose).{{sfn|Geisert}} Over the course of two years, the car was rebuilt.

During this process, Whiteside showed photographs of the project to [[Boyd Coddington]], hoping his shop (Hot Rods by Boyd) could build a [[Detroit Autorama#Past winners|Ridler Award]] winner.{{sfn|Geisert}} It was through Coddington's shop Foose conceived a sister car, a [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]], which ultimately became [[Impact (custom car)|''Impact'']], after the [[bankruptcy]] of Coddington's [[Boyds Wheels]], and the consequent failure of his rod shop.{{sfn|Geisert}}

Foose took over the project, working out of his [[Orange, California|Orange]] and later [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]] premises, aided by [[Roy Schmidt (customizer)|Roy Schmidt]], Brian Fuller, [[Marcel DeLay]] (and his sons, Marc and Luc), Dennis Graff, Chris Guinn, Don Maki, Paco Castell, Chris Eddie, Tom Marcotte, Lance Nabors, Larry Sergeff, and Steve Greninger (many of them former Coddington employees).{{sfn|Geisert}}

The car was completed in 2003, in time for the Autorama; Whiteside won the Ridler.{{sfn|Geisert}}

Unlike many show-quality customs, this car is actually driven.{{sfn|Geisert}}
