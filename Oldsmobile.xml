Naming standards were in flux at [[Oldsmobile]] during the late 1930s and 1940s. From 1932 through 1938 Oldsmobile had two series: "F" and "L" including the [http://www.tradeclassiccar.com/for-sale-online/7-2/54/1937-1938-oldsmobile-engine-motor-transmission/ 1937-1938 Oldsmobile] six-cylinder engine. The Series F came with a [[straight-six]] engine and the Series L came with a larger body and a [[straight-eight]] engine. The Series F was renamed Series 60 in 1939 and the Series L was replaced with the [[Oldsmobile Series 70|Series 70]] and 80, with the Series 70 and 80 being powered by the straight-six and the straight-eight respectively. The Series 60 used the [[GM A platform (RWD)|GM A-body]] and the Series 70 and 80 used the [[GM B platform|B-body]].

[[File:1939 Oldsmobile Series 60 Business Coupe in black, front left (Hershey 2019).jpg|thumb|left|1939 Oldsmobile Series 60 Business Coupe]]
The Series 60 occupied the entry-level position for Oldsmobiles sold in the United States from 1939 through the 1948 model years.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kimes|first=Beverly|title=standard catalog of American Cars 1805–1942|year=1996|publisher=Krause publications|isbn=0-87341-428-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were trimmed in an entry level fashion and, in parts and components, the Series 60 models were closely related to [[Chevrolet]]s and [[Pontiac]]s.

The 1939 Oldsmobiles were available with the "safety automatic transmission". The safety [[automatic transmission]] was [[Semi-automatic transmission|semi-automatic]], in that it still used a clutch to get the car going and then shifted automatically. The [[Hydramatic|Hydramatic transmission]], a fully clutchless automatic, debuted in the 1940 model year.

In 1939 four body styles were available: a business coupe with no rear seat, a club coupe with two rear fold-away jump seats, a two-door sedan with a full rear seat and a four-door sedan which shared its roofline with the two-door sedan. The wheelbase was 115&amp;nbsp;inches.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; The backs of the front seats were rounded and padded for protection of the rear seat occupants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1939_Oldsmobile/1939_Oldsmobile_Brochure/1939%20Oldsmobile-30-31.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1939_Oldsmobile/1939_Oldsmobile_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 216CID {{Convert|90|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Straight-six engine|I6]] was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1939_Oldsmobile/1939_Oldsmobile_Brochure/1939%20Oldsmobile-32-33.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1939_Oldsmobile/1939_Oldsmobile_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, the even larger [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] was introduced to Oldsmobile and it alone was powered by the straight-eight. In order to differentiate it from the previous year's Series 80 it was named the [[Oldsmobile 98|Series 90]] (there was no Series 80 that year). The series were also given names for the first time that year with the Series 60, 70, and 90 being called the Special, Dynamic, and Custom Cruiser respectively.

Two body styles were added to the model line up in 1940: a two-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]] and a four-door [[station wagon]]. In addition, a full rear seat was added to the club coupe, although it still did not share the roofline of the somewhat roomier two-door sedan. A deluxe equipment package was also new that year.

In 1941 both engines were offered on each Oldsmobile series so to differentiate between the two the second digit was used to denote the number of cylinders, so the Special 60 was replaced with the Special 66 and 68'. The only way to get an eight-cylinder engine on the [[GM A platform (RWD)|GM A body]] from 1941 to 1948 was to buy an Oldsmobile Special 68 or a [[Pontiac Torpedo|Pontiac Deluxe Torpedo Eight]].  

In 1941, the Series 60 wheelbase was increased to 119&amp;nbsp;in. Two models were produced, the 66 which used a 238&amp;nbsp;in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (3.9 L) straight-six engine and the 68 which used a new 257CID {{Convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} straight-eight.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; All Series 60s came with a three-speed column shift [[Manual transmission|manual]], or the optional four-speed [[Hydramatic]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]. Both options could be paired with either engine choice. Because of the column shift and new wider runningboard-less "torpedo" styling three passengers could now be accommodated comfortably in front. It used full instrumentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1940%20Oldsmobile/1940_Oldsmobile_Operating_Guide/1940%20Oldsmobile%20Operating%20Guide-10.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1940 Oldsmobile/1940_Oldsmobile_Operating_Guide |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941 the lineup consisted of a three-passenger two-door business coupe without a rear seat, a six-passenger two-door club coupe with a rear seat, a two-door sedan, a four-door "bustle back" sedan which shared its roof line with the two-door sedan, a four-door eight-passenger [[Woodie (car body style)|wood-bodied]] [[station wagon]] and a three-passenger two-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]. Except for the convertible and station wagon, all were available in either standard or deluxe trim.

In 1942 Oldsmobile stayed with its Special 60 series on the bottom of a three series format. As with all automakers production was halted early in the year due to the war, both a six- or eight-cylinder motor could be ordered. Now extremely rare, both a convertible and a station wagon were available. A new body style was a six-passenger two-door club sedan [[fastback]].

In 1946 the Special 60 series was again Oldsmobile's lowest priced group of cars. Special 60s had only six-cylinder power, although the eight-cylinder was offered in other years. The business coupe and the two-door sedan were discontinued. Interiors were a tan mixture pattern cloth. Standard tire size was 6.00 x 16&amp;nbsp;inches. Leather interiors were offered on convertibles. Technical features included electro-hardened aluminum pistons, full-pressure lubrication and automatic choke with fast idle mode. In 1946, dual windshield wipers were standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975|publisher=krause publications|isbn=0-87341-027-0|editor=Gunnell,John A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1947 more models were offered on the low-priced Special 60 series than the other two Oldsmobile series. The eight-cylinder engine returned to the Special 60 series and there were again 66 and 68 versions of each body style offered. Standard equipment included: safety glass, spare wheel and tire, dual horns, vacuum booster pump and cigarette lighter. The standard interior fabric was tan mixture cloth. Standard tire size was 6.00 x 16&amp;nbsp;inches. Horsepower grew to 100 for the six and 110 for the eight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flory, Jr.|first=J.

The 66 and 68 were renamed the Dynamic 66 and 68 in 1948. The Dynamic 60 series were the smallest Oldsmobiles available and offered the greatest variety or body styles. Both six-cylinder and eight-cylinder engines were available and were designated 66 and 68. Standard 60 Series equipment included: dual horns, dual sun visors and a cigarette lighter. The deluxe equipment package added foam rubber seat cushions, deluxe steering wheel, deluxe instrument cluster, clock and chrome wheel trim rings. Standard tires were 6.00 x 16&amp;nbsp;inches.Upholstery was Bedford cord or broadcloth.

The Series 60 model designation was retired after 1948, the L-head six-cylinder was then increased in displacement to {{convert|257|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} and was used only in the [[Oldsmobile Series 70|Oldsmobile 76]] which was discontinued in 1950. A limited amount were put through production in 1950, but only five exist today.

==Australian production==
The Series 60 was also produced from 1946 to 1948 by [[Holden|General Motors-Holden's]] in Australia, where it was marketed as the Oldsmobile Ace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldsmobileclub.org.au/acehist.html ''The Oldsmobile "ACE" - 1946 to 1948'', www.oldsmobileclub.org.au] Retrieved 29 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Local bodies were fitted and these cars are completely different from the scuttle back and were the last GM cars to feature "suicide doors" (hinged at the back).

==South African production==
Cars were exported to South Africa in [[complete knock down]] (CKD) form for local assembly.

The '''Oldsmobile Omega''' is a [[compact car]] that was manufactured and sold from 1973 through 1984 by [[Oldsmobile]]. The name ''[[omega]]'' was used to imply the last, the end, or the ultimate limit of a set, in contrast to ''[[alpha]]'', the first letter of the Greek alphabet. There were three generations of Omegas, all being [[Badge engineering|badge-engineered]] [[Chevrolet]] models, and each of the three using one of two [[GM X platform]] architectures:

The Omega was one of 3 X-body Chevrolet Nova clones introduced in 1973 (the Buick Apollo being the other one; the Pontiac Ventura was introduced in 1971). Naturally it shared the Nova's body and many of its mechanicals, but it had its own unique nose and tail, and, being an Oldsmobile, it had a little fancier trim than the Nova. It even borrowed the Nova's dashboard, but Olds added woodgrain trim to it for a more upscale look.

The front grille sported Oldsmobile's trademark split "waterfall" grille design, round headlights set into square recesses, and parking lights directly below in the bumper.  Body styles mirrored that of the Nova, starting with a 2-door coupe, 3-door hatchback or a 4-door sedan.

Engine choices were the standard Chevy-built 4.1L (250 cid) I6 with a 3-speed manual transmission standard, with a 4-speed manual or a 2- or 3-speed automatic optional. The lone V8 was Oldsmobile's 5.7L (350 cid) "Rocket" V8, which had a 4-speed manual as standard with the 3-speed automatic optional. V8 models with the fifth VIN digit being the letter "K" received a 4-barrel Rochester carburetor. All other V8 engines received the standard 2-barrel version. There were also 53 Doctor Oldsmobile Omega's built in 73. All were V8's built in Van Nuys, California and were sold at Century Oldsmobile in Van Nuys, California. This decal option was canceled in 1974.  

There were few changes in 1974. There was a base model and the upper-level Brougham and the S option was added. The parking lights were relocated inboard below the grille instead of the headlights and there was a new rear bumper design which met the federal government's new 5-mph impact standards. The 2-speed Powerglide transmission was dropped.

This car was the top of the X-body line along with Buick's Apollo and Skylark, having more luxury trimming, more noise insulation, rear anti-roll bars, and other features not found on the Chevrolet Nova.
There were four basic Oldsmobile X bodied cars, the F-85 (the base car),  the Omega, Omega SX, and the Omega Brougham. 
During the 1975-76 model years, the top engine choice was a 350 cu. in. (5.7 Liter) [[V8 engine|V8]] from GM's [[Buick]] division. During that time, the base engine was the {{Convert|115|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 250 cu. in. (4.1 Liter) [[inline-6]] from Chevrolet, until 1977 when it was dropped in favor of the lighter {{Convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} Buick 231 [[V6]]. It saw few changes through its life being limited mostly to the front end (3 different grilles) and to the rear lights, changing the number of lenses through the years. The Oldsmobile 260 (4.3-liter) V8  was available as an option from 1975-79.

The X-bodies were all-new front-wheel drive cars for 1980. Engine choices were limited to Pontiac's [[GM Iron Duke engine|Iron Duke]] [[inline-four engine]] and the new corporate 2.8&amp;nbsp;L [[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#LE2|LE2]] [[V6]] designed specifically for this platform. Transmissions were the 4 speed manual or the TH125 3-speed automatic.

Unlike the [[Chevrolet Citation]], which the car was based upon, the Omega range consisted of only a 2-door coupe and 4-door sedan, with upright styling and a distinctive split grille.

Aside from the standard and Brougham models produced in all five years, sportier models were also built.  These included the SX coupe (replaced by the ES in 1982), ES sedan, and pioneering urethane plastic-fendered 1981 SportOmega, which came with wild red-and-orange striping, white-over-gray paint, and a sloping front grille assembly shared with the SX and ES. Notably, the sportier models were available with both the L4 and V6 engines.&lt;ref&gt;1981 and 1983 Sales Brochures&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1982, the Chevrolet high-output (130 horsepower) 2.8L V6 became available on ES models. In 1983, the ES was only available in the sedan body style.

The X-body Omega, like its sister vehicles (the [[Chevrolet Citation]], [[Pontiac Phoenix]] and [[Buick Skylark]]), proved fairly trouble-prone early on, necessitating an astounding number of government-mandated [[Product recall|recall]]s for [[GM X platform (1980)#Mechanical problems|braking problems]], fluid leaks and suspension issues.  While Omega was the only one of the four X-cars to sell better in 1981 than in 1980 (147,918 versus 134,323), starting in 1982, production fell dramatically.  Only 77,469 Omegas were built in '82, with 53,926 in 1983 and 52,986 in swan-song 1984.

For 1985, the Omega was replaced by the [[GM N platform|N-body]] [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais|Calais]].

The '''Oldsmobile Firenza''' was a [[compact car]] which was produced by [[Oldsmobile]] from 1982 to 1988. It was based on the [[front-wheel drive]] [[GM J platform]], which was shared with the [[Buick Skyhawk]], [[Cadillac Cimarron]], [[Chevrolet Cavalier]] and [[Pontiac Sunbird]]. It was not based on the [[Europe]]an market [[Vauxhall Firenza]], but on the same platform as the [[Vauxhall Cavalier]] Mk 2 / [[Opel Ascona]] C.

==Overview==
The all-new Firenza was introduced in March 1982, as a replacement for the departed [[rear-wheel drive]] [[Oldsmobile Starfire|Starfire]]. Initially available as a 2-door [[hatchback]] and 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)#Notchback sedans|sedan]], the lineup was expanded to include a 4-door "Cruiser" wagon in 1983, and a 2-door [[notchback]] [[coupe]] in 1986.&lt;ref name="Consumer Guide 2006. pp 642-43"&gt;Auto Editors of Consumer Guide. 2006. ''Encyclopedia of American Cars'' (pp 642-43) . Lincolnwood, Il: Publications International.&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Cruiser" was applied to all Oldsmobile [[station wagon]]s at the time; this included the [[mid-size car|mid-size]]d [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Cruiser|Cutlass Cruiser]] and [[full-size]] [[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser|Custom Cruiser]]. The Firenza was positioned as Oldsmobile's entry-level compact car, priced below the sightly larger [[Oldsmobile Omega|Omega]] and later [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais|Calais/Cutlass Calais]]. Despite this, the Firenza could be equipped with premium options such as power windows, power locks, and 14-inch alloy wheels.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Oldsmobile Factory Sales Brochure "1988 Oldsmobile Lineup, Vol. II"&lt;/ref&gt; It is named for the Italian translation of the city of [[Florence]]. 
[[File:Oldsmobile Firenza Cruiser Station wagon (4899054495).jpg|thumb|left|Oldsmobile Firenza Cruiser]]
Although closely related to its J-body siblings, the Oldsmobile Firenza was [[badge engineered]] with distinctively Oldsmobile front and rear end styling found on larger Oldsmobiles of the time. The upper portion of the Firenza front end featured quad rectangular [[headlight]]s separated by signal lights in recessed housings, with a sloped body-color panel between the recesses. A [[Grille (car)|horizontal-barred grille]] was mounted in the lower portion of the front [[Fascia (car)|fascia]]. The rear featured nearly square [[taillight]]s with a slight wraparound at the outboard ends of the upper rear panel.  

The Firenza was launched with a 2.0-liter OHV [[I4 engine|inline four-cylinder engine]] as the sole powerplant, but an overhead-cam 1.8-liter engine was added during the model year. Oldsmobile did not utilize the turbo on these engines, Buick did offer the turbo.
Wraparound amber [[turn signal light]]s were added immediately outboard of the headlights for 1984. In 1985 the 2.8&amp;nbsp;L [[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#LB6|LB6]] V6 was added as an option, on the GT package. 

The GT was only available on the S Coupe (hatchback)&lt;ref&gt;1983-1987 Oldsmobile Sales literature, Oldsmobile Dealer sales and ordering catalogs - albums &lt;/ref&gt;, unlike Chevy Z24, Buick Skyhawk T-Type, Pontiac Sunbird GT could be had as either hatchbacks or 2 door sedan (notch-backs).  
GT's first were introduced in 1983, 65 were built; red with silver lower panel accent color, sold as "Brass Hat" promotional cars for dealerships, most were equipped with the "new" 1.8 liter overhead cam motor, with either a 3 speed automatic or 5 speed manual transmission. FE3 suspension was included in the package with a rear stabilizer bar, heavier struts all the way around, with a wider tire offering on the polycast wheels as standard for the GT package.  1984; red/silver carried over plus white with silver lower body color was added. 2312 - GT's were produced, less than 20% were white. Engines either were the 2.0 liter (4 speed manual or 3 speed auto)or the 1.8 liter (5 speed manual or 3 speed auto).
The GT for 1985 - 498 built; body colors were changed to either black or gray with silver trim (not as pronounced as with the 1983-84's.)  A fiberglass hood with a pronounced center bulge was included, the 2.6 liter V6 was offered with only the 4 speed manual or the 3 speed auto, the wheels were changed to aluminum from the previous polycast wheel, this was to be the same for 1986 GT. 
1986 - 1032 built; and was the only year the GT was its own separate trim level, and the body color red became available again with silver accent.   1987 GT - 783 built; went back to an option on the hatchback and was the last year offered, essentially same as 1986, but added the availability of the heavier 5 speed manual transmission than was previous on the 1.8 liter offering 3 years previous, along with a 3 speed auto. 
Interesting note; The "GT"  was used on the Calais and Ciera in 1987, replacing the "ES" (EuroSport) designation the previous two years, 1984-1985. 1988 the designation became "International Series", replacing GT.

The Firenza ES (EuroSport) sedan 1984 (maybe 1985?).  Not much is known of this offering, it had blacked out headlight bezels and blacked out trim on the tail lights, the interior upholstery used the same two color gray combo and red piping as with all the GT's. This was offered as a 4 door GT idea, with the same polycast wheels, heavier suspension, used on the 1983 and 1984 GT hatchbacks. They were only offered in a dark silver body color.

[[File:Oldsmobile Firenza Sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1988 Oldsmobile Firenza sedan]]
For the Firenza's last model year, 1988, it received a new open grille, aerodynamic composite headlamps, and tail lights, styled after those of the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera|Cutlass Ciera]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Also for the Firenza's final year, the hatchback was dropped along with the V6, leaving just the four-cylinder notchback coupe, sedan, and wagon models. Also for 1988, all previous trim level designations were dropped. All Firenza bodystyles came in a single unnamed base model that could be equipped with six various option packages.

The Firenza was never a strong seller for Oldsmobile. In keeping with its premium image, Oldsmobile always had better luck selling larger, better equipped cars, most notably its wide range of Cutlass models. Sales of the Firenza were also hampered by Oldsmobile management who fought hard not to have to sell the J-body cars but had to, in order to keep the division’s EPA average fuel economy ratings up to meet General Motors’ corporate standards. Thus Oldsmobile did not promote this car very well, instead choosing to put more marketing effort toward the Cutlass Calias.
Also to blame was competition from the Firenza’s rebadged J-body siblings. Sales of the Cavalier and Sunbird annually dwarfed the Firenza, as they better fit into Chevrolet and Pontiac's value-oriented brand portfolios.&lt;ref name="Consumer Guide 2006. pp 642-43"/&gt; Due to this, the Firenza was not replaced in Oldsmobile's lineup, leaving the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais|Cutlass Calais]] as the division's smallest car. The [[Cadillac Cimarron|Cimarron]] was discontinued that year as well. [[Leeds Assembly]], which built the Firenza, was closed. The [[Buick Skyhawk|Skyhawk]] lasted another year, while [[General Motors|GM]] kept the first-generation Sunbird and Cavalier in production until 1994. The last Firenza rolled off the assembly line on July 8, 1988.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Naming standards were in flux at Oldsmobile during the late 1930s and 1940s. From 1932 through 1938 Oldsmobile had two series: "F" and "L". Series F came with a [[straight-6]] engine and Series L came with a larger body and a [[straight-8]] engine. Series F was renamed [[Oldsmobile Series 60|Series 60]] in 1939 and Series L was replaced with the Series 70 and 80, with the Series 70 and 80 being powered by the straight-6 and the straight-8 respectively. The Series 60 used the [[GM A platform (RWD)|GM A-body]] and the Series 70 and 80 used the [[GM B platform|B-body]]. In 1940 the even larger [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] was introduced to Oldsmobile and it alone was powered by the straight-8. In order to differentiate it from the previous year's Series 80 it was named [[Oldsmobile 98|Series 90]] (there was no Series 80 that year). The series were also given names for the first time that year with the Series 60, 70, and 90 being called the Special, '''Dynamic''', and Custom Cruiser respectively.

In 1941 both engines were offered on each series so to differentiate between the two the second digit was used to denote the number of cylinders, so the Dynamic 70 was replaced with the '''Dynamic 76''' and '''78'''. In 1942 sales literature started referring to the Series 70 as the '''Dynamic Cruiser 76''' and '''78'''. In 1948, when the Series 60 was renamed the Dynamic the "Cruiser" tag was dropped from the Series 70 and it was once again named the '''Dynamic 76''' and '''78'''. The '''Dynamic 76''' was produced in Australia with fewer than 120 thought to have been produced during 1947

The all new post-war Futuramic styling that had been introduced to the C-body Oldsmobile 98 in 1948 was brought to Oldsmobile's B-bodies in 1949. The wheelbase was now {{Convert|119.5|in|mm}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1949%20Oldsmobile/album/1949%20Oldsmobile-18.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1949 Oldsmobile/album |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 78 model was retired with the 1949 introduction of the [[Oldsmobile 88]], which shared its new Futuramic B-body platform with the 76 but was equipped with the new overhead valve [[Oldsmobile V8 engine|Rocket V8]]. Due to the new styling the 76 was renamed the '''Futuramic 76'''.

The Futuramic tag was abandoned after only one year and so in 1950 the car was simply known as the '''76'''. The Series 70 was retired after the 1950 model year.

The 76 was available in the following body styles:
* [[Station wagon]]
* [[Convertible (car)|Convertible]]
* Holiday [[coupé]]
* Club [[coupé]] (2-door)

The '''Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser''' is an automobile that was manufactured and marketed by [[Oldsmobile]] in three generations from 1971 to 1992.  The first full-size station wagon produced by Oldsmobile since the 1964 [[Oldsmobile 88#1961–1964|Oldsmobile 88 Fiesta]], the Custom Cruiser was produced exclusively on the [[GM B platform|General Motors B platform]] as a five-door station wagon.  The nameplate was first used by Oldsmobile from 1940 to 1947, denoting the top trim level of its C-body model line (later the [[Oldsmobile 98]]).  451,819 Custom Cruisers were sold over the years.

Through its entire production run, the Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser was the counterpart to various Buick, Pontiac, and Chevrolet station wagons.  Within Oldsmobile, the Custom Cruiser shared its trim with either (or both) the Oldsmobile Delta 88 or Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight; following the further downsizing of Oldsmobile sedans in 1986, the Custom Cruiser effectively became a stand-alone model line.  With the discontinuation of the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme#Fourth generation (1978–1988)|Cutlass Supreme Classic]] in 1988, the Custom Cruiser became the sole Oldsmobile sold with rear-wheel drive.

For the 1991 model year, the Custom Cruiser underwent an extensive redesign alongside its Buick and Chevrolet counterparts.  Following the 1992 model year, the Custom Cruiser model line was discontinued.  In the early 1990s, the Oldsmobile division began to explore station wagon alternatives, introducing both a minivan and a mid-size SUV before 1992 (the [[Oldsmobile Silhouette]] and [[Oldsmobile Bravada]]).  At the end of the 1996 model year, General Motors ended production of Buick Roadmaster and Chevrolet Caprice station wagons, marking the end of full-size station wagon production by American automobile manufacturers until the introduction of the [[Dodge Magnum#Chrysler LX platform 2005–2008|Dodge Magnum]] in 2005.

}}During the early 1970s, GM returned its mid-price divisions to the full-size station-wagon segment after concentrating wagon production towards Chevrolet and Pontiac.  For 1971, the Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser was introduced alongside a redesign of the [[Buick Estate]] and [[Pontiac Safari|Pontiac Safari/Grand Safari]].  While the Oldsmobile Delta 88 sedan was mechanically related to the Chevrolet Impala/Caprice, General Motors designed the Custom Cruiser slightly separate from the Chevrolet full-size station wagon lines.

Using the intermediate-segment [[Buick Sport Wagon]] and [[Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser]] as a predecessor, GM introduced a forward-facing third seat in a full-size station wagon for the first time (with the shorter-wheelbase Chevrolet wagon retaining a rear-facing third seat).  With a total of eight-passenger accommodation (similar to the Chevrolet/GMC Suburban of the time), the Custom Cruiser would become among the largest vehicles ever built by Oldsmobile.

=== Chassis ===
Technically derived from the GM [[GM B platform|B-body]] chassis, the Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser shares its 127-inch wheelbase with the GM [[GM C platform (1936)|C-body]] chassis (though the Custom Cruiser was given a B-body serial number).  Shared with the same-generation Oldsmobile Ninety Eight, the 1971-1976 Custom Cruiser is the longest-wheelbase Oldsmobile ever produced by General Motors.

In contrast to the rest of the GM B/C/D-platform vehicles of the time, GM 1971-1976 full-size station wagons used a truck-style rear suspension of [[Multi leaf spring|multi-leaf springs]] (in lieu of rear [[coil spring]]s).

At {{convert|5161|lb|kg|abbr=on}} shipping weight ({{convert|5186|lb|kg|abbr=on}} with [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|woodgrain]]), or about {{convert|5400|lb|kg|abbr=on}} curb weight, the three-seat 1974 Custom Cruiser wagons are easily the heaviest Oldsmobiles ever built (the Custom Cruiser competes with similar models of the Buick Estate as the heaviest GM vehicle ever produced).

====Powertrain====
Oldsmobile offered the 455 cubic-inch [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#455|''Rocket V8'']] in various states of tune from 1971 to 1976 (though the "Rocket" brand was discontinued in 1975).  A 190&amp;nbsp;hp 400 cubic-inch [[Pontiac V8 engine#400|''Pontiac'' V8]] was offered for 1975.  For the entire production of the first-generation Custom Cruiser, the GM ''[[Turbo Hydramatic#Super Turbine 400 / THM400 / THM375 / 3L80 / 3L80HD|Turbo-Hydramatic 400]]'' 3-speed automatic was the sole transmission paired with either engine.

=== Body ===
As a result of its longer-wheelbase chassis layout, the Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser effectively existed as a hybrid of the Delta 88 and the Ninety Eight.  From the Ninety-Eight, the Custom Cruiser adopted the front fascia and rear quarter panels (and [[fender skirts]]); the Custom Cruiser adopted interior trim elements from both the Delta 88 and Ninety-Eight.  As with its Buick and Pontiac counterparts, to compete with the [[Mercury Colony Park]] and [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country (1941–1988)|Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] station wagons, the Custom Cruiser was offered with [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain siding]], with nearly 80% of buyers ordering the option.

Following the exterior of the Ninety-Eight, the Custom Cruiser was given a new front bumper for 1972.  For 1973 and 1974, Oldsmobile added 5-mph bumpers to the front and rear, respectively.  For 1974, the grille was redesigned.

For 1976, alongside all GM full-size vehicles, the Custom Cruiser saw a redesign of its front fascia.  Largely a preview of the 1977 Oldsmobile 98, the fascia was given four square headlights with outboard marker lights.

==== Clamshell tailgate design ====
[[File:1975_Oldsmobile_Custom_Cruise_(2547376776).jpg|left|thumb|1975 Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser, clamshell tailgate closed]]
Along with all other 1971-1976 General Motors full-size station wagons built on the B-platform, first-generation Custom Cruiser wagons feature a "[[Station wagon#Tailgate evolution|clamshell]]" tailgate design.  A two-piece tailgate configuration, the tailgate slid into a recess under the cargo floor while the rear glass window slid up into the roof; the design operated either manually or with optional power assist.

The first powered tailgate in automotive history, the powered option ultimately became standard, as the manual tailgate required a degree of effort to lift out of storage.  The system was operated from either an instrument panel switch or by key on the rear quarter panel.  The clamshell tailgate, was intended to aid the loading the long station wagons (over 19 feet long) in tight parking spaces.  Heavy and complex, the system was not included in the 1977 full-sized station wagons (shorter by over a foot and over 1000 pounds lighter); instead, GM developed its own two-way tailgate (a design developed by Ford).

}}For the 1977 model year, as part of a downsizing of the entire GM full-size range, the Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser was redesigned, becoming a direct counterpart of the Delta 88 sedan.  While interior space was reduced only marginally, its exterior footprint saw extensive change, with the full-size Custom Cruiser and the intermediate Vista Cruiser/Cutlass Supreme wagon briefly switching places as the longest Oldsmobile station wagon (for 1977 only, as GM intermediates underwent a similar downsizing for 1978).  

As with the previous generation, the Custom Cruiser shared its body with the Buick Estate, Chevrolet Impala wagon/Caprice Estate, and Pontiac Safari.  Following the exit of Chrysler from the segment after the 1977 model year, the Custom Cruiser primarily competed against the Ford LTD Country Squire and Mercury Colony Park, which remained in production through 1991.  

Following the 1985 model year, GM shifted Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac versions of the B-body sedans to the front-wheel drive [[GM H platform (1986)|H-platform]] with a further round of downsizing, with station wagons becoming distinct model lines on the B platform (only the Chevrolet Caprice remained as both a sedan and station wagon).  

=== Chassis ===
The second-generation Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser (as with all full-size GM station wagons) is based on the GM B-platform.  As part of the GM downsizing, station wagons were consolidated upon a common 115.9 inch wheelbase shared with wagons of all three mid-price divisions and Chevrolet (and all B-platform sedans).  In the redesign, the Custom Cruiser shed 14 inches in length, 11 inches of wheelbase, and up to 900 pounds of curb weight (though becoming taller).  Though sharing its wheelbase with the intermediate Vista Cruiser (and nearly 200 pounds lighter) prior to its 1978 downsizing/replacement, the Custom Cruiser remained in the full-size segment, as its body was several inches wider and taller.

As Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac  (and most Cadillac) full-size sedans were downsized further to the front-wheel drive [[GM C platform (1985)|C-body]] and [[GM H platform (1986)|H-body]] platforms in the mid-1980s, after 1986, the rear-wheel drive B-platform remained solely for the Chevrolet Caprice and Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac station wagons (with the Pontiac Safari ending production after 1989).

====Powertrain====
At its 1977 launch, the second-generation Custom Cruiser was offered with two engines, a 170&amp;nbsp;hp 350 cubic-inch Oldsmobile V8, with a 185&amp;nbsp;hp 403 cubic-inch Oldsmobile V8 as an option (the largest-displacement "small-block" ever offered by GM).  For 1979, both engines were detuned: the 350 was detuned to 160&amp;nbsp;hp and the 403 offered 175&amp;nbsp;hp.  After 1980, both the 350 and the 403 were replaced by the 307.

For 1980, Oldsmobile introduced its third (and last) V8 engine for the B-platform, the 307.  Initially producing 150&amp;nbsp;hp, the 307 was detuned to 140&amp;nbsp;hp for 1981.  For 1985, new "swirl port" cylinder heads were given to the 307.  While engine horsepower was not increased, the design increased torque and driveability; at the expense of high RPM power and performance, the heads featured relatively small intake ports.  Along with the new cylinder heads, roller lifters replaced flat lifters.

For 1980 in California-market examples, Oldsmobile introduced a new E4ME electronic carburetor, using CCC (Computer Command Control); in 1981, the 4-barrel carburetor was adopted in all 50 states, replacing the previous mechanical M4ME version.  In Canada, E4ME was not adopted until 1986.

1977-1990 Custom Cruisers were fitted with two different automatic transmissions.  From 1977 to 1980, the 3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM200|THM200]] was the sole transmission.  From 1981 to 1990, the THM200-4R 4-speed automatic with overdrive was added, as GM added a lock-up torque converter and a 0.67:1 overdrive ratio.  With the overdrive transmission, the Custom Cruiser drive with a numerically higher rear axle ratio for better performance, while offering improved fuel economy with the overdrive range

In its final year of production, the second-generation Custom Cruiser marked the end of the Oldsmobile-produced V8 (formerly the "Rocket V8").  Shifting from its long-running practice of each division developing its own engines, during the 1980s, GM consolidated V8 production in non-Cadillac full-size cars towards Chevrolet and Oldsmobile, with the latter division developing diesel engines.  Towards the end of the decade, GM phased out the Oldsmobile V8 family, as the 307 was the final engine produced by the company without fuel injection.  After 1990, Oldsmobile would never again have a division-produced engine; the only GM division-unique engine family developed since 1990 is the now-defunct [[Cadillac Northstar engine|Cadillac Northstar]] (developed with some Oldsmobile and Pontiac applications).

===== Oldsmobile diesel V8 =====
For 1978, Oldsmobile introduced its first diesel engine, a naturally aspirated 120&amp;nbsp;hp 350 cubic-inch V8.  For 1980, the V8 was retuned to 105&amp;nbsp;hp, remaining an option through 1985.

[[File:Oldsmobile-Custom-Cruiser.jpg|thumb|Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser configured without wood siding (derelict condition)]]
In contrast to the 1971-1976 Custom Cruiser, Oldsmobile styled the 1977 Custom Cruiser as a station wagon version of the Delta 88, adopting its front fascia entirely.  To distinguish itself from its nearly identical Buick, Chevrolet, and Pontiac counterparts, the Custom Cruiser was given its simulated wood design, with wood following the curve of the wheel wells.

In a major departure from the 2-piece "clamshell" tailgate of its predecessor, the Custom Cruiser was fitted with a two-way tailgate; similar to configurations offered by Ford and Chrysler, the two-way tailgate opened to the side as a door or hinged down as a tailgate (with the rear window glass retracted).  The third-row seat made its return, allowing for 8-passenger seating; to allow for production commonality on a single wheelbase, the Custom Cruiser was produced with a rear-facing third row seat (as were all full-size GM station wagons).

Alongside all B-platform station wagons and sedans, the Custom Cruiser saw an exterior update for 1980, with wagons receiving a new front fascia.  In the interest of aerodynamics and fuel economy, the grille and front fascia were redesigned, with the headlamps mounted closer to the front bumpers; similar to the Ninety-Eight, the Custom Cruiser gained wraparound front marker lights.  In a minor change, the design of the simulated woodgrain adopted the common layout used by Buick and Chevrolet, joining the headlamps and taillamps.

From 1980 to 1990, the exterior and interior of the Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser saw almost no visible change, besides a small front fascia swap in 1985. Instead of the split-grille style from 1980-1984, the Custom Cruiser was now fitted with a single, wider grille. Along with the wider grille came a sharper header panel, instead of curving off on the edge.  In 1986, the rear tailgate saw the addition of a federally mandated third brake light.  For 1989, the rear outboard seats were fitted with outboard shoulder belts; to meet federal safety standards involving passive safety restraints, the front shoulder belts were shifted from the B-pillar to the front doors for 1990 (as this generation could not accommodate airbags).

}}For the 1991 model year, General Motors redesigned its B-body model lines for the first time since 1977.  While its B-body underpinnings remained largely the same, to bring the model line into the 1990s, Oldsmobile gave the Custom Cruiser its largest exterior revision in 13 years; numerous upgrades were added, including aerodynamic headlights, anti-lock brakes (ABS), and a driver-side airbag.  As a consequence of the redesign, the long-running Oldsmobile Rocket V8 was retired, along with the use of simulated woodgrain siding. 

While Pontiac had ended production of the Safari station wagon after 1989 (with GMC taking over the nameplate), the Chevrolet Caprice Estate made its return for 1991; Buick retired the Estate model name in favor of reviving the Roadmaster model line.  In contrast to the Buick Roadmaster, Oldmobile never developed a sedan variant of the 1991 B-body (the [[Oldsmobile 98]] remained a front-wheel drive vehicle).  After the 1991 model year, the Custom Cruiser competed solely against its Buick and Chevrolet counterparts, as Ford ended production of the LTD Country Squire and Mercury Colony Park.  

Sold only in the United States, the 1991 Custom Cruiser improved its sales nearly two-to-one over 1990, slightly outselling the Buick Roadmaster (and outselling both the Country Squire and Colony Park combined).  For 1992, sales decreased close to 1990 levels, leading Oldsmobile to discontinue the model line for 1993.  The final Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser, the last Oldsmobile car produced with rear-wheel drive, was assembled on June 5, 1992.  The model line is also the final Oldsmobile produced exclusively with a 3-passenger front bench seat; all subsequent vehicles produced by the division were sold with 2-passenger front seating as standard (or as an option). 

In place of the Custom Cruiser, Oldsmobile concentrated on the [[Oldsmobile Bravada|Bravada]] SUV and [[Oldsmobile Silhouette|Silhouette]] minivan (segments not entered by Buick until after the closure of Oldsmobile).

=== Chassis ===

The 1991-1992 Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser is based upon the GM B-platform.  Sharing its wheelbase with the 1977-1990 B-platform, the third-generation Custom Cruiser and its counterparts are largely rebodied versions of their predecessors.  Primarily through the addition of additional safety equipment, the redesign of the Custom Cruiser added nearly 100 pounds of weight to the vehicle (though nearly 650 pounds lighter than a 1976 counterpart).

Following the 1992 discontinuation of the Custom Cruiser, the Buick Roadmaster Estate and Chevrolet Caprice Estate were produced with no major changes (to the B-body platform) through their 1996 discontinuation.  As the Custom Cruiser was the only GM B-body without a direct sedan counterpart, the front-wheel drive C-body 1991 Oldsmobile 98 Touring Sedan (flagship Oldsmobile) was nearly 12 inches shorter in length (5 inches shorter in wheelbase), 4 inches narrower in width, 5 inches lower, and approximately 740 pounds lighter.

====Powertrain====

As part of the redesign of the GM B platform for 1991, all divisions adopted retired divisional engines in favor of the Chevrolet small-block V8.  For 1991, the Oldsmobile 307 was replaced by a 5.0L V8.  Along with an increase of 30 hp (to 170 hp), the engine was fuel-injected (a first for a rear-wheel drive Oldsmobile).  The engine became the standard offering for 1992, with a 180 hp 5.7L V8 offered as an option.  Both engines were paired with the Hydramatic [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM700R4 / 4L60 / 4L60E / 4L65E / 4L70E|''4L60'']] 4-speed overdrive automatic (replacing the THM200-4R).

=== Body ===
[[File:Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser 1992 (10701519986).jpg|thumb|Rear view, 1992 Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]]
As with the previous generation, the Custom Cruiser shared nearly its entire body with its Chevrolet and Buick counterparts.  To distinguish the model line from the Caprice and Roadmaster Estate, Oldsmobile ended the use of woodgrain siding (adopting standard two-tone color schemes in its place).  The use of chrome was visibly reduced, with plastic-covered 5-mph bumpers replacing the previous steel bumpers; the body-color split grille made its return.  

Shared with the Buick Roadmaster Estate, the Custom Cruiser was fitted with a fixed second-row skylight, allowing for a slightly raised rear roofline (similar to the 1964-1972 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser).  While sharing its dashboard and interior elements with the Roadmaster, the Custom Cruiser was fitted with its own seat and wood trim design; cloth-trim seats were standard, while leather-trim seats were an option.  In contrast to its predecessors, the Custom Cruiser was given an instrument panel with full instrumentation, including tachometer, oil pressure, voltage, and coolant temperature.  

In line with the preceding two generations, the Custom Cruiser was offered with a rear-facing third-row seat, increasing capacity from six to eight.  As part of the body redesign, the rear window no longer retracted into the two-way tailgate, replaced by a hatch window (with its own windscreen wiper).  In line with the mid-size Cutlass Cruiser/Buick Century station wagons, the Custom Cruiser offered pop-out vent windows in the cargo area to aid airflow and ventilation.

The '''Oldsmobile Toronado''' is a [[personal luxury car]] manufactured and marketed by the [[Oldsmobile]] division of [[General Motors]] from 1966 to 1992 over four generations. The Toronado was noted for its transaxle version of GM's [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] transmission, making it the first U.S.-produced [[front-wheel drive]] automobile since the demise of the [[Cord (automobile)|Cord]] in 1937. 

The Toronado placed third in the 1966 [[European Car of the Year]] competition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/gallery/every-european-car-of-the-year-coty-winner/renault-16---1966-european-car-of-the-year/ |title=Renault 16 - 1966 European car of the Year {{!}} Driving through the ages – every European Car of the Year (COTY) winner since 1964 |work=Telegraph |location=UK |date=2018-03-05 |access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won the 1966 [[Motor Trend Car of the Year]] award in the U.S.

Sharing the [[GM E platform]] introduced by the rear-wheel drive [[Buick Riviera]] in 1963 and adopted a year later with the [[front-wheel drive]] [[Cadillac Eldorado]], the three models shared the E platform for most of the Toronado's 26-year history.

The name "Toronado" had no prior meaning and was originally selected for a 1963 [[Chevrolet]] [[show car]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=M_lTAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=50+Years+of+Chevrolet+George+H.+Dammann&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=toronado |title=Sixty years of Chevrolet |first=George H. |last=Dammann |page=248 |publisher=Crestline |year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1967 Oldsmobile Toronado engine.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The 1967 Toronado's 425 cubic-inch Super Rocket V8 engine]]

The Toronado began as a design painting by Oldsmobile stylist David North in 1962. His "Flame Red Car" was a compact sports/personal car never intended for production. A few weeks after the design was finished, however, Oldsmobile division was informed it would be permitted to build a personal car in the Riviera/Thunderbird class for the 1966 model year, and North's design was selected. For production economy, the still-unnamed car was to share the so-called [[GM E platform|E-body]] shell with the redesigned 1966 [[Buick Riviera]] (then entering its second generation), which was substantially larger than North had envisioned. Despite the efforts of Oldsmobile and General Motors styling chief [[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]] to put the car on the smaller [[GM A platform (RWD)|A-body]] intermediate, they were overruled for cost reasons.{{cn|date=March 2019}}

Oldsmobile had been working on front-wheel drive since 1958, a project shepherded by engineer [[John Beltz]] (who originated the [[Oldsmobile 4-4-2|4-4-2]]&lt;ref&gt;''Car Craft'', 1/91, p.52.&lt;/ref&gt; and would later become head of the division). Although initially envisioned for the smaller [[Oldsmobile Cutlass|F-85 line]], its cost and experimental nature pushed the program towards a larger, more expensive car. Engineer F. J. Hooven of the [[Ford Motor Company]], had patented a similar FWD layout, and Ford considered the design for the [[Ford Thunderbird (third generation)|1961 Ford Thunderbird]]. However, the capability to develop and engineer it on such short notice was doubtful.

The unusual Toronado powertrain called the '''Unitized Power Package''' ('''UPP'''), stuffed an engine and transmission into an engine bay no larger than one for a conventional [[rear-wheel drive]] car. During its seven-year development, UPP components were driven over 1.5&amp;nbsp;million test miles to verify their strength and reliability. They proved so well-built the UPP was employed basically unchanged in the 1970s [[GMC motorhome]].

At its debut, the Toronado featured such GM innovations as:

*Heavy-duty [[Turbo-Hydramatic 425|Turbo-Hydramatic]] 400 three-speed automatic transmission (named THM425 in [[Front-wheel drive|FWD]] form)
*Rochester [[Quadrajet]] four-barrel carburetor
*Spherical shaped exhaust-manifold flange gaskets, which provided freedom of movement in the exhaust system and prevented leaks
*"Draft-Free" ventilation system, which reduced wind noise considerably by eliminating conventional front-door triangular window vents.

[[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] designed an 8.85" x 15" tire especially for the Toronado called the '''TFD''' ('''T'''oronado-'''F'''ront-'''D'''rive) tire. It had a stiffer sidewall than normal, and the tread and stylishly thin white pin-stripe were also unique.

Oldsmobile engineers selected a conventional, though performance-boosted, Olds {{convert|425|cuin|L|0|abbr=on}} Super Rocket [[V8 engine|V8]] rated at {{convert|385|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|475|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque. It was an increase of {{convert|10|hp|kW|abbr=on}} over the [[Oldsmobile Starfire|Starfire]] 425, and an increase of {{convert|20|hp|kW|abbr=on}} over the standard 425 engine in the [[Oldsmobile 98|Ninety-Eight]]. The Toronado intake manifold's unique shape was depressed to allow for engine hood clearance.

The Turbo-Hydramatic heavy-duty three-speed automatic transmission became available during development of the Toronado. Called the TH425 in FWD form, the transmission's [[torque converter]] was separated from its [[epicyclic gearing|planetary gearset]], with the torque converter driving the gearset through a {{convert|2|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide silent chain-drive called '''Hy-Vo''', riding on two {{convert|7.5|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} sprockets. The Hy-Vo chain drive was developed by GM's [[Hydra-Matic]] Division and Morse Chain Division of [[Borg-Warner]]. The chains were made from very strong hardened steel and required no tensioners or idler pulleys because they were pre-stretched on a special machine at the factory. Although the rotational direction of the transmission gears had to be reversed, a large number of components were shared with the conventional TH400. Use of the automatic also eliminated the need to devise a workable manual-shift linkage. No manual transmission was ever contemplated because performance was adequate with the [[automatic transmission]] and because virtually all U.S.-built luxury cars during this period came with automatic transmissions as standard equipment. The car's {{convert|0|-|60|mph|0|abbr=on}} time was clocked at 9.5&amp;nbsp;seconds.&lt;ref name="auto.howstuffworks.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1966-1970-oldsmobile-toronado5.htm |title=1966-1970 Oldsmobile Toronado|work=How Stuff Works |accessdate=2013-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Toronado was GM's first [[subframe]] automobile, which means it was partly [[monocoque|unitized]], using a subframe that ended at the forward end of the rear suspension leaf springs, serving as an attachment point for the springs. It carried the powertrain, front suspension and floorpan, allowing greater isolation of road and engine harshness (the design was conceptually similar to the [[Chevrolet Camaro]] and [[Pontiac Firebird]] that would debut for 1967).

To fit into the tight space, Oldsmobile adopted [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] for the Toronado's front suspension (the first GM passenger car application of torsion bars in the US, but still not up to [[Packard]]'s automatic ride leveling system), with conventional, unequal-length [[double wishbone]]s.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1966"/&gt; Rear Toronado suspension was a simple [[beam axle]] on single [[leaf springs]], unusual only in having dual [[shock absorber]]s, one vertical, one horizontal (allowing it to act as a [[radius rod]] to control wheel movement).

Brakes were hydraulically-operated {{convert|11|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} [[drum brake|drums]], generally considered the Toronado's weak link. As a rather heavy car, after several panic stops the brake drums would overheat, resulting in considerable fade and long stopping distances. The 1967 addition of vented front [[disc brake]]s as an option provided substantial improvement.&lt;ref name="auto.howstuffworks.com"/&gt;

The Toronado's UPP enabled the interior to have a completely flat floor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1966%20Oldsmobile/1966_Oldsmobile_Toronado_Brochure/1966%20Oldsmobile%20Toronado-10-11.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1966 Oldsmobile/1966_Oldsmobile_Toronado_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; but interior space (primarily rear seat headroom) was somewhat restricted by the [[fastback]] styling.

As with many [[Coupé|coupes]], the Toronado featured elongated doors to allow easier access for passengers entering the rear seats.  Duplicate door-latch handles were even added at the rear of each door enabling back seat passengers to open the doors without having to reach over or around the front seat, a feature also available on the other two E-bodies, continuing until 1980 on the Eldorado.

Options included headrests ($52)&lt;ref name="autogenerated1946"/&gt; and a tilt-telescopic steering column.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1966%20Oldsmobile/1966_Oldsmobile_Toronado_Brochure/1966%20Oldsmobile%20Toronado-16-17.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1966 Oldsmobile/1966_Oldsmobile_Toronado_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drivers faced a highly stylized steering wheel with a double-delta shaped horn ring which framed the view of an unusual "[[slot-machine]]" style speedometer, consisting of a stationary horizontal "needle" and a vertically rotating black drum on which the numerals were printed in white. The numerals descended behind the needle as the vehicle gained speed. All other gauges, indicators and controls were grouped within fairly easy reach of the driver.

Despite an average weight of {{convert|4500|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}, published performance test data shows the 1966 Toronado was capable of accelerating from {{convert|0|-|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 7.5&amp;nbsp;seconds, and through the standing 1/4&amp;nbsp;mile (~400&amp;nbsp;m) in 16.4&amp;nbsp;seconds at {{convert|93|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.{{Ref|cd}} It was also capable of a maximum speed of {{convert|135|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.{{Ref|cd}} Testers found the Toronado's handling, despite its noticeable front weight bias and consequent [[understeer]], was not substantially different from other full-size U.S. cars when driven under normal conditions. In fact, many contemporary testers{{who|date=March 2018}} felt that the Toronado was more poised and responsive than other cars, and when pushed to the limits, exhibited superior handling characteristics, although it was essentially incapable of terminal [[oversteer]].

The Toronado sold reasonably well at introduction, with 40,963 produced for 1966. Some television commercials featured former [[NASA]] [[Project Mercury]] public affairs officer [[John A. Powers|John "Shorty" Powers]], Oldsmobile's primary commercial spokesperson of the era, along with racing legend [[Bobby Unser]] driving the vehicle and commenting favorably on the Toronado's handling. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQbX4bjefKw] The car gained publicity for the division by winning several leading automotive awards, such as ''[[Motor Trend]]''{{'}}s [[Car of the Year]] Award&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960–1972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), p.461.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Car Life''{{'}}s Award for Engineering Excellence. It also was a third-place finisher in the [[European Car of the Year]] competition.

Sales for the 1967 model, which was distinguished by a slight facelift, the addition of optional disc brakes, and a slightly softer ride, dropped by nearly half, to 22,062. A stereo tape player was optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1967%20Oldsmobile/album_001/1967%20Oldsmobile-05.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1967 Oldsmobile/album_001 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would be 1971 before the Toronado matched its first-year sales volume.

In 1967, [[Cadillac]] adopted its own version of the UPP for the [[Cadillac Eldorado]], using the [[Cadillac V8 engine]]. The Eldorado also shared the E-body shell with the Toronado and Riviera, but its radically different styling meant that the three cars did not look similar at all. Also, despite sharing the same platform as the Toronado and Eldorado, the Riviera retained its rear-wheel drive setup, and would not convert to front-wheel drive until the platform was downsized in 1979.

[[File:'70 Oldsmobile Toronado (Auto classique Bellepros Vaudreuil-Dorion '11).JPG|thumb|left|1970 Oldsmobile Toronado]]

The first-generation Toronado persisted with the usual annual facelifts through 1970. Other than the brakes, the major changes were the replacement of the original {{convert|425|cuin|L|0|abbr=on}} V8 with the new [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#455|{{convert|455|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] in 1968, rated at {{convert|375|hp|kW|abbr=on}} in standard form or {{convert|400|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with the W-34 option, revised rear quarter panels (with small fins to disguise the slope of the rear body in side view) in 1969, and the elimination of hidden headlights and the introduction of squared wheel arch bulges in 1970. An ignition lock was added in 1969.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1969"/&gt;

Slight interior cosmetic changes were made for each new model year, and a full-length center console with floor-mounted shifter was available as an extra-cost option with the Strato bucket seats from 1968 to 1970, though few Toronados were so ordered. The vast majority of customers went for the standard Strato bench seat to take full advantage of the flatter floor resulting from the front-drive layout. The lack of a "hump" in the floor made three-abreast seating more comfortable than in rear-drive cars, as the center passengers both front and rear did not have to straddle one.

The firm suspension and thus the quality of the ride, was gradually softened through the years, hinting at what Toronado eventually would become in 1971. A heavy-duty suspension was an option on later first generation Toronados, which included the original torsion bar springs that were used on the 1966 model.

A special option code called W-34 was available on the 1968–70 Toronado. This option included a cold air induction system for the air cleaner, a special performance camshaft and a "GT" transmission calibrated for quick and firm up-shifts and better torque multiplication at {{convert|5|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. Dual exhaust outlets similar to the 1966–67 model years with cutouts in the bumper, were included with W-34. The standard models also had dual exhaust systems, but only a single somewhat hidden outlet running from the muffler exiting rearward on the right side. For 1970 only, the W-34 option also included special "GT" badges on the exterior of the car. The W-34 Toronado was capable of 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph in 7.5&amp;nbsp;seconds and the standing 1/4&amp;nbsp;mile in 15.7&amp;nbsp;seconds at {{convert|89.8|mph|km/h|1|abbr=on}}.{{Ref|cd}}

With heavily revised styling from the first generation, the Toronado transitioned from a "GT"-style car into a more traditional luxury car. It was now more similar to the Cadillac Eldorado than the Buick Riviera (which would be redesigned in 1974, then again in 1977), with styling taking several cues from the 1967–70 Eldorado. Sales increased dramatically. Front disc brakes became standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1970%20Oldsmobile/album/1970%20Oldsmobile%20Toronado-06.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1970 Oldsmobile/album |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=2011-11-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219023455/http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1970%20Oldsmobile/album/1970%20Oldsmobile%20Toronado-06.html |archivedate=2013-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The front end utilized a novel air induction system, splitting the airflow from below the headlights, in a "[[bottom breather]]" fashion. When United States Federal bumper standards were implemented, the front air intake was phased out for a conventional approach from below the bumper.

All overall dimensions of the 1971 Toronado were larger than previous models with wheelbase increased from 119 to {{convert|122|in|mm|abbr=on}}, only {{convert|2|in|mm|abbr=on}} less than the full-sized Delta 88. Also, the subframe design of first-generation Toronados was replaced by a separate body-on-frame similar to full-sized [[Oldsmobile 88|Delta 88]] and Ninety-Eight models. The front torsion bar suspension was retained, but the multi-leaf springs in the rear were replaced by coil springs. In addition, the Toronado introduced as a novelty what later became a federal mandate in a modified form, two high-mounted taillights above the trunk and below the rear window, which was shared on its platform twin the Riviera.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960–1972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), p.841.&lt;/ref&gt; These taillights mirrored brake and turn functions of the normal taillights, but not the nighttime taillights. A rear-wheel [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] became optional.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1971"/&gt;

The 455&amp;nbsp;cubic-inch (7.46 L) Rocket V8 was carried over from previous models as the standard Toronado engine. The introduction of the second-generation Toronado coincided with the implementation of a GM corporate edict that took effect with the 1971 models; all engines had to run on lower-octane regular leaded, low lead or unleaded gasoline to meet increasing more stringent Federal (and California) emission control regulations, a goal that was reached by reducing compression ratios. This was a first step toward the introduction of catalytic converters in 1975, which mandated the use of unleaded fuel. The 1971 Toronado's 455&amp;nbsp;cubic-inch V8 (7.46 L) was rated at {{convert|350|hp|kW|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="autogenerated1946"/&gt; (down from 375 in 1970) with a compression ratio of 8.5:1 (down from 10.5:1 in 1970).

For 1972, the advertised rating for the 455 engine dropped to {{convert|250|hp|kW|abbr=on}} thanks to a switch in power measurements from the gross ratings in which power was measured by a dynometer with no accessories attached to "net" ratings which were measured as installed in a vehicle with all accessories and emissions equipment attached. By 1976, the last year for the 455 engine in the Toronado, the net rating dropped to {{convert|215|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.

The 1971–78 generation is mainly noted for the early use of two safety features that are now standard on all cars in the United States, the aforementioned high-mounted taillights (although a somewhat similar feature had appeared briefly as an option on the [[Ford Thunderbird]] in the late 1960s), and from 1974 through 1976, the Toronado was part of GM's first experimental production run of driver- and passenger-side [[airbag]]s, which GM named the [[Air Cushion Restraint System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1974_Oldsmobile/album/1974%20Oldsmobile-36.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1974_Oldsmobile/album |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=2011-11-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219022613/http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1974_Oldsmobile/album/1974%20Oldsmobile-36.html |archivedate=2013-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These Toronados used a unique steering wheel and were fitted with a knee blocker beneath the driver's portion of the dashboard.

Styling/engineering highlights through the years included disc brakes with audible wear indicators for 1972, a federally mandated {{convert|5|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} front bumper along with new vertical taillights in 1973, a stand-up hood ornament, 5&amp;nbsp;mph rear bumper and optional fixed rear side opera windows in 1974 and rectangular headlights in 1975.

The 1973 Toronado went on sale in September 1972 and has a combined fuel economy of between 8.5 and 10.9 miles per gallon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.consumerguide.com/12-worst-gas-guzzlers-1973/ |title=12 Worst Gas Guzzlers of 1973* |first=Tom |last=Appel |work=Consumer Guide |location=US |date=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AutoCatalog1973Toro&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1973/2369555/oldsmobile_toronado_custom.html|title=Detailed specs review of 1973 Oldsmobile Toronado Custom offered since September 1972 for  North America|website=www.automobile-catalog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1975 through 1978 Toronados had a fuel tank that could hold 26 gallons of gasoline,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gastankdepot.com/igm40u-gas-tank-1975-1978-oldsmobile-toronado.html|title=Steel Gas Tank For 1975-1978 Oldsmobile Toronado|website=Gas Tank Depot, Gas Tanks &amp; Fuel Parts}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the 1973 Toronado had a 25.9 gallon capacity fuel tank with 250 horsepower and an axle ratio of 2.73:1. The 1973 Toronado was made from September 1972 to September 1973.&lt;ref name=AutoCatalog1973Toro/&gt;

During most of the Toronado's second-generation run, two interior trims were generally offered each year. The standard interior trim consisted of a choice of cloth or vinyl upholstery and a Custom Sport notchback bench seat with center armrest. An optional Brougham interior available in cloth, velour or vinyl trims included cut-pile carpeting, door-mounted courtesy lighting and a split 60/40 bench seat with armrest. From 1971 to 1973, the Toronado's "Command Center" wrap-around instrument panel was similar to other full-sized Oldsmobiles featuring a large squared speedometer directly in front of the driver, heating/air conditioning and lights/wipers switches on the left hand side and the radio controls and cigar lighter on the right hand side. From 1974 to 1978, a flat instrument panel (again shared with Delta 88 and Ninety-Eight models) was used that featured a horizontal sweep speedometer flanked by a "Message Center" of warning lights, fuel gauge and shift quadrant, with the other controls in the same locations as in previous years.

As befitting a luxury car, Toronados featured a long list of standard equipment that included Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission, variable-ratio power steering, power front disc brakes along with an electric clock, carpeting and deluxe wheel covers. Virtually all Toronados were sold loaded with extra-cost options including air conditioning, AM/FM stereo with [[8-track tape]] player, power trunk release, vinyl roof, tilt and telescopic steering wheel, cruise control, power windows, power door locks and six-way power seats. Power windows became standard equipment in 1975. A new feature in 1974 was a gauge that monitored if the driver was driving economically or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1975%20Oldsmobile/1975%20Oldsmobile%20Full%20Line%20Brochure/75%20Oldsmobile%20Pg%2030.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1975 Oldsmobile/1975 Oldsmobile Full Line Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The later years of this generation of Toronado saw new features mostly confined to minor styling tweaks to the grille and trim, although in 1977, the XS and XSR models debuted. Both featured a three-sided, hot wire "bent-glass" rear window&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.classicoldsmobile.com/toronado/78.jpg|title=image|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, on the XSR, electric t-tops which slid inwards at the touch of a button. However, as built in prototype form, the XSR had no means of channeling water away from the retractable sections, and water would inevitably leak into the cabin. No workable solution to the problem was found, and as such, the XSR model was scrapped. The XS, which did enter production, was offered with GM's more reliable (and no doubt more leak-resistant) Astroroof sliding sunroof instead. Air conditioning was standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1977%20Oldsmobile/1977_Oldsmobile_Full_Size_Brochure/1977%20Oldsmobile%20Full%20Size-21.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1977 Oldsmobile/1977_Oldsmobile_Full_Size_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The running factory "XSR" prototype was documented as "restored" by Collectible Automobile Magazine in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://auto.consumerguide.com/pss/collectible/index.cfm?act=toc |title=Consumer Guide® Automotive: Search New &amp; Used Car, SUV, Truck &amp; Minivan Prices &amp; Reviews |publisher=Auto.consumerguide.com |date=2006-12-27 |accessdate=2011-11-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050221085019/http://auto.consumerguide.com/pss/collectible/index.cfm?act=toc |archivedate=2005-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also for 1977, the {{convert|455|cuin|L|abbr=on}} V8 was replaced by a smaller [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#403|{{convert|403|cuin|L|abbr=on}}]] engine (rated at 185HP/325&amp;nbsp;lb.ft.), due mainly to forthcoming government [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] standards (implemented beginning with the 1978 model year). In addition, the 1977 Delta 88 and Ninety-Eight models, formerly the biggest cars in the Oldsmobile stable, were downsized. For two more model years, the Toronado would be the largest Oldsmobile, and, after the mid-sized Cutlass line's downsizing for 1978, the Toronado looked hopelessly out of place in the lineup, given the industry-wide shift to smaller cars. Also in 1977, when Buick removed the Riviera from the E-body lineup and reassigned it to the B-body [[Buick LeSabre|LeSabre]] bodyshell, this meant that all E-bodies would be front-wheel drive only.

This generation was probably helped in the sales race by the radical and controversial "boat-tail"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musclecarclub.com/musclecars/buick-riviera/images/buick-riviera-1973a.jpg|title=Muscle Car Club|website=Muscle Car Club|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030124110238/http://musclecarclub.com/musclecars/buick-riviera/images/buick-riviera-1973a.jpg|archivedate=2003-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; design of the contemporary [[Buick Riviera]], since during this period the Toronado outsold its [[Buick]] cousin for the first time. However, the higher-priced [[Cadillac Eldorado]] managed to outsell the Toronado in most of these years.

The third generation Toronado was substantially downsized, losing nearly {{convert|1000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and more than {{convert|20|in|mm|abbr=on}} in length.  Reflecting its {{convert|206|in|mm|abbr=on}} length and {{convert|114|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase, it came equipped with the smaller Oldsmobile [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#350|{{convert|350|cuin|L|abbr=on}} V8]].  The engine was rated at 170 HP/270&amp;nbsp;lb.ft. torque giving it a top speed of over {{convert|110|mph|km/h|abbr=on|round=5}} and a {{convert|0-60|mph|km/h|abbr=on|0}} acceleration time of 9.4 seconds.  This was considered one of the faster times for that era.

A [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#307|{{convert|307|cuin|L|abbr=on}}]] V8 (140 HP) was introduced in 1980, and a larger {{convert|252|cuin|L|abbr=on}} version of the [[Buick V6 engine#4.1|Buick V6]] (125 HP) shared with the Riviera was made available from 1981 to 1984, but it proved unpopular due to its slow acceleration.

Also offered in these years was Oldsmobile's new [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#350|diesel V8]], that is based on (but mistakenly said to be converted from) Olds' well-regarded gasoline-powered {{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, but with added block material. This engine was novel and economical, and sales were initially good. The diesel conversion acquired a terrible mechanical reputation, becoming a genuine black eye for Oldsmobile. Many cars which originally came diesel-equipped were eventually converted to gasoline engines when disgusted owners finally threw in the towel. The engine was revised through its life, which fixed many issues that hurt its reputation, but it was too late and the engine was eventually dropped.

The three-speed [[Turbo Hydra-Matic]] [[automatic transmission]] was standard equipment from 1979 to 1981 and replaced by the four-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic 325-4L overdrive unit from 1982 to 1985. The 307&amp;nbsp;cubic-inch V8 (a smaller-displacement version of the 350 Rocket), was standard on 1985 Toronados.

[[independent suspension|Independent rear suspension]] (designed by [[Cadillac]] engineers) was adopted for the new car, which helped to increase usable rear-seat and trunk space in the smaller body, as well as improved handling over previous Toronados with no sacrifice in ride quality. Rear disc brakes were optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World Cars 1982|publisher=Herald Books|isbn=0-910714-14-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the base Toronado Brougham, various trim packages were available under the XSC (1980–81) and Caliente (1984–85) names were offered along with choices of velour, leather upholstery, even sueded leather inserts and digital instrumentation. The XSC offered individual front bucket seats,  as opposed to the traditional split bench front seat usually installed. The third-generation of the Toronado was also made into a convertible by the American Sunroof Company, with a power-operated cloth top. Reclining backrests were an option.&lt;ref name="World Cars 1985"/&gt;

This Toronado, along with its Riviera and Eldorado cousins, were the last body-on-frame, front wheel drive cars with longitudinally mounted V8 engines.

The final generation Toronado made its debut in 1985 for the 1986 model year. It was even smaller on the outside, lost its body-on-frame construction in favor of a [[unibody]] platform, and was the first Toronado since 1969 to feature hidden headlights (while both the Riviera and Eldorado/Seville kept exposed headlights). For the first time ever V8 engines were gone, with the fuel-injected version of the [[Buick V6 engine|Buick 231&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in (3.8&amp;nbsp;L) V6]] now the only powerplant available.  The new Toronado also came with a nearly 16% price increase over the 1985 model.

Inside, a new digital instrument panel and optional voice alert system were employed and the same luxury features were offered as standard equipment and options as before. Standard seating was a cloth 60/40 bench with center armrest. For the first time since 1970, Strato bucket seats were offered as an option, and they included a full-length center console with a horseshoe-like "basket handle" gear shift similar to that found in some 1960s and 1970s Buicks and Chevrolets. Upholstery choices included cloth or leather.

GM's timing with this latest downsizing proved to be off the mark. Gasoline prices had dropped dramatically — below $1.00 per gallon in many parts of the U.S. — by the fall of 1985, against corporate soothsayers' predictions of $3.00 and up. As a result, buyers chose to "buy big" in 1986, with cars like the [[Lincoln Town Car]] and Chrysler's long-in-the-tooth, V8-powered [[Chrysler Fifth Avenue|Fifth Avenue]] setting sales records for the 1986 model year. Along with its shrunken sisters, the Eldorado and Riviera, the Toronado suffered a serious sales decline which would never be reversed. Critics blamed the downsizing, as well as "cookie cutter" styling that looked too much like the cheaper, less-luxurious compacts at GM, notably the [[Oldsmobile Calais]], [[Buick Somerset]], and [[Pontiac Grand Am]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=123&amp;v=IgfkIiqIOOs |title=1990 Oldsmobile Toronado Trofeo |location=US |via=YouTube |access-date=2019-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=1990 redesigned Oldsmobile Toronado loses lopped off stying that differentiates it from other GM Coupes |first=John |last=Davis |magazine=Motor week}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OldsmobileTrofeo.jpg|thumb|left|Oldsmobile Toronado ''Troféo'']]

In mid-1987, Oldsmobile attempted to bolster sagging Toronado sales by introducing a sportier model called the '''Troféo''', which boasted standard leather bucket seats, faux dual exhaust, more-aggressive styling, and a stiffer suspension (the highly regarded corporate FE3 package, with retuned shocks, struts and other components).

For 1988, changes for the Troféo included new seats and monochromatic paint; both Toronado and Troféo benefited from larger climate control buttons and rear three-point seatbelts. Additionally, power increased with the introduction of the new [[Buick V6 engine#LN3 Naturally Aspirated|Buick {{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} LN3]] V6 engine. Wire wheelcovers were deleted from the options sheet. Other changes were minor and mainly cosmetic.

The 1989 Troféo, which was no longer badged externally as a Toronado, could be ordered with the Visual Information Center: a dash mounted touchscreen [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] that controlled the vehicle's thermostat and radio and also supplied advanced instrumentation such as a [[trip computer]]. The following is a link to pictures of various CRT screens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v366/Toronado3800/Autos/1989%20Toronado%20Trofeo/ |title=1989 Toronado Trofeo pictures by Toronado3800 - Photobucket |publisher=Smg.photobucket.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The VIC could also serve as the interface to an in-car hands-free cell phone. Troféo also received standard [[anti-lock brakes]] and a new steering wheel with controls for radio and climate control. Toronados now had standard bucket seats with console or an optional split-bench.

For 1990, the hood was the only carryover sheet metal as Olds designers redesigned the body, increasing the overall length by about {{convert|12|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, enlarging the trunk. A drivers-side airbag was standard equipment. The 1991 models made remote keyless entry and anti-lock brakes standard, increased horsepower, with an optional ultrasuede upholstery. The optional moonroof no longer required ordering bucket seats, however, a fully digital instrument cluster was now only available on Toronado models equipped with a front bench seat. 

[[File:KGrHqFk0E3Gzey500BNyFu4jH 3 (1).jpg|thumb|left|Oldsmobile CRT]]
Also for 1990, a new CRT [[touchscreen]] control center became an option for Trofeo models that integrated basic vehicle controls (climate controls and vehicle settings) and audio system settings, and also included a built-in "navigation system" (directional compass and trip computer). The system could also integrate an optional integrated [[cellular phone]] that was mounted in the vehicle's center console. In 1992, [[General Motors]] (GM) and [[Avis Rent a Car]] pilot tested a GPS navigation system in select rental Trofeo models equipped with the [[touchscreen]] at the [[Orlando International Airport]] in [[Florida]]. The pilot systems included the built-in [[cellular phone]] and a computer-synthesized voice guidance system. Named "TravTek", the system was monitored by [[American Automobile Association|AAA]] via an antenna mounted on the car's trunk, and included directions to AAA locations around the [[Orlando]] area. A similar system utilizing a separate color display screen later became a dealer-installed option on 1995 [[Oldsmobile]] models. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outrightolds.com/index.php/spotlight-on/early-gps-systems |title=Early GPS Systems |work=Outright Olds |location=US |access-date=2019-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGrxur7dMh8 |title=TravTek Navigation System of the Future (circa 1992) |first=Tracey |last=Curro |location=Australia |via=YouTube |access-date=2019-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1992 Oldsmobile Toronado.jpg|thumb|right|1992 Oldsmobile Toronado]]

The 1992 models brought back wire wheels as an option. Troféos got a stiffer standard suspension (the formerly optional FE3 package). By this time, the trend away from personal luxury coupes was too strong to counter.  Oldsmobile discontinued the Toronado and Troféo at the end of the 1992 model year, with the last Toronado rolling off the assembly line on May 28, 1992. The Toronado and Trofeo were ultimately replaced in the lineup in early 1994 by the [[Oldsmobile Aurora|Aurora]] sports sedan, which made its debut as a 1995 model and shared its platform with the eighth and final generation of the [[Buick Riviera]] (which ended production in 1999).

During the late 1960s (1968–70), the only Oldsmobile professionally made into a limousine was the Toronado, known as the AQC Jetway 707.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coachbuilt.com/bui/a/aqc/aqc.htm |title=American Quality Coach |work=Coachbuilt |first=Mark |last=Theobald |year=2004 |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 707 rode on six wheels.

===67 X===
The '''67 X''' (also '''Toronado 67X''', '''Esso 67X''') is a [[Canada|Canadian]]-built automobile, based on the Toronado, that was designed and manufactured by automobile customizer [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]] for Canada's [[Expo 67]], where they were [[raffle]]d off in a contest sponsored by [[Imperial Oil|Esso]]. Only four of these vehicles were ever made, but they included swiveling seats, a sofa, and even a refrigeration unit, with an overall sleek-looking design. Commercials for this vehicle were aired in the [[1967 Stanley Cup playoffs|Stanley Cup Playoffs final game]] between the [[Montreal Canadiens]] and [[Toronto Maple Leafs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/theprovince/cars/story.html?id=cb7bb55d-9c23-4a97-8a18-40fa8007b60b |title=Who recalls that 'Esso' Toronado? |work=The Vancouver Province |publisher=CanWest MediaWorks Publications Inc. |date=2008-06-06 |accessdate=2013-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, one of these cars came up for auction on [[eBay]]. Although in poor condition, it was advertised as the "project car of a lifetime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=eBay Find of the Day: George Barris Oldsmobile Toronado 67X |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/04/14/ebay-find-of-the-day-george-barris-oldsmobile-toronado-67x/ |date=2009-04-14 |accessdate=2012-12-29 |first=Jonathon |last=Ramsey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gasoline-powered '''Curved Dash Oldsmobile'''&lt;ref&gt;The name comes from its curved dash or [[dashboard]], like that of a sleigh. See the photo and caption on page 130 of the ''[[Popular Science]]'' article listed under External Links below.&lt;/ref&gt; is credited as being the first [[mass-produced]] [[automobile]], meaning that it was built on an [[assembly line]] using [[interchangeable parts]]. It was introduced by the [[Oldsmobile]] company in 1901 and produced through 1907; 425 were produced the first year,{{Sfn|Posthumus|1977|p=48}}&lt;!--[[G.N. Georgano]], ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886-1930''. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985), says 400.--&gt; 2,500 in 1902, and over 19,000 were built in all.&lt;ref name=Georgano1985&gt;{{harvnb|Georgano|1985|p={{Page needed|date=October 2014}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; When General Motors assumed operations from [[Ransom E.

It was a [[runabout (car)|runabout]] model, could seat two passengers, and sold for [[USD|US$]]650. While competitive, due to high volume, and priced below the US$850 two-seat [[Ford Model C]] "Doctor's Car",{{Sfn|Clymer|1950|p=37}} it was more expensive than the [[Western Tool Works (automobile company)|Western]] 1905 Gale Model A roadster at US$500. The [[Black Motor Company|Black]] sold for $375,{{Sfn|Clymer|1950|p=61}} and the [[Success Automobile Manufacturing Company|Success]] for US$250.{{Sfn|Clymer|1950|p=32}}

The flat-mounted, [[water-cooled]], single-cylinder engine, situated at the center of the car, produced {{convert|5|hp|kW|abbr=on}},{{Sfn|Rogliatti|1973|pp=270–271}} relying on a brass [[gravity feed]] [[carburetor]]. The transmission was a semiautomatic design with two forward speeds and one reverse. The low-speed forward and reverse gear system is a [[planetary gear|planetary]] type (epicyclic). The car weighed {{Convert|850|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and used Concord springs.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} It had a top speed of {{Convert|20|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.{{Sfn|Sedgwick|1962|p=36}}

The car's success was partially by accident; in 1901, a fire destroyed a number of other models before they could be approved for production, leaving the Curved Dash as the only one intact.{{Sfn|Wright|2000}}

The '''Vista Cruiser''' is a [[station wagon]] manufactured and marketed by [[Oldsmobile]] over three generations from 1964 to 1977.  

The first and second generation Vista Cruisers are noted for their fixed-glass, roof-mounted [[skylight]]s over the second-row seating with sun visors for the second row passengers, a raised roof behind the skylight and lateral glass panels over the rear cargo area along the raised roof, and three rows of forward-facing passenger seating. 

Sharing its bodystyle with the [[Buick Sport Wagon]], the Vista Cruiser was introduced on February 4, 1964, as a 1964 model, based on the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]]/F-85 model.  Prior to the 1973 model year the Vista Cruiser utilized a wheelbase which was {{Convert|5|in|mm|0}} longer than that of the Cutlass/F-85 sedan.

Subsequent Oldsmobile mid-size wagons featured a skylight as did the 1991–92 full-size [[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]] wagon and the 1991–96 [[Buick Roadmaster]] wagon. 

Reminiscent of earlier models, the third generation Vista Cruiser (1973–1977) featured optional rear-facing third row seating, while incorporating a single flat venting moonroof over the front row seating.

GM's 1971–76 full-size [[clamshell wagons]], including the [[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]], incorporated an optional forward-facing third row and a slightly elevated roof over the cargo area, though no skylight.

The first-generation Vista Cruiser pioneered a raised roof with split skylight that began over the second-row seating, with lateral glass panels over the rear cargo area.  Sun visors for second row passengers, with a third row of forward-facing passenger seating available as an option.

In 1964, the Vista Cruiser was one of three station wagons offered by Oldsmobile, the others being the F-85 built on the same wheelbase as other F-85/Cutlass intermediates and the full-sized [[Oldsmobile 88|Dynamic 88]] Fiesta.

[[File:1966 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser (5279667972).jpg|thumb|left|1966 Vista Cruiser displaying raised rear roofline]]
From 1965 to 1970 Oldsmobile dropped the full-sized [[Oldsmobile 88|88]] wagon, making the Vista Cruiser the division's largest; the shorter-wheelbase F-85/Cutlass wagon remained the entry-level offering.

Engines in the Vista Cruiser paralleled other Olds intermediates, with a {{convert|330|cuin|cc|0|adj=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]] offered from 1964 to 1967 producing from {{convert|210|to|320|hp|kW}} depending on year and carburetion.

Transmission included the two-speed [[Super Turbine 300|Jetaway]] [[automatic transmission]] and two rarely equipped manual transmissions, a three-speed column shift and a four-speed floor shift.

A major restyling of the GM A-body car line for 1968 replaced the split skylight with a one-piece unit, and stretched the wheelbase 1" to {{convert|121|in|mm|sigfig=4|abbr=on}}.

From 1968 to 1972, a {{convert|350|cuin|cc L|adj=on}} V8 became standard, with a high-output {{convert|400|cuin|cc L|adj=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]] from the [[Oldsmobile 442|442]] muscle car optional in 1968-69, and a {{convert|455|cuin|cc L|adj=on}} V8  available from 1970 to 1972.

Transmission offerings through the years included one of two [[Automatic transmission|automatics]]—the two-speed [[Super Turbine 300|Jetaway]] (1968) or three-speed [[Turbo Hydramatic]] (1968–72), or very rarely, a standard three-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] with column shift or optional four-speed manual with floor-mounted Hurst shifter.

In 1969, the "Dual-Action" tailgate was introduced as an option on two-row models and standard equipment on three-row.

[[File:'72 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser (Les chauds vendredis '14).JPG|thumb|left|1972 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser]]
In 1970, an exterior redesign sharpened edges and curves.  Although it closely resembled the 1968-69 models, and is essentially regarded a second-generation car (The GM Skywagon Club recognizes the 1970-72 models as "Generation 2a"), many body parts were no longer interchangeable.  The dashboard was also completely redesigned.  

For 1971, Oldsmobile brought back the Custom Cruiser wagon on the full-sized [[Oldsmobile 98|98]] [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] chassis, featuring GM's disappearing clamshell tailgate, but the glass-roofed Vista Cruiser continued until 1972.

A small number of 1972 Vista Cruisers were modified by [[Hurst Performance]] for support car duties at the 1972 [[Indianapolis 500]], joining the 1972 Hurst/Olds official pace car.  Both were equipped with {{convert|455|cuin|cc L|adj=on}} Rocket V8.  Two modified Vista Cruisers are known to survive as of 2012, a press car and a medical director's car.  As of 2012, the medical director's car is owned by a relative of [[Ray Harroun]], the winner of the first Indianapolis 500 in 1911.

For 1973, the GM A-body intermediate platform was completely redesigned and the separate wheelbase used by the Vista Cruiser and Buick Sport Wagon eliminated; all A-body wagons were now built on the 116-inch sedan wheelbase.  While its Buick counterpart was discontinued, the Vista Cruiser was redesigned as a woodgrained version of the new Cutlass Supreme station wagon.  Despite the shortened wheelbase, three-row seating returned, with the third row facing rearward.  

[[File:'75 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser (Auto classique VAQ Beaconsfield '13).JPG|thumb|left|1975 Vista Cruiser]]
The model's distinctive skylights gave way to "Colonnade" styling, which partially offset the loss with frameless door glass that increased side window area. A pop-up sunroof over the front seats was optional.        

A 350 cubic-inch [[Oldsmobile V8 engine|Rocket V8]] was standard, with a 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8 optional through 1976, replaced the following year by a 403 cubic-inch Rocket V8.  The three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic transmission, power steering and power front disc brakes were standard equipment on Vista Cruisers from 1973-77.

==In popular culture==

A 1969 Vista Cruiser was a key component of ''[[That 70s Show]]'', with the pilot of the series revolving around [[Red Forman]]'s decision to pass the car down to his son, [[Eric Forman]]. The car would remain a fixture through the series' eight-season run, with many key scenes occurring on or in the car. In 2016, Rod Authority named Eric's Vista Cruiser #22 on their list of the 50 greatest television automobiles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rodauthority.com/news/top-50-tv-cars-of-all-time-no-22-that-70s-show-oldsmobile-wagon/ Top 50 TV Cars of All Time]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2019 horror film ''[[The Curse of La Llorona]]'' a blue with side woody trim first generation Vista Cruiser is featured as the family's car.
 
* An early 1970s model is used when Clark Griswold ([[Chevy Chase]]) trades it in for a new car on the movie [[National Lampoon's Vacation]]

The '''Oldsmobile Achieva''' is a [[front-wheel drive]] [[compact car|compact]] sedan and coupe that was introduced by [[Oldsmobile]] for the 1992 [[model year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/overview.aspx?year=1997&amp;make=Oldsmobile&amp;model=Achieva&amp;trimid=-1 |title=1997 Oldsmobile Achieva Detailed Pricing and Specifications |publisher=Autos.msn.com |date=2010-02-22 |accessdate=2010-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927011344/http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/overview.aspx?year=1997&amp;make=Oldsmobile&amp;model=Achieva&amp;trimid=-1 |archive-date=2011-09-27 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Achieva was based on the [[GM N platform|GM N-body platform]], which it also shared with its siblings the [[Pontiac Grand Am]] and [[Buick Skylark]]. The Achieva replaced the GM N-body [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais|Cutlass Calais]] after its final 1991 model year, and ended production after the 1998 model year.

==Overview==
The Achieva was a compact car produced by the [[General Motors|General Motors']] [[Oldsmobile]] division from 1991 to 1998 and was available as a [[sedan (car)|sedan]] or [[coupe]]. It was offered in four different trim levels during its production run: S, SC, SL, and SCX. Available engines included different versions of the Oldsmobile-developed 2.3&amp;nbsp;L [[GM Quad-4 engine|Quad 4]]: the base single-cam L40 "Quad OHC", the [[DOHC]] LD2, the high-output LG0, and the special "W41" variant of the LG0 Quad 4 used in the SCX model. All were replaced for 1996 by a revised 2.4&amp;nbsp;L version. A pair of V6 engines were also offered including the Buick-sourced 90° 3.3&amp;nbsp;L [[Buick V6 engine#3300 .28LG7.29|"3300"]] V6, which was later replaced by Chevrolet's 60° 3.1&amp;nbsp;L [[General Motors 60° V6 engine#3.1L.2F3100|"3100"]] [[V6]]. While a five-speed manual [[transaxle]] was initially offered as the standard base [[Manual transmission|transmission]], most Achieva models were sold with three-speed or four-speed automatic transaxles. The Achieva was last sold as model year 1998, after which it was replaced in the Oldsmobile lineup by the [[Oldsmobile Alero|Alero]] for the 1999 model year.

==Initial production==
[[File:Oldsmobile-Achieva-coupe.jpg|left|thumb|Achieva SC coupe (with aftermarket wheel covers)]]

The Achieva was first seen as a concept car at the 1991 [[Chicago Auto Show]], positioned to replace Oldsmobile's compact [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais|Calais]] models. The Calais and Achieva share the same front wheel drive [[GM N platform|N-body]] architecture including identical [[wheelbase]]. The Achieva started regular production for the 1992 model year. It was offered in four different trim levels: S and SL, available on both coupes and sedans, and the sporty SC and SCX coupes. The base S offered a {{convert|120|hp|lk=on|abbr=on}} 2.3&amp;nbsp;L "Quad OHC" 4-cylinder, while the SL had the DOHC {{convert|160|hp}} [[GM Quad-4 engine|Quad 4]] engine standard that was optional on the S model. A {{convert|160|hp|abbr=on}} 3.3&amp;nbsp;L V6 engine was optional for the SL. The SC coupe had a standard {{convert|180|hp|abbr=on}} high-output Quad 4 with 5-speed [[manual transmission]] or a 3 speed automatic, with the 3.3&amp;nbsp;L V6 being an option.

==SCX==
The W41 coupe was introduced by Oldsmobile in 1991 on the Cutlass Calais and offered through 1993 on the Achieva. The Achieva SCX replaced the previous Cutlass Calais [[Oldsmobile_442#1990–1991|442 W41]] as the best handling, highest power output compact car in the Oldsmobile's lineup as well as being the last performance "W-Machine" Oldsmobile would offer. The SCX is a higher-performance version of the SC (sports coupe) and as such utilized the SC's deeper front bumper cover with standard fog lamps, lower body side cladding, rear bumper cover with dual exhaust tip cut-outs, as well as a unique W41-specific silver colored stripe around the lower body moldings, "W41" decals on the front fenders, and "Achieva SCX" decals at the leading edges of the doors. Other appearance changes for the SCX W41 package included the addition of a 140&amp;nbsp;mph speedometer in place of the standard 120&amp;nbsp;mph unit as well as a tachometer indicating the higher 7200 rpm red line.
[[File:1992 Oldsmobile SCX W41.jpg|thumb|250px|1992 Oldsmobile Achieva SCX coupe]]

Performance modifications primarily differentiated the SCX from the SC models and were designed to make the SCX competitive for use in [[Showroom stock racing|showroom stock]] racing series such as the [[International Motor Sports Association#IMSA Showroom Stock|IMSA]] Firehawk and [[SCCA World Challenge|SCCA GRAND-AM World Challenge]]. This included the move to smaller diameter yet wider [[Tire speed ratings#Speed rating|V-rated]] P215/60VR14 BF Goodrich Comp T/A tires on 14x6.5&amp;nbsp;inch cast aluminum wheels (compared to the SC's 205/55R16 on 16x6 inch wheels) and different suspension components on the SCX-specific FX3 [[Regular Production Option|RPO]] coded suspension. The suspension changes included larger diameter direct-acting front [[sway bar]] over the base Achieva, a wider rear axle with dual rear sway bars, "[[Computer Command Ride]]" (CCR) electronically adjustable struts and shock absorbers, as well as higher spring rates and bushing changes. (A similar CCR electronic suspension was also offered as an option on the Achieva SC as well as the platform-mate Buick Skylark and works similar to the systems offered on Cadillac and [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]] models of the time.)

The SCX's powertrain included the highest output naturally aspirated [[Straight-4|four-cylinder engine]] GM had produced up to that time: the 190 horsepower, 160&amp;nbsp;lb·ft [[GM Quad-4 engine#W41|W41]] version of Oldsmobile's Quad 4 engine. Compared to the SC's standard high-output, 180 horsepower LGO Quad 4, the W41 version of the LGO Quad 4 was fitted with different [[camshafts]], a low restriction exhaust system with dual mufflers and a special engine computer [[Engine Control Unit|calibration]] for the ignition and fuel systems that also raised the engine's [[redline]] to 7200&amp;nbsp;rpm. This engine was complemented by a unique version of the [[Getrag]]-licensed, GM-Muncie built [[Getrag 282 transmission|Getrag 282]] five-speed transmission with special second and fifth gears as well as a different final drive ratio for quicker acceleration and better gearing to keep the engine in its power band.

The production numbers for the Achieva SCX in 1992 totaled 1146 cars made with (6) C41 RPO code A/C-delete racing models as follows: (1) bright red, (2) medium garnet red, (1) aqua, (1) blue, and (1) white cars. The normal C60 RPO code models included (472) bright red, (42) medium garnet red, (218) black, (196) aqua, (50) neon blue, (151) white, and (11) gray cars.

The 1993 SCX production totaled 500 cars produced including (5) C41 RPO code A/C-delete racing models as follows: (1) bright red, (1) aqua, and (3) white cars. The normal C60 RPO code models included (128) black, (191) bright red, (20) medium garnet red, (73) aqua, (8) neon blue, (70) white, and (5) majestic pearl cars.

==Production changes==
For the second year of production, all 1993 Achieva models saw a reduction in power across the engine lineup due to changes made to comply with stricter emission requirements. This resulted in all engine outputs being {{convert|5|hp}} lower for 1993, including the SCX which was down to 185&amp;nbsp;hp for its final year (primarily due to exhaust port changes to the cylinder head). Other changes for 1993 included a revised front engine mount and changes to the Quad 4 block casting to address criticism for that engine's [[Noise, vibration, and harshness|NVH]] characteristics. For 1994, a driver-side airbag was added as a standard feature,&lt;ref name=MT1994&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Long-Term Wrap Up: 1994 Oldsmobile Achieva |last=Bartlett |first=Jeff |date=September 2, 1995 |work=Motor Trend |url=https://www.motortrend.com/cars/oldsmobile/achieva/1994/1994-oldsmobile-achieva/ |accessdate=August 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Buick-developed 3.3&amp;nbsp;L [[Buick V6 engine#3300 .28LG7.29|"3300"]] V6 was replaced by a Chevrolet-designed 3.1&amp;nbsp;L [[General Motors 60° V6 engine#3.1L.2F3100|"3100"]] V6.

In 1995, trim levels were reduced to one: SC coupe and SL sedan, divided into two groups, Series I and Series II according to equipment. The Quad 4 with {{convert|150|hp}} and 3.1&amp;nbsp;liter V6 with {{convert|155|hp}} were the only available engines for 1995; the other two engines from the previous year were dropped.

The 1996 models added more standard features, include standard air conditioning and daytime running lamps, and a new dashboard featuring revised gauges and a passenger-side airbag. A Series III equipment level was added while the Series I was now only available on the coupe. The new base engine was a 2.4&amp;nbsp;liter four-cylinder "Twin Cam" that replaced the 2.3&amp;nbsp;L Quad 4. There were little changes other than reduced trim levels and options for the final two model years.

The final model year for the Achieva was 1998, with the majority of sales going to [[Fleet vehicles|fleet]] customers. The Achieva was complemented at the end of its production run by the slightly larger [[Oldsmobile Cutlass#Sixth|Cutlass]] which overlapped Achieva production from 1997 to 1999. Both models were replaced in the Oldsmobile lineup by the [[Oldsmobile Alero|Alero]] for 1999. The Cutlass and Alero were built on a redesigned [[GM_N_platform#2nd generation GMX130|GMX130]] N-body platform that shared little chassis and platform architecture with the Achieva.

Achieva production ended on December 4, 1997.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Motorsport==

The Achieva won the touring car championship of the [[SCCA World Challenge]] from 1992-1994. As of 2011, Oldsmobile is the only GM division to accomplish this feat and only one of two American brands (along with AMC).

The '''Oldsmobile Starfire''' is an automobile [[Car model|nameplate]] used by [[Oldsmobile]], produced in three non-contiguous generations beginning in 1954. The Starfire nameplate made its debut with the 1954–1956 [[Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight|Ninety-Eight]] series [[convertible (car)|convertible]]s. For 1957 only, all Ninety-Eight series models were named "Starfire 98".&lt;ref name="flory 50s"&gt;{{cite book |last=Flory |first=J. "Kelly" Jr. |title=American Cars, 1946 to 1959; Every Model, Year by Year |year=2008 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers |ISBN=978-0-7864-3229-5 |page=833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a two-year hiatus the Starfire name returned for 1961 as separate model offered in a single convertible [[body style]]. Intended to compete in the growing [[personal luxury car]] market, from 1961 to 1965 the Starfire Convertible was the highest-priced model offered by Oldsmobile. While it shared most of its sheet metal with other full-sized Oldsmobile models, the Starfire wore unique trim and luxurious interiors. The Starfire Coupe hardtop joined the convertible for the 1962 model year. For the final 1966 model year, the convertible was dropped and the Starfire was moved downmarket to make room for the all-new [[Oldsmobile Toronado]].

After a nine-year break, the Starfire nameplate returned for the 1975 model year as Oldsmobile's first [[subcompact car|subcompact]], powered by a [[Buick]] V6 engine. The 1977 Starfire featured the first-ever Oldsmobile four-cylinder engine as standard equipment, with a V6 and V8 optional. Production ceased in 1980.

=== Concept car (1953) ===
[[File:1953 Olds Starfire Show car.jpg|thumb|1953 Oldsmobile Starfire show car at the [[General Motors Motorama#1953|GM Motorama]], [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel|Waldorf Astoria]]]]

The Starfire name was first used by Oldsmobile on a one-of-a-kind [[Concept car|dream car]] that was shown at the 1953 Motorama auto show. Named after the [[Lockheed F-94 Starfire]] jet fighter, the original Starfire was a 5-passenger [[convertible (car)|convertible]] that had a [[fiberglass]] body, a {{Convert|200|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} Rocket [[V8 engine|V8]] engine, and a wraparound windshield like that used on the top-of-the-line and limited-production 1953 Fiesta 98 convertible.

=== 98 Starfire (1954–1956) ===
[[File:Oldsmobile Starfire 1955.jpg|thumb|1955 Oldsmobile 98 Starfire]]
The name was then used for the 1954–1956 model years to designate the convertible models of the [[Oldsmobile 98|98]] line in much the same way that the Holiday name was used to designate hardtop body-styles. The 1954–1956 Oldsmobile 98 Starfire convertibles were the most expensive Oldsmobiles offered during those years. During the 1957 model year, all 98 models were referred to as being '''Starfire 98s'''. The name was dropped from the 98 series beginning with the 1958 model year.

===1961===
[[File:1961 Oldsmobile Starfire convertible rear right.jpg|thumb|left|1961 Oldsmobile Starfire, rear view]]
Introduced in January 1961 as a convertible, the Starfire was separated into its own model line and shared its body and wheelbase with the Super 88 and the lower-priced Dynamic 88. It was loaded with standard equipment including leather [[bucket seats]], center console with [[tachometer]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1946"&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975|publisher=krause publications|isbn=0-87341-027-0|editor=Gunnell, John A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and floor shifter for the Hydra-matic transmission, and was the first U.S. full-sized production car to feature an automatic transmission with a console-mounted floor shifter, brushed aluminum side panels and power steering, brakes, windows and driver's seat.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1961%20Oldsmobile/album_003/1961%20Oldsmobile%20Starfire-06.html&lt;/ref&gt; With a base price of $4,647 in 1961, it was the most expensive Oldsmobile, even more than the larger Ninety-Eight models. The standard 394 cubic inch V-8 Skyrocket V8 engine - Oldsmobile's most powerful in 1961 - used a 4-barrel Rochester carburetor and generated {{Convert|330|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4600 rpm. Sales of the 1961 model were 1,500.

===1962===
[[File:1962 Oldsmobile Starfire (10753850395).jpg|thumb|left|1962 Oldsmobile Starfire Coupe]]
For the 1962 model year, the convertible was joined by a two-door [[hardtop]], which featured a new convertible-styled roofline shared with other Oldsmobile 88 coupes. Horsepower was increased to {{convert|345|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.
1962 was the best sales year for this generation Starfire, with sales of the hardtop coupe being 34,839 and sales of the convertible being 7,149.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960-1972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), p.183.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1963===
[[File:63 Oldsmobile Starfire (9130153559).jpg|thumb|left|1963 Oldsmobile Starfire Coupe]]
Styling changes for the 1963 model year included a move away from the sculpted sides of the previous years model, to a flatter, more conventional look with an exclusive squared off roofline that included a concave rear window. Sales of the coupe were down to 21,489 and the convertible was down to 4,401,&lt;ref name="Flory, p.249"&gt;Flory, p.249.&lt;/ref&gt; a drop of 38%,&lt;ref name="Flory, p.249"/&gt; probably due to intense competition from Buick's all-new Riviera, which was in the same price range as the Starfire but had its own unique bodyshell.  The Pontiac Grand Prix was also restyled for 1963 with a similar squared-off roof, which no doubt stole some sales from Oldsmobile showrooms.

===1964===
[[File:1964 Oldsmobile Starfire (29130773668).jpg|thumb|left|1964 Oldsmobile Starfire Holiday coupe]]
The 1964 model appeared very similar to the 1963. Curb weight was down, but overall length was up to {{convert|215.3|in|mm|1}}. Sales dropped further, to 13,753 coupes (down 36%) and 2,410 convertibles (down 45%).&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p.318.&lt;/ref&gt; The Starfire now shared its basic bodyshell with the new and lower-priced '''[[Oldsmobile Jetstar I|Jetstar&amp;nbsp;I]]''' hardtop coupe which competed directly against the [[Pontiac Grand Prix]]. The Jetstar also used the Starfire's {{Convert|345|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{Convert|394|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} "Ultra High Compression" Rocket V8, but had a pricetag that was over $500&lt;ref&gt;Flory, pp.316 &amp; 318.&lt;/ref&gt; lower than the Starfire due to the use of a vinyl bucket seat interior and the fact that many Starfire standard features were optional on the Jetstar including Hydra-Matic transmission, power steering and brakes. Front seat belts were now standard.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1964%20Oldsmobile/1964_Oldsmobile_Prestige_Brochure/1964%20Oldsmobile%20Prestige-34-35.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===1965===
[[File:1965 Oldsmobile Starfire (29451224483).jpg|thumb|1965 Oldsmobile Starfire Coupe]]
[[File:1965 Oldsmobile Starfire (28864344465).jpg|thumb|Exhausts exiting through the rear fender were a distinctive design feature of the 1965 Starfire]]
For the 1965 model year, all Oldsmobiles would receive new styling, and the Starfire Coupe would receive a modified version of the 1963–1964 unique roofline with an inversely curved rear window. The Hardtop Sports Coupe body-style was again shared with the Jetstar I. Other 88 models adopted a Holiday Hardtop Coupe body-style that featured more of a fastback roof design, while the Ninety-Eight featured a more squared-off formal roof-line.
A new version of the Rocket V8 engine was offered for the 1965 model year, this one measuring {{Convert|425|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} displacement, still using a [[Rochester Products Division|Rochester]] 4-barrel carburetor, and generating {{Convert|375|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4800 rpm. This was still the most powerful engine in the Oldsmobile lineup and used only in the Starfire and the Jetstar I. Also new for 1965 was the three-speed [[Turbo Hydra-Matic]] [[automatic transmission]] which replaced the previous fluid-coupling Hydra-Matic used by Oldsmobile since 1940. Added to the option list for the first time on Starfires and other [[B-body]] cars was a four-speed manual transmission with [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] shifter that was rarely ordered.

1965 sales were 13,024 for the coupe and 2,236 for the convertible.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p.389.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1966===
In 1966 the all-new, [[front-wheel drive]] [[Oldsmobile Toronado|Toronado]] took the crown from the Starfire as Oldsmobile's premier personal luxury car and most expensive model. Only the Starfire Coupe was offered, as the convertible was discontinued for this final year for the nameplate as a full-sized sporty/luxury coupe. The Starfire was moved downmarket and priced like the former Jetstar&amp;nbsp;I. Equipment level dropped considerably from previous years, with a less plush interior thanks to the leather seats being replaced by Morroceen vinyl for both the Strato bucket seats or no-cost optional notchback bench seat, and no longer standard power windows and power seats. The Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission, power steering and power brakes also went to the optional equipment list; all were standard on Toronado. While the 425 cu.in. V8 still produced {{convert|375|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}, the Starfire no longer had the most powerful engine offered for sale in an Oldsmobile. Here the Starfire was again upstaged by the Toronado, which had a similar engine offering {{convert|385|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}. Sales of the 1966 Starfire Coupe were 13,019.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p.467.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1967 Oldsmobile Delta 88 coupe rear.jpg|thumb|left|The 1967 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Custom Holiday Coupe carried on the Starfire's legacy]]
===End of the line===
For 1967 the Starfire was discontinued, and in its place Oldsmobile offered a new upmarket version of the [[Oldsmobile Delta 88|Delta 88]], the Delta 88 Custom. At a $3522 base price,&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p.542.&lt;/ref&gt; nearly unchanged from the 1966 Starfire, it had similar interior trimmings and even carried the trademark brushed side trim with faux vents on the front fender. The two-door Holiday Coupe hardtop was complemented by a four-door Holiday Sedan, with the notchback bench seat. Later full-sized Oldsmobile coupes to carry on the Starfire tradition included the 1969–1970 Delta 88 Royale and 1978–1981 Delta 88 Holiday Coupe.

The second generation Oldsmobile Starfire is a [[subcompact]] four-passenger automobile which was introduced in September 1974, and produced for the 1975 through 1980 model years. 
The Starfire was Oldsmobile's entry-level product and a [[badge engineered]] version of the [[Chevrolet Monza]], which was based on the [[Chevrolet Vega]]. The Starfire was virtually identical to the Monza other than Oldsmobile specific badges and the grille design. &lt;ref&gt;h-body.org&lt;/ref&gt; It would be the smallest car bearing the [[Oldsmobile]] name since before [[World War II]]. An upgraded SX model was available, and the GT was introduced in mid-1975.&lt;ref&gt;1975 Starfire brochure&lt;/ref&gt;

The Starfire has a {{convert|97.0|in|mm|adj=on}} [[wheelbase]] and a {{convert|65.4|in|mm|adj=on}} width.
The Starfire, [[Chevrolet Monza]], [[Buick Skyhawk]] and [[Pontiac Sunbird]] were among the first vehicles to adopt the newly approved quad rectangular headlamps. The [[body style]] is noted for having a resemblance to the [[Ferrari 365 GTC/4]]. Starfire's standard engine for 1975-76 model years was the Buick [[Buick V6 engine#231|231]] cid V6 engine using a 2-barrel carburetor that generates {{Convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4000.

The front suspension is short and long control arms with [[coil springs]], and [[anti-roll bar]]; the rear suspension is a torque-arm design with coil springs and an anti-roll bar. The second generation Starfire is a [[rear-wheel-drive]] vehicle with a [[live axle|live rear axle]] design. Variable-ratio [[power steering]] was standard of a [[recirculating ball]] type. The brake system features standard power assist including front [[disc brakes]] with solid rotors, and rear drum brakes.  This was the first GM product to incorporate a torque arm rear suspension (rear coil springs with 2 links) - its design was later incorporated into GM's third and fourth generation F-bodies ([[Chevrolet Camaro (fourth generation)|Camaro]] and [[Pontiac Firebird|Firebird]]).

1976 models could be had with the new optional Borg-Warner 5-speed manual with overdrive transmission. Starting with the 1976 models the front disc rotors were of the vented type.&lt;ref&gt;1976 Starfire brochure&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 1977 model year, the front end was revised with a split grille design with vertical slots similar to the previous year's Cutlass base models. The 140 CID (2.3-liter) aluminum-block inline 4-cylinder engine with 2-barrel carburetor became standard, while the [[Buick V6 engine#231|Buick 231 cid]] (3.8-liter) [[V6]] became optional on the base model. The GT package included the V6 engine. The [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#305|Chevrolet 305]] (5.0-liter) [[V8 engine]] option was added later in the year. The Vega 140 CID aluminum-block L4 was discontinued at the end of the 1977 model year&lt;ref&gt;1977 Starfire brochure&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1978 standard engine was Pontiac's 151 CID (2.5-liter) [[GM Iron Duke engine|Iron Duke]] [[Inline-four engine|inline 4-cylinder engine]] with a 2-barrel carburetor, generating {{Convert|85|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4400 rpm. Late in the year, Oldsmobile added the '''Starfire Firenza''' package which included special rallye suspension, a front air dam, rear spoiler, flared wheel openings taking the width to 67 in, sport wheels and special paint and trim.&lt;ref&gt;1978 Starfire brochure&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1979 model year saw a face lift, with twin rectangular headlamps replacing the previous quad rectangular headlamp design. The rear end was revised with a blunt rear body panel containing new taillamps and the license plate mounted above a conventional rear bumper. 
The V8 engine option was dropped at the end of the 1979 model year, as was the 5-speed [[manual transmission]].&lt;ref&gt;1979 Starfire brochure&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1980 model year was the last one for the Starfire and its derivatives. Production ceased December 21, 1979, as Oldsmobile traded H-body production to Chevrolet and Pontiac in exchange for a higher allotment of new FWD X-bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 1980 |year=1980 |publisher=Ward's Communications, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rear-wheel-drive H-body cars including the Starfire were replaced in the spring of 1981 with the new front-wheel drive [[GM J platform|J-cars]] designated as early 1982 models, including the [[Oldsmobile Firenza]].

A total 125,188 H-body Starfires were produced in six model years.&lt;ref&gt;H-Body.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oldsmobile Calais''' is a [[compact car]] that was manufactured and marketed by [[Oldsmobile]] from 1985 through 1991, superseding the [[Oldsmobile Omega]] and named after the city of [[Calais]], [[France]]. Renamed the '''Cutlass Calais''' for 1988, and briefly available in 1987 as the limited edition '''GMO Quad 4''', the Calais shared the [[GM N platform]] with the [[Pontiac Grand Am]] and the [[Buick Skylark]]/[[Buick Somerset]] &amp;mdash; and was superseded by the [[Oldsmobile Achieva]] in 1992. The Calais was selected the [[Indianapolis 500]] Pace car for 1985 and was driven by actor [[James Garner]].

The first production model ([[VIN]] 1G3NT27UXFM200001), was a white Calais Supreme two-door with a gray velour interior. Equipped with an [[automatic transmission]] and the 92 horsepower, 151 CID pushrod four-cylinder engine (also known as GM's '''"Iron Duke"''' Tech-IV), this particular model was outfitted with nearly every available option, including wire wheel covers. While this [[front-wheel drive]] car is maintained by the [[R.E. Olds Transportation Museum]] in [[Lansing, Michigan]], it was one of more than 700 vehicles that made up the '''GM Heritage Collection''' of historically significant vehicles that date back to the early 1900s. The Calais Supreme was auctioned in April, 2009, and sold for $6,820.

In 1987, the [[Quad 4 engine]] was developed and became available in a special limited edition of the Calais called the "GMO Quad 4". Early television ads touting the new engine's abilities showed video of the Calais GMO Quad 4 racing around city streets (the submodel was dropped, however the Quad 4 engine continued to be available for several years afterward). Another, later special Cutlass Calais model was the 1990 to 1991 [[Oldsmobile 4-4-2|Quad-442]]. It used a high-output version of the [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] coupled to a 5-speed [[manual transmission]]. This same High Output version was also available in the top-of-the-line Cutlass Calais International Series. 

[[File:1991 Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais Int'l Series (2d).jpg|thumb|left|1991 Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais International Series coupe]] 
The International Series was available as both a 2-door or a 4-door and featured exclusive options for the Calais range including lower front and rear facias, lower rocker extensions, and quad-tipped sport exhaust. Changes inside include thickly bolstered sport seats which feature driver-side power controls and were available in cloth with leather accents or full leather. The International Series came standard with power locks and windows with driver's side auto-down, a multifunction Driver Information Center in the center console, full gauges, cruise control, and the uplevel FE3 sport suspension. The standard engine for the International was the new-for-1990 Quad 4 H.O. although the normal Quad 4 L.O. and automatic transmission where an option. Optional equipment on the International series included keyless entry and a Delco CD player.

Previously, the Cutlass Calais nameplate was used on top-line versions of the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme|Cutlass Supreme]] [[coupé]] (differing from the Supreme only in minor trim details) from 1978 to 1984. There was also a [[Cadillac Calais]] model, sold from 1965 to 1976.

The '''Oldsmobile 98''' (spelled '''Ninety-Eight''' from 1952 to 1991, and '''Ninety Eight''' from 1992 to 1996) is the [[full-size car|full-size]] flagship model of [[Oldsmobile]] that was produced from 1940 until 1996. The name &amp;mdash; reflecting a "Series 90" fitted with an 8-cylinder engine &amp;mdash; first appeared in 1941 and was used again after American consumer automobile production resumed post-[[World War II]]. It was, as it would remain, the division's top-of-the-line model, with lesser Oldsmobiles having lower numbers such as the [[GM A platform (RWD)|A-body]] [[Oldsmobile Series 60|66 and 68]], and the [[GM B platform|B-body]] [[Oldsmobile Series 70|76 and 78]]. The Series 60 was retired in 1949, the same year the Oldsmobile 78 was replaced by the [[Oldsmobile 88|88]]. The Oldsmobile 76 was retired after 1950. This left the two remaining number-names to carry on into the 1990s as the bread and butter of the full-size Oldsmobile lineup until the Eighty Eight-based '''Regency''' replaced the 98 in 1997.

Occasionally additional nomenclature was used with the name, such as L/S and Holiday, and the 98 Regency badge would become increasingly common in the later years of the model. The 98 shared its General Motors [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] platform with [[Buick]] and [[Cadillac]].

Since it was the top-line Oldsmobile, the series had the most technologically advanced items available, such as the [[Hydramatic]] [[automatic transmission]], the [[Automatic headlight dimmer#Automatic beam switching|Autronic Eye]], an automatic headlight dimmer, and [[Twilight Sentinel]] (a feature that automatically turned the headlights on and off via a timer, as controlled by the driver), and the highest-grade interior and exterior trim.

Naming standards were in flux at Oldsmobile during the late 1930s and 1940s. From 1932 through 1938 Oldsmobile had two series: "F" and "L". Series F came with a [[straight-6]] engine and Series L came with a larger body and a [[straight-8]] engine. Series F was renamed [[Oldsmobile Series 60|Series 60]] in 1939 and Series L was replaced with the [[Oldsmobile Series 70|Series 70]] and 80, with the Series 70 and 80 being powered by the straight-6 and the straight-8 respectively. The Series 60 used the [[GM A platform (RWD)|GM A-body]] and the Series 70 and 80 used the [[GM B platform|B-body]]. In 1940 the even larger [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] was introduced to Oldsmobile and it alone was powered by the straight-8. In order to differentiate it from the previous year's Series 80 it was named '''Series 90''' (there was no Series 80 that year). The series were also given names for the first time that year with the Series 60, 70, and 90 being called the Special, Dynamic, and '''Custom Cruiser''' respectively. In 1941 both engines were offered on each series so to differentiate between the two the second digit was used to denote the number of cylinders, so the Custom Cruiser 90 was replaced with the '''Custom Cruiser 96''' and '''98'''. In 1942 Oldsmobile dropped the six cylinder Series 90 model leaving only the Custom Cruiser 98. 

The new C-body that the 1940 Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser 90 shared with [[Cadillac Series 62]], [[Buick Roadmaster]] and [[Buick Super|Super]], and the [[Pontiac Torpedo]] featured cutting-edge "[[Torpedo (car)|torpedo]]" styling. Shoulder and hip room was over {{convert|5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wider, running boards were eliminated, and the exterior was streamlined and {{convert|2|-|3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} lower. When combined with a column mounted shift lever the cars offered true six passenger comfort. These changes had clearly been influenced by the [[Cadillac Sixty Special]]. The 90 rode on a wheelbase of {{convert|124.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. A total of 43,658 90s were sold in four body styles. The rarest was the 4-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]] with only 50 being sold.

In 1941 the wheelbase was increased to {{convert|125.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. A deluxe equipment package was now offered. The top-of-the line Oldsmobile was available in three body styles on the 96 and in four body styles on the 98. Rarest of these was the 4-door convertible which was exclusive to the 98. Only 119 were sold in 1941 and this would be the only time this body style was ever offered on the 98. The other three body styles were a convertible [[coupe]], a club coupe and a 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]. This was also the only year in Oldsmobile history that a 96, a 90 series car with a six-cylinder engine, was available. [[Hydramatic]] [[automatic transmission]] was a popular option. A total of 24,726 98s and 6,677 96s were sold in 1941.

In 1942 the Custom Cruiser 98 was once again the Oldsmobile entrant into the luxury market. Gone was the single year offering of the 96. All cars in this series were powered by the straight eight engine. Also gone in this shortened model year was the ultra rare 4-door convertible. An exclusive {{convert|127.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} inch wheelbase was used in the series. A total of 6,659 98s were made before production was shut down due to the war.

Again in 1946 the Custom Cruiser 98 was the top of the Oldsmobile line. Three body styles were offered (a 4-door sedan, a 2-door Club coupe and a 2-door convertible) and all were eight cylinder powered. Technical features included electro hardened pistons, full pressure lubrication and automatic choke with fast idle mode. Standard equipment included front and rear bumper guards, vacuum booster pump, dual sun visors, cigarette lighter and plastic radiator ornament, wraparound bumpers, Deluxe instrument cluster clock, rear armrest, and foam rubber sheet cushions. Tire size was {{convert|7.00|in|mm|0|abbr=values}} by {{convert|15|in|mm|0|abbr=off}}. Available upholstery was either [[leather]], [[broadcloth]], or [[Bedford cord]]. 14,364 98s were sold in its first postwar year of production.

In 1947 the top of the line Custom Cruiser 98 again had three body styles. This was the last year for the 98 1942 prewar body. All 98s had the straight eight engine. Standard 98 equipment included safety glass, spare wheel and tire, dual horns, vacuum booster pump, cigarette lighter, and a [[starter solenoid|solenoid starter]] system. Upholstery was either custom broadcloth or leather. Standard tire size was {{convert|7.00|in|mm|0|abbr=values}} by {{convert|15|in|mm|0|abbr=off}}. An electric clock was standard in 1947.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; A record 37,140 98s were sold in 1947.

For the first time since 1940 Oldsmobile offered totally different styling during a single model year. The top of the line 1948 Oldsmobile 98 drew heavily from the Futuramic styling concept that would be used on all 1949 Oldsmobiles. Standard equipment on 98s included a solenoid starter, fender skirts, E-Z-l rearview mirror, and foam rubber seat cushions. The 98s also included front and rear bumper guards, vacuum booster pump, plastic radiator ornament, dual horns, dual sun visors, and cigarette lighter. Deluxe equipment added front and rear floor mats, Deluxe steering wheel, wheel trim rings, rear seat armrests, and hydraulic window, seat and top controls on all convertibles. Upholstery was either broadcloth or leather. The standard tire size was 6.50 x 16. With the introduction of new postwar styling Custom Cruiser 98 was renamed the '''Futuramic 98'''. The Custom Cruiser name would be revived to denote full-size Oldsmobile [[station wagon]]s in 1971. The new styling was apparently popular with a record 65,235 98s sold, exceeding the number of 90s sold in 1940 for the first time.

The following year the new styling was joined by a new engine, the now famous [[Oldsmobile V8 engine|Rocket V8]]. In February 1949, several months into the model year, General Motors introduced three highly styled "hardtop convertible" coupes, the Oldsmobile 98 '''Holiday''', the [[Cadillac Series 62]] [[Cadillac De Ville|Coupe de Ville]], and the [[Buick Roadmaster]] [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]], the first [[hardtop]] coupes ever produced. The Holiday was exclusive to the 98 series that year. Available in four special Holiday colors, as well as four two-tone combinations, it was priced the same as the convertible, and was similarly equipped, with hydraulically operated windows and seat. Only 3,006 Holidays were sold in its first year compared to 20,049 Club coupes. Total sales reached 93,478 in 1949, setting yet another record.

The 1950 Oldsmobile 98 repeated its 1948 precedent of previewing some of next years styling cues for the 88. The 98 was restyled after only two years. It was the first totally slab sided Oldsmobile and the first sedan with wraparound rear windows. A 4-door 98 [[fastback]] appeared for one year only in 1950 and was called the '''Town Sedan''', selling only 1,778 units. Standard equipment included bumper guards, dual horns, parking lamps, dome light, rubber floor mats, aluminum sill plates, foam rubber seat cushions, chrome interior trim, lined luggage compartment and counterbalanced trunk lid. Deluxe 98 equipment included rear seat armrest, Deluxe electric clock, Deluxe steering wheel and horn button, special door trim and stainless steel wheel trim rings. Upholstery choices spanned nylon fabric, striped broadcloth or leather. Standard tire size was {{convert|7.6|in|mm|0|abbr=values}} by {{convert|15|in|mm|0|abbr=off}}. In 1950, Oldsmobile stopped naming the 98 series and so from then through 1996, with the exception of 1957 when it was called the Starfire 98, and in 1961 when it was called the Classic 98, it was simply known as the Oldsmobile 98. Sales of the 98 Holiday nearly tripled to 8263, approaching the 11,989 sold of the Club coupe. Given the rapidly growing popularity of the 2-door Holiday hardtop, 1950 was the last year for the pillared Club coupe. Total sales set yet another record of 106,220.

The 98 topped the Oldsmobile line again for 1951 with Three body styles available. The 4-door sedan and convertible came only with Deluxe equipment, while the Holiday hardtop was available with either Deluxe or Standard trim. The 98 standard equipment included bumper guards, cigarette lighter, dome light, rubber floor mats, stainless steel moldings, lined trunk, illuminated ashtray, foam rubber seat cushions and extra chrome moldings. Deluxe equipment was special rear door ornament, rear center armrests, Deluxe electric clock, Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring and special chrome trim. Upholstery choices were nylon cord, nylon cloth and leather. The pillared Club coupe was no longer offered. With the only choice in a closed 2-door 98 now being the hardtop, Holiday sales nearly doubled to 17,929 units. 

From 1952 the car, which remained as the top of the line Oldsmobile, began to be called '''Ninety-Eight'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/North-America/Oldsmobile/1952-Oldsmobile/1952-Oldsmobile-Full-Line-Brochure |title=1952 Oldsmobile brochure |website=oldcarbrochures.org |accessdate=2019-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would continue until the demise of the model, with the exception of model years 1957 and 1961. The series shared the higher output 160 HP Rocket V8 with the Super 88s. Standard equipment on the three body styles included bumper guards, gray rubber floor mats front and rear, electric clock, dual horns, aluminum door sill plates, chrome gravel guards, foam rubber seat cushions, turn signals, carpeting front and rear, stainless steel wheel trim rings, windshield washer, and Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring. Upholstery selection was broadcloth or six colors of leather. Standard tire size was {{convert|8.00|in|mm|0|abbr=values}} by {{convert|15|in|mm|0|abbr=off}}. For the first time power steering was an option. Another new option was the [[Automatic headlight dimmer#Automatic beam switching|Autronic Eye]], an automatic headlight dimmer, which in its initial year was shared only with [[Cadillac]].

New in 1953, the '''Fiesta''' joined the [[Cadillac Series 62]] [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]] and [[Buick Roadmaster]] [[Buick Skylark|Skylark]] as top-of-the-line, limited-production specialty [[convertible (car)|convertible]]s introduced that year by [[General Motors]] to promote its design leadership. It featured a cut-down belt line, a wraparound windshield that was {{convert|3|in|mm|0|abbr=values}} inches lower than the standard Ninety-Eight's windshield, and special "spinner" hubcaps, which became a trademark on later Oldsmobiles. Virtually every Oldsmobile option was standard except air conditioning, regarded as unnecessary at the time in a convertible. 

Mechanically, the Fiesta had a special version of the Ninety-Eight engine which gained 5 horsepower to 170 through manifold streamlining and compression increased from 8.1:1 to 8.3:1. A four speed [[Hydramatic]] [[automatic transmission]] and faster rear axle rato were designed to keep the 4459 pound shipping weight Fiesta (336 more than a standard Ninety-Eight convertible) up to Oldsmobile performance standards. At $5,715 (over $700 more than the Skylark) the Fiesta was nearly twice the $2963 price of a standard Ninety-Eight convertible, with only 458 units produced to its 7,521. 

Standard equipment for 1953 included bumper guards, electric clock, lined trunk, dual horns, cigarette lighter, chrome moldings, twin interior sun visors, rear seat robe rails, special rear stainless steel trim, chrome window ventiplanes, windshield washer, and Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring. In 1953 a padded safety dash also became standard on the Ninety-Eight.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1953%20Oldsmobile/album/1953%20Oldsmobile-10.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120905112938/http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1953%20Oldsmobile/album/1953%20Oldsmobile-10.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-05 |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1953 Oldsmobile/album |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=2011-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time [[air conditioning]] was an option.

The Fiesta convertible would be gone the next year but its name would be resurrected in 1957 for Oldsmobile [[station wagon]]s.

In 1954, Oldsmobiles were redesigned across the line, with a three body style Ninety-Eight series at the top. Convertibles were dubbed '''[[Oldsmobile Starfire|Starfire]]s''', after the previous year's [[Oldsmobile Starfire#Origin|Starfire dream car]]. A slightly higher horsepower {{convert|324|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#324|Rocket]] [[V8 engine|V8]] was shared with the Super 88 series. Standard Ninety-Eight equipment included bumper guards, rubber simulated carpets front and rear, electric clock, lined trunk, dual horns, cigarette lighter, aluminum door sill plates, turn signals, chrome rocker panel moldings, deck lid ornament, foam rubber seat cushions, padded dash,&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; parking brake light, courtesy light package, stainless steel wheel discs, windshield washer, and Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring. Upholstery choices were nylon and leather, in a variety of colors. Standard tire size was {{convert|8.00|in|mm|0|abbr=values}} by {{convert|15|in|mm|0|abbr=off}}. A slightly modified 1954 Holiday Coupe was used as a press car during the final Carrera Panamericana in 1954.

In 1955 the Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight again had a longer wheelbase than the 88. Standard equipment included turn signals, bumper guards, stainless steel molfings, dual horns, cigarette lighter, front and rear floor mats, inside rearview mirror, foam rubber seat cushions, stainless steel rocker panel moldings, front seatback robe cord, spun glass hood insulation, rear window ventiplanes, electric clock, stainless steel wheel discs, custom cushion lounge seats front and rear, hand brake light, courtesy light package, padded dash, Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring, and windshield washer.

Standard tire size was {{convert|7.70|in|mm|0|abbr=values}} by {{convert|15|in|mm|0|abbr=off}}.

The 4-door Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight Holiday Sedan, along with the 4-door [[Oldsmobile 88|88 Holiday]] and the 4-door [[Buick Century|Buick Century Riviera]] and 4-door [[Buick Special|Special Riviera]], were the first 4-door [[hardtop]]s ever produced. Perhaps because of the popularity of the new 4-door hardtop body style total Ninety-Eight sales set a new record of 118,626.

Again in 1956 the top of the line Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight series had an exclusive {{convert|126.0|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase, {{convert|4.0|in|mm|abbr=on}} longer than the 88.

For 1959, the Oldsmobile line-up was completely redesigned. However, unlike other GM makes (such as Chevrolet and Cadillac&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1959_Cadillac/1959_Cadillac_Brochure/1959%20Cadillac-15.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1959_Cadillac/1959_Cadillac_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Oldsmobile continued to use a full perimeter frame, instead of the GM X-frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1959%20Oldsmobile/album/1959%20Oldsmobile-26-27.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120906013622/http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1959%20Oldsmobile/album/1959%20Oldsmobile-26-27.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-06 |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1959 Oldsmobile/album |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=2011-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ninety-Eight shared its appearance with the [[Oldsmobile 88]]. Oldsmobile stayed with its top series format by offering four body styles on an exclusive {{convert|126.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase: a four-door sedan, a two-door hardtop, a four-door hardtop and a convertible. For 1959 and 1960 only, the hardtop body styles were dubbed "Holiday SceniCoupe" and "Holiday SportSedan" respectively, while the convertible continued the traditional "Convertible Coupe" moniker. Each body style had a distinctive [[Greenhouse (car)|greenhouse]], shared with other 1959 GM cars. The 4-door sedan had six side windows and a sloping roof; the 2-door hardtop had a very large rear window and thin pillars; the 4-door hardtop sported a "floating roof" look, with a large wrap-around rear window. Standard equipment included oil filter, turn signals, air scoop brakes, Safety spectrum speedometer, rocker panel moldings, special emblems, parking brake light, sponge vinyl headliner, deep twist carpeting, electric clock, wheel trim moldings, power steering, power brakes, and Jetaway [[Hydramatic]] Drive. Interiors were selected from leather, Morocceen vinyl, or cloth in different colors. Standard tire size was {{convert|9|x|14|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. The {{convert|394|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}, the largest first generation [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#394|Rocket]] [[V8 engine|V8]], was used from 1959 until 1964. 

In 1960, once again the top of the line Oldsmobile series was the Ninety-Eight. Oldsmobile cars were completely restyled, while keeping the underlying structure and rooflines of the 1959 models. All four body styles were carried over, and the four-door sedan was renamed "Celebrity Sedan"—a designation used only one year on the Ninety-Eight, but that was continued on 88 sedans up to 1965. Standard equipment included Safety-vee steering wheel, turn signals, air scoop brakes, electric windshield wipers, safety-spectrum speedometer, carpets with rubber inserts, padded dash, courtesy lamps, wheel trim rings, Star-lite headliner, two-speed windshield wipers, chrome roof side moldings, Jetaway Hydramatic transmission, power steering, power brakes, windshield washers, electric clock, and deep twist carpeting. Upholstery was fabric, leather, or Morocceen in a variety of colors. Tire size was {{convert|9|x|14|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. An anti-spin rear axle was optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1960%20Oldsmobile/1960%20Oldsmobile%20Brochure/1960%20Oldsmobile-26-27.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1960 Oldsmobile/1960 Oldsmobile Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1961, and 1961 only, the Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight was renamed '''Classic 98'''; nevertheless, most factory literature refers to the line as the Ninety-Eight.&lt;ref name='flory118'/&gt; A fifth body style was added to the four offered since 1955: a 4-door 6-window hardtop, previously exclusive to [[Cadillac]] and the [[Buick Electra]]. The "Holiday Sedan" name was transferred to it, and the 4-door 4-window hardtop body style was instead called the "Sport Sedan". This was the first time not all Oldsmobile hardtops were called Holidays. The sedan, which like in the two previous two years was a 6-window body style, was now called the "Town Sedan". Another peculiarity of the 1961 models was that, with the exception of the convertible, no 98 body styles shared its roofline with the 88. Overall sales plunged from 59,364 to 43,010, probably due to the introduction of the new [[Oldsmobile Starfire|Starfire]] series, the 98's low point following the production record set in 1955. Standard equipment included padded dash, Safety spectrum speedometer, floating propeller, air scoop brakes, two-speed windshield wipers, Safety-Vee steering wheel, parking brake lamp, courtesy lamps, oil filter, windshield washer, electric clock, [[Roto Hydramatic]] transmission, power steering and power brakes. Upholstery was vinyl, cloth or leather. Standard tire size was 8.50 x 14&amp;nbsp;inches. With the {{convert|394|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#394|Rocket]] now standard equipment on the [[Oldsmobile 88]] a higher compression version was made standard equipment on the 98 and Super 88 with horsepower rising to 325 in 1961 and 330 in 1962. It was dubbed the "Skyrocket" from 1961-63.

Unfortunately for loyal Oldsmobile customers, GM management on Woodward Avenue in Detroit were focusing on cost savings per vehicle by this time, a philosophy later called "less car for more money" by the 1970s.{{who|date=May 2013}} One drawback of this thinking was that the 1961 through 1964 Oldsmobiles lost their dependable (but expensive to build) Jetaway [[Hydramatic]] transmissions. Replacing those time-tested four speed units was a much cheaper to build three speed unit, the [[Roto Hydramatic]]. This transmission had no front fluid coupling at all, and utilized a single "fill-and-dump" coupling to perform double duty as both a fluid coupling in third speed while having a third reaction member, which Olds called an "Accel-O-Rotor," which was actually a small stator, thus giving some limited torque multiplication in first. In theory, the "Accel-O-Rotor" would provide the same multiplication range in first as both the first and second gears of the four speed unit without all the hardware...and cost. It was also unique at that time, in that second speed was pure mechanical connection from engine to rear end...no fluid coupling involved. The big problem with this unit in the Oldsmobiles (and lower line Pontiacs of the same era) was engine speed would race wildly in first, and then hit a "brick wall" of a very steep RPM decline in second, which was equivalent to third gear in the four speed Jetaway [[Hydramatic]].{{CN|date=May 2013}} This unit was very trouble prone and unreliable, and cost a great deal of performance otherwise obtainable from the [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#394|Rocket]].{{CN|date=May 2013}} It would linger for only these three years, when it was replaced by the much more reliable, but less efficient, [[Turbo Hydramatic]] in 1965. Customer complaints caused many dealers and independent transmission shops to wholesale replace the [[Roto Hydramatic]] in these cars with older (or contemporary, from a Pontiac Star Chief or Bonneville) HM315 four speed [[Hydramatic]].{{CN|date=May 2013}}

The largest 1962 Oldsmobiles were again the Ninety-Eights. Five body styles were offered including three 4-doors plus an open and a closed 2-door. The Holiday Coupe was renamed the Holiday Sport Coupe, and the Sport Sedan was renamed the Holiday Sport Sedan, so once again, at least temporarily, all hardtops were called Holidays. Ninety-Eights were well appointed with standard equipment including padded dash, guard beam frame, live rubber body cushions, coil springs, foam rubber seats, two-speed windshield wipers, parking brake lights, courtesy lamp package, special moldings, Roto Hydramatic, power brakes, power steering, power windows and power seat. Interiors were leather, vinyl or cloth. Standard tire size was 8.50 x 14&amp;nbsp;inches.
[[File:Nada Blue Book.jpg|thumb|left|1963 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight Convertible]]

Again, in 1963, the top-of-the-line Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight had an exclusive {{convert|126.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase. A new body style was the Custom Sports Coupe hardtop. It was the only body style with the 345 horsepower Starfire engine. The 4-door 6-window hardtop was renamed the '''Luxury Sedan''' (often condensed to '''L/S'''). The convention of naming all hardtops Holidays would not again return until 1965. Standard equipment included die-cast grille, deep pile carpeting, 21-gallon fuel tank, full-flow oil filter, foam seat cushions, foot-operated parking brake, two-speed windshield wipers, special molding package, Deluxe steering wheel, map light, heavy duty air cleaner, courtesy lights, Roto Hydramatic, power brakes, power steering, special rocker panel moldings, self-regulating electric clock, dual rear seat cigarette lighters and special headliner. Interiors were leather, vinyl or cloth. Standard tire size was 8.50 x 14&amp;nbsp;inches. Ninety-Eights were now made only in [[Lansing Car Assembly|Lansing]], [[Linden Assembly|Linden]], [[Leeds Assembly|Kansas City]], [[South Gate Assembly|Southgate]] and [[Wilmington Assembly|Wilmington]]. 
 
[[Malcolm X]] owned a 1963 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight—black, 4-door, hardtop - it is on display in the north lobby of the Malcolm X College on the near west side of Chicago.

In 1964 the top of the line Ninety-Eight series was offered in six body styles in 2-door, 4-door and convertible configurations. Standard equipment included: Roto Hydramatic; power steering, brakes, windows and seats; windshield washer; special wheel discs; clock; courtesy and map lights and padded dash. Upholstery was a variety of colored cloth, vinyl and leather. Standard tire size was 8.50 x 14&amp;nbsp;inches. Ninety-Eights were now built only in Lansing.

[[File:1966 Oldsmobile Ninety Eight Luxury Sedan in white, front right.jpg|thumb|left|1966 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight]]
The 1965 Ninety-Eight was completely redesigned from the ground up along with other full-sized [[General Motors]] cars but retained the larger [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] shared with [[Cadillac]] and [[Buick Electra]] in contrast with the [[GM B platform|B-body]] used in the Oldsmobile 88. The Ninety-Eight featured many of the lines found on 88s but with more squared off styling. The exclusive Ninety-Eight wheelbase had five body styles. The Custom Sport Coupe was gone and the 4-door 6-window body styles were replaced with 4-door 4-window body styles. The Luxury Sedan was no longer a [[hardtop]] but featured a more luxurious interior along with more standard amenities than the Town Sedan such as power seats. Most Ninety-Eight Luxury Sedans also had vinyl roofs, which were offered only in black that year. For the first time since 1962 all hardtops were once again called Holidays. 

Standard equipment included automatic transmission, power steering and brakes, power windows, clock, padded dash, foam padded seats, parking brake light, Deluxe steering wheel, special wheel covers, windshield washer and two-speed electric wipers, courtesy and glovebox lamps, and front seat belts. Standard tire size was 8.55 x 14&amp;nbsp;inches. A new three-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] [[automatic transmission]] with torque converter replaced the dismal three speed [[Roto Hydramatic]] that Oldsmobile had been using for the last three model years. Along with the transmission and redesigned platform, the engine was also new for 1965. It was a {{convert|425|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Super [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#425|Rocket]] [[V8 engine|V8]] that was more powerful and of a more efficient design than the older {{convert|394|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#394|Rocket]] V8 previously used, yet it was much lighter in weight. The Ninety-Eight's standard and only [[internal combustion engine|engine]] offering for 1965 was the four-barrel "Ultra High Compression" version of the 425 Super Rocket rated at {{convert|360|hp}}. Ninety-Eights were built only in [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]].

Between 1965 and 1975 Oldsmobile commissioned [http://www.coachbuilt.com/bui/c/cotner_bevington/cotner_bevington.htm Cotner-Bevington] to build [[professional cars]], (ambulances and hearses), using the large Ninety-Eight chassis. Ironically, during the '60's (1968), the only Oldsmobile professionally made into a limousine was the smaller [[Oldsmobile Toronado|Toronado]], known as the [http://www.coachbuilt.com/bui/a/aqc/aqc.htm AQC Jetway 707.]

Some luxury market buyers purchased either the [[Oldsmobile Starfire|Starfire]]s or the new [[Oldsmobile Toronado|Toronado]]s in 1966 but the Ninety-Eight remained the full-size top-of-the-line Oldsmobile. Five models, including a trio of 4-doors were available. Standard equipment included: Turbo-Hydramatic transmission; power steering, brakes, windows and seats; special wheel covers; front and rear seat belts; carpeting; windshield washer and two-speed wipers; foam seat cushions; electric clock and special armrests on selected models. Upholstery was cloth, vinyl and leather. Standard tire size was 8.55 x 14&amp;nbsp;inches. Ninety-Eights were built in Lansing.

In 1967 the sporty elegance of the Starfire was gone. The Ninety-Eight and the Toronado were now Oldsmobile's remaining luxury cars. There were five Ninety-Eight body styles available. Standard Ninety-Eight trim included: armrests, power brakes, dual cigarette lighters, electric clock, carpeting, lamp package, molding package, seat belts, power seats, power steering, Turbo-Hydramatic and power windows. Upholstery was cloth, vinyl or leather. Standard tire size was 8.85 x 14&amp;nbsp;inches. Ninety-Eight models were built in Lansing.

In 1968 Oldsmobile continued to produce five well appointed Ninety-Eight body styles. Standard equipment included: dual master cylinder, four way flasher, energy-absorbing steering column, back-up lights, side marker lights, seat belts, cross-flow radiator, rear armrest ashtrays, power brakes, electric clock, special moldings, shoulder belts, Deluxe steering wheel, power steering, carpeted trunk and Turbo-Hydramatic transmission. Upholstery was cloth, vinyl or leather. Standard tire size was 8.85 x 14&amp;nbsp;inches. Engine displacement was increased to the Rocket {{convert|455|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with 365 horsepower. Ninety-Eight production was in Lansing.  

The 1969 Ninety-Eight conventional front engine/rear drive car remained the top-of-the-line Oldsmobile. It was the largest Oldsmobile product offered and now had a {{convert|127.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase. Six body styles were now available with a hardtop version of the Luxury Sedan added to the lineup. New to the Ninety-Eight series were a recessed padded instrument panel, anti-theft lock within the steering column, rear view mirror map light, mini-buckle seat belts, and deeply padded head restraints. Standard equipment included: power brakes, self-regulating electric clock, full carpeting, courtesy lamps, paint stripes, power seat adjuster, seat belts and shoulder harnasses, power steering, Deluxe steering wheel, power windows, Turbo-Hydramatic transmission, custom sport seat, foam padded front seat, and wheel discs (hub caps). Standard tire size was 8.85 x 14&amp;nbsp;inches. Upholstery was vinyl, cloth or leather. The Ninety-Eight's standard engine was still the Rocket 455 which required [[Gasoline#Tetraethyllead|premium leaded gas]]. All Ninety-Eights were made in Lansing and had the code letter M. 

Some of the available 1969 options were a tilt-telescope steering wheel, instant horn, four season air conditioning with comfortron, tinted glass windshield, 6-way power seat, divided front seat with dual controls, power trunk release (vacuum), power door locks, power front [[disc brakes]], AM-FM stereo radio, rear seat speaker, stereo tape player [[stereo 8|(8-track)]], power operated antenna, door edge guards, cruise control, left outside remote control mirror, cornering lamps, anti-spin rear axle, [[vinyl roof]], flo-thru ventilation, and safety sentinel.

Of the Ninety-Eight series, the 1969's were the only models to have an attached hood extension. After receiving numerous complaints from dealership mechanics about hitting their heads on the extension, Oldsmobile changed the style of the hood in 1970, removing the extension, which resulted in a flat hood design.

In 1970, the Ninety-Eights were the largest Oldsmobiles. They still shared the luxury side of Oldsmobile business with the Toronado. Standard equipment included: Turbo-Hydramatic 400 transmission, power steering, power brakes with front discs, power windows, power seats, Deluxe steering wheel, electric clock and full wheel discs. Standard tire size was J78-15. Interiors were vinyl, cloth or leather. All Ninety-Eights were made in Lansing indicated by the codel letter M in the Vehicle Identification Number. The length grew to 225.2&amp;nbsp;inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1970%20Oldsmobile/1970_Oldsmobile_Prestige_Brochure/1970%20Oldsmobile%20Prestige-48.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1970 Oldsmobile/1970_Oldsmobile_Prestige_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oldsmobile built its biggest full-size car in 1971 although wheelbase was unchanged from 1970. The Ninety-Eights were the roomiest Oldsmobiles ever built thanks to the new GM full-size bodies which, at 64.3" front shoulder room and 63.4" rear shoulder room, set a record for interior width that would not be matched by any car until the full-size GM rear-wheel drive models of the early to mid-1990s. The 1971 through 1976 Ninety-Eight was very similar to the [[Oldsmobile 88]] (which by now was called the "Delta 88") except the Ninety-Eight had a longer passenger compartment owing to its 3" longer wheelbase, and had rear [[Cadillac]]-esque tailfins to better differentiate between the two full-size models.

The standard 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8 was rated at {{Convert|320|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and designed to run on lower octane regular lead, low-lead or unleaded gasoline for the first time this year thanks to a [[General Motors]]-mandate that all engines be designed to run on such fuels in preparation for the catalytic converter equipped cars of 1975 and later years that absolutely required unleaded gasoline. Despite this, a few 1975 and 1976 Ninety Eights were released from this catalytic converter requirement in Canada and were given certification along with exemption from requiring unleaded gasoline. V8s were progressively detuned as production wore on in line with tighter emission standards. Trunk mounted louvers for the flow through ventilation system were only found on 1971 models (as in many other GM models of 1971). The louvers were moved to the doorjambs for 1972-1976 models. From 1971 to 1976, Oldsmobile's full-sized [[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser|Custom Cruiser]] [[station wagon]] shared the {{convert|127.0|in|mm|sing=on}} wheelbase and 455 cubic-inch V8 with the Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight, and shared its interior and exterior styling, in particular the Ninety-Eight's distinctive front fascia and rear quarter panels complete with fender skirts.

The number of body styles was reduced to four for 1971. The [[convertible (car)|convertible]] was gone as were the 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] body styles. A new body style was the Luxury Coupe. For the first time ever all Oldsmobile Ninety-Eights were now [[hardtop]]s, and for the first time since 1964 not all hardtops were called Holidays. Standard equipment included armrests, front and rear, power brakes with front discs, electric clock, carpeting, inside hood release, lamp package, power seat, power steering and [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] transmission. Standard tire size was J78-15. Interiors were vinyl, cloth and leather. Ninety-Eights were built in both [[Linden, New Jersey|Linden]] and [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]].

Four body styles were offered in the Ninety-Eight series for 1972. Standard equipment included: Deluxe armrests, dual ashtrays, power brakes with front discs, electric clock, carpeting, interior hood release, remote control outside mirror, molding package, interior light package, windshield radio antenna, power seat, power steering, spare tire cover and Turbo-Hydramatic transmission. A midyear version of the 4-door hardtop named the '''Regency''' was produced to commemorate Oldsmobile's 75th year as an automaker. For the first time in 17 years the Ninety-Eight set a new sales record of 121,568.

In 1973 a five body style Ninety-Eight series was at the top end of the Oldsmobile line. The 75th anniversary Regency 4-door hardtop continued, following its successful mid-1972 introduction. Standard equipment included: Deluxe armrests, dual ashtrays, power brakes with front discs, cigarette lighter, carpeting, inside hood release, dome light, molding package, windshield radio antenna, foam sheet cushions, power steering, Deluxe steering wheel, Turbo-Hydramatic transmission and wheel opening covers. Standard tire size was L78-15. Upholstery was vinyl or cloth. The Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight set another record of 138,462 sold.

The 1974 Ninety-Eight was now Oldsmobile's longest running series dating back to 1941, and was still popular. Five models were offered with the Regency Coupe taking the place of the Luxury Coupe. Standard equipment included: power brakes with front discs, cigarette lighter, electric clock, interior hood release, lamp package, molding package, remote control outside mirror, windshield radio antenna, power steering, Deluxe steering wheel, spare tire cover, power windows, power seat and Turbo-Hydramatic transmission. Standard tire size was J78-15. Upholstery was vinyl, cloth or leather. 

From 1974 to 1975 the Ninety-Eight reached a record length of 232.4 in (5903&amp;nbsp;mm), when federally mandated {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} bumpers were added both front and rear increasing the overall length of the cars by several inches, while 1976 model year saw minimal length reduction to 232.2 in (5898&amp;nbsp;mm). It is also worth to note that 1974 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight 4-door hardtop was the longest car with that body style sold that year, since the longer [[Lincoln Continental]], [[Cadillac Sixty Special]] and [[Cadillac Series 75]] were basically sedans (and 1974 Lincoln Continental came only with one hardtop body style: the 2-door). The 1974-76 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight (as well as all full-size Oldsmobiles, [[Buick]]s and [[Cadillac]]s) also were among the first US production cars to offer an air bag option ("Air Cushion Restraint System") beginning in 1974. Very few cars were so equipped. The high cost ($700) plus public uncertainty about the yet-to-be proven safety systems that are now universal in today's automobiles saw quite handily to that.

The number of Ninety-Eight body styles was reduced in 1975. Four were available consisting of coupes or 4-door hardtops in Luxury or Regency trim. Two door models were no longer hardtops. Standard equipment included: power brakes with front discs, cigarette lighter, electric clock, electronic ignition, hood release, bumper impact strips, lamp package, 455 CID engine, molding package, remote-controlled outside mirror, power seat, power windows, power steering, Deluxe steering wheel, chrome wheel discs and Turbo-Hydramatic transmission. Standard tire size was J78-15. Upholstery was vinyl, cloth or leather. 

In 1976 the Luxury and Regency editions of the full-size Ninety-Eights were offered, in 2-door coupes or 4-door hardtops. 4-doors had an extra window (like an opera window) in the C-pillar. A landau roof option for the coupe gave it a huge-looking opera window. Like the Custom Cruiser, Ninety-Eights had a dual section eggcrate-design grille, with new front end panel, front bumper, and wraparound horizontal parking lamps. Amber marker lenses aligned with the headlamps wrapped around the fender sides. Separate clear cornering lamps had horizontal ribs. Vertical taillamps were decorated with a small emblem in each lens. Tiny back-up lamps stood alongside the license plate, on a panel that also contained small red lenses next to the tail lamps. Standard Ninety-Eight equipment included a 455 CID Rocket V8 with 4-barrel carburetor, Turbo-Hydramatic, vari-ratio power steering, power brakes, power driver's seat, driver's door armrest control console, electronic message center, electric clock, fold-down center armrests, front ashtray, and JR78 x 15 blackwall steel-belted radials. Rear fender skirts and bumper impact strips were also standard. A new 2.41:1 axle ratio became standard to improve fuel economy.

[[File:1976 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight Regency - Rear.jpg|thumb|right|1976 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight Regency sedan]]

For the 1972 model year, the Limited Edition Regency was offered to commemorate Oldsmobile's 75th anniversary. Each 1972 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight Regency was registered at [[Tiffany's]] and included the specially styled interior with black or covert gold "pillow effect" velour upholstery, and power split bench seat, in place of the power bench seat with a rear clock. Tiffany touches include the Tiffany Gold paint (an exclusive custom metallic color created especially for this car), the clock has also been specially styled by Tiffany's and bears a white Oldsmobile emblem above Tiffany's name on a golden face. Each 1972 Regency owner received a distinctive sterling silver key ring as a gift. If they were lost, the keys could be dropped in a mailbox, and Tiffany's would return them to the owner. A total of 2,650 75th anniversary Ninety-Eight Regency cars were built, all of them four-door hardtops. In 1973 the non-anniversary Regency stayed in the line up slotted just above the LS. The Regency package would remain available on the Ninety Eight through the 1996 model year when it would become a separate model nameplate.

The 1977 model was extensively redone and downsized, like the [[Oldsmobile 88|Delta 88]]. The new models, at around 4000 pounds curb weight, were over 800 pounds lighter, but headroom and rear seat legroom were increased compared to equivalent 1976 models. The 455&amp;nbsp; CID engine was replaced by the smaller 403&amp;nbsp; CID V8. The Oldsmobile 350 V8 was now the standard engine. The Ninety-Eight set a new sales record of 139,423. A four-door sedan and a two-door hardtop coupe were available.

[[File:1984 Oldsmobile 98 Regency coupe, front left.jpg|thumb|left|1984 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight Regency coupe]]

A diesel version of the 350 was added in 1978. Beginning in 1979, production of the Ninety-Eight was exclusive to Lansing as [[Linden Assembly]] was retooled to build the E-body cars. Base '''LS''' models were available as sedans only, and the premium '''Regency''' model came as either a coupe or a sedan. A limited production top level '''Regency LX''' sedan was also offered for 1979.

The Ninety-Eight was restyled for 1980, along with the Delta 88. That year, it gained a new 307 CID (5.0 L) V8 as an option. The 403 was dropped completely. The 1980 models received new exterior sheet metal, without drastically changing the look of the car. To improve aerodynamics and fuel economy the hood was sloped downward, while the trunk area was higher. This also gave all models a heavier, more substantial appearance, while even slightly increasing interior and trunk space. The 1981 model year saw the introduction of Buick's [[Buick V6 engine#4.1|252&amp;nbsp;in³ V6]] as standard, as well as a new 4-speed THM200-4R automatic transmission; the first standard 4-speed automatic since 1960. The gas 350 engine was dropped that same year, completely replaced by the smaller 307. A redesigned steering wheel and slightly revised instrument panel were also new that year. 

The 1983 models received a new grille but were otherwise unchanged. The federal {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} impact standard was rolled back for 1984, prompting GM to make major changes to the bumpers to save weight; predictably, this drastically reduced their effectiveness. An optional 8-track tape player and the 4.1 L V6 were no longer available, though the CB radio was still optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---September/1984-Oldsmobile-98-Regency-Brochure-Cdn/1984-Oldsmobile-Ninety-Eight-Regency-Cdn--04-05 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002052509/http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---September/1984-Oldsmobile-98-Regency-Brochure-Cdn/1984-Oldsmobile-Ninety-Eight-Regency-Cdn--04-05 |archivedate=2016-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Production ended in March 1984.

===Ninety Eight Regency Brougham===
The new '''Regency Brougham''' model was introduced for 1982 and available for the sedan model only. This car featured plush "Prima" velour seats with embroidered emblems, cut pile carpeting, and electroluminescent opera lamps on the B-pillars. Wire wheel discs were also standard as well as Tungsten halogen headlamps, cornering lamps, full padded vinyl roof, and a tilt steering wheel. Regency became the new 'base' model as the LS was discontinued.

1985 saw the Ninety-Eight downsized for the second time, this time switching from [[rear-wheel drive]] to a new [[front-wheel drive]] platform, with sales beginning in April 1984.&lt;ref name="conundrum"/&gt; Although this Ninety-Eight was nearly {{Convert|25.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} shorter in length and weighed over {{convert|700|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} less than its predecessor,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Oldsmobile Sales Material "1985 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight Regency Marketing Guide", authorized by General Motors Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; passenger space was nearly equal to 1984 models. Buyers seemed to prefer this new, more manageable Ninety-Eight, as 1985 model year sales, at 169,432 units, were more than double 1984's 76,833 units, an all-time sales record.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of American Cars "Oldsmobile" p.663: "Oldsmobile Production Figures."&lt;/ref&gt;

As in previous years, the 1985 Ninety-Eight was available as a 4-door sedan and a 2-door coupe, in either '''Regency''' or '''Regency Brougham''' trim. Both models came with standard velour seating, with Sierra grain leather optional on both.&lt;ref&gt;Oldsmobile Sales Material "1985 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight Sales Brochure", authorized by General Motors Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; For the first year, the Buick [[Buick V6 engine#3.0|181&amp;nbsp;in³ V6]] was the standard powerplant. V8 engines were gone for good, never to return to the Ninety-Eight. Optional engines were Buick's [[Buick V6 engine#3.8 FWD|231]] and Oldsmobile's [[Oldsmobile Diesel V6 engine|263&amp;nbsp;in³ Diesel V6]]. The 3.0 gas V6 and 4.3 Diesel [[V6 engine|V6]] were dropped for 1986.

Oldsmobile consistently improved this generation Ninety-Eight over its six-year run, treating it to yearly updates. Available for the first time was an electronic digital dash display featuring speed and remaining fuel. A new Delco/Bose stereo cassette system was available for USD$895. [[Anti-lock braking system|Anti-lock brakes]] were a new option for 1986 and a special "Grande" package was offered in 1986 and 1987 featuring composite headlights and specific front end panel (1986 only), and 45/45 leather seats with pigskin inserts and console with a combination lock. 

For 1987, all Ninety-Eights received a new grille with flush composite headlamps. It would also be the last year for the slow-selling 2-door coupe body style. In 1988, a power pull-down trunk lid and an onboard computer with oil life monitor (known as the "Driver Information System") were added to the options list. For the 1989 model year, the Ninety-Eight saw another grille change and the addition of [[Twilight Sentinel]] headlights, optional remote keyless entry, an automatic dimming rearview mirror which could be turned on and off, and an optional (but rarely ordered) drivers-side airbag.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/olds/87olds/bilder/13.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1990, the eleventh-generation Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight had a new harmonic balancer and increased horsepower over 1985 models. Also in 1990, a [[Professional Golfers Association|PGA]] edition package for the Regency Brougham included gold PGA emblems, gold nameplate badging, gold striping, and wire wheels with gold Oldsmobile rocket emblems. 1990 would be the last year that the "Regency Brougham" trim level, first introduced in 1982, was offered on a Ninety-Eight.

The final generation of the Oldsmobile Ninety Eight coincided with its 50th anniversary in 1991 and had added length, rear [[fender skirts]], wide tail, low nose, and split-grille with wraparound headlights. Although wheelbase was unchanged from the previous generation, overall length increased by over 9&amp;nbsp;inches (229&amp;nbsp;mm).  Most of this extra space was added to the rear of the car, resulting in a larger trunk.

The final generation Ninety-Eight was available in two main trim levels: the traditional luxury-oriented '''Regency''' models and the performance-oriented '''Touring''' models. The engine choices included normally aspirated (all years) and supercharged (1992-1995) versions of the 3.8 L V6. To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Ninety-Eight, Oldsmobile offered a "50th Anniversary" package in 1991. This limited edition model was available only in black or white and featured [[cloisonné]] front fender anniversary emblems, gold nameplate badging, gold striping, and unique gold accent alloy wheels. The interior was trimmed in burl walnut with gold accents.

[[File:91-96 Oldsmobile 98.jpg|thumb|left|1991-1993 Oldsmobile Ninety Eight]]
In 1992, a new supercharged V6 engine became available on the Touring edition. Also that year, a new entry-level Regency trim model was added. On upper level Regency Elite models, a PGA edition package was offered which included gold PGA emblems, gold nameplate badging, gold striping, and unique gold accent alloy wheels. In 1993, a new value priced Special Edition model was added to the lineup and Ninety-Eight received an improved 3.8 L V6 engine offering better performance and fuel efficiency.

[[File:Olds-NinetyEight.jpg|thumb|left|1994-1996 Oldsmobile Ninety Eight]]
In 1994, the Touring edition was discontinued but many of the features of that model became standard or available on Regency Elite including the supercharged engine. Additionally, the Ninety Eight added standard front passenger-side airbag plus new instrument panel, steering wheel, and door panel designs. The exterior received a new cross-hatch grille as well as redesigned head- and side-marker lamps.

In 1995, Oldsmobile further simplified the Ninety Eight lineup by offering just two levels of Regency Elite (Series I and Series II). Each was offered with a high level of standard equipment and only a short list of extra cost options. Also that year, the standard 3.8 L V6 engine was again reengineered to improve performance and fuel efficiency. For 1996, the Ninety Eight's final year, changes were minimal. The most notable was the removal of the supercharged engine from the option list. That engine, however, remained available on Oldsmobile's performance LSS model. 

Engines:
* 1991–1996 3.8&amp;nbsp;L (231&amp;nbsp;in³) [[V6]]
* 1992–1995 3.8&amp;nbsp;L (231&amp;nbsp;in³) supercharged V6

==Discontinuation==
The Ninety Eight ended production on May 31, 1996.&lt;ref name='Wards97'&gt;{{cite book |title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 1997 |publisher=Ward's Communications, Inc |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; To fill the void, a new Eighty-Eight relative – the '''Regency''' – was introduced, joining the sportier '''LSS''' model introduced a year earlier. The LSS featured steel front fenders, while the more stately and traditional Regency had the carryover GTX-composite fenders from the 1996 Ninety Eight.

The '''Oldsmobile Aurora''' was a [[full-size car|full-size]] sedan made by  [[Oldsmobile]] from 1994 to 2003.  It was produced in two generations: the first was a [[luxury car|luxury]] [[sports sedan]] which, along with the two-door [[Buick Riviera]], originated the [[Cadillac]]-derived [[GM G platform (FWD)|G platform]].  The second generation was a more conventional full-sized car, as the Aurora was now Olds' only full-sized offering and the G-platform had spread to all full-sized GM models.

The Aurora became the high-end sport sedan offered by Oldsmobile, powered by a four-cam, 32-valve 4.0&amp;nbsp;L V8 supplanting the [[Oldsmobile Toronado]] coupe and eventually the [[Oldsmobile 98]], [[Oldsmobile LSS|LSS]] and [[Oldsmobile Regency|Regency]] in the lineup. The Aurora offered both a [[V8]]- and a [[V6]]-powered version in 2001 and 2002 but returned to being V8-only in 2003.  It was equipped with a four-speed [[automatic transmission]] with performance algorithm shifting. No manual transmission was ever offered on the Aurora.

==Introduction==
Since the late 1980s GM had wanted a new car to rejuvenate Oldsmobile; thus the Aurora was developed, with several styling cues taken from the 1960s [[Oldsmobile Toronado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/vehicles/new/reviews/wk9545.html |title=Oldsmobile Aurora (1996) |publisher=Theautochannel.com |date= |accessdate=December 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stylistically, the Oldsmobile Aurora was based on the 1989 [[Oldsmobile Tube Car]] concept car and, mechanically, it adopted a version of Cadillac's [[Northstar Allanté#Northstar series|Northstar]] 4.6-liter V-8 engine.

By the time the Aurora was released, Oldsmobile badly needed hope for a comeback of the marque (Oldsmobile sales had plummeted from 1,066,122 in 1985 to 402,936 in 1993). As a symbol of its clean break from other cars in the lineup, the Aurora bore no Oldsmobile badging or script save for the radio-CD-cassette deck and engine cover. Instead, a new emblem consisting of a stylized ''A'' was used, foreshadowing a similar restyling of Oldsmobile's corporate "rocket" emblem for 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Aurora, Oldsmobile tried to ride the praise of the car by launching other models that borrowed styling cues from the Aurora such as the mid-size [[Oldsmobile Intrigue|Intrigue]] and compact [[Oldsmobile Alero|Alero]], as well as the redesigned [[Oldsmobile Eighty-Eight|Eighty-Eight]], [[Oldsmobile Silhouette|Silhouette]], [[Oldsmobile Cutlass|Cutlass]], and [[Oldsmobile Bravada|Bravada]]. The Oldsmobile "rocket" logo was even updated to be more in-line with the Aurora's emblem.

==Conceptualization==
Early design work on what would become the Aurora began as early as the late 1980s and manifested itself with a 1989 engineering concept known as the [[Oldsmobile Tube Car]] designed by Bud Chandler. Beyond the overall similar shape, the Tube Car featured many detailed elements that were later found on the production automobile, including a full-width taillamp, wraparound rear windshield, and frameless windows. Unlike the eventual production car, the Tube Car was of a pillarless hardtop design with [[suicide doors]]. The final production design was signed off on in July 1989, originally set for a 1992 start of production.&lt;ref name="businessweek.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.carstyling.ru/en/cars.1989_Oldsmobile_Tube%20Car.html

After much research and development, the Aurora went into production on January 24, 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 1995 |publisher=Ward's Communications, Inc |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released for the 1995 model year. It hosted a number of luxury and technologically advanced standard features including dual-zone climate control, driver and front passenger airbags, leather seating surfaces, genuine burl walnut interior accents, six-speaker sound system with in-dash cd-cassette, and eight-way power adjustable front seats with two-position memory.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;General Motors Introductory Sales Brochure "1995 Oldsmobile Aurora"&lt;/ref&gt;  An onboard computer displaying the date, current gas consumption, and other information was also standard, and was mounted in the center of the dashboard, above the factory radio and climate controls.  Only a few options were available on the Aurora including power sunroof, [[Bose Acoustimass]] premium amplified sound system, heated front seats, and Autobahn package.

[[File:4.0 L V8 Aurora.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The Aurora's ''[[Northstar engine series#L47|4.0&amp;nbsp;L V8]]'']]
The Aurora also came standard with Oldsmobile's {{convert|244|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|disp=flip}} [[GM L47 engine|L47]] [[V8 engine|V8]] engine, a [[DOHC]] [[internal combustion engine|engine]] based on [[Cadillac]]'s [[Northstar engine series|4.6&amp;nbsp;L Northstar V8]]. The Northstar engine and 4T80-E had been exclusive to Cadillac prior to the Aurora. The L47 put out {{Convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5600&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|260|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} torque at 4400&amp;nbsp;rpm.&lt;ref name='edmunds-specs'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/used/1996/oldsmobile/aurora/1653/specs.html |title=1996 Oldsmobile Aurora specs |accessdate=March 3, 2008 |publisher=Edmunds Online }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aurora used a four-speed automatic transmission with driver selectable "normal" and "power" shift modes. A highly modified {{Convert|650|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version of this engine was used by General Motors racing division initially for [[Indy Racing League]] and [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] competition starting in 1995 with the GM-supported Aurora GTS-1 racing program, then was later used in the [[Cadillac Northstar LMP]] program in 2000.  Both engines retained the 4.0&amp;nbsp;L capacity, but the Northstar LMP version was twin-turbocharged.&lt;ref name=Aurora&gt;Weitzman, Larry (2001).[http://www.theautochannel.com/vehicles/new/reviews/2001/lweitzman_oldsmobile_aurora.html The Aurora by Oldsmobile (2001), Better in every respect]. ''Autochannel''. Retrieved on June 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Aurora had a [[drag coefficient]] of 0.32.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.motortrend.com/cars/1999/oldsmobile/aurora/specifications/| title = Oldsmobile Aurora specs | accessdate = March 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aurora was highly regarded at the time for its refined engine, excellent build quality, well-balanced ride, and structural integrity. During normal crush-to-failure tests done by automakers to evaluate body [[torsional rigidity]], the Aurora's [[unibody]] construction broke GM's testing machine.&lt;ref&gt;1994 Aurora brochure by General Motors.&lt;/ref&gt; A frame-crusher otherwise used to test stronger truck frames had to be used instead, with the car exceeding federal standards for passenger cars by two times.

All first-generation Auroras were built in [[Lake Orion, Michigan]], along with the [[Buick LeSabre]], [[Buick Park Avenue]], [[Buick Riviera]], [[Oldsmobile 88]], [[Oldsmobile 98]] and [[Pontiac Bonneville]]. Production for this generation ended on June 25, 1999.&lt;ref name=Wards00&gt;{{cite book |editor=Binder, Alan K |title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 2000 |publisher=Ward's Communications, Inc |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Year-to-year changes===
'''1996'''&lt;br/&gt;
For 1996, Oldsmobile made some minor revisions to the Aurora including new rear glass which has less distortion than previous models.
Further revisions include daytime running lights and OBD II compliant on-board diagnostic systems, tweaking the climate control and safety alarm, a revised keyless entry system with new features was and the short list of optional equipment was expanded to include chrome wheels and a gold trim package. The 1996-'99 models also had the passenger temperature toggle buttons on the middle right portion of the instrument panels replaced with air recirculator buttons.

'''1997'''&lt;br/&gt;
There were minor changes for the Aurora in 1997. A new in-dash CD player for the Bose sound system highlighted the improvements. Another new feature was a tilt-down right-outside mirror that enhances the driver's view of close objects, whenever the shifter is placed in reverse.
The underside of the door handles were slightly recontoured to minimize slipping fingers when the handles are pulled. Seat belt release buttons were moved from the face of the buckle to the end for improved convenience. An electronic compass was added to the inside rear-view mirror. Larger front brakes came along with cast aluminum front control arms and steering knuckles. The rear ashtray assembly was changed from a click-lock face to a pull-up face. Finally, the spare tire cover and jack cradle assembly was changed from the jack and cover being bolted down to one where the jack sat in a plastic "bucket" inside the spare with the cover simply placed on top.
On some 1997s a modest "Oldsmobile" badge returned to the right-rear corner of the car along with the Aurora name.

'''1998'''&lt;br/&gt;
[[File:Oldsmobile Aurora 1998.jpg|thumb|right|1998 Oldsmobile Aurora]]
The 1998 model had a few minor refinement changes to the brakes, suspension, steering and emissions controls. A new front control arm design with front hydraulic bushing and rear cross axis ball joint for enhanced ride smoothness and better isolation from road noise and vibration. Internal rebound springs added to front struts for improved body motion control and to minimize crash-through. Increased wheel travel (3&amp;nbsp;mm) and redesigned jounce bumpers for softer feel at full travel. Dual durometer cradle mounts for improved isolation. Premium valving and damping in the front and rear struts for a higher refinement in calibration. There were more accurate wheel sensors for improved ABS actuation. New steering calibration for more on-center feel and reduced parking effort.

GM's previously optional OnStar system, standard for this year, uses a dedicated button on the cellular telephone putting drivers in contact with an information center that can provide them with emergency assistance. The system uses no transmitters to determine the vehicle's location and provide route information to any destination.

Almost all of the changes made to the Aurora for 1998 were aimed at refining what was already a highly regarded suspension system. 

'''1999'''&lt;br/&gt;
The last year for the first generation Aurora; changes for 1999 included additional engine mounts for improved engine stability. No 2000 models were produced.

}}
Oldsmobile's original intention for the second generation was to move the Aurora further upmarket, retaining its V8-only drivetrain and sharing a platform with the new Buick Riviera, as the original Aurora had done. This would have created more room within the Oldsmobile lineup for a four-door Eighty-Eight successor known as the "Antares". {{cn|date=March 2018}} However, Buick dropped its Riviera development plans and fiscal trouble found Oldsmobile, so Oldsmobile was forced to re-engineer the Antares into an acceptable Aurora in short time.{{cn|date=March 2018}} Still using the G-body design, the re-engineered Aurora was the result, but retaining its 4.0 V8 Northstar still mounted to a 4T80-E.

Oldsmobile also offered a [[V6 engine]] in the Aurora for the first time. The V6 in question was the [[Northstar engine series#LX5 (Shortstar)|LX5]], a cut-down relation of the DOHC Aurora V8, dubbed the "Shortstar." {{cn|date=March 2018}} The V6-powered Aurora was produced for the 2001 and 2002 model years only, with production ceasing in mid-2002.

[[File:2003 Oldsmobile Aurora.jpg|thumb|left|2001-2002 Oldsmobile Aurora V6]]
This Aurora, though still a competitive luxury sedan, did not attract the attention, nor sales that the original did.  While sales of the 2001 Aurora topped 53,000, thanks in part to its extra long model year which started in February 2000, the success was short-lived.  This can be blamed on several reasons. Most notably was that the new Aurora was overshadowed by GM's announcement in December 2000 that the Oldsmobile marque was to be phased out over the next several years.  Though still retaining its unique styling, it now shared design cues from other Oldsmobiles, as well many parts in common with other GM vehicles.  This took away a bit of the exclusivity that the original had.  Also, the second generation Aurora was over six inches shorter than was the first generation. ''[[Automobile Magazine|Automobile]]'' magazine wrote that "The Aurora's new look is not quite as sensuous or elegant as that of the outgoing model,"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal|title=2001 New Cars|journal=Automobile Magazine|issue=September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Auto Channel review said, "it was better in every respect."&lt;ref name=Aurora/&gt;

The second generation Aurora went into production on November 1, 1999,&lt;ref name=Wards00/&gt; and went on sale in February 2000&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; as a 2001 model. The last V6-powered Auroras rolled off the assembly line on June 21, 2002. The final 500 Auroras ended production on March 28, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Binder, Alan K |title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 2004 |publisher=Ward's Communications, Inc |year=2004 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were all a special burgundy color (called "Dark Cherry Metallic"), had special chrome wheels, and "Final 500" badging. The Orion, Michigan plant built a total of 71,722 second-generation Auroras;{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} 53,640 in 2001, 10,865 in 2002, and 7,217 in 2003.

===Standard and optional equipment===
The second-generation (2001-2003) Oldsmobile Aurora was very well equipped from the factory, as was expected of a luxury vehicle. Standard features on the Aurora were as follows: keyless entry, a security alarm, luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces with power adjustments for the driver's seat, an AM-FM stereo with radio data system (RDS) and cassette and single-disc CD players, a six-speaker sound system, leather door panel inserts, wood interior trim, automatic climate control, OnStar in-vehicle telematics system (later introduction), steering wheel-mounted climate and radio controls, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, power trunk release from the keyless entry remote, a multi-function driver's information center mounted above the factory radio and climate controls, a rear bench seat with fold-down center armrest, luxury-styled alloy wheels, a spare tire and wheel, automatic front head and fog lamps, a 3.5L V6 engine, a 4-speed automatic transmission, front-wheel-drive (FWD), front and side SRS airbags. 

While there was not an abundance of optional equipment on the Aurora, the few additional options included a driver's memory package with memory front driver's seat and memory for radio presets, heated dual front bucket seats, a premium audio system with external amplifier by [[Bose Corporation|Bose]], a power tilt-and-sliding sunroof, chrome-finished alloy wheels, a gold emblem package for the front and rear Oldsmobile emblems, Aurora emblem, and 3.5 or 4.0 emblems, and the 4.0L Northstar V8 engine (this engine became standard equipment in 2003 for the Aurora's final year of production). 
Starting in 2002, a voice-activated, CD-ROM based navigation system was available.

The '''Oldsmobile 88''' (marketed from 1989 on as the '''Eighty Eight''') is a [[full-size car]] that was sold and produced by [[Oldsmobile]] from 1949 until 1999. From 1950 to 1974 the 88 was the division's top-selling line, particularly the entry-level models such as the 88 and Dynamic 88. The 88 series was also an image leader for Oldsmobile, particularly in the early years (1949–51) when it was one of the best performing automobiles thanks to its relatively small size, light weight and advanced overhead-valve high-compression V8 engine. This engine, originally designed for the larger [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-bodied]] and more luxurious 98 series, also replaced the [[Oldsmobile Straight-8 engine|straight-8]] on the smaller [[GM B platform|B-bodied]] [[Oldsmobile Series 70|78]]. With the large, high performance V8, the Oldsmobile 88 is considered by some to be the first [[muscle car]], although this title is disputed.

A large number of variations in nomenclature were seen over this long model run — Futuramic, Super, Golden Rocket, Dynamic, Jetstar, Delta, Delmont, Starfire, Holiday, L/S, LSS, Celebrity, and Royale were used at various times with the 88 badge, and Fiesta appeared on some station wagons in the 1950s and 1960s. The name was more commonly shown as numbers in the earlier years ("Delta 88", for example) and was changed to spell out "Eighty Eight" starting in 1989.

[[Oldsmobile]] introduced the 88 badge in 1949. It was named to complement the already-existing [[Oldsmobile Series 70|76]] and [[Oldsmobile 98|98]], and took the place of the [[Oldsmobile Straight-8 engine|straight-8 engined]] 78 in the model lineup. The new car used the same new Futuramic [[GM B platform|B-body]] platform as the [[Oldsmobile Straight-6 engine|straight-6 engined]] 76 but paired it with the new {{convert|303|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile V8 engine|Rocket V8 engine]] producing {{Convert|135|hp|kW|0}}. This combination of a relatively small light body and large, powerful engine made it widely considered to be the first [[muscle car]]. The Rocket 88 vaulted Oldsmobile from a somewhat staid, conservative car to a performer that became the one to beat on the [[NASCAR]] (National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing) circuits. It won six of the nine NASCAR late-model division races in 1949, 10 of 19 in 1950, 20 of 41 in 1952, and was eventually eclipsed by the low-slung, powerful [[Hudson Hornet]], but it was still the first real "King of NASCAR."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadiandriver.com/articles/bv/rocket88.htm Vance, Bill. "1949 Oldsmobile "Rocket" 88" Canadian Driver, October 19, 2004], retrieved on 2008-06-08.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to increased sales to the public. There was a pent up demand for new cars in the fast-expanding post-[[World War II]] economy, and the 88 appealed to many ex-military personnel who were young and had operated powerful military equipment.

The 88 enjoyed great success, inspiring a popular 1950s slogan, "Make a Date with a Rocket 88", and also a song, "[[Rocket 88]]", often considered the [[first rock and roll record]]. Starting with the trunk-lid emblem of the 1950 model, Oldsmobile would adopt the rocket as its logo, and the 88 name would remain in the Olds lineup until the late 1990s, almost until the end of Oldsmobile itself.

The 1949 model was equipped with an ignition key and a starter push-button to engage the starter. Pushing the starter button would engage the starter, but if the ignition key was not inserted, unlocking the ignition, the car would not start. The car was equipped with an [[Air filter#Oil Bath|oil bath air cleaner]]. At the bottom edge of the front fender directly behind the front wheel was a badge that said "Futuramic" which identified an Oldsmobile approach to simplified driving, and the presence of an automatic transmission. V8 Oldsmobiles were automatic-only in 1949 as Oldsmobile lacked a manual gearbox that could handle the torque of the new engine.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m9_7lqg6Hc 1948 Oldsmobile Futuramic introduction] In 1950, Oldsmobile offered a modified Cadillac manual gearbox for V8 models. The 88 now outsold the six-cylinder 76 lineup, which was dropped entirely after the 1950 model year. It had a 40&amp;nbsp;ft. turning circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1950%20Oldsmobile/1950_Oldsmobile_Foldout/1950%20Oldsmobile%20Foldout-18.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1950 Oldsmobile/1950_Oldsmobile_Foldout |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hershel McGriff]] and Ray Elliot  won with the 1950 model won the [[1950 Carrera Panamericana]].

For 1951, the 88 was now the entry-level Olds with the discontinuation of the [[Straight-6|six-cylinder]] 76 line, which meant that all Oldsmobiles were powered by Rocket V8s. An in-house manual transmission replaced the modified Cadillac gearbox, but as the 1950s progressed, manual shift became increasingly rare in Oldsmobiles and normally could only be obtained by special order. New this year was the more upscale '''Super 88''' line on the new GM B-body&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; which included restyled rear body panels, a more luxurious interior, and a slightly longer {{convert|120|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase as opposed to the {{convert|119.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase which had been standard since the 88's introduction. The station wagon was discontinued and would not reappear until the 1957 model year. New was an I-beam frame. Hydraulic power windows and seats were optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1951%20Oldsmobile/1951_Oldsmobile_Foldout/1951%20Oldsmobile%20Foldout-18.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1951 Oldsmobile/1951_Oldsmobile_Foldout |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, the base 88 shared the Super 88's rear body panels and wheelbase, and came with a Rocket V8 and two-barrel [[carburetor]] while Super 88s came with a new four-barrel carburetor upping the output to {{Convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Other mechanical features were unchanged with styling changes amounting to new grilles, taillights, and interior revisions. New was the optional automatic headlight control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1952%20Oldsmobile/1952_Oldsmobile_Autronic_Eye_Foldout/1952%20Oldsmobile%20Autronic%20Eye%20Foldout-rear.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1952 Oldsmobile/1952_Oldsmobile_Autronic_Eye_Foldout |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1953, the base 88 was renamed the DeLuxe 88&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; for only this one year while the Super 88 continued as a more upscale version. Engines and transmission offerings were the same as 1952. Late in the 1953 model year, a fire destroyed GM's Hydra-Matic plant in [[Livonia, Michigan]], which was then the only source for Hydra-Matic transmissions. The temporary loss of Hydra-Matic production led Oldsmobile to build thousands of its 1953 models with Buick's two-speed Dynaflow automatic transmissions until GM pressed its [[Willow Run Transmission]] plant into service to resume Hydra-Matic production. New options this year included Frigidaire air conditioning, power steering, and power brakes.

The 1954 Oldsmobiles were completely restyled with new longer and lower body shells and wrap-around windshields and rear windows. Wheelbases increased to {{convert|122|in|m}}. Base models reverted to being simply called 88s after being designated as DeLuxe 88s for only one year and the Super 88 was once again the top series (beneath the larger [[Oldsmobile 98|98]]). The Rocket V8 was enlarged from 303 to 324 cubic inches with 88s powered by a two-barrel, {{convert|170|hp}} unit while Super 88s came with a {{convert|185|hp}} version with four-barrel carburetor. Also, a safety padded dash became optional, at $17.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt;

The 1955 models were heavily [[Facelift (automobile)|facelifted]] with new grillework, taillights and body-side chrome. Horsepower for the 324-cubic-inch Rocket V8 increased to 185 for 88s and 202 for Super 88s. At mid-year, Olds introduced the new pillarless four-door hardtop body, dubbed the Holiday sedan, in both the 88 and Super 88 series. The four-door Oldsmobile 88 Holiday, along with the four-door [[Oldsmobile 98|98 Holiday]], [[Buick Century|Buick Century Riviera]], and [[Buick Special|Special Riviera]], were the first four-door [[hardtop]]s ever produced. Air conditioning became an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1955%20Oldsmobile/1955_Oldsmobile_Brochure/1955%20Oldsmobile-30-31.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1955 Oldsmobile/1955_Oldsmobile_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 88 had full instrumentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1955%20Oldsmobile/album_001/1955%20Oldsmobile%20Manual-07.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1955 Oldsmobile/album_001 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1956, styling highlights included a new split grille in front and revised taillights and deck along with revised side chroming. Horsepower for the 324 Rocket V8 increased to 230 for 88s and 240 for Super 88s. A new four-speed Jetaway Hydra-Matic was introduced this year to replace the original Hydra-Matic transmission that Olds had used since 1940. The new Jetaway Hydra-Matic retained the four forward speeds and fluid coupling unit, but added a new "Park" position to the shift quadrant and no longer required band adjustment as a specified routine maintenance. Inside, an oval speedometer replaced the round unit and a new foot-operated parking brake replaced the previous T-handle unit.

For 1957 only, the basic 88 was officially named '''Golden Rocket 88''', taken from Oldsmobile's 1956 [[General Motors Motorama|Motorama]] [[Oldsmobile Golden Rocket|two-passenger show car]]. However, the only badging was an "88" underneath each taillight. Also for 1957 the "J2" option was offered, with three {{convert|2|oilbbl|m3|sing=on}} carburetors, similar to the Pontiac Tri-Power. The Super 88 continued as the upscale mid-line series. Under the hood, the Rocket V8 increased in displacement to 371 cubic inches and {{convert|277|hp}} for all models across the board. Although rare, three speed manual transmissions were still available.  Styling highlights were more evolutional than radical overall with three-piece rear window styling utilized on some models. Oldsmobile revived station wagons for the first time since 1950 with the Super 88 Fiesta being a four-door hardtop design. In 1957, Oldsmobile added a safety deep-recessed steering wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1957%20Oldsmobile/album/1957%20Oldsmobile-15.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1957 Oldsmobile/album |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=2012-01-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905093324/http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1957%20Oldsmobile/album/1957%20Oldsmobile-15.html |archivedate=2010-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1958, GM was promoting their fiftieth year of production, and introduced Anniversary models for each brand; Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Chevrolet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmphotostore.com/1958-Chevrolet-Impala-50th-Anniversary-Art-Poster/productinfo/P8367/ Image of 50th Anniversary promotional photo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017224216/http://www.gmphotostore.com/1958-Chevrolet-Impala-50th-Anniversary-Art-Poster/productinfo/P8367/ |date=2015-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1958 models shared a common appearance on the top models for each brand; Cadillac Eldorado Seville, Buick Roadmaster Riviera, Oldsmobile Holiday 88, Pontiac Bonneville Catalina, and the all-new Chevrolet Bel-Air Impala.

The 1958 model is best known in Oldsmobile as the year of the "ChromeMobile" thanks to tremendous splatterings of chrome trim on the body, particularly on the higher-priced Super 88 and Ninety-Eight models. The styling was advertised by Olds as the "Mobile Look." The '''Dynamic 88''' debuted in 1958 and lasted through 1966 positioned as the entry level model below the '''Super 88.''' This model featured a more economical Rocket V8 than its more expensive linemates – a de-tuned {{Convert|265|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version of the 371 cubic-inch Rocket V8 with two-barrel carburation. Super 88 models were powered by a four-barrel {{Convert|300|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} version of that engine as standard equipment with a J-2 option featuring three two-barrel carburetors and {{Convert|310|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.
A new option for 1958 was a "Trans-Portable" radio that could be removed from the instrument panel through the glove compartment and used as a portable radio for beaches, picnics, etc. thanks to portable batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1958_Oldsmobile/1958_Oldsmobile_Brochure/1958%20Oldsmobile-28-29.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1958_Oldsmobile/1958_Oldsmobile_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A revised instrument panel was highlighted by a new deep-dish steering wheel with "horn bars" replacing the long-standing horn ring still common during that period.

Despite an economic recession that cut into new car sales industry wide, and especially affected the medium-priced car market that Olds competed in, Oldsmobile saw only a slight decline in sales for 1958 and even rose in industry standings to fourth-place behind the "Low-Priced Three" of Chevrolet, Ford and Plymouth, while surpassing a now-floundering sister division Buick on the sales charts for the first time in many years. Oldsmobile was also way ahead of other middle-priced competitors such as sister division Pontiac, Mercury, Dodge and Chrysler, along with Ford Motor Company's all-new and ill-fated [[Edsel]], and Chrysler Corporation's [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] - the latter two nameplates of which would fade into oblivion within the next three years.

All Oldsmobiles were completely restyled for 1959, with the 88 series given longer, lower and wider styling on a GM B-body chassis. The 88 shared its appearance with the top-model [[Oldsmobile 98]]. Styling highlights for the new models, promoted as the "Linear Look," included six-window styling on four-door pillared sedans, glassy semi-fastback rooflines on Holiday coupes and flat-blade rooflines with thin windshield and C-pillars on Holiday sedans which created a large open greenhouse effect. Two-door hardtops were called "Holiday Scenicoupes," whereas four-door hardtops were called "Holiday Sport Sedans."  While many 1959 model cars featured bigger and sharper fins, Olds flattened theirs horizontally and reduced chrome from 1958 for a much cleaner look. Wheelbases on 88 models increased by one inch to {{convert|123|in|mm|0}}.

A larger, 394 cubic-inch Rocket V8 with four-barrel carburation rated at {{Convert|315|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} was standard on the '''Super 88'''. The lower-priced '''Dynamic 88''' retained the two-barrel {{Convert|265|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 371 cubic-inch '57–58 Rocket V8, with a {{Convert|300|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} four-barrel version optional.

A simpler but bold new grille and revised rear design with even flatter, horizontal tailfins and new taillights highlighted the 1960 makeover. Power for Super 88 models remained the same, while Dynamic 88s had their 371 ci Rocket V8 detuned to {{Convert|240|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, where a lower compression ratio accommodated lower-priced regular gasoline. Other changes included a revised instrument panel and a slimmer transmission tunnel for improved interior space.

An all-new body and chassis with perimeter "Guard Beam" frame and all-coil suspension replacing the previous leaf springs highlighted the 1961 full-sized Oldsmobiles, which were joined by the new compact [[Oldsmobile F-85|F-85]]. All full-sized Oldsmobiles were now powered by the 394-cubic-inch Rocket V8 with the Dynamic 88 getting a two-barrel, {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version that used regular gas, while the Super 88 was powered by a four-barrel "Ultra High Compression" 394 Skyrocket V8 rated at {{convert|325|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The Skyrocket engine was available as an extra-cost option on the Dynamic 88. A new three-speed "Roto" Hydra-matic transmission that was smaller and lighter than the previous four-speed unit was introduced as an option.

[[File:1961 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 (35257871770).jpg|thumb|left|1961 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 Celebrity Sedan, rear view]]
The 1961 Oldsmobile body design represented the after-effect of the 1958 recession.  While wheelbases remained the same as in 1960, the overall length and width were reduced slightly – a trend seen throughout all of GM's marques.  Body design focused on a trimmer, fuselage design.  At the bottom of the rear quarters, a "[[skeg]]"—a downward fin—jutted outboard to counterbalance the rearward point of the quarter panel. Round tail lights, one on each side, were set into the rear cove. For 1961, GM retired the compound curve windshields that it introduced in 1954, and the much hated body dogleg necessitated by the shape of the windshield.  Instead of adopting the cleaner straight angled "A" pillar, Harley Earl, who was nearing the end of his tenure at GM, pushed for a small curved switch back, used in 1961–62, at the outboard base of the windshield.

Like for the previous model year, there were six body styles: a 2-door sedan, the Celebrity Sedan 4-door sedan, the Holiday Sedan 4-door hardtop, the Holiday Coupe 2-door hardtop, the Convertible Coupe drop-top and the Fiesta station wagon, available in both 2- and 3-seat models. All body styles but the 2-door sedan (which was the price leader) were offered both as Dynamic 88 and Super 88. In general all models had thicker pillars than the extremely thin ones found on previous generation models. The Holiday Coupe 2-door hardtop continued the "bubble top" look. The 1961 Holiday Sedan 4-door hardtop had thicker, parallelogram-shaped rear pillar than its predecessor. The extreme "floating roof" look of the 1959–1960 4-door hardtop, with wrap-around panoramic rear window and overhanging roof, had been passed on to the pillared Celebrity Sedan—which had switched from the previous year six-window to a four-window greenhouse. Six-window sedans continued to be offered in the [[Oldsmobile 98|98]] line.

At mid-year, a sporty and luxurious convertible called the [[Oldsmobile Starfire]] was introduced. It was based on the Super 88 ragtop and featured leather bucket seats, center console with floor shifter for the Hydra-matic transmission (incidentally the first U.S. full-sized production car to feature an automatic transmission with a console-mounted floor shifter) and many other standard items such as power steering, brakes, windows and driver's seat. The Starfire was also powered by an even higher-performance version of the "Ultra High Compression" 394-cubic-inch Starfire V8 rated at {{Convert|335|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

[[File:Oldsmobile station wagon white.jpg|thumb|left|For 1962 the Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 Fiesta station wagon mostly retained the rear design of the 1961 model]]
For 1962, the Oldsmobile 88 received a "second-year" facelift that included a revised grille and front bumper. Length was increased somewhat to give the '62 Olds a longer look. Changes to the rear included the removal of the rear fender skegs (personally ordered by GM's Vice President of design [[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]], who disliked them), and oval taillights, one on each side for Dynamic and Super 88 models replaced the 1961's round units. 1962 Starfires received two oval lights per side, much like the concurrent Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight models. Changes to the greenhouse included new roof lines for the four-door Celebrity Sedan—which relinquished the panoramic rear window—and for the Holiday Coupe two-door hardtop, which received a new fashionable convertible-inspired roofline abandoning the "bubble-top" appearance. The two-door sedan, made redundant as entry-level model by the previous year's introduction of the [[Oldsmobile F-85|F-85]] compact, was discontinued. Lastly, the Fiesta station wagon was only partially restyled, retaining most of the 1961's rear styling; the 3-seat wagon was now only available as Dynamic 88.

Engines were uprated to {{convert|280|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the standard engine in the Dynamic 88 thanks to a higher compression ratio that demanded the use of premium fuel (a regular-fuel {{convert|260|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version was offered as a no-cost option), 330 horses for the "Skyrocket" V8 standard on Super 88 and Ninety-Eight and 345 horsepower for the top Starfire Rocket V8. Oldsmobile marketing continued to use the trade names of "Roto-matic Power Steering" and "Pedal-eeze Power Brakes".
All Oldsmobiles featured the "speed bar" speedometer. Introduced in 1959, the speedometer used a rolling black cylinder with sections painted brilliant green, yellow and bright red. As the car went from a standing stop forward in speed, the cylinder rolled, first exposing the green in a window that matched the numeric speed on stationary speed dial for low speeds, yellow at moderate speeds, and finally red at highway speeds. Drivers who topped the car over 100&amp;nbsp;mph moved the cylinder into an area where only the black base color was visible. For 1963, Oldsmobile would revert to a standard speed needle sweeping over a calibrated set of speeds instead.

1962 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88s and Dynamic 88 Fiesta wagons each had their own upholstery patterns in single and dual-tone colors. Super 88s received tri-tone upholstery and trim. Heaters became standard equipment on all models, and the push-button controls were located to the right of the steering wheel column. Vehicles not equipped with air conditioning received push-button vacuum-operated fresh air vents, called "Summer Ventilation", which replaced the pull level type vents.  This control panel was located on the left of the steering column.  Cars equipped with factory air conditioning replaced the vent control panel with the air conditioning panel, which also contained its own blower switch.  These cars also sported round dash vents for the delivery of A/C airflow. Dynamic 88s received aqua dashboard panel inserts with "OLDSMOBILE" lettering, while Super 88s received panels with that model's nomenclature on the insert.

All full-sized Oldsmobiles underwent extensive body and trim revisions for 1963. Most of the underlying basic body structure and rooflines were carried over from '62 with new exterior sheet metal abandoning the previous years' sculpted mid-sections; Lincoln Continental-style slab sides and sharper edges being employed overall. The Starfire gained an exclusive razor-edged roof treatment utilizing a concave backlight similar to that of the new Pontiac Grand Prix. Different rear quarter panels meant Oldsmobile 88s and the more expensive 98s were more differentiated than before. 1963 also brought about GM's across-the-board adoption of the straight angled windshield "A" pillar on all full-size production vehicles eliminating the unusual 1961 through 1962 reverse-curve treatment. Models and drivetrains in both the Dynamic 88 and Super 88 series were unchanged from 1962. Options that year included a "tilt-away" steering wheel that could be adjusted to six positions, six-way power seats, AM/FM radio and cruise control.&lt;ref&gt;http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---April/1963-Oldsmobile-Full-Size-Owners-Manual/1963-Full-Size-Oldsmobile-Manual-32-33&lt;/ref&gt;

The sharp-edged theme continued for 1964, Oldsmobile's full-sized cars received a minor face-lift that included revised trim, grilles and taillights. New that year was the introduction of price leader for the full-sized Oldsmobile series, the '''Jetstar 88''', which used the same full-size body as other 88 models but also shared key components with that year's redesigned [[Oldsmobile F-85|F-85]] [[Mid-size car|intermediate]]. The Jetstar 88 used the smaller [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#Jetfire Rocket|330 V8]] and Jetaway ([[Super Turbine 300]]) two-speed automatic transmission in place of the 394-cubic-inch V8 and [[Roto Hydramatic]] found in other Oldsmobiles, and 9.5-inch (241.3&amp;nbsp;mm) [[drum brake]]s which were less effective than the {{convert|11|in|mm|0|sing=on}} drums found on other full-sized Olds models.

Oldsmobile also introduced the [[Oldsmobile Jetstar I|Jetstar I]] for 1964. Not part of the Jetstar 88 line, the Jetstar I instead was a direct competitor to the [[Pontiac Grand Prix]] in the same $3,500 price range. Jetstar I's shared the [[notchback]] body style with the [[Oldsmobile Starfire|Starfire]] along with its more powerful {{convert|345|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 394-cubic-inch Rocket V8 engine, but with less standard equipment and a lower price tag. Oddly, Oldsmobile teamed the {{convert|345|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} Rocket engine with a very unsuitable transmission in the Jetstar I, the Jetaway ([[Super Turbine 300]]) two-speed unit with "switch pitch" converter.

With the introduction of the Jetstar 88, the Dynamic 88 models were elevated a rung up the ladder for the 1964 model year. Only the Dynamic 88s could be in five body styles: four-door pillared Celebrity Sedan and hardtop Holiday Sedan, two-door hardtop Holiday Coupe, convertible and 2- or 3-seat Fiesta station wagon. The Jetstar 88 didn't offer a station wagon.

1964 was the last for the Super 88 series, which was limited to the two four-door body styles—the Celebrity Sedan and Holiday Sedan. Total production for both four-door Super 88 models reached 19,514 assemblies for the model year.

[[File:1964 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 Fiesta station wagon, rear left side.jpg|thumb|1964 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 Fiesta station wagon]]
1964 was also the last year for Oldsmobile to offer full-sized station wagons until the 1971 model year. Oldsmobile's full-size Fiesta wagons (and Buick's Estate Wagons) introduced in 1957 had never been strong sellers. From 1960 to 1963, production per model (Super or Dynamic) and seating capacity (six or nine passenger) never broke 15,000 units. The wagons' bodies weren't made by Fisher Body, but were instead farmed out to Ionia Manufacturing Company of Ionia, Michigan. As Oldsmobile set its sights on more luxury and performance, full-sized wagons weren't in the mix. The division introduced a new Vista Cruiser wagon in mid-1964 that featured a raised roofline and skylights over the rear seat and cargo area. The models were offered with six- or nine-passenger seating with all seats facing forward. The Vista Cruiser used a six-inch (152&amp;nbsp;mm) stretched wheelbase version of the intermediate F-85/Cutlass. This allowed Oldsmobile (and Buick, which used the same body and stretch wheelbase for its Sport Wagon) to offer a wagon comparable in overall size to the full-sized Chevrolet Impala and Pontiac Catalina wagons, but without diluting the cachet of its full-size cars with a utilitarian body style.

The '''Delta''' name in 1965 was an upscale trim line of the Dynamic 88, the '''Dynamic 88 Delta''', replacing the previous top-series B-body Olds, the '''Super 88'''. Early '65s were referred to as Dynamic 88 Deltas, but within a few weeks after the start of the model year, Olds began marketing the line as a separate series known as the '''Delta 88.''' Other full-sized Oldsmobile model lines included the low-priced Jetstar 88, the volume-selling Dynamic 88, sporty [[Oldsmobile Jetstar I|Jetstar I]] and the sporty and luxurious [[Oldsmobile Starfire|Starfire]], all riding on a {{convert|123|in|mm|0|sing=on}} wheelbase.

All 1965 Olds models featured all new styling and engineering. The B-body cars featured more rounded styling than previous years with [[Coke bottle styling|Coke-bottle]] profiles and semi-fastback rooflines on Holiday (two-door hardtop) coupes - Jetstar I and Starfire coupes got a more rounded variation of the squared-off 1963–64 roofline with concave rear window shared by Pontiac's Grand Prix.
Also introduced this year was a new 425 cubic-inch Super Rocket V8 with horsepower ratings ranging from 300 to 370 depending on carburation and compression ratio. The new three-speed [[Turbo Hydramatic]] transmission with torque converter replaced the [[GM Roto Hydramatic transmission|Roto Hydramatic]] used since 1961. Also new to the option list for 1965 on all B-body cars was a four-speed [[manual transmission]] with Hurst floor shifter, which was a seldom-ordered offering.

[[File:1966 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Holiday hardtop 4-door sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1966 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Holiday Sedan]]
Few styling changes other than revised grilles and tail sections marked the 1966 full-sized Oldsmobiles. The sporty Jetstar I series was dropped with a lower-priced Starfire only offered as a hardtop coupe taking its place. All other series' 88 models were carried over from 1965 with a new convertible added to the Delta 88 line and the same bodystyle dropped from the Jetstar 88 line.

A new option for all senior Oldsmobiles (88, Ninety-Eight and the new front-drive [[Oldsmobile Toronado|Toronado]]) was GM's automatic Comfortron Air Conditioning system first introduced by Cadillac in 1964. Comfortron permitted the driver to automatically set a year-round temperature at a constant level. The basic Frigidaire air conditioning unit offered in previous years continued as before and becoming an increasingly popular option on full-sized Oldsmobiles. Another new option for 1966 was a Tilt-and-Telescopic steering wheel that could be vertically adjusted to six different positions as well as telescoped outward from the instrument panel to improve driver comfort.

[[File:1967 Oldsmobile Delta 88 HT sedan, Castle Hedingham 2008.jpg|thumb|left|1967 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Holiday Sedan]]
[[File:1967 Oldsmobile Delta 88 coupe rear.jpg|thumb|left|1967 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Custom Holiday Coupe, rear view]]
For 1967, all GM full-size cars received a mid cycle freshening that featured fuller body panels. More rounded styling cues marked all 1967 Olds 88 models which received longer hoods and shorter decks and more sweeping fastback rooflines on 88 Holiday coupes to emulate the styling of Olds' front-wheel-drive flagship, the Toronado.  Olds 88's received a three part front grille made op of a center prow flanked on either side by headlight pods.  For the first time since 1959, the dual headlights were split apart by parking lights.  Taillights for 88's featured a waterfall design. Interiors made extensive use of wood-tone panels, and bright metal finishes were kept to a minimum.

Model wise, there was more name juggling. The '''Delmont 88''' was introduced for 1967 and produced for just two years, replacing both the Jetstar 88 and Dynamic 88 model lines. The Delmont featured the [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#Jetfire Rocket|330 V8]] as standard and the [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#425|425 V8]] as an option in 1967 and the new stroked "Rocket 455" version of the same engine in 1968. The 425 was standard on the Delta 88. The Delta 88 gained a new sub series called the '''Delta 88 Custom''' which had a plusher interior than the standard Delta 88 featuring a Strato bench seat in the Holiday Sedan (four-door hardtop) or, in the Holiday Soupe (two-door hardtop), a choice of either Strato bucket seats with console or Strato bench seat with armrest. The Delta Custom Holiday Coupe was essentially a successor to the former 88-based [[Oldsmobile Starfire|Starfire]] series offered in previous years (1961–66) but with a standard 88 semi-fastback roofline rather than the Starfire's squared off roof with concave rear window.  Another styling cue for the Delta Custom was the addition of a second set of tail light reflectors set into the lower portion of the bumper.

New options for 1967 included front disc brakes, stereo [[8-track tape|8-track]] tape player and a Climate Combustion Control system for Rocket V8s designed to regulate carburetor air temperature, boost fuel economy, speed choke warm up and eliminate winter icing to permit easier starting and more efficient operation in cold weather.

The same assortment of 330 and 425 cubic-inch V8 engines were carried over from 1966, as were most transmission offerings except the optional four-speed manual with Hurst shifter, which was discontinued due to low buyer interest.

[[File:1968 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Holiday Coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1968 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Holiday Coupe]]
For 1968, the overall design was a carry over.  New front end with split grille design that would become an Olds trademark in coming years highlighted all 1968 full-sized Oldsmobiles with horizontal lines on 88's and egg-crate patterns on Ninety-Eights, along with concealed windshield wipers.
 
The Delmont 88 got a larger 350 cubic-inch V8 as standard equipment and the optional V8 that was standard on Delta 88/Custom and Ninety-Eight was jacked up to 455 cubic inches with a {{Convert|390|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} W-33 option primarily designed as part of the division's police package available as an RPO on all 88's. Horsepower ratings of other Olds engines included 250 for the 350 two-barrel standard in the Delmont 88, 310 for the four-barrel 350 optional in the Delmont 88. A 455 two-barrel rated at {{convert|310|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} was standard on the Delta 88/Custom and optional on the Delmont 88. Optional on all 88s was a four-barrel 455 rated at {{convert|365|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} from the larger C-body Ninety-Eight. Both the 350 and 455 two-barrel Rocket V8 engines were designed to use regular gasoline while the optional 350 and 455 four-barrel carburated "Ultra High Compression" Super Rocket V8s required premium fuel.

The 1969 88 series dropped the Delmont name, leaving the Delta 88 as the base model of the series. The '''Delta 88 Royale''' trim, only available on a Holiday Coupe, was added as line-topper above the Delta 88 Custom. It came standard with a more luxurious interior featuring a notchback vinyl upholstered bench seat with armrest or Strato bucket seats with optional center console. For safety, a ceiling mounted shoulder belt was offered in the front seats for both the driver and right passenger. This arrangement provided five belt buckles in the front bench seat. The standard engine in the base Delta 88 was a 350 cu in, low compression ratio (9.0:1) Rocket V8 with a Rochester two-barrel carburetor that was rated at {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,600&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|355|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque ran on leaded regular 94 RON gasoline. Standard on the Delta 88 Custom and Royale models and optional on the base series was a low compression two-barrel version of the 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8 rated at {{Convert|310|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} designed to use regular fuel. Optional on all Delta 88s was the four-barrel Ultra High Compression 455 cubic-inch Super Rocket V8 rated at {{Convert|365|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Top option was the {{Convert|390|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version of the four-barrel 455 V8 designed to run on 98 RON octane fuel available in all Delta 88 models as the W-33 option.

The two-speed Jetaway automatic that was previously offered as an option on the smaller engine 88 models was dropped completely in favor of the GM three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic 400 transmission previously only offered with the larger engines. Also a new GM-designed Variable-Ratio Power Steering system was introduced as an option.

All full-sized Oldsmobiles were completely restyled for 1969 with more squared off bodylines and rooflines for the Holiday coupes and sedans replacing the semi-fastback look of 1967–68, and ventless front windows on all models. Wheelbases were increased by one-inch to {{convert|124|in|m}}. Though the 1969 models were extensively restyled, the basic 1965 chassis design and inner-body structure was retained along with the roofline on the pillared four-door Town sedans.

Inside, headrests were now standard equipment and a new instrument panel included square instruments replacing the round instruments of previous years along with a push-button operated ashtray and rotary glove compartment knob, as well as heating/air conditioning controls relocated from the center of the dash to the left of the steering wheel near the lights and wiper switches. The high-beam lights indicator was a red rocket located on the dash. Also new was a steering column-mounted ignition switch that also locked the steering wheel when not in use – a feature found on all 1969-model General Motors passenger cars, a year before locking steering columns were required by federal mandate starting in 1970.

[[File:1970 Oldsmobile Delta 88 front.jpg|thumb|left|1970 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Town Sedan]]
Only detail changes were made for the 1970 full-sized Oldsmobiles including a new split grille that no longer extended to surround the headlights and a slightly revised rear section. Powertrain selections were carried over from 1969 with both 350 and 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8s now featuring "Positive Valve Rotators" for longer engine life and more efficient operation. A new antenna impregnated into the windshield was introduced this year that replaced the previous fender-mounted unit and was included as standard equipment on all cars equipped with a factory radio. New option this year was a wiper/washer switch mounted in the shift lever knob.  Optional radio was a stereo AM-FM radio and a lower dash mounted eight track tape player.

It reached its maximum size in 1974 at an astounding {{convert|226.9|in|mm|0|sing=on}} in length.  It was available as a pillared four-door Town Sedan, two-door and four-door Holiday hardtops and a convertible. Series models for 1971 included the base Delta 88, Delta 88 Custom and Delta 88 Royale, the latter inheriting the convertible body style previously offered on the base Delta 88. All models received fuselage styling somewhat similar to what Chrysler Corporation introduced on its 1969 models, and new rooflines with a more squared off greenhouse for Town sedans and more rounded lines for Holiday sedans and coupes – the latter receiving reverting to a semi-fastback format.

Also new for 1971 was the [[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser|Custom Cruiser]] station wagon, the first full-sized Oldsmobile wagon since 1964. It used the 88's B-body platform with a longer {{convert|127|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase (matching the larger C-body Ninety-Eight) with multi-leaf spring suspensions that differed entirely from the all-coil suspensions used in sedans and coupes. The Custom Cruiser came standard with the larger 455 Rocket V8 and utilized the disappearing clamshell tailgate of other full-size GM wagons.

Engine offerings again included 350 and 455-cubic-inch Rocket V8s ranging from 250 to 340 gross horsepower, all of which featured lowered compression ratios beginning in 1971 to enable use of lower octane regular leaded 91 RON octane, low-lead or unleaded gasoline. Vented power front disc brakes and variable-ratio power steering were now standard equipment on all 88 models. During the 1971 model year, the Turbo Hydra-matic 400 transmission was added to the standard equipment list.

Other highlights for 1971 included a wrap-around instrument panel shared with Ninety-Eight and Toronado models (Toronados had a slightly smoother upper leading edge design) that was highlighted by a large square speedometer and all controls within easy reach of the driver, and a one-year only Flo-Through ventilation system that utilized vents in the trunklid. The system used on all GM B-, C- and E-body cars and the [[Chevrolet Vega]], used the heater fan to draw air into the car from the cowl intake, and force it out through vents in the trunk lid or tailgate. In theory, passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped, as in heavy traffic. In practice, however, it didn't work.

1971 was the last model year in which a 3-speed manual transmission was offered on full-sized Oldsmobiles; the rarely-ordered option was dropped in 1972.

Within weeks of the 1971 models' debut, however, Oldsmobile—and all other GM dealers—received multiple complaints from drivers who complained the ventilation system pulled cold air into the car before the heater could warm up—and could not be shut off. The ventilation system was extensively revised for 1972.

For 1972, the Delta Custom series was dropped and the Royale series was expanded to include four-door Town and Holiday sedans. Advertised brake horsepower figures dropped to 155 for the base 350 two-barrel and 250 for the optional 455 four-barrel Rocket V8s thanks to an industry-wide switch in power measurements from the previous gross method (as measured by a dynamometer with no accessories attached) to the net method in which the power measurements were based upon an engine "as installed" in a vehicle with all emission controls and accessories hooked up. Only minor trim changes were made this year that included revised "waterfall" grilles in front and four-segment taillights in the rear. Inside a revised "Flo-Through" ventilation system utilizing vents in the [[doorjamb]]s replaced the 1971 version which utilized vents in the trunklid.

For 1973, wider and lower split waterfall grilles flanked a new federally mandated {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} front bumper on all Delta 88 models and larger one-piece rounded rectangular taillights replaced the four-segmented lights of 1972. Engine offerings included a standard 350 Rocket V8 with two-barrel carburetor (150 net horsepower) or optional 455 Rocket V8 with four-barrel carburetion and {{Convert|215|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with single exhaust or {{Convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with dual exhausts. Model offerings were the same as 1972 with the Delta 88 Royale series now including the sole Olds convertible offering following the demise of the intermediate Cutlass Supreme convertible after 1972.

Director [[Sam Raimi]] regularly includes a 1973 Delta 88 in his films. Referred to as "The Classic" by the filmmaker, the car originally belonged to his parents and has made an appearance in the ''[[Evil Dead]]'' trilogy, his ''[[Spider-Man in film|Spider-Man]]'' films with [[Tobey Maguire]], and ''[[Drag Me To Hell]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drees|first1=Rich|title=The Classic: Sam Raimi And The 1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88|url=http://www.filmbuffonline.com/FBOLNewsreel/wordpress/2013/04/09/the-classic-sam-raimi-and-the-1973-oldsmobile-delta-88/|website=FilmBuffOnline|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, a {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} rear bumper was added and taillights reverted to a four-segment design similar to 1972 and the front grilles were narrowed and raised to hood level similar to 1971–72 models. Also, new rooflines were featured on Holiday hardtop coupes with large fixed triangular side windows in the widened "C" pillar.  Unlike the big Chevrolet formal-roof coupes, the Olds retained a small roll-down rear window.  As Oldsmobile completely discontinued two-barrel carbureted engines this year, a new 350 four-barrel Rocket V8 (175 horsepower) became standard equipment with the 455 available as an option. Other highlights this year included an all-new flat instrument panel shared with Ninety-Eight and Toronado models with horizontal sweep speedometer and "Message Center" system of warning lights replacing the wrap-around dash of previous years. A new and seldom-ordered option available on all full-sized Olds models and Toronados was a driver's-side airbag – among the first to be offered in a production automobile. The Delta 88 Royale ragtop was again the only convertible offered by Olds.

Detail changes for 1975 included revised grilles and taillights along with new rear quarter windows for pillared and Holiday sedans – the latter's design similar to an opera window in September 1974. The same assortment of 350 and 455-cubic-inch Rocket V8s were still offered along with a one-year-only (and seldom-ordered) option of a Pontiac-built 400-cubic-inch V8 with two-barrel carburetor and {{convert|170|hp}} rating. All engines were hooked up to a catalytic converter that not only mandated the use of unleaded gasoline but also spelled the end of dual exhaust systems. 1975 was the final year for the Delta 88 Royale convertible, the last of which was built on July 11, 1975. Just under 7200 Delta 88 Royale convertibles were built in 1975 as Oldsmobile made a concerted effort to target the convertible buyer market at the time. The headline on a print ad for a 1975 Olds Delta 88 Royale convertible stated, "Today a beautiful Olds convertible. Tomorrow, a collector's item". The featured car in the ad was a red Delta 88 Royale rag top.

For 1976, the final year of this generation, all Olds 88s received revised grille work, rectangular headlamps and parking lamps directly below instead of in the bumper, with Delta 88 Royale models also getting spring-loaded stand-up hood ornaments. It was also the final year for the Holiday hardtop coupes and sedans, along with the 455 Rocket V8 and the optional airbag system that would generally become universal on production cars and trucks some 15 years later. A one-year only option on Delta 88 Royale Holiday coupes was the Royale Crown Landau package that included a stainless steel roof bar, padded rear quarter vinyl roof, special hood ornament and color-keyed wheelcovers.

The 1977 Delta 88s and other GM B-body cars were considerably downsized from their predecessors in length and wheelbase ({{convert|116|in|mm|abbr=on}} – the same as the four-door 1973–77 A-body Cutlass Sedan) and nearly {{convert|900|lb|abbr=on}} lighter in weight, with curb weights dropping to between {{convert|3500|and|3600|lb|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} depending on model.&lt;ref name='77Specs'&gt;{{cite book |title=1977 Oldsmobile Specs Book |publisher=[[Oldsmobile|Oldsmobile Motor Division]] |date=August 1976 |location=Lansing, Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than a reduction in shoulder room, however, interior room was not adversely affected; in fact, headroom and rear seat legroom increased. Both base Delta 88 and Royale models were now only offered in two pillared body styles; a two-door coupe and a four-door Town Sedan. The 1977–1979 '''[[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser|Custom Cruiser]]''' was now based on the Delta 88's B-body rather than the Ninety-Eight's C-body (thus also sharing the coil spring suspension, rather than the multi-[[leaf spring]]) and came with a two-way tailgate rather than the clamshell of 1971–76 models. A fuel economy gauge was optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1977%20Oldsmobile/1977_Oldsmobile_Full_Size_Brochure/1977%20Oldsmobile%20Full%20Size-23.html |title=1977 Oldsmobile Sales Brochure, Full-size Cars |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard engine was now a {{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine|Buick V6]] with a [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM200|Turbo-Hydramatic 200]] [[automatic transmission]].&lt;ref name='77Service'&gt;{{cite book |title=1977 Oldsmobile Service Manual |publisher=[[Oldsmobile|Oldsmobile Motor Division]] |year=1977 |location=Lansing, Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#260|Oldsmobile 260]] was the base V8, followed by either a Chevrolet 350 (option code LM1) or Oldsmobile 350 (option code L34). Initially, the Oldsmobile engine came in California and high-altitude cars, the Chevrolet engine came in cars with Federal emissions equipment.&lt;ref name='77Specs'/&gt; The Olds engine returned later in the model year. Oldsmobile's new 403 was the top engine option and came with a [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM350|THM350]] transmission.

The use of a Chevrolet engine caused a situation known as the "Chevy-mobile" affair. GM settled with some Oldsmobile owners by offering them warranty extensions for the Chevrolet-engined Oldsmobiles, or the option of returning those cars in exchange for an Oldsmobile with a genuine Rocket V8. The "return car" option wasn't commonly chosen, because the owner had to pay GM for mileage driven, which could become expensive. This began the era of "corporate" engines, and for many years GM advertisements would include a disclaimer stating '"Oldsmobiles (or other divisions) are equipped with engines manufactured by various GM divisions, subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide."'

As in previous years, base Delta 88 and Royale models differed mainly in exterior and interior trim. Base Deltas had a full bench seat available in cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl upholstery, while Royales had a notchback bench seat with armrest or optional 60/40 notchback bench, also available in cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl trim. All 88s featured an all-new instrument panel with a horizontal sweep speedometer and heater/air conditioning controls moved to the center of the dash above the radio from the left side of the dash, and continued with the "Message Center" bank of warning lights. The new dash was highlighted with woodgrain trim. The dimmer switch moved from the floor to the turn-signal lever.

For 1978, a '''Holiday 88''' coupe was added to the lineup, featuring Strato bucket seats along with console and floor shifter, Super Stock wheels and two-tone paint schemes. All 88 models received new grilles and revised taillights with drivetrains the same as 1977 except for the addition of the 350 Diesel V8 to the option list.

The 1979 model year saw the addition of a new Delta 88 Royale Brougham series added to the line, which included plush "pillowed" seat trim similar to the Ninety-Eight. All models again received revised grilles and other minor changes. It was the last year for the 403 [[V8 engine|V8]] as federal fuel-economy mandates spelled the end of larger engines in order to meet those requirements.

For 1980, all 88s got new and more aerodynamic sheetmetal for improved fuel economy highlighted by rounded square taillights similar to mid-70s 88s, but overall dimensions stayed the same and coupes received a revised roofline. New to the engine lineup was the {{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Rocket V8 with four-barrel carburetor and {{convert|150|hp}}. All other engines except the now-discontinued 403 were carried over from 1979.

Only minor grille and taillight lens revisions highlighted the 1981 Delta 88s. The gasoline 350 Rocket V8 was dropped from the option list, leaving only the diesel version available. All other engines including the Buick 231 V6 and Oldsmobile 260 and 307 Rocket V8s were continued. All gasoline engines received GM's new '''Computer Command Control''' engine management system. This system was the forerunner of today's [[OBD-II]] which is standard on all cars sold in the United States. The system read various parameters such as vehicle speed, throttle position, engine speed, coolant temperature, and the oxygen content of the exhaust to provide the correct air/fuel mixture for any given driving condition. Also new for 1981 was GM's [[Turbo-Hydramatic#200-4R|Turbo-Hydramatic 200-4R]] transmission, which added an overdrive gear and torque converter clutch (TCC) to contribute to fuel economy and engine longevity. The sporty Holiday 88 coupe was offered for the last time this year.

The 1982 model year saw only minor trim changes for Delta 88, Royale and Royale Brougham models. The same assortment of engines/transmissions were carried over from previous years though the small 260 V8 was offered for the last time. For 1983, all Oldsmobile 88s received new grilles, hood ornaments and minor trim revisions including new steering wheels. This would be the last year for the base Delta 88 line, leaving only the Royale and Royale Brougham after this year. Engine offerings were down to three, a standard Buick 231 cubic-inch [[V6]], or optional Oldsmobile V8s including the 307 Rocket and 350 Diesel.

For 1984, all Delta 88s were now '''Royale''' or '''Royale Brougham''' models. Styling highlights included new grille inserts and red and amber taillights replacing the red lenses. At mid-year, a new Royale Brougham LS was added to the 88 line almost simultaneous to the introduction of a new and downsized 1985 [[front-wheel drive]] [[Oldsmobile 98|Ninety-Eight]]. With the Ninety-Eight being downsized and converted to front-drive, the '''Royale Brougham LS''' model of the 88 was now the largest and most luxurious [[rear-wheel drive]] car offered by Oldsmobile. Custom Cruiser wagons continued with the same styling changes found on other 88 models.

[[File:81-85 Oldsmobile Delta 88.jpg|thumb|left|1985 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale sedan]]

Only minor changes marked the 1985 model, which was in its last year before a major downsizing and conversion to [[front-wheel-drive]]. The same assortment of models in the Royale, Brougham and Brougham LS continued as before. The '85 88s would be the last full-sized Oldsmobile sedans and coupes to feature rear-wheel-drive, Rocket V8 power, and body-on-frame construction. Though the 88 [[Sedan (car)|sedans]] and [[coupe]]s were downsized and switched to front-drive for 1986, the Custom Cruiser [[station wagon]]s would continue virtually unchanged through the 1990 model year and eventually become the only Oldsmobile model powered by an Oldsmobile Rocket [[V8 engine|V8]] engine, for which production ended in 1990 after 42 years.

For 1986, the '''Delta 88''' switched platforms from the [[GM B platform]] to the smaller [[front-wheel drive]] [[GM H platform (FWD)|H platform]], with a wheelbase of only {{convert|110.8|in|mm|0}}. The headlights changed from square sealed beam quads to integrated regular/high beam composite lamps in 1987. A few [[NASCAR]] teams built racecars with 1986 Delta 88 sheetmetal and ran them on the circuit in the 86-88 seasons, but only one victory (with [[Terry Labonte]]) was scored.

Due to the federal mandate to add passive restraints, door mounted seat belts were added for 1987. For 1988, rear shoulder belts were added. For 1989, the "Delta" name was dropped, as was the hood ornament, leaving the model to simply become the "Eighty Eight," now spelled out instead of using the "88" in numerical form, and deleted the amber color from the taillights. A driver airbag became an available option.

The Eighty Eight was given a mild facelift in 1990, eliminating the former chromed grille for a body-colored fascia with four slots and the Oldsmobile Rocket logo.  In the rear, new taillights and backup lights extended across the body; once again, chrome trim was deleted. Minor revisions were also made to the interior. Part of the door panel was revised and 1990 also offered new cloth for the seats. The Pillow Cushion seats on the Brougham were deleted. A revised armrest console was also added, this one provided more room. As an option was a revised electronic climate control system. A new choice of alloy wheels was an option.

1991 was the last year for the coupe.  The model range during this time was the standard Eighty Eight, the Eighty Eight Royale, and the Eighty Eight Royale Brougham, in ascending order. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/olds/90olds/14.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/olds/86omo/bilder/10.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/olds/86omo/bilder/11.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voice diagnostic system ===
This generation of Delta 88s had an optional voice diagnostic system that alerted the driver of problems.&lt;ref&gt;1989 Oldsmobile full-line sales catalog: The New Generation of Oldsmobile&lt;/ref&gt; The voice was male and computer synthesized.

In the event of a warning, the door chime played three times rapidly and then played the voice alert. This happened twice in case the driver missed the warning the first time. Every alert also had a corresponding light on the instrument cluster.

Warnings included:

* "The engine coolant level is low!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1aauto.com/1A/-/Oldsmobile/Delta88 |title=Oldsmobile Delta 88 Auto Parts, Aftermarket Parts, Car Parts at |publisher=1aauto.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The engine is overheating!  Please stop the engine and consult the owner's manual!"
* "The park brake is not fully released!"
* "The key is in the ignition!" (Upon opening the door with the key inserted into the ignition.)
* "The headlights are on!" (Upon turning off the car with the headlights on.) A light would also appear on the dash.

The Oldsmobile Eighty Eight was redesigned for 1992, following the redesign of the Ninety Eight the previous year. This was the last '''Eighty Eight''' or '''88''' model from Oldsmobile (along with its performance '''LSS''' and '''Regency''' models) before being discontinued in 1999 and being replaced in 2001 with the Aurora. The 3.8&amp;nbsp;L Buick V6 was still the only engine, but output increased to {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|220|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque.

The Eighty-Eight's front and rear were restyled for 1996, and with it the nomenclature was changed from "Eighty Eight Royale" to three models – '''Eighty Eight''', '''Eighty Eight LS''' and '''LSS''' (A "Luxury Sports Sedan" targeted to male European car buyers, available with a supercharged [[V6]] and a floor mounted gear shifter).  It is important to note, however, early LSS models (1995) were rarely equipped with the 3800 Supercharged engine.  The LSS was an originally a trim level package on the 88 starting in 1992. In 1996 the LSS received Aurora-inspired seats. 1996 was the final year that the original-style rocket (in black and silver) appeared on a hood emblem. 1997 would welcome the new Oldsmobile logo on all Eighty-Eight trims except the Regency.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/olds/95_88/95_88.html&lt;/ref&gt;

After the demise of the [[Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight|Ninety-Eight]] in 1996, Oldsmobile added the '''Regency''' to the 1997 and 1998 lineups, which used the same front fenders and chrome grille as the Ninety-Eight sedan but kept the standard Eighty-Eight body. The Regency featured a long list of standard features including traction control, leather upholstery, dual 6-way power seats with power lumbar and a driver's side memory function, a dual-zone automatic climate control system, and an electronic level control for the rear suspension. A driver's side [[electrochromic]] outside mirror was also standard on the Regency, a feature that even [[Cadillac]] didn't offer as standard equipment. The interior day/night auto-dimming mirror was linked to the outside mirror and dimmed both with the same intensity at the same time. Some of these options, like the 2-driver memory feature, were not available on the Eighty-Eight Royale or LSS. 

To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 88/Eighty-Eight nameplate, Oldsmobile offered a special 50th Anniversary Edition of the 1999 Eighty-Eight. This edition included front and rear leather bench seats from the 98/Regency, steering wheel with audio and HVAC controls, the older rocket logo, electronic climate control unit, gold plated badges, and special Anniversary badges on the C-pillars and front door panels.

All four vehicles used the same {{convert|110.8|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase and shared an updated version of the [[GM H platform (FWD)|H-body]]. The suspension tuning, interior appointments, and certain exterior trim was used to differentiate the three models.

'''Engines:'''
* 1992–1994 3.8&amp;nbsp;L (231&amp;nbsp;in³) [[Buick V6 engine#Series I|3800 Series I]] [[V6]], {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}
* 1995–1999 3.8&amp;nbsp;L (231&amp;nbsp;in³) [[Buick V6 engine#Series II|3800 Series II]] V6, {{convert|205|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}
* 1995 3.8&amp;nbsp;L (231&amp;nbsp;in³) [[Buick V6 engine#L67 Supercharged|supercharged 3800 Series I]] V6, {{convert|225|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} which was only installed on 100 vehicles of its kind.
* 1996–1999 3.8&amp;nbsp;L (231&amp;nbsp;in³) [[Buick V6 engine#Series II|supercharged 3800 Series II]] V6, {{convert|240|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}

From 1992 to 1999, Eighty Eight models were produced in [[Lake Orion, Michigan]], [[Flint, Michigan]], and [[Wentzville, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.copart.com/lot/32443257/Photos&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Year-to-year changes:'''
* 1992: The redesign. Models included the Eighty-Eight Royale and the Eighty-Eight Royale LS. The 1992 full line Oldsmobile factory brochure makes brief mention of the LSS (Luxury Sport Sedan) model in one small photo, yet it doesn't appear later in the options summary. 
* 1993: Trunk mounted key cover emblem removed. The Eight Eight LSS returned with better factory promotion of its sporty option package that included: Bucket seats (a pair of right-hand halves of the standard 60/40 split bench seat), steering wheel audio and HVAC controls, floor shifter and center console (borrowed from the previous generation Pontiac Bonneville SSE) in the interior, and full instrumentation for the dash. Sixteen inch alloy wheels, higher spring rates and larger diameter stabilizer bars for the front and rear suspension gave the LSS a firm ride and more controlled handling. 
* 1994: The first facelift: Front grille and headlamps were redesigned, 'sculpted' aluminum turbine rims were made available.  A major redesign to the dash added a passenger side airbag and made it less cluttered and more modern. 
* 1995: The 3.8L [[V6 engine]] was bumped from {{convert|170|hp|abbr=on}} to {{convert|205|hp|abbr=on}}.  All models shared this same 3.8L engine. The optional L67 3800 Supercharged engine, making {{convert|225|hp|abbr=on}}, was made an available option for the LSS, and later other models. First OEM GPS system introduced by any manufacturer, as an option the Oldsmobile Guidestar.&lt;ref&gt;http://autosofinterest.com/2015/05/01/1995-oldsmobile-guidestar-navigation-system/&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1996: The second facelift: New front grille and new round headlights, all body trim was changed to give the car a cleaner, more aerodynamic appearance.  Tailamps and rear reflector bar were slightly reshaped.  All models were renamed from ''Eighty Eight Royale'' to ''Eighty Eight'' and ''Eighty Eight LS'' ([LS] which migrated from an 88 Royale trim).  The LSS continued with the same changes to the exterior as other models, the addition of Aurora styled seats, but the same center console was retained for one more year. The supercharged LSS engine was bumped from {{convert|225|hp|abbr=on}} to {{convert|240|hp|abbr=on}}.
* 1997: An upscale, "fully loaded" version of the Eighty-Eight was introduced as the ''Oldsmobile Regency'' to satisfy previous [[Oldsmobile 98#1991–1996|Ninety-Eight]] buyers. All Oldsmobile Eighty Eight and LSS models (except for the Regency) changed badges from the '80s Oldsmobile "Rocket" logo to the 1997–2004 Oldsmobile "Rocket Oval" logo, inspired by the Aurora's logo. The center console on bucket seat cars was also redesigned to fit up against the lower part of the dash, allowed for rear passenger vents, and 2 cup holders for front the occupants.
* 1998: Last year for the Regency which kept the old "Rocket" logo. The last Oldsmobile Regency rolled off the assembly line on June 18, 1998.
* 1999: Last year for both Eighty Eight and LSS models. This was also the last Oldsmobile sedan to have 6-passenger seating as an option. The last Oldsmobile LSS was produced on September 23, 1998. The last Oldsmobile Eighty Eight 50th Anniversary Edition was manufactured on January 6, 1999.

===Oldsmobile Guidestar===

The Guidestar system was designed off of the previous TravTek [[Automotive_navigation_system|GPS]] that Oldsmobile developed with [[Avis_Rent_a_Car|Avis]] and [[American_Automobile_Association|AAA]],that was tested in the 1990-1992 [[Oldsmobile_Toronado|Oldsmobile Toronado Trofeo]]. Once the Toronado was discontinued after 1992, the Oldsmobile division continued working on the system as the Guidestar using the newly acquired [[Hughes_Electronics|Hughes Electronics division]]  and [[Electronic_Data_Systems|EDS]]. The Oldsmobile Guidestar was a hard disk-based system  that offered satellite navigation for 17 states but lacked live traffic updates. The states were California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Virginia. It was a 2000 dollar option, plus 400 dollar per map cartridge. In 1995 it was the first on-board navigation system to be offered on a US production car, the 1995 Oldsmobile 88.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.outrightolds.com/index.php/spotlight-on/early-gps-systems&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://autosofinterest.com/2015/05/01/1995-oldsmobile-guidestar-navigation-system/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jesda.com/2012/01/11/how-in-dash-navigation-worked-in-1992-olds-was-first/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oldsmobile Silhouette''' is a [[minivan]] which was produced by [[General Motors]] for model years 1990 through 2004. Production was ceased as a direct result of General Motors discontinuing the [[Oldsmobile]] brand in 2004. The Silhouette was replaced by the [[Saturn Relay]] and the [[Buick Terraza]] for the 2005 model year.

==Background==
[[General Motors]]' first attempt at producing a [[minivan]] to compete with the [[Chrysler minivans (S)|Chrysler minivans]], the [[rear wheel drive]], truck-based [[Chevrolet Astro]] and its twin, the [[Chevrolet Astro|GMC Safari]] failed to make a noticeable dent in Chrysler's near monopoly of the minivan market in the 1980s, so this second attempt was made. The 1989 Oldsmobile Silhouette and its sibling models, while more successful than the Astro/Safari due in terms of market share, had unconventional "[[Dustbuster]]" styling that ultimately limited its appeal and sales.

==Original concept==
First shown to the public in 1986, the [[Pontiac Trans Sport]] [[concept car]] was well received. It featured futuristic styling, individually removable bucket seats with built-in stereo speakers, a [[gull-wing doors|gull-wing]] rear passenger door and extensive use of glass including a glass-paneled roof as well as many other "dream car" features.

Based on the warm reception the concept vehicle received, the Pontiac Trans Sport was approved for production, but as is often the case, the styling and features showcased on the concept did not make the translation to the mass-produced edition. The gullwing door was deemed too expensive to produce and would probably have impacted overhead doors in suburban garages. The glass roof was too heavy and expensive, so the resultant production vehicle made-do with high-gloss black painted panels for the roof to suggest the glass canopy of the concept.

Chevrolet and Oldsmobile were also given production vehicles based on the Trans Sport to cover the widest range of customers. It was intended that the Lumina APV would be the value-priced version, The Trans Sport would net the more "sport &amp; style" oriented buyers, and the Silhouette would compete with the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] for the premium, luxury market.

[[File:1991 Oldsmobile Silhouette 3.1 (14670148722).jpg|thumb|left|1991 Oldsmobile Silhouette rear]]
The very first 1990 Oldsmobile Silhouette rolled off the assembly line on August 1, 1989.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Assembled in [[General Motors]]' now-closed  [[North Tarrytown Assembly]] assembly facility, these [[GM U platform|U platform]] vans consisted of a [[galvanized steel]] [[space frame]] wrapped in composite plastic body panels that were impervious to rust and minor dents and dings, a manufacturing technique developed on the [[Pontiac Fiero]] and also used extensively on General Motors' [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]] line of vehicles.

The Silhouette was available with seating for seven, with the five lightweight ({{convert|34|lb|kg|abbr=on}}) rear seats being individually reconfigurable and removable. In 1994 built-in child seats were added to the option list, which provided the ability to switch two of the rear seats between adult and child seating with the pull of a seat-mounted tab.

Included with the level ride package, which utilized a compressor and air-pressurized rear shock absorbers to maintain vehicle height regardless of load, was a control panel and air hose kit that allowed the vehicle to be used to inflate tires, air mattresses, sporting equipment and such.

In 1994, a remote-controlled power sliding door feature was added, a General Motors innovation.

For the 1994 and 1995 model years, [[traction control system|traction control]] was available with the [[GM 3800 engine|3800]] engine option.

The first generation Silhouette was not available in [[Canada]].

===Europe===
Europeans grew accustomed to sleek minivans thanks to the [[Renault Espace]] and did not object to the futuristic styling. For the European market however, the Oldsmobile Silhouette was sold as the Pontiac Trans Sport by replacing the Oldsmobile badging with Pontiac badging, along with Pontiac wheels. Sales in Europe were good for an American import, but did not represent enough volume to make a fourth, distinct model economically feasible. The [[Pontiac Trans Sport]] of [[Europe]] was discontinued in 1997. Its successors were both the [[Chevrolet Trans Sport]] (Second gen [[Pontiac Trans Sport]] rebadged as a Chevrolet) (LWB), and the [[Opel Sintra]] (SWB). In the United Kingdom, it was sold as the [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] Sintra.

===Engines===
*1989–1995 [[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#LG6|LG6 3.1]] ({{convert|191|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}) [[V6]]

*1996 [[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#LA1|LA1 3400]] ({{convert|207|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}) [[V6]]

===Modest sales success===
The design of these minivans was controversial. At the time that the Oldsmobile Silhouette and its siblings were conceived, no one had tried to market a stylish or sporty minivan, and GM felt that this represented a potentially large market segment. They styled these minivans to be lower and sleeker than the competing brands. The extremely large, long and sloped windshield and the resultant long distance to the base of the windshield when sitting in the drivers seat made for a disconcerting driving experience until a person could adjust to the "different" proportions. Automotive magazines christened the new minivans "dustbuster" after a household appliance with a similar profile.

The first engine in these vans was a meager 3.1&amp;nbsp;L V6, that produced only {{Convert|120|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, which was not up to the task of hauling these fairly heavy vehicles.

In 1992, the Silhouette and its siblings received the {{Convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.8&amp;nbsp;L [[GM 3800 engine|3800]] V6 as an option, which provided better torque and acceleration, making them the most powerful as well as best handling minivans then in production.

Production of first generation Silhouettes and stablemates ended in 1996, at which time the [[Tarrytown, NY]] plant which produced them and which had been in operation since 1900, was shuttered and scheduled for demolition. The final 1st generation U-body Oldsmobile Silhouette rolled off the assembly line on May 17, 1996.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

===Year to year changes===
[[File:1st-Oldsmobile-Silhouette.jpg|thumb|right|1990–1992 Oldsmobile Silhouette]]

* '''1990''' - All new model- The Silhouette in keeping with its positioning as GM's luxury minivan offering is available with optional leather seating, a feature not available on its platform mates and available only on the [[Chrysler Town and Country]] among competing manufacturer's models.
* '''1991''' - Customer complaints regarding glare reflected on the interior of the windshield from the massive expanse of dashboard lead to the addition of black carpeting in lieu of the more reflective plastic used in the previous year.
* '''1992'''
**Newly available for 1992 was GM's [[GM 3800 engine|3800]] V6 engine coupled with a [[Hydra-Matic]] [[Turbo-Hydramatic 125#Turbo-Hydramatic 440-T4|4T60-E]] 4-speed electronically controlled [[automatic transmission]].
**The cowl-mounted fixed radio antenna was eliminated, and an integrated roof antenna was installed, sandwiched between the roof and the [[Headliner (material)|headliner]].
**Side view mirrors were changed to the folding type, and were enlarged to provide better rear visibility.
**Brakes were enlarged and anti-lock brakes ([[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]]) were added as standard equipment.
**A pop-up sunroof was added to the options list.
**Steering wheel-mounted controls for the stereo system were added as an option.

{{Original research|date=May 2011}}
The redesigned 1997 Silhouette was built at [[Doraville Assembly]]. The first 1997 Silhouette rolled off the assembly line on August 6, 1996.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Canadian sales began as a 1998 model. Unlike the Venture and Trans Sport/Montana, the roof rack was standard on all Silhouettes. GM continued to offer the Silhouette as their premium luxurious minivan, the Montana as the sporty one, and the Venture as the basic version. The base model (only offered for 1997) was the only model to offer short-wheelbase and a driver side sliding door being only optional, when all the other trim levels of the Silhouette were in long-wheelbase extended version and offered a standard driver side sliding door.

Having achieved second place in sales to Chrysler, General Motors brought out an entirely new [[GM U platform|U platform]] series of minivans, theoretically based{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} on the lessons learned from its previous mis-steps. Still stinging from the criticism {{Who|date=May 2011}} of the "[[dustbuster]]" minivans, the new Silhouette would be completely conventional in all respects. The vehicle would be of steel [[unibody]] construction, and styling would be as conservative as possible. The previous generation was a little too large{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} for comfortably navigating [[Europe]]an streets, so this new range of models would be narrower and slightly smaller than was the norm for the [[United States]] in order to produce a single range of [[minivan]]s that GM hoped would fill the needs of both the [[North America]]n and [[Europe]]an markets.

New for this generation, [[cabin air filter]]s were installed, and the filters can be accessed from behind an access panel easily accessed from inside the glove compartment.

During the development of this generation of the [[GM U platform|U-body]] minivan, General Motors extensively [[Benchmarking|benchmark]]ed {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}the then current [[Chrysler minivans (AS)|Chrysler minivans]]. The resultant vehicles more closely resembled the immensely successful trio of [[Chrysler minivans]]; However, Chrysler would launch a [[Chrysler minivans (NS)|completely redesigned minivan line]] a year before GM.

[[File:Oldsmobile Silhouette rear.jpg|thumb|left|Back end of 2001-2004 model]]
Two different wheelbase lengths were offered as well as dual sliding doors. Silhouettes, in keeping with their luxury positioning, offered many features as standard that were optional on competing makes and on its platform mates. In 1998, it became one of the first vehicles on the market to offer a [[VCR]] with overhead retractable [[LCD]] screen for back seat viewing, which has since become a "must-have" option for families with children. For 2001, the Silhouette received a minor facelift that included a new grille and front bumper.

===Safety===

[[File:1997 Pontiac Trans Sport SE IIHS.jpg|thumb|left|The 1997 [[Pontiac Trans Sport]] crash-tested by the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]]]

The minivan received a "Poor" rating by the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]. Some comments made by the IIHS after the first test in 1997 were:
* Major collapse of the occupant compartment left little survival space for the driver.
* Extreme steering wheel movement snapped the dummy's head backward.
* The unnatural position of the dummy's left foot indicates that an occupant's left leg would have been seriously injured in a real-world crash of this severity.
* The forces on the left lower leg were so high that the dummy's metal foot broke off at the ankle.

The [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] gave the van 4 stars for driver protection and 3 stars for passenger protection in the {{convert|35|mph|km/h||abbr=on}} frontal impact test. In the side impact test, it received 5 stars for front passenger protection, and 5 stars rear passenger protection.

The safety issues of the Silhouette and other second generation U-body minivans were addressed with the third generation redesign, which earned the  highest rating of "Good" given by the Insurance Institute in the frontal offset crash test.

===Mixed sales success===
The Silhouette and its platform mates achieved slightly better sales than their avant-garde predecessors, but also failed to capture a significant share of the market.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The Silhouette was a close competitor in many of the categories deemed of importance, but was a winner in luxury, first in the world to offer factory video screen, the minivan market had become significantly more crowded with competing products that proved to be more desirable and throughout its production it was widely considered a second-tier competitor, certainly competent but not a stand-out in any category.

The Silhouette remained in production until the 2004 model year with minimal changes. The [[Oldsmobile]] division of [[General Motors]] was shut down and no Oldsmobiles were produced after the 2004 model year. The final Oldsmobile Silhouette rolled off the assembly line on March 31, 2004.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The spiritual successor to the Oldsmobile Silhouette within the General Motors lineup is the [[Buick Terraza]] (2005-2007), which was built on an updated version of the U platform and occupied the luxury minivan slot previously occupied by the Silhouette. Due to poor sales of all the third-generation GM minivans, GM decided to exit the minivan market altogether.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Production of the Buick Terraza and [[Saturn Relay]] ended after the 2007 model year and for the  [[Chevrolet Uplander]], production ceased in the United States after the 2008 model year and focused on the new [[crossover vehicle]] market. However, production of the Uplander continued on for one more year (along with the [[Pontiac Montana SV6]]) in Mexico and Canada due to slightly better sales in those countries. Had the Oldsmobile division not been discontinued it would be likely that the Silhouette would have been kept for the third generation of the GM minivans.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

The '''Oldsmobile Cutlass''' was a range of [[automobile]]s produced by [[General Motors]]' [[Oldsmobile]] division between 1961 and 1999. At its introduction, the Cutlass was Oldsmobile's smallest model; it began as a [[unibody]] [[compact car]], but saw its greatest success as a [[body-on-frame]] [[intermediate car|intermediate]].

Introduced as the top trim level in Oldsmobile's compact '''F-85''' line, the Cutlass evolved into a distinct series of its own, spawning numerous variants, including the formidable [[Oldsmobile 4-4-2|4-4-2]] [[muscle car]] in 1964, premium  [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme|Cutlass Supreme]] in 1966, and outright performance [[Oldsmobile Hurst/Olds|Hurst/Olds]] in 1968, as well as the [[Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser|Vista Cruiser]] [[station wagon]].

By the 1980s, Oldsmobile was using the Cutlass as a sub-[[marque]], with numerous vehicle lines bearing the name simultaneously. These included the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais|Cutlass Calais]] [[compact car|compact]], the [[mid-size car|midsize]] [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera|Cutlass Ciera]], the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Cruiser|Cutlass Cruiser]] [[station wagon]], and top of the line [[mid-size car|midsize]] Cutlass Supreme.

Oldsmobile first used the Cutlass name on an experimental sports [[coupe]] designed in 1954. It rode a {{convert|110|in|mm|adj=on|abbr=on}} wheelbase, and featured a dramatic [[fastback]] roofline and stock [[Oldsmobile V8 engine|V8]]. Its platform was similar to the compact F-85 introduced seven years later.

General Motors began developing its first [[compact car]]s in 1956, beginning with initial planning on what would become the [[Chevrolet Corvair]] in 1960. The following year a second series of somewhat larger cars was planned for [[Buick]], Oldsmobile, and [[Pontiac]]; what would be termed "senior compacts". They would share the same body shell and lightweight engine. Oldsmobile designer [[Irvin Rybicki]] began work on the Olds model in 1957. It finally went on sale in 1960 as a 1961 model.

The Oldsmobile '''F-85''' shared a new [[GM Y platform#First Y platform (1960–1964)|Y-body]] platform with the [[Buick Special]] and [[Pontiac Tempest]], using a 112-inch (2845&amp;nbsp;mm) wheelbase and still-novel [[unibody]] construction. It was Oldsmobile's smallest, cheapest model—some two feet (60&amp;nbsp;cm) shorter and $451 less  than the next-smallest Olds, the full-sized [[Oldsmobile 88|Dynamic 88]]. The F-85 had [[double wishbone]] front suspension and a four-link [[live axle]] in the rear, suspended with [[coil spring]]s all around; the [[drum brake]]s had a diameter of {{convert|9.5|in|mm}}. Unlike its platform mates, the first-generation F-85 was only ever offered with a V8 engine. Standard engine was the new ''Rockette'' [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#Aluminum 215|{{convert|215|cuin|l|1|abbr=on}} all-aluminum V8]], Oldsmobile's version of the [[Buick V8 engine#Buick small-block|Buick aluminum V8]] which later became famous as the [[Rover V8]]. With a two-barrel [[carburetor]] and an 8.75:1 [[compression ratio]], it was rated {{convert|155|bhp|kW PS}} at 4,800&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|210|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3,200&amp;nbsp;rpm.&lt;ref name="MT 1961 F-85"&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Motor Trend]] |title=Full range road test—Olds F-85 |date=February 1961 |pages=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifications for the base engine remained the same throughout the 1961–1963 production run.

===1961===
The first-year F-85 was offered in two body styles, a four-door sedan or a four-door [[station wagon]] with either two or three seats,  and in a choice of two trim levels, base or De Luxe. Transmission options were initially a 3-speed manual (with [[synchromesh]] on the top two gears)&lt;ref name="CL 1963 F-85" /&gt; and the newly introduced 3-speed [[Roto Hydramatic]]. Overall length was {{convert|188.2|in|mm}}, and curb weight was around {{convert|2800|lb|kg}}. A few months after the model introduction, Oldsmobile added a "power pack option", which included a four-barrel carbureted, high-compression (10.25:1), dual exhaust version of the 215 cu in aluminum V8, and a shorter 3.36:1 [[final drive ratio]] with either manual and automatic transmissions.&lt;ref name="MT 1961 F-85" /&gt; This premium fuel-only engine was rated at {{convert|185|hp|kW PS}} at 4,800&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|230|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3,200&amp;nbsp;rpm.&lt;ref name="MT 1961 Cutlass"&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Motor Trend]] |title=Oldsmobile's F-85 Cutlass |date=July 1961 |pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial sales were somewhat disappointing, but were soon picked up by the May 1961 introduction of a pair of [[Pillar (car)|pillared]] two-door coupes, each with a different roofline and market placement: the F-85 Club Coupe, which became the lowest-priced Oldsmobile model, and the sporty '''F-85 Cutlass'''. The Cutlass came equipped with the 185&amp;nbsp;hp "power pack" drivetrain, and featured De Luxe-type exterior trim with , a more upscale interior with standard [[bucket seat]]s, upholstered in two-tone vertically pleated vinyl, and an optional center console.&lt;ref name="MT 1961 Cutlass" /&gt; 80,347 F-85s were built in total for the 1961 model year.
[[File:1962 Oldsmobile F-85 Club Coupe rear.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of a 1962 Oldsmobile F-85 Club Coupe]]

''[[Car Life]]'' magazine tested an F-85 with the standard engine and automatic transmission, and recorded a 0-60 (0–96&amp;nbsp;km/h) time of 14.5 seconds, with a top speed just over {{convert|100|mph|km/h}}. They praised its construction, but found its steering too slow and its suspension too soft for enthusiastic driving.
{{clear left}}

===1962===
For 1962 styling changes were minor, and included a new grille, different chrome ornamentation on the bodysides and new interior trim. The existing F-85 models returned, and a convertible was added to the line-up in September, available in both standard and Cutlass versions. The automatic transmission was replaced with an upgraded 4 speed Roto 5 Hydro-Matic transmission, and an all-synchromesh four-speed manual became optional. Overall F-85 sales rose to 97,382, with the Cutlass displacing the four-door De Luxe sedan as the top-selling model.

The bigger news was the arrival of the '''Oldsmobile Jetfire''', a Cutlass pillarless hardtop with a [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] version of the 215 V8, dubbed ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#Turbo-Rocket|Turbo-Rocket]]''. This made the 1962 Jetfire the [[List of automotive superlatives#Firsts|first ever turbocharged production car]], an honor it shares with the 1962 [[Chevrolet Corvair|Chevrolet Corvair Monza Spyder]]. Equipped with a [[Garrett AiResearch]] turbocharger and a sidedraft, one-barrel, blow-through carburetor, the Turbo-Rocket engine was rated at {{convert|215|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,600&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|300|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 3,200&amp;nbsp;rpm.
The Jetfire came with bucket seats and console, unique trim—two chrome fins on the hood and full-length contrast stripes on the bodysides—and a [[pressure/vacuum gauge]] mounted in the console (where it was almost hidden). Although much faster than a standard F-85, the Jetfire was criticized for having the same soft suspension as its less-powerful brothers, for its lack of a [[tachometer]] and other instruments, and for the poor shift quality of both the automatic transmission and the optional four-speed. ''[[Car and Driver]]'' tested an automatic Jetfire and obtained a 0–60 time of 9.2 seconds, with a top speed of 110&amp;nbsp;mph (176&amp;nbsp;km/h). The Jetfire's high cost (nearly $300 over a standard Cutlass hardtop) and reliability problems with its turbocharged engines limited sales to 3,765.

{{original research|paragraph|date=April 2017}}
Ultimately the Jetfire engine was far ahead of its time. With forced induction and an already high compression ratio the Jetfire was capable of producing more torque than a naturally aspirated engine that was twice its size, significantly improving the engine's efficiency and usability in real-life driving conditions, turbo lag not being an issue at motorway speeds. But since turbo and supercharging the engine essentially means forcing the compression in the combustion chamber even higher, the Jetfire was prone to 'spark-knock' and without modern engine management systems the only way to mitigate this was to use a [[MW50|50/50 mixture of methanol and distilled water]].

===1963===
The F-85 was restyled for the 1963 model year, to a crisper, more squared off design than the one of the 1961–62 models. While the wheelbase was unchanged at 112 inches, the new sheetmetal added {{convert|4|in|mm}} to the F-85's rear overhang, increasing overall length to {{convert|192.2|in|mm}}. The Jetfire and its turbocharged V8 returned, for what would be its final year. Three-row seating was dropped on station wagons. On automatic transmission models only, the compression ratio of the "Cutlass" engine was raised to 10.75:1, pushing output to {{convert|185|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4800&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|235|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3200&amp;nbsp;rpm. A Delcotron [[alternator]] became standard on all models, as well as on the rest of the Oldsmobile car line.&lt;ref name="CL 1963 F-85"&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Car Life]] |date=November 1962 |page=40 |title=Introducing the '63 cars—Oldsmobile F-85, Cutlass &amp; Jetfire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall sales climbed again to 121,639, of which 53,492 were Cutlasses.

Disappointing sales of the compact F-85, along with the introduction of [[Ford Motor Company]]'s [[mid-size car|intermediate]] [[Ford Fairlane (North America)|Fairlane]] in 1962, prompted GM to enlarge the senior compacts for the 1964 model year.

===1964===
The new intermediate F-85 now rode a conventional [[body-on-frame]] chassis with a perimeter frame which it shared with the newly-introduced "A-body" [[Chevrolet Chevelle]], and upgraded [[Buick Special]] and [[Pontiac Tempest]]. Wheelbase grew to {{convert|115|in|mm}}, overall length to {{convert|203|in|mm}}, and weight by more than {{convert|300|lb|kg}}. Both the aluminum V8 and the Roto Hydramatic were discontinued in favor of a new cast-iron small-block V8 of {{convert|330|cuin|L|abbr=on}} displacement and an optional two-speed [[Super Turbine 300|Jetaway]] automatic transmission with variable-pitch [[stator]]. Buick's {{convert|225|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine|V6]] was the standard engine.

The body styles of the previous model returned, and a new [[Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser|Vista Cruiser]], a stretched-wheelbase ({{convert|120|in|mm}}) version of the standard station wagon featuring a raised rear roof with tinted skylights and a fold-down, forward-facing third seat, debuted on February 4, 1964. The [[Oldsmobile 4-4-2|4-4-2]] model, derived from the BO-9 police package, was also introduced in March 1964 (costing $285.14 in 1964),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunnell|first=John|title=standard catalog of American Muscle Cars 1960–1972|year=2006|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=0-89689-433-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an answer to the new intermediate muscle car market created by the [[Pontiac GTO]] that same year.

Sales increased to 167,002 for 1964, not counting Vista Cruisers.

===1965===
[[File:1965 Oldsmobile F-85 2dr coupe rear right.jpg|thumb|left|1965 Oldsmobile F-85 V6 Sports Coupe]]
For 1965 a modest facelift increased overall length to {{convert|204.3|in|mm}} while the front end received a "dumbbell-style" grille similar to full-sized Olds models. A bigger 400&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in (6.6&amp;nbsp;L) engine was included with the [[Oldsmobile 4-4-2|4-4-2]] option, based on the newly introduced 425&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in (6.9&amp;nbsp;L) engine from the full-sized Oldsmobiles while the Buick 225 V6 and Olds 330 Jetfire Rocket V8 were carried over from the previous year, with increased power ratings for the V8 options. Sales increased again to 187,097. The year 1965 was the first for Oldsmobile's "Rocket" logo that would last, with minor variations, until the 1990s.

===1966===
[[File:1966 Oldsmobile F-85 Deluxe four-door sedan (10754223263).jpg|thumb|left|1966 Oldsmobile F-85 Deluxe four-door sedan]]
The 1966 models were slightly restyled again, with body lines similar to the full-sized [[Oldsmobile 88|88]], and semi-fastback rooflines with extended sail panels and tunneled rear windows on Sport (pillared) and Holiday (hardtop) coupes. The Buick V6 was replaced on base models by an Oldsmobile-badged "Action-Line 6" version of Chevrolet's {{convert|250|cuin|L|abbr=on}} [[Chevrolet straight-6 engine|"Turbo-Thrift"]] [[straight-6]] engine, while the {{convert|330|cuin|L|abbr=on}} Jetfire Rocket V8 continued with power ratings of {{convert|250|and|320|hp}}. New that year was the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme|Cutlass Supreme]] four-door hardtop sedan also dubbed the Holiday Sedan by Oldsmobile, the first such body style for Olds' intermediate line.

===1967===
[[File:1967 Oldsmobile Cutlass 4 d. hardtop.jpg|thumb|right|1967 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme Holiday Sedan]]
Changes for 1967 included the availability of optional [[disc brake]]s and the three-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] to supplement the two-speed Jetaway. A new option was the '''Turnpike Cruiser''' package on Cutlass Supreme coupes and convertibles, which used a two-barrel carburetor and mild [[camshaft]] with the 400&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in (6.6 L) engine and a (numerically) low axle ratio for efficient and relatively economical freeway cruising. The Turnpike Cruiser used the heavy-duty suspension of the 4-4-2, and was available only with a Turbo-Hydramatic.

===1968===
The F-85/Cutlass underwent a major body restyle in 1968, as did all other GM A-body cars. Oldsmobile's was penned by the styling studio headed by [[Stan Wilen]]. Two-door and four-door models now rode different wheelbases: {{convert|112|in|mm}} for two-doors and {{convert|116|in|mm}} for four-doors. Ostensibly, this change was to allow more individual styling, although several engineers were quoted off the record as saying the {{convert|115|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase had created problems with uncomfortable "freeway hop" owing to its resonance frequency. Overall length shrunk about {{convert|2.6|in|mm}}, but curb weight rose approximately {{convert|75|lb|kg}} to {{convert|3465|lb|abbr=on}} for the hardtop coupe. Two-door F-85 and Cutlass models adopted a semi-[[fastback]] roofline.

Base model remained the F-85, with mid-level Cutlass S, and upscale [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme|Cutlass Supreme]], as well as the 4-4-2, which became a distinct model instead of an option package. A limited-production model was the [[Oldsmobile Hurst/Olds|Hurst/Olds]], a special 4-4-2 marketed by Oldsmobile and [[Hurst Performance]]. The H/O combined the 4-4-2 suspension package with a {{convert|455|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Rocket V8, not ordinarily offered in Cutlasses because of a GM policy limiting intermediates to engines of {{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} or less. Cutlass and Vista Cruiser station wagons were likewise redesigned; the F-85 wagon was discontinued.

Engine options were similar to the previous year, although the Cutlass's [[V8 engine|V8]] option was expanded to {{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}, still with both two- and four-barrel carburetion. The variable-pitch [[stator (turbine)|stator]] feature of both optional two-speed Jetaway and three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic [[automatic transmission]]s was discontinued.

===1969===
[[File:Oldsmobile Cutlass Convertible.jpg|thumb|left|1969 Oldsmobile Cutlass S Convertible]]
The 1969 F-85/Cutlass models received only minor trim changes from their '68 counterparts such as a now-Olds trademark split grille with vertical bars and vertical taillights. Per federal safety regulations, headrests were now standard equipment and the ignition switch moved from the instrument panel to the steering column to lock the steering wheel when not in use, in common with all other 1969-model GM cars, one year before the locking steering columns were federally mandated.

Engine offerings were unchanged from 1968, but a new three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic 350 transmission was added to the option list and available with all versions of the {{convert|350|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} Rocket V8, including the standard two-barrel {{convert|350|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} version, four-barrel "Ultra High Compression" {{convert|310|hp|kW|abbr=on}} option and the W-31 option, conservatively rated at {{convert|325|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Hot Rod Magazine |date=March 1986 |page=54}}{{verify source|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-speed Jetaway automatic was still available with the Chevy-built {{convert|250|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} "Action-Line" six or the two-barrel {{convert|350|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8. The Turnpike Cruiser two-barrel {{convert|400|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} Rocket V8 was dropped and the four-barrel 400 engine from the 4-4-2 was available only in the Vista Cruiser wagons.

===1970===
[[File:1970 Olds Cutlass Sport.jpg|thumb|left|1970 Oldsmobile Cutlass S Sport Coupe]]
[[File:70 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme (9680860813).jpg|thumb|left|From 1970 the Cutlass Supreme Holiday Coupe wore a unique notchback roofline.]]
The 1970 F-85 and Cutlass was available in seven body styles, three of which were coupes: a pillared [[fastback]] Sports Coupe (in F-85, Cutlass S or [[Oldsmobile 4-4-2|4-4-2]] trims), an hardtop fastback Holiday Coupe (Cutlass S and 4-4-2 only), and finally a more formal [[notchback]] Holiday Coupe, only offered in [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme|Cutlass Supreme]] trim. This practice was similar to that followed at the time by Ford and Mercury for theirintermediates, which were offered in both notchback and fastback coupes starting in 1968. Also available were a four-door hardtop Holiday Sedan, a four-door Town Sedan, a convertible, a flat-top station wagon called the Custom Cruiser, as well as the fancier [[Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser|Vista-Cruiser]] station wagon. Counting all trim level and body style permutations, Oldsmobile's 1970 lineup included 15 different intermediate models.

With GM tossing out the 400 cubic-inch limit for intermediates and the 4-4-2 now coming standard with the larger 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8 from the big Oldsmobiles and previously used in the 1968-69 Hurst/Olds, Olds discontinued the 400 engine entirely and also offered the 455 as an option in the Cutlass S models and the Vista Cruiser wagons. There was an SX option that became available in 1970 and was available only on the Cutlass Supreme hardtop and convertible.  The SX cars all had the 455 engine and TH-400 automatic transmission.

The same assortment of three- and four-speed manual transmissions were carried over from previous years with Hurst shifters used on floor-mounted three-speeds and all four-speeds. The two-speed Jetaway automatic transmission was discontinued entirely with the three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic now the sole offering for shiftless driving. Cutlass S coupes with the optional Strato bucket seats and Turbo Hydra-matic could be equipped with the [[Hurst Dual-Gate]] shifter (also known as the "His and Her-Shifter") in conjunction with the extra-cost center console. The Hurst Dual-Gate made it possible to either put the transmission in Drive, and let the transmission decide when to shift. Or it could be placed in a manual mode, much like today's computer-controlled automatics.

[[File:1970 Oldsmobile Rallye 350 (28832594266).jpg|thumb|right|1970 Oldsmobile Rallye 350]]
A 1970-only offering was the '''Oldsmobile Rallye 350''', a value-priced high-performance model using the 350 engine. It was intended for younger buyers that wanted the performance and looks of a [[Muscle car#Supercars|supercar]], but might have trouble with the rising insurance premiums associated with 455-engined cars like the 4-4-2.&lt;ref name="MT Rallye 350"&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Motor Trend]] |issue=February 1970 |title=Bridging the insurance gap—Olds comes up with an answer to rising supercar insurance rates |first=Karl |last=Ludvigsen |pages=68–69, 98}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence the Rallye 350 was an appearance package (coded ''W45'') tied to mandatory options, and could be ordered on the Cutlass S Holiday or Sports Coupe as well as on the F-85 Sports Coupe. All Rallye 350s were painted in Sebring Yellow with matching urethane-coated bumpers front and rear. The package also included special black and orange decals, blacked out grille and yellow-painted 7" wide Super Stock II [[rally wheels]] without trim rings, wearing G70×14" bias-belted Wide Oval blackwall tires. The engine was the ''L74'' air-inducted high-compression 350 cu.in. Rocket V8 engine, fitted with a [[Quadrajet]] carburetor and producing {{convert|310|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. Required options were the associated "Force-Air" fiberglass vented hood, dual exhaust with 4-4-2-style megaphone outlets, 3.23:1 axle ratio, heavy-duty "Rallye-Sport Suspension" with front and rear [[Anti-roll bar|stabilizers]], sports mirrors and sports steering wheel.

===1971===
[[File:Oldsmobile-Cutlass-Sedan.jpg|thumb|right|1971 Oldsmobile Cutlass Town Sedan]]
The 1971 model shared much of the same exterior sheetmetal as the 1970, but with a new hood, grille, and headlight assemblies, as well as new bumpers and taillights. Four new exterior body colors were offered, Viking Blue, Lime Green, Bittersweet, and Saturn Gold.

The famous "Rocket" V8 continued in several different sizes and power options, with both the large 455 and 'small-block' 350 available with either 2- or 4-barrel carburetors. This was the last year for the 250 cubic-inch six-cylinder engine, as it had not been a popular offering in Olds intermediates. All engines were now fitted with hardened valve seats, preparing for the upcoming mandate for unleaded gasoline that took effect with the introduction of catalytic converters on 1975 models. The 1971 Olds engines also featured lowered compression ratios and designed to run on regular leaded, low-lead or unleaded gasoline with a research octane rating of 91 or higher (equivalent to 87 octane by today's octane measurements).

===1972===
[[File:1972 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme Hardtop -- 10-19-2010.jpg|thumb|right|1972 Oldsmobile Cutlass hardtop]]
For 1972, there were minor style changes to the Cutlass, and the 4-4-2 reverted to being a trim line (W-29 option) on the Cutlass instead of an individual model, as it was in 1971.

The primary changes to the 1972 Cutlass were the front grilles and the tail lights. The straight six engine was dropped, but would return to the lineup in 1975.

The '''Hurst/Olds''' used the Cutlass Supreme notchback hardtop and convertible bodies. A 1972 Hurst/Olds paced the [[Indianapolis 500]], and Olds built about 630 replicas, some 25% of them convertibles.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960–1972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), p.864.&lt;/ref&gt;

The entry-level F-85 series was reduced to a single four-door sedan, and then discontinued mid-year due to low sales. This ended the use of the F-85 nameplate, although it would later resurface on an entry-level version of the compact Omega.

===1973===
The Cutlass line was redesigned for 1973 using GM's new "Colonnade" A-body platform. While rooflines were shared with other GM divisions, Cutlass bodies now sported convex bulges aft of the front wheel and fore of the rear wheel on all body styles. The model lineup consisted of the base Cutlass, Cutlass "S", Cutlass Supreme, Cutlass Salon, Vista Cruiser station wagon, and the 4-4-2 appearance package on the Cutlass "S" colonnade coupe. The Cutlass "S" and 4-4-2 offered, as an extra-cost option, unique Strato bucket seats with high seatbacks and built-in [[head restraint]]s that could be swiveled 90 degrees to permit easier entry and exit for the driver and front-seat passenger.

The new Cutlass Salon was an upscale Euro-style luxury/sports sedan similar in concept to the Pontiac Grand Am of the era. The Salon, which included items such as upgraded suspension, [[radial tire]]s, reclining bucket seats and hand-operated [[headlamp]] dimmer switch (integral to the turn signal lever) was based on the Cutlass Supreme series, first as a 4-door Colonnade sedan, joined by a 2-door Colonnade hardtop coupe in 1974. The Cutlass Salon was the first Oldsmobile with the international-flags emblem, later carried on the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera|Cutlass Ciera]]. Front disc brakes were standard.&lt;ref name="ocb1973"/&gt;

All Cutlass models came standard with a {{convert|180|hp|adj=on}} 350 Rocket V8 (K code). Optionally available was a {{convert|200|hp|adj=on}} 350 Rocket V8 with dual exhaust (M code), a {{convert|250|hp|adj=on}} 455 Rocket V8 (U code, or L75). The top engine option was a {{convert|270|hp|adj=on}} 455 V8, with a hotter cam and W30-style heads. This engine was called the L77 (V code), and was used primarily in four-speed cars and automatics without  air conditioning in the Hurst/Olds. Transmissions included a standard column-shift three-speed manual, optional four-speed Muncie M20 manual with Hurst shifter, and three-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] automatic. Upgraded gauges were optional.&lt;ref name="ocb1973"/&gt;

===1974===
Only minor styling changes were made on this year's Cutlass models. These included flush taillight lenses{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} and new grilles up front, including a fascia with bumper mounted turn signals on the base model not shared with any of the other trim levels. There were newly mandated {{convert|5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} rear [[Bumper (automobile)|bumpers]] (joining the {{convert|5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} front bumpers mandated in '73), with a new hydraulic energy absorpotion system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1974_Oldsmobile/album/1974%20Oldsmobile-37.html |title=Old car brochures 1974 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the 350 and 455 Rocket V8s were carried over unchanged from 1973 aside from revisions required to meet 1974 emission regulations. The Turbo Hydra-matic transmission became standard equipment on all Cutlass models.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===1975===
[[File:1975 Oldsmobile Cutlass four-door sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1975 Cutlass Colonnade Hardtop Sedan]]
For 1975, Oldsmobile added two smaller engines to attract economy-minded buyers in the aftermath of the 1973–74 energy crisis. These were the Chevrolet-built {{convert|250|cuin|L|1}} inline six (previously offered from 1966–71) and a new [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#260|260 V8]] based on the Olds 350 Rocket V8, which continued as an option. Also continuing was the 455 Rocket V8, rated at {{convert|190|hp}}. All engines had [[catalytic converter]]s and required [[unleaded gasoline]] in the United States; Canadian buyers could opt to delete the converter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=C1Y_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wlIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1411,2516119&amp;dq=catalytic+converter+canada&amp;hl=en "Canada Hangs Tough in Rough Times", The Windsor ''Star'', 9 July 1975, p.42]&lt;/ref&gt; The three-speed manual transmission returned as standard equipment in conjunction with the six-cylinder engine on all Cutlass models except Salons and station wagons. However, only 0.2% of Cutlasses were built with a manual transmission as most customers overwhelmingly preferred the 350 V8 and Turbo Hydra-matic as in previous years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 1976 |publisher=Ward's Communications, Inc. |year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '75 grilles were somewhat more angular and separated into eight pieces on each side. The parking lights were now incorporated into the grille. At the rear, new two-piece taillights were divided vertically. The S and Supreme both have a chrome strip atop the bonnet, while the Supreme also has the Oldsmobile logo mounted atop the grille. A fuel economy gauge was optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1975%20Oldsmobile/1975%20Oldsmobile%20Full%20Line%20Brochure/75%20Oldsmobile%20Pg%2030.html |title=Old car brochures 1975 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cutlass line overtook the full-sized Delta 88 as the best-selling Oldsmobile line for the first time ever in 1975 with the Cutlass Supreme coupe accounting for the majority of those sales, becoming the best-selling intermediate-sized car in America by surpassing the Chevrolet Chevelle and Ford Torino for the top spot. The Cutlass was also the second-best selling car line in the U.S. in 1975, with only the full-sized Chevrolet Impala/Caprice outpacing it.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===1976===
The Cutlass became America's best selling car this year and would hold this title for most years{{vague|date=February 2016}} into the 1980s. A restyled front end with waterfall-type split grilles and new rectangular headlights was introduced that would become an Olds Cutlass trademark in coming years, lasting into the late 1980s. Coupe bodies were reshaped for a smoother, less contoured look than the 1973-75 design, a design change shared with Buick's A-body coupes. Cutlass sedans and wagons kept their bulges through the end of model year 1977. Taillights were revised and the license plate/fuel filler was moved above the bumper. The base Cutlass line was dropped, with the Cutlass S nameplate now applied to the entry-level coupe and sedan this year - both of which featured an aerodynamic slanted front nose in contrast to the upright front ends of other Cutlass models including the Cutlass Supreme coupe, sedan and wagon, Vista Cruiser wagon, Cutlass Salon coupe and sedan, and the new Cutlass Supreme Brougham coupe. The 4-4-2 option was still offered on Cutlass S coupes as an appearance/handling package.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Engine offerings were carried over from 1975 including the Chevy-built 250 cubic-inch inline six and Olds-built Rocket V8s of [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#260|260]], [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#350|350]] or [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#455|455]] cubic inches. A three-speed manual transmission was standard with the six-cylinder engine but Turbo Hydra-matic was optional with this engine and the 260, and required with the 350 and 455 V8s. A new option this year was the T-50 Borg-Warner five-speed manual transmission, which was available only with the 260 V8.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===1977===
[[File:1977 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme Brougham.jpg|thumb|right|1977 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme Brougham Coupe]]
New grilles highlighted all 1977 Cutlass models with Cutlass S sedans and coupes reverting to an upright grille/front end while the more aerodynamic slanted front end was only offered with the 4-4-2 option. "Oldsmobile" nameplates in a new sans-serif typeface replaced the former script ones.

Inside was a slightly revised instrument panel with the clock relocated to the right side of the dash above the glovebox. This also marked the introduction of Oldsmobile's new mechanical digital clock. The Chevrolet inline six was replaced by Buick's [[Buick V6 engine#231|231]] V6 (standard on all models except Salon and Vista Cruiser), while the 260 and 350 Rocket V8s were carried over. The big-block 455 Rocket V8 was discontinued and replaced by a new small-block 403 cubic inch Rocket V8. Transmissions included a three-speed manual (standard and only available with the V6 engine), five-speed manual (coupes with 260 V8 only) or three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic - optional on V6 models, included with the 260 V8 in sedans and 350 and 403 V8s on all models, and standard on station wagons. A sedan was added to the Supreme Brougham line, while the Salon lost its sedan version. The base wagon dropped the Cutlass Cruiser nameplate and became part of the Vista Cruiser line.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

632,742 Cutlasses were built in 1977, the highest production for the model.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===1978===
The 1978 Cutlass was [[downsize (automobile)|downsized]] to the new version of GM's A-body with a shorter, {{convert|108|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase. This Cutlass was lighter than earlier versions at around {{convert|3300|lb|kg}}, and it could be ordered with any of several engines built by GM's different divisions; a Buick 231 [[V6]], Oldsmobile 260 [[V8 engine|V8]], Pontiac 301 V8 or Chevrolet 305 V8s with either two- or four-barrel carburetors. This generation could still be ordered with the T-50 Borg-Warner five-speed manual transmission for several model years. 

The '78 Cutlass lineup included the Salon and Salon Brougham fastback coupes and sedans and the formal roof Supreme, Supreme Brougham and Calais coupes. The Salons quickly proved to be far less popular than the notchback Supreme and Calais coupes. There were also "two-seat" (6 passengers in two rows) Cutlass Cruiser and Cutlass Cruiser Brougham station wagons; both being smaller, more conventional replacements of the three-seat (8 passenger) Vista Cruiser. 
[[File:Oldsmobile Cutlass Salon rear.jpg|thumb|left|Oldsmobile Cutlass Salon]]
Broughams featured softer, quieter rides, and fancier trim and upholstery. A factory T-top was optional on notchback coupes only. The 4-4-2 appearance and handling package, available on Salon coupes, featured large lower body stripes and 4-4-2 decals outside but not always shown with decals, unique 4-4-2 seats and badges inside, and a taut performance suspension featuring quicker-ratio steering, heavier springs, stiffer shocks, a stiffer front stabilizer bar, a rear stabilizer bar, and bigger tires. The Cutlass Calais used essentially the same suspension as the 4-4-2, but it also came standard with several other performance and touring options, including full instrumentation, an aluminum spoked sport steering wheel, reclining front bucket seats and a center console with floor shifter.

Cosmetically, the 1978 line continued through 1979 with only slight changes front and rear. A bewildering array of grilles were used on the different equipment levels for 1978 and 1979, including two sets each of slotted (Salon), waterfall (Supreme incl. Brougham), and eggcrate (Calais) style designs.

===1979===
[[File:1979 Hurst Olds W-30 front.jpg|thumb|left|Cutlass Calais coupe with the Hurst/Olds W-30 package]]
The same model lineup continued, with a revision of both the front grille and taillight lenses. A diesel version of the Oldsmobile 260 (based on the Olds 350 diesel) was optional; diesel Cutlasses had the "Oldsmobile Diesel" badges on the [[decklid]]s, where gasoline-powered Cutlasses had the "Rocket" logo.

Only 2499 Cutlass Calais coupes were equipped with the [[Oldsmobile Hurst/Olds|Hurst/Olds]] W-30 package, featuring unique aluminum wheels trimmed with gold paint, an exclusive console-mounted [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] Dual Gate floor shifter, special gold over black or white two-tone paint and an otherwise unavailable Oldsmobile 350 V8 with a four-barrel carb and dual outlet exhausts. It is estimated that only 537 cars with the H/O package had T-Tops.

===1980===
Cutlass Supreme and Calais coupes received new header panels incorporating four headlights, mimicking the 1977 model. The four-door Salon was dropped due to poor sales. Taking its place was a conventional notchback sedan known simply as "Cutlass," with base, LS, and Brougham trim levels available. Sister division [[Buick]] did the same with their [[Buick Century]] sedan (the 1978 to 1980 Centuries shared the bodyshell with the Cutlass Salon). The 4-4-2 package was moved to the Cutlass Calais, and while it lacked the Dual Gate shifter, it was essentially a carryover of the 1979 Hurst/Olds, even having the Oldsmobile 350 V8 886 80 442's were produced for 1980. The 260 diesel engine was dropped, as it was considerably slower yet no more economic than the 5.7-litre diesel.&lt;ref name=4MSDS&gt;{{cite journal | ref = 4MD | journal = Road &amp; Track's Road Test Annual &amp; Buyer's Guide 1981 | issue = January–February 1981 | title = Four mid-size diesel sedans | editor-first = Tony | editor-last = Hogg | page = 27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1981===
[[File:1981 Oldsmobile Cutlass Cruiser diesel front.jpg|thumb|left|1981 Cutlass Cruiser diesel station wagon]]
The fastback Salon coupe was dropped, and the Supreme and Calais got a restyle that included a more aerodynamic nose and smoother body lines. Sedans got quad headlamps and a new grille. The 4-4-2 was dropped. Most of this range continued to be marketed as the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme|Cutlass Supreme]] until 1986, although the Cutlass Cruiser was replaced for 1984.

==Cutlass family 1982–1997==
In 1982, Oldsmobile began using the Cutlass nameplate as a sub-marque, with numerous distinct vehicle lines bearing the name simultaneously.

===Cutlass Ciera (1982–1996)===
{{main|Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera}}
[[File:1985-88 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera.jpg|thumb|left|200px|1987 Cutlass Ciera]]

The more space-efficient '''Cutlass Ciera''' was introduced on GM's new [[front-wheel drive]] [[Mid-size car|mid-sized]] [[GM A platform (FWD)|A platform]] in 1982. The '''Cutlass Cruiser''' [[station wagon]] nameplate followed the Ciera to its new platform in 1984. [[Coupes]] were produced until 1992, [[sedans]] and [[station wagon|wagons]] until 1996. For the final year in production, this model was renamed simply '''Oldsmobile Ciera'''.

During its run, the Cutlass Ciera was consistently Oldsmobile's best-selling model.

===Cutlass Supreme (1982–1997)===

====1980–1988====
[[File:1987 Olds Cutlass Supreme 442.jpg|left|thumb|200x200px|1987 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme 442]]
Meanwhile, the previous-generation '''Cutlass Supreme''' continued on the (now renamed) [[rear-wheel-drive]] [[GM G platform (RWD)|G-body platform]] for six more years. The [[Oldsmobile Hurst/Olds|Hurst/Olds]] edition reappeared for two years in 1983 and 1984.  From 1985 through 1987 the [[Oldsmobile 442|4-4-2]] replaced the Hurst/Olds as the high performance model.

Until 1984, the deluxe Cutlass Supreme model was known as the '''Cutlass Calais'''. When the Calais nameplate moved to its own platform in 1985, the top Supreme was renamed to '''Cutlass Salon'''. As the new front-wheel drive Cutlass Supreme model was being launched in 1988, the rear-drive G-special coupe remained in production for one final model year as the '''Cutlass Supreme Classic'''.

====1988–1997====
[[File:88-91 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme front.jpg|thumb|left|200px|1990-91 Cutlass Supreme sedan]]

The premium '''Cutlass Supreme''' nameplate was moved to the new [[front-wheel-drive]] [[Mid-size car|mid-sized]] [[GM W platform]] in 1988. Originally a [[coupe]], a 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] model was added in 1990. [[Convertible (car)|Convertible]]s were also produced from 1990 to 1995.

In 1998, the Cutlass Supreme was replaced by the [[Oldsmobile Intrigue]].

{{main|Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais}}
[[File:'85-'86 Oldsmobile Calais Coupe.jpg|thumb|left|200px|1985-86 Cutlass Calais coupe]]

The third Cutlass nameplate introduced was the [[Compact car|compact]] '''Cutlass Calais''' (originally just '''Oldsmobile Calais''') on the [[front-wheel-drive]] [[GM N platform|N-body]] in 1985. The famed '''[[Oldsmobile 4-4-2|4-4-2]]''' nameplate was revived for the Cutlass Calais in 1990 and 1991.

The Cutlass Calais was replaced by the [[Oldsmobile Achieva]] in 1992.

      <text bytes="8336" xml:space="preserve">The '''Oldsmobile Jetstar I''' is a sporty, high-performance full-sized car produced by [[Oldsmobile]] for the 1964 and 1965 model years. Based on the upscale [[Oldsmobile Starfire|Starfire]] model, the [[Oldsmobile 88|Olds 88's]] B-bodied Jetstar I lacked many of the Starfire's standard luxuries but shared its powerful engine, roofline and seating arrangement.  Positioned to compete with [[Pontiac]]'s successful full-sized [[Pontiac Grand Prix| Grand Prix]], it was only offered as a two-door hardtop. 

==1964==
[[File:1964 Oldsmobile Jetstar I at 2007 Olds Homecoming.jpg|thumb|1964 Oldsmobile Jetstar I]]
The Jetstar I was initially designed as both a lower-priced companion to the more luxurious [[Oldsmobile Starfire|Starfire]], which had a starting price of over $4,100, and a direct competitor to the successful [[Pontiac Grand Prix]], which sold in the Jetstar I's $3,500-$3,600 price range. Offered only as two-door hardtop coupe, the Jetstar I shared the Starfire's squared-off roofline, with concave rear window, which differed from the convertible-inspired rooflines featured on other Olds 88 two-door hardtop coupes.

Standard equipment included the Starfire's 345&amp;nbsp;hp (257&amp;nbsp;kW) 394 cubic-inch Rocket V8 engine, but lacked its automatic transmission, power steering, power brakes, leather interior, and distinctive brightwork trim. Included were 
bucket seats, center console, carpeting, full wheel covers, and padded instrument panel. A three-speed column-shift manual transmission was standard, with a three-speed Roto Hydra-matic automatic with console-mounted T-handle shifter optional. Adding just automatic transmission, power steering, and power brakes brought the {{convert|4028|lb}} Jetstar I's price close to $4,000.

A total of 16,084 were produced for 1964, slightly below Starfire output but barely one-quarter of the 63,000 Grand Prix built by Pontiac.

==1965==
[[File:1965 Oldsmobile Jetstar I (Saffron Yellow).jpg|thumb|1965 Oldsmobile Jetstar I in Saffron Yellow.]]
The Jetstar I, like all other full-size Oldsmobiles, was completely restyled for 1965 with bodylines receiving a more rounded rendition of the '64's squared-off roofline again shared with Starfire (other 88-series two-door coupes got semi-fastback rooflines). Also new for 1965 was the engine and automatic transmission. Replacing the 394 cubic-inch Rocket V8 was the new 425 cubic-inch engine, with the top of the line Starfire version having a four-barrel carburetor, dual exhaust, and a 10.5:1 compression ratio and was rated at {{convert|370|hp}} — the most powerful Olds engine in 1965. The 425, which shared many components with the smaller 330 cubic-inch V8 introduced for Olds' intermediate-sized Cutlass the previous year, was lighter in weight than the previous 394 despite the increase in displacement and included bigger valves and improved cooling capabilities. Also new was the three-speed [[Turbo Hydramatic]] transmission, which was considered a vast improvement over the previous three-speed Roto Hydra-matic, whose basic design dated back to the original Hydra-matic introduced in 1940. Another new transmission offering for the Jetstar I along with the other full-sized Oldsmobiles (except the Ninety-Eight) for 1965 was the Muncie four-speed manual, which turned out to be a seldom-ordered option. Oldsmobile boasted in a 1965 press release that “a Jetstar I proved to be the top accelerator of the entire event” at the 1965 Pure Oil Performance Trials in Daytona Beach. Those trials were sanctioned and supervised by NASCAR.

The {{convert|370|hp}} Starfire V8 was the largest and most powerful V8 in Oldsmobile's market segment in 1965. Buick could only muster {{convert|360|hp}} from its largest V8 (similar in cubic inches to the Olds engine but of a much older design) even with dual four-barrel carburetors, Chrysler topped out at 413 cubic inches and {{convert|360|hp}} and Mercury made do with a 390 cubic-inch V8 of as much as {{convert|330|hp}}, excepting the very few Merc buyers willing to shell out an astronomical cost of $700 for an exotic 427 cubic-inch V8 with dual four-barrel carbs and {{convert|425|hp}} - which was not really designed for everyday driving and not available with some of the most popular options in this price class such as automatic transmission and air conditioning.

Trimmed down 65 pounds to {{convert|3963|lb}} and equipped with the new 370&amp;nbsp;hp (276&amp;nbsp;kW)/ 470&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (637 N·m) of torque 425ci Starfire engine, turned the ’65 model into an overlooked performance car. The equivalent power was only available in a Grand Prix or other full-size Pontiac via the top-of-the-line 376&amp;nbsp;hp (276&amp;nbsp;kW) 421ci HO Tri-Power engine, an expensive $375.77 option.

Although the Jetstar I was priced similar to the Grand Prix, unless one bought the basic model there was little  incentive for an Oldsmobile buyer to purchase a one over the Starfire.  Adding power steering ($107), power brakes ($43), and automatic transmission ($242.10) - all standard on the Starfire - brought the Jetstar I's $3602 base price within $150 of the $4,148 Starfire, without its genuine leather interior and distinctive exterior trim.  On the other hand, the performance-minded could elect the comparatively plain Jetstar I and its faux air extractors behind the front wheels.

Often confused with its lesser brethren, the low-priced Jetstar 88 series, the Jetstar I concluded its two-year run with only 6,552 sold in 1965. The introduction of the mid-sized muscle cars (including the 389 V8-powered Pontiac GTO and similar [[Oldsmobile 4-4-2]], which started with a 330 cubic-inch V8 in 1964 but switched to a larger 400&amp;nbsp;inch engine in 1965) and specter of the front-drive Toronado taking over the flagship status from the Starfire loomed big in Oldsmobile's future were too much to overcome. 

The Jetstar I's direct replacement for the 1966 model year was a lower-priced Starfire hardtop coupe (convertible dropped for this year), with a base price in the same range as the Jetstar I. Leather interior was replaced by Morroceen vinyl and several hundred dollars worth of formerly-standard equipment became optional, including Turbo Hydra-matic transmission, power steering and power brakes. This lower-priced '66 Starfire sold in bigger numbers than the '65 Jetstar I, but that nameplate/series was dropped after the 1966 model year.  It would return in 1975 on a badge-engineered subcompact [[Chevrolet Monza]].

==Confusion with the Jetstar 88 series==
Between 1964 and 1966, Oldsmobile named its least expensive full size model the '''Jetstar 88''' (priced $500–$600 below the Jetstar 1), but that car was not related to the Jetstar I. The Jetstar 88 was basically a B-body with A-body running gear, which gave the 88 line the most inexpensive model.  The Jetstar 88 also offered a full range of bodystyles including the four-door Town (pillared) and Holiday (hardtop) sedans, Holiday hardtop coupe and even a convertible (1964-1965 only) -  all featuring cloth/vinyl bench seat interiors shared with the step-up '''Dynamic 88''' series. The Jetstar 88 was powered by the same 330 cubic-inch Rocket V8 with 11.5 to 1 compression (ultra-high) found in the intermediate F-85/Cutlass models instead of the 394 or 425 found in all other Olds 88-series models. Furthermore, the Jetstar 88 also shared the intermediate-sized car's two-speed Jetaway automatic transmission and smaller {{convert|9.5|in|mm|adj=on}} diameter brake drums. Although the Jetstar 88 was a respectable seller during its three-year run, it was outsold by a wide margin by the Dynamic 88, which cost only a few dollars more than the Jetstar 88, but was also considered a better value by many Olds buyers due to a larger standard engine, three-speed automatic transmission, and larger brake drums.

The '''Oldsmobile Bravada''' is a front-engine, four-door [[mid-size car|mid-size]] [[sport utility vehicle|SUV]] manufactured and marketed by the Oldsmobile division of [[General Motors]] &amp;mdash; across three generations and as a [[Rebadging|rebadged]] variant of the [[Chevrolet Blazer]] and [[GMC Jimmy]]. It was the only SUV manufactured or marketed by Oldsmobile, and the first light truck offered in the United States by a GM brand other than Chevrolet or GMC since before [[World War II]].

The first generation (1991–1994) and second-generation (1996–2001) used the [[GM GMT platform#GMT 325/330|GMT330 platform]], and the third generation (2002-2004) used the [[GM GMT platform#GMT 360|GMT360 platform]]. The third generation was the only version offered in Canada.

The 1991 Bravada was an upscale version of the then-new 4-door [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer|S-Blazer/Jimmy]]. It was the first truck-based vehicle offered by Oldsmobile since the 1920s, and at that time was a [[United States]]-only vehicle. Unlike its siblings, the Bravada was only offered with "Smart Trak" [[all-wheel drive]], power equipment, body-colored bumpers and exterior trim (with lower body cladding which was body-colored, similar to the competitor Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited), and the 4.3&amp;nbsp;L W-code engine. At the heart of Smart Trak system was the [[Borg Warner]] 4472 transfer case (also shared with the limited production GMC Typhoon and AWD GM M platform vans &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Chevrolet Astro|Astro/Safari]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;), offering 65% rear and 35% front torque with more to the front when it slips. [[Anti-lock brakes]] and remote keyless entry were also standard.

[[File:Olds Bravada first rv.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of Oldsmobile Bravada]]
The 4.3&amp;nbsp;L [[V6 engine]] got a horsepower boost to 200 for 1992. Also for '92, the Bravada's instrument panel was slightly modified to differ from its siblings. 1993 saw the addition of an overhead console with compass, temperature, and reading lights. An optional Gold package with gold exterior badging and special gold aluminum wheels was also new for '93. This version was produced through 1994.

The Bravada was refreshed later than its platform mates, with no 1995 models produced. The 1996 and 1997 models' body featured more rounded lines than their predecessor. This generation Bravada could easily be distinguished from the Chevrolet Blazer and GMC Jimmy by its Oldsmobile-styled body-colored split grille, premium alloy wheels, and lower bodyside cladding. Standard fare included a driver's [[airbag]] and daytime running lamps. The interior styling was more appealing to the eye with less ridges and squares, much like the exterior. In keeping with its premium image, the Bravada's interior was modified and upgraded, to differ from its [[Chevrolet]]/[[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] siblings. The front bucket seats were similar to those found on the [[Oldsmobile Aurora|Aurora]]. Other interior features included standard leather seating, woodgrain trim, and its unique center console with a leather-wrapped [[Gear stick#Alternative positions|console shifter]] (as opposed to a [[Gear stick#Alternative positions|column shifter]] on the Blazer/Jimmy). In 1997, 4-wheel anti-lock disc brakes became standard and the rear spoiler was deleted. As with the previous generation, the Oldsmobile Bravada was available only in 4-door, 5-passenger configuration.

===1998===
[[File:1998-01 Oldsmobile Bravada.jpg|200px|thumb|left|1998–2001 Bravada]]
Another refreshening occurred in 1998. The "Smart Trak" system now featured the computer controlled NP-136 transfer case, which works more like a traction control. The Bravada was now run RWD in normal operations and only when wheel slip is detected does the "Smart Trak" kick into AWD. A revised interior including dual airbags, heated seats, and a new front fascia which included the new [[Oldsmobile Aurora|Aurora]] inspired Oldsmobile logo. [[OnStar]] was available in 1999 as a cell phone unit, later becoming integrated into the rearview mirror in 2001 with available features like hands-free calling and virtual advisor. A [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] sound system was added for 1999 and the fuel injection was updated in 2000, though output remained the same. A new two-tone exterior dubbed the Platinum Edition was made available in 2000. This generation was phased out in 2001 to make way for the new ''[[GM GMT platform#GMT 360|GMT360]]'' Bravada.

===Engines===
* 1996–2001 - 4.3&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Chevrolet 90-Degree V6 engine#L35 and LF6 SCPI|L35 Vortec 4300]]'' [[V6]], [[Sequential Central Port Injection|SCPI]], {{Convert|190|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with single exhaust

The new 2002 Bravada hit showrooms in February 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New Cars for 2002|journal=Automobile Magazine|issue=September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first [[GM GMT platform#GMT 360|GMT360]] truck introduced, and the last new Oldsmobile model. Like the [[Chevrolet TrailBlazer]] and [[GMC Envoy]], it used the new 270&amp;nbsp;hp (201&amp;nbsp;kW) ''[[GM Atlas engine|Atlas]]'' [[Straight-6|I6 engine]]. [[Rear-wheel drive]] was available for the first time as well, making this the first rear wheel drive Oldsmobile since the 1992 [[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser|Custom Cruiser]]. The Bravada entered [[Canada]] at this time. This was the first Oldsmobile with a [[straight-6]] engine since the [[Oldsmobile Omega|Omega]] of 1976, and the only [[GMT360]] not to offer a V8 engine option.

Production of the Bravada ended with the demise of the [[Oldsmobile]] marque in 2004. The last 500 Bravadas were produced as "Final 500" special editions, each featuring custom seat embroidering and exterior badging inspired by vintage Oldsmobile logos, dark cherry metallic paint, unique chrome alloy wheels, and a medallion featuring that particular Bravada's production number, ranging from 1 to 500.

The last Bravada, the number 500, rolled off the assembly line on January 12, 2004. The closing of the last factory that manufactured the trucks was the subject of an emotional 2009 HBO documentary - “The Last Truck: Closing of a G.M. Plant”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/07/arts/television/07truck.html The Days the Plant Died]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bravada bodyshell was continued by its joint replacements, the 2004-2007 [[Buick Rainier]] and the 2005-2009 [[Saab 9-7X]] - the latter of which remained in production until December 2008.

The '''Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme''' is a [[mid-size car]] produced by [[Oldsmobile]] between 1966 and 1997. It was positioned as a premium offering at the top of the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass|Cutlass]] range. It began as a trim package, developed its own roofline, and rose during the mid-1970s to become not only the most popular Oldsmobile but the highest selling model in its class.

It was produced as a rear-wheel drive two-door hardtop, sedan, and station wagon into the 1980s, and a convertible through 1972.  In 1988 Oldsmobile sought to capitalize on the [[brand equity]] of the Cutlass Supreme [[marque]] by replacing it with a downsized front-wheel drive model based on the [[GM10]] platform [[GM W platform|W-platform]].

When production ended there was no direct replacement for the Cutlass Supreme, although the [[Oldsmobile Intrigue|Intrigue]] introduced for 1998 was designed in size and price to replace all the Cutlass models.

The Cutlass Supreme name first appeared for the 1966 [[model year]], the first year of GM's new intermediate four-door [[hardtop]] [[sedan (car)|sedan]]—also known as the Holiday Sedan. In addition to the new body style (also available on the midline F-85 Deluxe series), the Supreme featured a plusher interior that included a [[bench seat]] with [[armrest]], full wheel covers and deluxe door panels among other items including "CS" emblems on the rear [[Pillar (car)|C-pillars]] and trunk lid. Although smaller than the traditional domestic cars, "its deluxe interior makes it comparable with [[Ford LTD (Americas)|LTD]], [[Plymouth Fury|VIP]], [[AMC Ambassador|DPL]], and [[Chevrolet Caprice|Caprice]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4SUDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=its+deluxe+interior+makes+it+comparable+with+LTD+VIP+DPL+Caprice |page=79 |title=The 1966 cars |journal=Popular Science |first=Jan P. |last=Norbye |date=October 1965 |volume=187 |issue=4 |accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
For the 1967 model year, the Cutlass Supreme line was expanded into a full series that also included a two-door [[hardtop]] [[coupe]] (Holiday Coupe), two-door pillared [[coupe]] (Sport Coupe), four-door pillared [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]] (Town Sedan) and a convertible. Generally, interior appointments in Supreme models were more luxurious than lesser F-85 and Cutlass series cars and included a cloth or vinyl bench seat with armrest in sedan models and all-vinyl Strato bucket seats in coupes and convertibles.

For both years, the standard Supreme engine was Oldsmobile's {{convert|330|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} "Ultra High Compression" [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#330|Jetfire Rocket V8]] rated at {{convert|320|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with a four-barrel carburetor. Transmission offerings included a standard three-speed manual with column shift, floor-mounted four-speed manual with Hurst shifter or a two-speed Jetaway [[Automatic transmission|automatic]].

In 1967, the high-performance [[Oldsmobile 442|442]] package with the {{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|350|hp}} V8 was available on three Cutlass Supreme models including the sport coupe, Holiday coupe and convertible. Also available on each of those three Supreme two-door models was "Turnpike Cruiser" option that included a 400 cubic-inch V8 with two-barrel carburetor and {{convert|300|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} rating along with a numerically lower rear axle and Turbo Hydramatic transmission.

The Cutlass and other GM [[mid-size car|intermediate]]s were completely restyled for 1968 with wheelbases shortened to {{convert|112|in|mm|0}} for 2-door [[coupe]] models and lengthened one inch to {{convert|116|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} for four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]s and [[station wagon]]s (with the exception of the glass-roof [[Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser|Vista Cruiser]] [[station wagon]], which rode on an even longer {{convert|121|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase). The Cutlass Supreme, now the top-line Olds intermediate series, was pared down to two- and four-door [[hardtop]] models with the pillared sedans and coupes dropped and the convertible moved to the lower-priced Cutlass "S" line, upon which the [[Oldsmobile 442|4-4-2]] [[muscle car]] was now based. Also the standard Rocket V8 was enlarged from 330 to 350 cubic inches with {{convert|310|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

The 1969 models received only a minor facelift such as a new split grille and vertical taillights with the same model and engine offerings. A new three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic 350 was added to the option list to replace the two-speed Jetaway automatic. Headrests were made standard equipment due to federal safety mandate and the ignition switch moved from the instrument panel to the steering column, which also was designed to lock the steering wheel. This ignition/steering wheel interlock, found on all 1969-model General Motors passenger cars, except for the Corvair, debuted one year before the federal government mandated it on all 1970 models.

For 1970, the Cutlass Supreme nameplate was switched to [[Oldsmobile]]'s equivalent of the downsized [[Pontiac Grand Prix]] on the [[GM A platform (RWD)|A-body]], to give the division an entry in the burgeoning market for smaller [[personal luxury car]]s. As such, the two-door hardtop had a new [[notchback]] roofline, while lower trim-line Cutlass coupes had a [[fastback]] style roof. The model remained in this role for virtually all of its production life. Unlike the Grand Prix and the also-related [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]], which had wholly separate bodies and names from their less expensive siblings, the Supreme shared front and rear body parts with the standard Cutlass line and was always marketed as part of it. In addition to the two-door [[hardtop]] (Holiday Coupe), the Cutlass Supreme series for 1970 also included a four-door [[hardtop]] (Holiday Sedan) and regained the convertible bodystyle.

Supreme interiors were more luxurious that those of other Cutlass models, with a choice of a Custom Sport [[notchback]] [[bench seat]] with armrest in Osborne cloth or Moroccan vinyl or, at no extra cost (on coupes and convertibles only), Strato bucket seats in Moroccan vinyl. Available at extra cost with the bucket seats was a center console with floor-mounted shifter for which the Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission could also be had with the [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] Dual-Gate shifter commonly found in the division's musclecar, the [[Oldsmobile 442]].

For 1970 and 1971, both the Cutlass Supreme coupe and convertible were available with the Code Y-79 high performance [[Cutlass SX|SX]] option package. The "SX" option included several versions of the larger 455 cubic-inch Rocket [[V8 engine|V8]] borrowed from the Olds 442 along with the cutout rear bumper and exhaust trumpets, 442's rallye suspension (optional), distinctive SX badges and other features.

A W31 option added distinctive stripes and badging, and a camshaft with increased lift and duration for the 350 engine. The W31 option was offered on Supreme coupes only in 1968, but continued on lower-line F-85 and Cutlass S coupes through 1970.

1972 was the only year in which the Cutlass Supreme notchback hardtop could be equipped with the L75 455 and M20 four speed transmission, and only 77 of these cars were produced. All 1972 L75 455/M20 cars used the larger 2.07 valves and the W30 automatic camshaft. This gave the L75 455/M20 cars 270 net horsepower, as opposed to the TH400 [[automatic transmission|automatic]]-equipped L75 cars, which produced 250 net horsepower.

The 1972 Hurst/Olds was based on the Supreme two-door hardtop and convertible, powered by both versions of the 455 Rocket offered on the 4-4-2, along with a Turbo 400 transmission with Hurst Dual/Gate shifter. The H/O convertible also served as the Indianapolis 500 Pace Car in 1972.

1972 was also the final year for Olds to offer the Cutlass Supreme convertible, until 1990.  In its final year, it was the best-selling convertible in the U.S., with 11,571 sold, or 16% of the market, beating the [[Cadillac Fleetwood#1971–1976|Eldorado]] and [[Chevrolet Corvette C3#1968–1972|Corvette]].&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960-1972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), p.864.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1973 to 1975, the only Oldsmobile convertible offered was the full-sized Delta 88 Royale.

In 1973, the Cutlass Supreme, like other GM mid-size cars, was redesigned. Hardtop models were replaced by new "Colonnade" styling with fixed center pillars. Concerns over proposed rollover standards caused many automakers to phase out their pillarless hardtops and convertibles throughout the 1970s, and the Cutlass was no exception. Despite some initial controversy over the disappearance of hardtop models, the new 1973 GM mid-sized line proved highly successful. Cutlass Supreme coupes had a unique roofline with vertical opera windows not shared with other Cutlass coupes, as well as unique front end styling.

[[File:1973 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme (28759139042).jpg|thumb|left|1973 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme coupe]]

The Cutlass line soon became Oldsmobile's biggest seller, accounting for 43% of the division's total volume in 1974, with the Cutlass Supreme coupe being the single most popular model. With rectangular headlights newly legalized in 1975, the Cutlass received a facelift for the 1976 model year featuring quad headlights and a waterfall grille. This attractive redesign boosted sales even further. The Cutlass line as a whole was America's best-selling car in 1976, helping Oldsmobile to become the only marque outside of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[Chevrolet]] to break one-million units sold. By 1977, however, GM had downsized its full-size models, and the Cutlass Supreme was now nearly identical in size to the redesigned [[Oldsmobile Delta 88|Delta 88]]. That situation would last only that one year, as GM planned to downsize the Olds Cutlass and other intermediates for 1978.

In addition to the Colonnade [[hardtop]] [[coupe]], the Cutlass Supreme was also offered in a four-door Colonnade [[sedan (car)|sedan]] (with six-window styling and frameless door windows) as well as six-and-nine passenger [[station wagon]]s - the wagons with the woodgrain exterior trim were marketed under the [[Vista Cruiser]] nameplate previously used on Oldsmobile's stretched-wheelbase station wagons with raised roof and skylights from 1964 to 1972.

The Supreme Colonnade sedan was available in 1973 as the Cutlass Salon, which was an option package that included radial tires, upgraded suspension and reclining bucket seats upholstered in corduroy or vinyl trim along with color-keyed wheelcovers - designed as sort of a European-style luxury/touring sedan similar to the [[Pontiac Grand Am]] of the same period. For 1974, the Salon package was also made available on the Supreme Colonnade coupe and in 1975, the Salon was upgraded to a separate series available in both sedan and coupe. The 1975s received a new, more squared off grille, slightly larger and incorporating parking lights. The bumpers also continued to grow ever larger.

For 1973-74, the 350 Rocket V8 with four-barrel carburetor and {{convert|180|hp}} was the standard Cutlass Supreme engine with a 250-horsepower 455 Rocket offered as an option. Both three- and four-speed [[manual transmission]]s were offered in 1973, but the greatest majority of Cutlasses (including Supremes) were built with the three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic [[automatic transmission]] which became standard equipment in 1974, along with variable-ratio power steering.

[[File:1976 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme four-door sedan in silver, front right.jpg|thumb|left|1976 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme four-door sedan]]
The 1973-74 energy crisis resulting from the [[Arab Oil Embargo]] led Oldsmobile to introduce two new smaller engines to the Cutlass line in 1975. The Chevrolet built 250 cubic-inch [[Straight-six engine|inline six]] and three-speed manual transmission were reinstated as standard equipment on the Supreme coupe and sedan with a new Olds-built 260 cubic-inch Rocket V8 (standard on Cutlass Salon and optional on all other Cutlasses except wagons) offered as an option. However, the majority of Cutlass Supremes in 1975, 1976, and 1977 were sold with the now-optional 350 Rocket [[V8 engine|V8]] and Turbo Hydra-matic [[automatic transmission|automatic]] (still standard on wagons). The 455 Rocket [[V8 engine|V8]] was optional through 1976, and replaced by a smaller 403 Rocket V8 in 1977, the same year in which a Buick-built 231 cubic-inch [[V6]] replaced the Chevy inline six as base power in most Cutlass models.

[[File:1977 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme coupe, front right (Hershey 2019).jpg|thumb|right|1977 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme coupe]]

For 1976, the Cutlass Supreme Brougham coupe was added to the line, featuring a more luxurious interior trim than the regular Supreme model with pillowed crushed velour upholstery and 60/40 bench seats similar to the larger [[Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight|Ninety-Eight]] Regency. It also received quad square headlights. For 1977, the Brougham was also available as a four-door Colonnade sedan. The grille was also changed, with each half divided into five rather than two segments of bars divided by chrome strips.

A five-speed [[manual transmission]] was available as an option with the 260 V8 in all models except Supreme Brougham and station wagons for 1976-77.

The Cutlass Supreme was downsized for 1978, along with the rest of the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass|Cutlass]] line. An upscale '''Cutlass Calais''' model was added, differing from the Cutlass Supreme only in minor trim details. The new [[notchback]] Cutlass Supreme proved to be far more popular than the controversial [[fastback]] [[Oldsmobile Cutlass|Cutlass Salon]] coupe and sedan introduced at the same time.

The Cutlass Calais, essentially replaced the previous Cutlass Salon series, as far as model position and content were concerned. The Calais featured reclining Strato [[bucket seats]], [[center console (automobile)|center console]], sport [[steering wheel]], full instrumentation, tuned suspension with front and rear sway bars, color-keyed wheelcovers, front [[grille (car)|grille]]s mimicking an ice cube tray (as opposed to the waterfall style used with the Cutlass Supreme) and more.

Both the Cutlass Supreme and Calais were available with [[T-top]]s or a factory [[sunroof]], even on the base Cutlass Supreme coupe with the factory radio delete option.

From 1978 through 1980, a high-performance '''[[Oldsmobile 442#1978|442]]''' model was available, and for 1979 (Cutlass Calais), a special-edition performance model, the '''[[Oldsmobile Hurst/Olds#1979|Hurst/Olds]]''' was offered. These used the Supreme's [[notchback]] body, rather than the standard [[fastback]] coupe's.  Around 2,499 Hurst/Olds were produced - all were powered with an Oldsmobile 5.7L (350 cubic-inch) Rocket V8 (not the diesel engine) sourced from the [[Full-size car|full-size]]d Delta 88 and Ninety Eight Regency. Also included in the Hurst/Olds package was the Hurst Dual/Gate shifter for the three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic transmission.

In '''1978''', the Cutlass line featured [[taillight]]s which had a lighted  Oldsmobile rocket logo in the center.

In '''1979''', the [[taillight]]s on the Cutlass line dropped the rocket logo.

In '''1980''', the two-door models went back to four [[headlight]]s. A 4-door [[notchback]] [[Sedan (automobile)#Notchback sedans|sedan]] (known as Cutlass, Cutlass LS, and Cutlass Brougham) replaced the unpopular 4-door "aeroback" Salon, which continued in two-door form for one more year. The Supreme Brougham package was available on and off throughout 1978-1988 production.  This was also the first year GM introduced the OBD-I computer controlled engine management and emission control system.

The [[Oldsmobile 442|442]] option moved from the aeroback Cutlass Salon coupe body to the notchback Cutlass Calais for 1980, with content upgraded from a mere "appearance and handling" package back to a legitimate performance option with content similar to the 1979 Hurst/Olds including its 350 Rocket V8. This would be the last 442 until that model was revived in 1985 again on the Cutlass notchback body as a successor to the 1983-84 Hurst/Olds.

In '''1981''', the Cutlass Supreme coupe received an [[aerodynamic]] restyle (with a "shovel-nose" front header panel), which, along with a higher rear deck, decreased air resistance by 15%.&lt;ref name=Wards81&gt;{{cite book |title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 1981 |publisher=Ward's Communications, Inc |editor=Stark, Harry A |year=1981 |page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would continue with this basic design until the final rear-drive Cutlass was produced in 1988. A 4-door sedan was added to the Supreme lineup, with a new front end and a slight [[taillight]] lens restyle (resembling a touch-tone dial or [[Rubik's Cube]] - this lens style was used until 1984).  It was this restyled body that (along with the [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]], [[Buick Regal]], and [[Pontiac Grand Prix]]) ushered in the down-sized cars into NASCAR cup competition.  While the Cutlass looked almost identical to the [[Buick Regal]] (which scored 35+ victories in the 1981 thru 1985 seasons), the Cutlass (like the [[Dodge Mirada]]) didn't take one checkered flag, and many teams moved away from it in 1983 to the Regal, Grand Prix, and restyled Monte Carlo SS.  This was a rude awakening to Oldsmobile, which was getting used to wins on the NASCAR circuit.

In 1982, GM launched the [[front-wheel drive]] [[GM A platform#1982|A-body]], known as the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera|Cutlass Ciera]], meant as replacements for the 1978-vintage RWD A-bodies, but decided to continue selling the older models anyway. The Cutlass Supreme continued on with the RWD Cutlass sedan and station wagon (two-door Cutlasses were dropped).

The '''Hurst/Olds''' reappeared on the Cutlass Calais coupe for two years, first in 1983 as the black over silver 15th anniversary, and then as the silver over black 1984 model. Both featured chrome wheels, red striping and a high output Oldsmobile 307 V8 with 4 barrel carburetor, dual muffler exhausts and Hurst's then new three stick Lightning Rods shifter (the latter eventually becoming a magnet for thieves.) All Hurst/Olds were automatics.

The Cutlass wagon was dropped in 1984.

The '''1985''' Cutlass Supreme was produced by Oldsmobile and designed after the [[Oldsmobile Calais]], which became a separate model on the [[GM N platform]] in the same year. The [[rear-wheel drive]] Cutlass Calais was renamed the Cutlass Salon (taking its name from the upscale Supreme coupe and sedan that preceded the Calais).

“ 5.0-liter V8 engine, available. The added performance that adds to the pleasure of driving.”&lt;ref name="Oldsmobile 1985"&gt;Oldsmobile. 1985 Oldsmobile. Fredric Wisconsin: Oldsmobile, 1985. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The Olds Cutlass Supreme coupe and sedan were stock with a 3.8-liter V6, 2 barrel engine, while a 5-liter V8 engine was available at extra cost.

Brougham Coupe and Sedan - Although very similar to the original Cutlass Supreme, the Brougham is slightly better equipped. It has the same exact 3.8-liter stock engine and 3-speed transmission, but has a divided front bench seat with individual controls and the choice of [[velour]] trim in five colors. Also includes a convenience group with lamps, visor vanity mirror and chime tones. To finish off the specialization of the premium model, [[Oldsmobile]] created specific Brougham hood ornaments.&lt;ref name="Oldsmobile 1985"/&gt;

'''1987''' was the final year for the [[rear-wheel drive]] sedan, and both coupe models received a restyled header panel with composite headlights.  A [[Buick V6 engine|Buick 231]] was the base motor alongside the [[Oldsmobile V8 engine|Oldsmobile 307]]. For its final year, the 442 package was moved to the Supreme model.

'''1988''' was the final year for the [[rear-wheel drive]] Cutlass Supreme. It was badged '''Cutlass Supreme Classic''', and 27,678 were built.&lt;ref name='Wards89'&gt;{{cite book |title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 1989 |publisher=Ward's Communications, Inc |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2-door coupe (produced alongside the [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] at GM's Pontiac, Michigan plant) continued, until the new front-wheel drive version was released in December 1987. The Olds 307 was the only available engine.

===High-performance engines===
Two high-performance variants were created, both using a high-output version of [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#307|Oldsmobile's 5.0&amp;nbsp;L (307&amp;nbsp;CID) V8 engine]]:

A front-wheel-drive Cutlass Supreme based on the [[GM10]] platform ([[GM W platform|W-body]]) was introduced as a 2-door [[notchback]] [[coupe]] mid-year during the 1988 production run, while the final year of Cutlass Supreme [[Rear-wheel-drive|RWD]] [[coupe]]s were still being produced.  This new [[Front-wheel drive|FWD]] model shared its {{convert|107.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase with the [[Pontiac Grand Prix]], [[Buick Regal]], and later [[Chevrolet Lumina]].  The 1988 and 1989 models were 2-door [[coupe]]s.  This body style proved to be a winner for NASCAR competition and it visited the victory circle 13 times between 1989 and 1992, when [[Oldsmobile]] ended its racing program.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} A 4-door [[notchback]] [[sedan (car)|sedan]] and a 2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]] were added for 1990.  Models included base (later called S), SL, and the sporty International Series.  Throughout its run, the convertible was considered a separate trim level.

International Series models could be equipped with unique features such as quad [[bucket seat]]s with dual center consoles, a driver information system and a heads-up display.  A very rare Muncie 5-speed [[manual transmission]] option was paired first with the {{convert|2.8|l|cid|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[GM 60-Degree V6 engine|60°]] [[V6]] in 1988 and 1989.  In 1990, a revised [[Getrag]] 5-speed [[manual transmission]] option was available for the [[Quad-4#LG0|high-output Quad-4]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]] and the [[DOHC]] {{convert|3.4|l|cid|abbr=on|adj=on}} 60° V6 in 1991 and 1992.  The entire line was restyled for 1992, with coupes and convertibles gaining distinctive "mini-quad" headlamps shared with the Pontiac Grand Prix coupe.  A driver's side [[airbag]] became standard in 1994, and a new ergonomically curved dashboard with dual airbags debuted in 1995.

The trim levels and the lineup were gradually pared down over time.  The [[Quad-4]] was last produced during the 1991 model year; the manual transmission option during 1992; the International Series during 1993; the S model during 1994; the convertible during 1995; and the 3.4&amp;nbsp;L V6 engine option during 1996.  The Cutlass Supreme ceased production at the end of the 1997 model year.  That same year, an N-body [[Oldsmobile Cutlass|Cutlass]] (actually a [[badge engineering|badge-engineered]] Malibu) was introduced to replace the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera|Ciera]], but this model lasted just three years.  The Cutlass Supreme's place in the Oldsmobile line was taken by the 1998 [[Oldsmobile Intrigue|Intrigue]], built on the next version of the W platform. The Cutlass Supreme ended production on April 24, 1997.

The W-body Cutlass Supreme was built in [[Doraville, Georgia]] from 1988 to 1995, and at the Fairfax Plant in [[Kansas City, Kansas]] from 1996 to 1997.  The first 1988 Cutlass Supreme rolled off the assembly line on January 13, 1988.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The last Cutlass Supreme convertible was completed on February 15, 1995.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The reason for this is that the last 34,743 cars built in Doraville were sedans, the coupe production was sent to Fairfax, Kansas around March 1, 1995 and Cars and Concepts did not have a facility near Fairfax.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

===Indianapolis 500 Pace Car===
In 1988 the Indianapolis Motor Speedway chose Oldsmobile to pace “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing”, with retired United States Air Force General Chuck Yeager behind the wheel{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.  Traditionally a manufacturer builds many pace car replicas, often thousands{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.  But in 1988 Oldsmobile chose to build only 50 Cutlass Convertible Indy Pace Car editions.  All 50 (used on track on race day and in 500 Festival activities) were essentially hand built.  General Motors/Oldsmobile contracted Cars and Concepts of Brighton, Michigan to build each of these 50 unique cars. Following the race 50 very select Oldsmobile dealers were given the opportunity to purchase one of these cars.  The price was set at full invoice price for a standard International Series coupe (~$14,000) plus the cost of the convertible conversion (an additional $13,997){{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.  Each was highly optioned including the first ever application of Heads Up Display in an American production vehicle developed by Hughes Electronics.  After the 50 were claimed, paid for and delivered to the lucky Olds dealers who said yes, the story of these cars gets more interesting. After the 50 were in the dealers’ hands across the country General Motors discovered some issue with the certification of these one-off models.  Each dealer was asked to return them to GM (where they were to be destroyed) and receive full credit of their purchase price.  Most of the 50 were returned for credit, but a few dealers objected and kept their cars leaving (by all accounts) less than 10 in the general population. Mr. Thomas Knobloch, a second-generation Oldsmobile dealer in Erie, Pennsylvania was one of those dealers who refused to relinquish his car{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.  He instead held on to it as a collectible.  Realizing its incredible rarity and place in both GM/Oldsmobile and Indy 500 history he drove less than {{convert|800|mi|km}} over his many years of ownership. The Knobloch family sold the car after his death{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.

'''Viking''' is an automobile manufactured by [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]]' [[Oldsmobile]] division, in Lansing, Michigan, for model years 1929 to 1931 and used the [[GM B platform]].

Viking was part of [[Alfred Sloan]]'s [[General Motors Companion Make Program|companion make program]] introduced to help span gaps in General Motors’ pricing structure, and was marketed through GM's Oldsmobile division. Viking was one of four makes introduced by General Motors, the other lines (and their GM divisions) being [[Pontiac]] ([[Oakland Motor Car Company|Oakland]]), [[Marquette (automobile)|Marquette]] ([[Buick]]) and [[LaSalle (automobile)|LaSalle]] ([[Cadillac]]). Of the four makes, Viking was the only one priced higher than its "parent" make.&lt;ref name="Kimes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kimes|first=Beverly Rae|title=The Standard Catalog of American Cars: 1805-1942|year=1996|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, IA|isbn=0873414284|pages=1612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oldsmobile Touring Sedan''' is a [[full-size car]] that was produced by [[Oldsmobile]].  Marketed from 1987 to 1993, two generations of the Touring Sedan were produced.  Introduced to commemorate the 90th anniversary of Oldsmobile, the model also was an attempt by General Motors to differentiate Oldsmobile from Buick by marketing it to younger, upscale buyers.  

A variant of the [[Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight]], both generations were based on the front-wheel drive [[GM_C_platform_(1985)|GM C-platform]].  All examples were produced exclusively as a four-door sedan.  

The Touring Sedan was discontinued after 1993; the model line was functionally replaced by the [[GM H platform (1986)|GM H-platform]] [[Oldsmobile LSS]] and the [[GM G platform (1995)|GM G-platform]] [[Oldsmobile Aurora]].

== Model history ==

===1987–1990===
Oldsmobile introduced the Touring Sedan late in the 1987 model year, commemorating the 90th anniversary of the nameplate.  Officially designated the W12 option package for the Ninety-Eight sedan, the Oldsmobile Touring sedan carried a base price of just over $24,000 [[USD]] (approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|24000|1987}}}} in current dollars).

As with Oldsmobile Troféo and the later Cadillac Seville Touring Sedan (STS) and Eldorado Touring Coupe (ETC), the Touring Sedan was a performance-oriented derivative of an existing GM model line marketed towards buyers of European [[Executive car|luxury sports sedans]], including the [[Audi 100#Audi 100, 200 and 5000 (C3, 1982–1991)|Audi 5000]], [[BMW 7 Series (E32)|BMW 735i]], and [[Mercedes-Benz W124|Mercedes-Benz 300E]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-american/curbside-classic-1992-oldsmobile-touring-sedan-a-regency-with-an-attitude/|title=Curbside Classic: 1992 Oldsmobile Touring Sedan – A Regency With An Attitude|last=Klockau|first=Tom|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

While sharing the 165 hp 3.8L V6 (and 4-speed automatic transmission) of the Ninety-Eight (and Toronado), Oldsmobile upgraded the handling of the Touring Sedan with the use of a stiffer FE3 touring suspension (shared with the Troféo), which added larger stabilizer bars; Teves four-wheel anti-lock brakes (ABS) was included.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/olds/90olds/12.html|title=Auto Brochure|website=www.lov2xlr8.no|access-date=2019-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Externally, the Touring Sedan was not badged or advertised as a Ninety-Eight, with Oldsmobile using special badges for the model.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The lower body was distinguished by dark gray body cladding and revised bumper covers; fog lamps were standard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The interior underwent several revisions; to become the first five-passenger version of the Ninety-Eight, the Touring Sedan was fitted with custom 6-way [[Lear Siegler]] leather bucket seats, a floor-mounted transmission shifter with a floor console, real burled walnut wood trim, and a full set of instruments (tachometer, 120-mph speedometer, oil, volts, coolant temp, and fuel gauges).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The rear seat was redesigned to include individually-reclining seatbacks and head restraints.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;             

For 1988, the Touring Sedan saw few major changes.  For 1989, the model line underwent an exterior revision, with all chrome exterior trim painted black; 16-inch wheels (shared with the Troféo) became standard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A redesigned steering wheel was introduced (including controls for climate and stereo systems).  Alongside the Delco-Bose cassette player, a CD player became an option.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===1991–1993===
For 1991, the Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight received a complete redesign of its exterior and interior.  In place of a stand-alone model line, the Touring Sedan was reintroduced as a performance-oriented trim level, becoming the Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight Touring; the [[Oldsmobile 88|Oldsmobile Eighty-Eight]] received a similar variant, designated the LSS (Luxury Sports Sedan).  Slotted alongside the Regency as the top-trim Ninety-Eight, the Touring was offered with five-passenger seating and alloy wheels (shared with the LSS).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The two-tone body of the previous generation was replaced with a monochromatic exterior (including a body-color grille); all chrome trim was deleted (with the exception of badging).  

For 1992, a 205 hp supercharged version of the 3.8L V6 became an option (in line with the Buick Park Avenue Ultra, Pontiac Bonneville SSEi, and Oldsmobile LSS); the naturally-aspirated 3.8L V6 produced 170 hp&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

After the 1993 model year, Oldsmobile removed the Touring trim from the Ninety-Eight model line.  While developed as the direct successor of the two-door Toronado, the four-door Aurora also closely matched the Ninety-Eight in size; leading Oldsmobile to consolidate the model line with the 88 after 1996.  The similar LSS remained in production from 1991 to 1999, itself replaced by the 2001 Aurora.

Following the success of [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] components in [[Oldsmobile]]'s [[Oldsmobile 442|442]] models, Oldsmobile, in collaboration with [[Hurst Performance]] of [[Warminster Township, Pennsylvania|Warminster]], [[Pennsylvania]], produced special-edition performance versions of the [[Oldsmobile 442|442]] or [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme|Cutlass Supreme]], the '''Hurst/Olds'''.

==1968==
[[File:1968 Hurst Demmer.jpg|thumb|1968 Hurst/Olds Sport Coupe at Demmer]]The first Hurst/Olds was the 1968 '''Hurst/Olds'''. It shared its body with the regular [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]] and [[Oldsmobile 442|442]], but had a unique Peruvian Silver and Black paint scheme. The Hurst/Olds was powered by a {{convert|390|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} @ 5000 rpm and a maximum [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] of {{convert|500|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 3200 rpm, 308° duration cam W-45 (without A/C) or 285/287° duration cam W-46 (with A/C), with a [[Engine displacement|displacement]] of [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#455|{{convert|455|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Rocket V8]], equipped with a single 4-barrel [[Rochester_Products_Division|Rochester]] [[Quadrajet]] 4GC [[carburetor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myclassicgarage.com/knowledge-base/1968-Oldsmobile-442|title=1968 Oldsmobile 442 performance specs|website=myclassicgarage.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldsmobilesforever.com/442%20History.htm|title=Oldsmobile 442|website=oldsmobilesforever.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This engine was similar to the {{convert|400|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} W-34 455 engine offered in the [[Oldsmobile Toronado|Toronado]] and the {{convert|390|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} W-33 455 option available on the full-sized [[Oldsmobile 88|Delta 88]]. The W-45 and the milder W-46 engines differed in [[camshaft]] and [[cylinder head]] selection. The 455 was mated to a code OW three-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] 400 [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] with console-mounted [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] Dual-Gate [[Gear shift|shifter]] that permitted automatic or manually ratcheted shifting.
	
515 production examples of the 1968 model were built in 2 body styles. There were 51 Sport coupes and 464 Holiday coupes manufactured.
	
The Hurst/Olds was the only GM intermediate-sized car to offer an engine larger than {{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}  thanks to a corporate policy at that time which prohibited the divisions from putting larger engines in cars smaller than full-sized models other than the [[Chevrolet Corvette]]. Oldsmobile got around the 400 cubic-inch limit by implying that the engines were installed by Hurst, not Olds. In fact, the special [[drivetrain]] and [[Ram-air intake|ram-air]] package (shared with the W-30 and W-31) was installed at the factory. The cars were then taken across town ([[Lansing, Michigan]]) to Demmer Engineering where the remainder of the unique Hurst components were added. This included black accent paint with hand-applied white pinstripes, real [[walnut]] dash trim, H/O emblems, and Dual Gate shifter and mini-console.

==1969==
[[File:1969 Hurst Olds.jpg|thumb|1969 Hurst/Olds]]
The Hurst/Olds returned for the 1969 model year. The biggest change was the switch from the silver and black paint scheme of '68 to a new Firefrost gold on white paint scheme. This would be the primary paint scheme for many Hurst/Olds models of later years. Instead of the dual ram air scoops under the front bumper that was used in '68 and other ram air '69s, the H/O received a functional "mailbox" fiberglass hood scoop with '''''H/O 455''''' on each side. A spoiler was mounted on the trunk and the car sat on unique 15x7 chrome SSII rims with Goodyear F60x15 Polyglas tires.  The exterior was finished off with a pair of English racing mirrors, H/O emblems on the front fenders and deck lid, blacked out 442 grilles, and black hand-applied pinstripes.  All of the '68 and '69 H/Os were pinstriped by one person.  Interior modifications included a different wood veneer on the mini-console, painted gold stripes on the headrests, and a Hurst/Olds emblem on the glove-box door.  The non-drive train modifications were again done at Demmer Engineering.  Approximately 913 cars were built including 2 convertibles for Hurst promotional use, one for East coast events and one for West coast events(a third was built after one of the original two was destroyed).

The 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8 (W46) was rated at {{convert|380|hp}} and 500 lb/ft of torque. This is the same engine as A/C equipped 68 Hurst Olds' and provided better drivability. The same engine was used for both A/C and non-A/C cars.  The engine received a unique intake manifold, chrome steel valve covers, and a special vacuum operated air cleaner lid to allow cold air from the hood scoop into the carburetor.  This was backed up by a specially calibrated code OH Turbo 400 transmission and 3.42 gears for non-A/C cars or 3.08 gears for cars with A/C.  Optional 3.91 gears were available only for non-A/C cars.

The Hurst/Olds was temporarily dropped after the 1969 model year because GM dropped the 400 cubic-inch engine limit for the 1970 model year, which permitted the divisions to install larger engines in their intermediate musclecars. For 1970, the regular [[Oldsmobile 442|442]] came standard with a 365-horsepower 455 Rocket V8, or an optional {{convert|370|hp}} W-30 version of same engine. For 1970, Olds planned to bring back the Hurst/Olds, but as a lower-priced companion to the 442 with a smaller 350 cubic-inch V8 and special graphics. That planned '70 H/O ended up being introduced as the mid-year Rallye 350, which featured a bright yellow paint scheme for the body along with front and rear bumpers coated with matching yellow urethane. The next Hurst/Olds would be introduced as a 1972 model.

==1972==
[[File:1972 Hurst Olds Pace Car.jpg|thumb|1972 Hurst/Olds Convertible Indy Pace Car]]
The 1972 Hurst/Olds was actually developed by [[Hurst Performance]], and not Oldsmobile. Due to a [[1971 Indianapolis 500#Pace car crash|tragic accident involving the 1971 Indy Pace car]], a Dodge Challenger, the major auto manufacturers were reluctant to provide the pace car for the 1972 Indy race. Hurst Performance stepped up and volunteered to sponsor the 1972 Pace car. Oldsmobile provided the Cutlass Supreme coupe and convertible. It was the only time an Indy Pace car was sponsored by a manufacturer other than an automobile manufacturer, and first time to include a major supplier's name in the title. The 1972 edition of the Hurst/Olds had some of the lowest production numbers of any produced with a total of 629 made; 130 Convertibles, 220 hardtop with sunroof, 6 Station Wagons for Press and Ambulance use, and 279 hardtop cars. The only color available was Cameo White with reflective 3M gold stripes that were stickers, not paint. All of the cars had the W-25 Ram Air Hood and gold SS III Rally Wheels with a chrome bolt-on center cap and chrome beauty ring. The tires were Goodyear Polysteel Radials. The standard Hurst/Olds engine was a 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8 rated at 270 net horsepower. Optional at extra cost was the W-30 option with the L77 455, a blueprinted engine rated at 300 net horsepower. Both engines were mated to a Turbo Hydra-matic 400 transmission with console-mounted Hurst Dual-Gate shifter. All of the 1972 Hurst/Olds had the black Strato bucket interior with a center console. Special Hurst/Olds Pace Car badging adjourned the glove box door and all 1972 Hurst/Olds' were identified with a W-45 Code on the cowl tag.

==1973==
The new Hurst Olds shared with all 1973 GM A body cars, the most extensive redesign in their 10-year history The chassis was as new as the bodies -[[Wheelbase]] dimensions were a sporty 112&amp;nbsp;inches for coupes and 116&amp;nbsp;inches for sedans and station wagons on an all-new sturdier [[perimeter frame]] with increased front and rear suspension travel, larger 8½&amp;nbsp;inch rear axle, wider 6-inch wheel rim width, refined rear control arm bushings and new shock absorber location, new body mounts and improved front suspension geometry&lt;ref&gt;Chevrolet engineering report-73 Chevelle&lt;/ref&gt; - The left wheel was adjusted to have slightly more positive [[camber angle|camber]] than the right which resulted in a more uniform and stable steering feel on high-crown road surfaces while maintaining excellent freeway cruise stability. Clearances for spring travel were improved for a smoother ride over all types of surfaces; the [[coil spring]]s at each wheel were computer-selected to match the individual car's weight. Power brakes with front [[disc brake]] calipers were now standard on all '73 Cutlasses. 

Additional new features were an acoustical double-panel roof, tighter-fitting glass, flush style outside door handles, molded full foam front and rear seat construction, flow-through power ventilation system, inside hood release, refined Delcotron generator and sealed side-terminal battery, a larger 22 gallon fuel tank, and "flush and dry" rocker panels introduced first on the redesigned 1971 full-size GM cars. Another structural improvement was a stronger design for the side door guard beams. Options included swiveling Strato-[[bucket seats]] (with console) for coupes, a power moonroof, and Turbine I urethane (backed by steel) wheels, as was the instrument gauge cluster.&lt;ref&gt;1973–1977 Chevrolet Chevelle brochures&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oldsmobile Cutlass (including the Hurst/Olds and 442) changed body styles to the "Colonnade" body style, which was used until 1977. The Hurst Olds was based on the semi-fastback Cutlass S coupe and featured an interior with swiveling Strato bucket seats separated by a console with Hurst Dual-Gate shifter for the Turbo Hydra-matic 400 transmission. The sole engine offering was a 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8, with four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts, with the {{convert|250|hp}} L75 U code engine. Also available was the L77 V code 455 with {{convert|270|hp}} available only without air conditioning. Although Pontiac's SD 455 cubic-inch engine lasted one more year with {{convert|290|hp}}, Oldsmobile's high performance 455 engine would only last one more year culminating with the L76 optioned 455 W-30 Hurst/Olds in 1974.  The '73 model was the first Hurst Olds to be offered in two color schemes-black/gold or white/gold.  A grand total of 1,097 Hurst/Olds were produced for 1973 with about 60% being white/gold and about 40% being black/gold under option code W-45,  unless ordered without air conditioning, which was option code W-46. Hurst-only options included a console mounted digital tachometer, air shocks, and alarm system.

==1974==
[[File:1974 Oldsmobile Hurst W-30 (36597210302).jpg|275px|thumb|right|1974 Hurst/Olds W-30]]
The Hurst/Olds returned in 1974 with the "Colonnade" body style. This year the Hurst/Olds was also the Indianapolis 500 pace car, which was available as a graphics package option to the Hurst/Olds owner. 1800 1974 Hurst/Olds' were produced in 1974, 380 of them were the W-30 version which designated the 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8 and produced 230 net horsepower. The other 1420 had a 350 cubic-inch Rocket V8 with {{convert|180|hp}}, which was also the only engine available for California cars.
The 1974 Hurst/Olds was intended to be a pace car but because the Indy 500 track required convertibles for the parade lap cars, the Delta 88 was chosen.
These cars were used as track cars to parade celebrities and guests on the track.  There were a total of 92 Hurst/Olds Parade cars.

==1975==
The Hurst/Olds in 1975 was the first [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] car to have "Hurst/Hatch" removable T-Top style roof installed. The car is based on the formal-roofed  [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme|Cutlass Supreme]] coupe rather than the semi-fastback Cutlass S used in 1973-74.
The car was available in either black or white, with either a black or white half vinyl top offset by a wide aluminum band. Either a W-25, equipped with an Oldsmobile 350 engine, or a W-30, equipped with an Oldsmobile 455 engine could be had. Due the environmental regulations at the time, this was the first year that the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] mandated the addition of [[catalytic converters]] mounted in the exhaust system. Due to the added expense, only single exhaust was available.

The hood from the 1974 Hurst/Olds, with the center mounted [[louvers]], carried over. Gold stripes adorned the sides of the car, as well as the trunk, hood, and mirrors. The car also carried gold 15"x7" Super Stock III Oldsmobile rims.
Interiors were similar to 1974 except for revised door panels and new reversible vinyl/velour seat cushions and backs for the all-vinyl Strato bucket seats. The most popular interior color combination on '75 Hurst/Olds was white seats and door panels, and black carpet, dashboard, steering wheel and console. Additional colors such as red and beige dashboard, carpet and seat cushions was also available.
The Hurst Performance 'Dual Gate' Shifter carried on for 1975. An optional digital LED numerical readout tachometer was available and mounted on the center console by Hurst Performance.

==1979==
[[File:1979 Hurst Olds W-30 front.jpg|thumb|1979 Hurst/Olds W-30]]
Another car, now called simply the '''Hurst/Olds''', appeared in 1979, based on the Cutlass Calais coupe. It used the '''L34''', [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#350|Oldsmobile's 5.7&amp;nbsp;L (350&amp;nbsp;in³) V8 engine]].  A Hurst Dual Gate shifter was standard. After a three-year hiatus, the H/O returned for 1979 on GM's newly downsized Cutlass body. The first H/O to be built entirely by Oldsmobile Division, it was also the first H/O that did not offer a 455 engine. It was, however, the only GM G-body to offer a 350 V8 in 1979. It was also the first W-30 to come with the Olds 350 and not the Olds 455. White and black again were the color choices, but with a wider choice of interior trims than ever before. Gold paint covered the hood, most of the top, and the very rear of the trunk. The aluminum wheels were also painted gold, along with the grille. This H/O was built by Oldsmobile at the Lansing plant.

Known as the W-30, it was produced for the following year in the 1980 Olds 442. The only major differences between the 1979 and the 1980 were the headlights, and the 1979 also had the dual gate Hurst shifter.

==1983–1984==
[[File:1983 Hurst Olds.jpg|thumb|1983 Hurst/Olds T-Top]]
After the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass|Cutlass]] line was split between the [[front-wheel drive]] [[GM A platform|A-body]] [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera|Cutlass Ciera]] and the [[rear-wheel drive]] [[GM G platform (RWD)|G-body]] [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme|Cutlass Supreme]] in 1982, GM again offered a limited-edition Hurst/Olds - it was the 15th anniversary of the first Hurst/Olds introduced in 1968.
The Hurst Lightning Rod floor shifter was introduced in the '83 H/O.
For its 15th Anniversary Edition, the '83 H/O came only in black with silver rocker panels. Chrome 15" wheels fitted Goodyear Eagle GT tires, and a power bulge hood and rear spoiler gave the car a purposeful look. A modified version of Oldsmobile's 307 CID V8 was installed, along with 3.73 gears and Hurst's radical Lightning Rods shifter. Dual exhausts with rumbling mufflers meant there was no mistaking the H/O for a garden variety Cutlass. A new style "Hurst/Olds" emblem was introduced, and red and silver stripes separated the black and silver paint. Demand for the car was very strong. Originally, 2500 units were scheduled to be produced, but Olds had to up that number to 3001 because of high demand. That may have been a factor in bringing the H/O back for '84. The paint scheme was reversed, with silver being the main body color, and black on the rocker panels. In most respects, the '84 was mechanically identical to the '83.  The '84 did get a stronger 8.5" rear end. 3500 units were produced in 1984.

A fully loaded 1984 H/O model cost $19,500 (base price ~$11k)

The '''Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera''' is a [[mid-size car]] that was manufactured and marketed for model years 1982-1996 by the [[Oldsmobile|Oldsmobile Division of General Motors]]. It shared the [[front-wheel drive]] [[GM A platform (FWD)|A platform]] with the similar [[Buick Century]], [[Pontiac 6000]] and [[Chevrolet Celebrity]]; both Oldsmobile and [[Chevrolet]] considered using the Celebrity name, which had originally been used on the [[Oldsmobile 88|Eighty Eight]] model in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Witzenburg |first=Gary |title=The Name Game |journal=Motor Trend |date=April 1984 |page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Available body styles included a 2-door [[coupe]], 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]], and the '''Cutlass (Ciera) Cruiser''' [[station wagon]]. Based on the [[GM X platform (1980)|GM X-Body]], this platform served as the basis for the [[GM U platform|GM U-Body]] vans.

==Development==
The 1980s was a time of great transition for General Motors. [[Roger Smith (executive)|CEO Roger B. Smith]] invested heavily in computerization, front wheel drive and advanced assembly processes. One of the first products to reach the marketplace under this program was the GM A-Body. The Cutlass Ciera, like its A-Body platform mates, benefited from GM's Computer Command Control system, MacPherson strut front suspension, body color urethane bumpers, flush mounted glass, front wheel drive and on many models, fuel injection. The Cutlass Ciera shared the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass|Cutlass]] nameplate with the smaller [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais|Cutlass Calais]] and the larger [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme|Cutlass Supreme]], often creating confusion among the buying public as all three were available concurrently during the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Initially, the Cutlass Ciera and its platform mates were premium mid sized offerings, holding a higher market position than the X-Body, from which they were derived, and the [[GM N platform|N-Body]] Calais, which would follow for 1985. The Cutlass Ciera and Cruiser were intended as replacements for the venerable rear wheel drive G-Body Cutlass models, but strong sales kept the higher trim Cutlass Supreme in production until the 1988 model year, when it was replaced by the all new GM W-Body models. As such, these front wheel drive sedans carried the A-Body designation, previously reserved for their rear wheel drive showroom companions. In order to keep both lines in production, General Motors rechristened the rear wheel drive mid sized platform as the [[GM G platform|G-Body]] beginning with the 1982 model year. When the W-Body intermediates were introduced for 1988, Oldsmobile "decontented" its Cutlass Ciera by reducing the number of options and configurations available to the public. During the model years that followed, luxury and performance options such as FE3 suspension, Auto Calculator, bucket seats, leather seating areas, sunroofs, and full instrumentation were eliminated.  After 1990, special editions were dropped from the American market and by the end of 1991, the coupe was discontinued. Although slimmed down to just two trim levels and two body styles, sedan and wagon, the 1996 final run of Oldsmobile Cieras were still Oldsmobile's best selling product line.

==Special editions==
The car enjoyed many factory specialty models including the Holiday Coupe, GT, ES, XC, and International Series models – the latter of which had a stock body kit.

'''Holiday Coupe'''
[[File:1985 Cutlass Ciera Holiday Coupe.jpg|thumb|1985 Cutlass Ciera Holiday coupe (RPO WJ5) in Pastel Beige with Saddle top and interior.]]
From 1984 to March 1986, Oldsmobile offered a special edition Holiday Coupe package, option WJ5, on the Brougham coupe. This package included a unique landau vinyl roof (RPO C10), opera windows, special rooftop trim and painted pin stripes. The Holiday Coupe package required tinted glass and could not be ordered with standard pin stripes. It was discontinued part way through the 1986 model year, when Oldsmobile introduced the updated coupe roof line. All Holiday coupes were converted by the American Sunroof Company (ASC) outside of the factory. Oldsmobile would ship ASC Brougham coupes equipped with tinted glass to modify at their facility. These models have an ASC decal in the driver side door frame indicating the factory authorized conversion.

'''ES'''
The ES (RPO W48) sedan was available from 1983–1985. These vehicles feature unique wheel covers, blacked out trim, F41 performance suspension, black sidewall tires, center console with bucket seats and a sport steering wheel. For 1985 only the ES sedan returned, as the coupe had been renamed GT.

'''GT'''
The GT (RPO W45) was first offered as an option on the 1985 Ciera coupe.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.consumerguide.com/cheap-wheels-1986-90-oldsmobile-cutlass-ciera-gtinternational-series-coupe/&lt;/ref&gt; It featured blacked out trim, V6 engine, center console with bucket seats, fog lamps factory body kit, alloy wheels and performance suspension. For 1986, it was expanded to the four door sedan, replacing the ES. Following the 1987 model year, it was replaced by the International Series.

'''International Series'''
From 1988 to 1990, the International Series (RPO W45/W49) was the top performance trim available on the Ciera. It featured the 3.8 liter V6 for 1988 and the 3.3 liter V6 for 1989 and 1990. Available on coupe and sedan models, it featured a factory body kit, bucket seats with console, FE3 performance suspension, alloy wheels, full instrumentation, air conditioning JA2 heavy duty brakes, extra capacity cooling, and unique ornamentation.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.consumerguide.com/cheap-wheels-1986-90-oldsmobile-cutlass-ciera-gtinternational-series-coupe/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''XC''' The XC was introduced as part of Oldsmobile's 90th Anniversary celebrations (XC being Roman Numeral or 90) and remained on the option sheet from 1988 to 1990.&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/view/cutlasscieraresourcecenter/home/1988&lt;/ref&gt; It was available on coupe and sedan models. Sharing much of its sporty appearance with the International Series, the XC is distinguished by orange body side stripes in place of the typical black and chrome trim. Unlike the similar looking International Series, the XC package did not include a standard V6, 4 speed automatic, or other higher end features. These had to be ordered in addition to the XC package.

Oldsmobile never produced a factory convertible of this A-Body model for public sale, but many dealers did make them available via aftermarket conversions. Between 1983 and 1986, 814 Cutlass Ciera convertibles were made by [[Hess &amp; Eisenhardt|Hess &amp; Eisenhardt/Car Craft]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hemmings.com/blog/article/everyday-cutlass-ciera/&lt;/ref&gt; These vehicles were Brougham coupes, modified with leather interior and chassis reinforcement to provide the needed structural rigidity that was lost by removing the roof.

==1982–1988==
[[File:Early Olds Cutlass Ciera.jpg|thumb|left|1982–1984 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera sedan]]
Production began September 28, 1981 at [[Doraville Assembly]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] for the 1982 model year.&lt;ref name='Wards82'&gt;{{cite book |title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 1982 |publisher=Ward's Communications |year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1984, the Cutlass Cruiser [[station wagon]] model moved to the Cutlass Ciera's platform; previously, the nameplate used the [[rear wheel drive]] [[GM G platform (RWD)|G-body]]. The Cutlass Ciera came in three trim levels: the base, LS, and ''Brougham'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|oː|ə|m}}.

The standard engine was a 2.5 L four-cylinder Tech IV ([[Iron Duke engine|Pontiac Iron Duke]]) engine. All models also included standard bench seats and cloth interior.  Available on all models were a 3.0 L Buick V6 engine, or a 4.3 L Oldsmobile Diesel V6 engine. Brougham trim added a  plush interior with vinyl accents, leatherette interior door pulls, additional chrome trim and a reading lamp. The base coupe and sedan were initially dropped after 1982 due to poor sales, leaving LS and Brougham trim as the only available from 1983–1985, excluding special editions. During the model year, production ended at the [[Fremont Assembly|Fremont GM Assembly Plant]] due to that facility closing.

1983 Added a new ES trim package for the coupe and sedan models. This would be the last year for the standard 13" wheels.

For the 1984, the line added a new Cruiser wagon, replacing the former G-Body Cutlass Cruiser. A 3.8 liter Buick V6 and the Holiday Coupe package joined the option list&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/view/cutlasscieraresourcecenter/home/1984&lt;/ref&gt; as did a 4 speed manual transmission for diesel models. This transmission was dropped in the fall of 1983 from the option list.

For 1985, the Cutlass Ciera received its first facelift with revised grille, headlamps, taillights and interiors. The GT coupe was added as a companion to the ES sedan. In spring 1985 the Oldsmobile designed 4.3-liter diesel was dropped due to poor sales. Canadian models added the 2.8 liter 2bbl V6 to this year.

For 1986, the Cutlass Ciera's grille had expanded ventilation sections than the similar 1985 model. The coupe received a new, more rounded roofline that was not initially shared with the other GM A-body models, but later migrated to the Buick Century coupe. These models are easily identifiable by their sweeping roofline and updated VIN identification, which replaced the "27" coupe designation used form 1982 until March 1986 with "37". 1986 also saw the addition of the 2.8 liter V6 in place of the previously offered Buick 3.0 liter V6 in the American market. The 2.8 liter engine had previously been offered in Canadian Ciera's with the 2-barrel carburetor.  In compliance with federal regulations, the 1986 Ciera was the first to have a high mount brake light as standard equipment. The Cutlass Ciera nameplate appeared on the rear fiberglass panel, just below the trunk lid.

[[File:1985 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera Brougham Convertible (H&amp;E), front left at Hershey 2019.jpg|thumb|1985 Cutlass Ciera Convertible conversion by Hess &amp; Eisenhardt]]
For 1987, the Cutlass Ciera was facelifted again with a new grille, updated steering wheel had the Oldsmobile logo moved from the right to the very center, and the 2.8 L ''LE2'' V6 engine was dropped in favor of the more powerful LB6 unit. In addition, Brougham and GT models received composite headlamps as standard equipment. The 2.5 liter Iron Duke 4 cylinder received minor updates, including a serpentine belt, which replaced the previous engine belt set up, for a boost of 6 horsepower, to 98.  Ciera's tail lamps were slightly revised, adding ribs to their lower quarter.

For 1988, the base Cutlass Ciera received composite headlamps, the new ''International Series'' models were introduced, and this would be the last year for the ''Brougham'', which was rechristened the Brougham SL on coupe models. The ''International Series'' included the emblem with the flags of various countries below the nameplate (see below for exemplar) and was available on coupe and sedan body styles. This model came equipped with a standard Buick 3.8 liter V6 engine, 4-speed automatic transmission, sporty exhaust system, front bucket seats, and power windows. Composite headlamps were made standard on all Cutlass Ciera models. Sedan models could have the new power sliding sunroof for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/view/cutlasscieraresourcecenter/home/1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==1989–1996==
[[File:Oldsmobile Cutlass Cruiser front.jpg|thumb|right|1989–1996 Cutlass Cruiser wagon]]

The Cutlass Ciera was updated for 1989, with the sedan receiving a modern roofline (similar to the coupe), and revised body side moldings and deletion of hood ornaments. Rear seat shoulder belts were added. Both coupe and sedan models received updated rear-end treatments. The older Buick 3.8 liter V6 was dropped in favor of GM's new [[GM 3300 engine|3300 V6]] engine. The Brougham trim level was eliminated, replaced by an upper level SL trim. A new XC wagon also joined the option sheet this year.&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/view/cutlasscieraresourcecenter/home/1989&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1990, the front seat belts were moved from the B-pillars to the doors. This would also be the last year for the 'International Series' and 'XC'.

The changes for 1991 included a new instrument cluster with a trip odometer and an engine temperature gauge. 6 speaker sound systems were added as was a remote lock fob and improved body acoustics. This would be the last year for the coupe in the United States and Canada, but it would continue on in the Mexican market.

For 1992, the coupe was dropped, and the line-up included only sedans and wagons in 'S' or 'SL' designations. The wagon now had some internal competition in the form of the new [[Oldsmobile Silhouette]] minivan (itself based on the Cutlass Ciera's A-platform), offering buyers a choice of traditional station wagon or a multi-configurable minivan. Despite the all-new Olds Achieva and Delta 88 models for 1992, the Cutlass Ciera was still Oldsmobile's best-selling model line, with over 132,000 sedans and an additional 7,793 wagons produced this year.

For 1993, the 2.5 L Tech IV engine was replaced by the 2.2 L "2200" OHV engine with a 3-speed automatic transmission.

In 1994, the 'SL' designation was dropped. The 'Cutlass Ciera S', available in sedan or wagon form, featured a driver airbag as standard equipment, along with anti-lock brakes, adjustable steering column, electric rear-window defogger, automatic door locks, and delay wipers. The 3.1 liter, Chevrolet V6 engine with a 4-speed automatic transmission replaced the prior year's 3300 Buick V6. This engine was standard on the Cruiser wagon and optional on the sedan. The 2200 I-4 received minor updates, resulting in a 10-horsepower increase.

For 1995, the 'SL' designation returned in place of the 'S'. The 1995 Cutlass Ciera SL featured a new shift interlock system that required stepping on the brake pedal before moving the gear shift out of park.

For 1996, the final model year, the 'Cutlass' nomenclature was dropped and the car was now known simply as the 'Ciera SL', which continued to be available in 'Series I' or 'Series II' equipment levels. The chrome "Oldsmobile" badge above the driver's headlight was deleted. During this time, Oldsmobile attempted to revamp itself as a European-styled upscale make with new products such as the [[Oldsmobile Aurora|Aurora]], but the Cutlass Ciera's continued strong sales proved almost an embarrassment due to its dated design and perceived image as an "[[old man's car]]". On the other hand, because the tooling for the A-body platform had long since been monetized, GM was guaranteed a profit off each Cutlass Ciera and [[Buick Century]] sold. At the same time, GM was losing massive amounts of money on its other midsized platform, the [[GM W platform|W-platform]]. In addition, build quality and reliability of the cars was extremely good by this point.{{dubious|By what standard?|date=March 2018}} Production of the Ciera ended on August 30, 1996.&lt;ref name='Wards97'&gt;{{cite book |title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 1997 |publisher=Ward's Communications |year=1997 |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was replaced in the U.S. by the [[GM N platform|N-body]] 1997 [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]], also built at the [[Oklahoma City Assembly|Oklahoma City assembly plant]]. As a result, the 1996 Cruiser wagon was the final Oldsmobile station wagon model produced. Sales of this Ciera replacement peaked at 53,438 in 1998 and it was discontinued in 1999.

==International Sales==
Throughout much of its history, the Cutlass Ciera was offered in a number of global markets. In Mexico, local production allowed for unique models under the name Chevrolet Cutlass. These models featured the coupe body style and International model until discontinuation in 1996. These vehicles were also offered with 5 speed manual transmissions.

==Awards==
The Cutlass Ciera consistently ranked among the highest rated vehicles by J.D. Power and Associates; it was ranked the "Best in Price Class" on July 30, 1992 and the "Top-Ranked American-Made Car" on May 28, 1992. It was also named "Safe Car of the Year" by Prevention Magazine on March 6, 1992.

==In popular culture==
The Cutlass Ciera appeared repeatedly in the first season (1993) of the TV series [[The X-Files]], mostly as a rental vehicle driven by the main characters.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imcdb.org/v042039.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imcdb.org/v042040.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imcdb.org/v007148.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_42046-Oldsmobile-Cutlass-Ciera-1993.html&lt;/ref&gt;
The Cutlass Ciera is also featured prominently in the 1996 film [[Fargo (film)|Fargo]], which is partially set in an Oldsmobile dealership. Throughout the film, police are looking for a "tan Ciera", which is eventually found, leading them to their suspect.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imcdb.org/v004816.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noted owner==
In April 2016, U.S. presidential candidate, and wife of former president [[Bill Clinton]], [[Hillary Clinton]]'s old car was being offered for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://apnews.com/19f0feb12345455ba58f3479ec355163 |title=Former White House gardener selling Hillary Clinton’s car |date=April 11, 2016 |agency=AP |accessdate=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car was a 1986 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera Brougham, blue in color, with few options (a blue velour interior, a radio with cassette player, and alloy wheels, plus roll-up windows), with an [[Arkansas]] registration and license plates an Arkansas title signed by Clinton, as well as a Bill Clinton for Governor sticker from 1990 on the back window. The car was moved to the [[White House]] in [[Washington, DC]] in 1993 when Bill Clinton became the President of the United States, where it mostly parked on the south grounds. In 2000, it was sold for $2,000 to a now-retired White House gardener named Mike Lawn. The car had approximately 33,000 miles on its odometer in 2016 when the owner was selling it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Arcement |first=Katherine |title=If you want to buy Hillary Clinton’s old car, now’s your chance |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/04/13/if-you-want-to-buy-hillary-clintons-old-car-nows-your-chance/ |newspaper=Washington Post |date=13 April 2016 |accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sold in April 2016 for $60,100 on eBay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ben |first=Hooper |title=Ex-White House groundskeeper sells Hillary Clinton's car for $60k |url= https://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2016/04/25/Ex-White-House-groundskeeper-sells-Hillary-Clintons-car-for-60k/5131461603501/ |website=UPI |date=25 April 2016 |accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oldsmobile Alero''' was a mid-size car that was produced by General Motors for its [[Oldsmobile]] division from 1999 to 2004. The Alero was introduced in 1998 as a 1999 model to replace the entry-level [[Oldsmobile Achieva|Achieva]] and [[Oldsmobile Cutlass|Cutlass]], and went into production in April 1998. All Aleros were built in the United States at [[Lansing, Michigan]]. The Alero was the last model Oldsmobile built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-end-of-the-road-for-oldsmobile|title=The end of the road for Oldsmobile|date=April 29, 2004|work=HISTORY.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Oldsmobile Alero sedan rear 6.15.18.jpg|thumb|left|Oldsmobile Alero sedan rear]]
The design of the Alero was originally previewed in 1997 with the [[Oldsmobile Alero Alpha|Alero Alpha]] [[concept car]], a [[V6]]-powered sport coupe that featured many design elements seen in the production Alero as well as some that were never meant for production. Its appearance was a revival of "[[coke bottle styling]]", popular during the 1960s and 1970s.

[[File:Oldsmobile-Alero-coupe.jpg|thumb|An Oldsmobile Alero coupe in 2007]]
[[File:Chevrolet Alero front 20080121.jpg|thumb|A Chevrolet Alero parked on a city street in [[Europe]]]]
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:99 Alero interior.jpg|right|thumb|The interior of a 1998 Oldsmobile Alero sedan]] --&gt;
The Alero was sold either as a 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] or as a 2-door [[coupe]]. It shared its chassis and many parts, including engines, with the [[Pontiac Grand Am]]. All Aleros came in base ''GX'', mid-level ''GL'', or high-end ''GLS'' trim; the ''GL'' trim was split into three levels: 1, 2, and 3.

The Alero experienced minimal changes during its 5-year run. Most of these changes were either in choice of engines or options. In 2003, the Alero's [[Daytime running lamp|daytime running lights]] were changed from high-beam to low-beam.

The Alero was also sold in select countries in [[Europe]] and in Israel between 1999 and 2001 as the [[Chevrolet]] Alero, and was only available as a [[sedan (car)|sedan]]. The car still featured its Oldsmobile badges even though sold under the Chevrolet brand, but since most European consumers would not recognize the badging, [[Chevrolet]] badges were added to the grille and rear fascia for the 2000 model year. The Alero featured Chevrolet emblems throughout its entire run in Israel. The Alero was replaced in [[Europe]], Israel, and [[Canada]] by the [[GM Daewoo]]-sourced [[Daewoo Magnus|Chevrolet Evanda/Epica]].

The Alero's production ended with a special Final 500 Edition. These last 500 Aleros featured custom logos inspired by vintage Oldsmobile logos, dark cherry metallic paint, and a plate featuring the car's number out of 500.  The final Alero Final 500 Edition (#500 of 500), a ''GLS'' 4-door, also happened to be the final Oldsmobile ever built, and was signed under its hood by the employees of the General Motors Lansing plant. The final car left the Lansing Assembly Plant on April 29, 2004 and was then given to the [[R.E. Olds Transportation Museum]]. On December 15, 2017, this car was sold at auction for $42,000 to a dealer in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.autoremarketing.com/wholesale/florida-dealer-collector-takes-home-last-oldsmobile-42000&lt;/ref&gt;

A preview of the planned replacement for the Alero was seen in 2001 with the unveiling of the [[Oldsmobile O4]] concept, designed by Bertone. The car was an open-top 4-seater with [[Europe]]an styling featuring some [[Oldsmobile]] traits, and powered by the latest ''[[GM Ecotec engine|Ecotec]]'' [[I4 engine]]. The name had multiple meanings, including "Oldsmobile 4-Seater" as well as implying the year 2004 as a planned date for production.

However, the O4 concept was unveiled a few weeks after [[General Motors]] announced that they would be phasing out the Oldsmobile brand, meaning that production possibilities of the O4 would never be realized. Because of this, a second generation Alero was never built and the car was phased out with the Oldsmobile brand in 2004.

== Trim levels ==
During its production, the Alero was available in four trim levels, all available in coupe or sedan body styles:

The '''GX''' was the most basic trim level of the Alero. It included such features as a 2.4 L inline four-cylinder engine, 5-speed manual transmission, an AM/FM stereo (later, AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD player) with a four-speaker sound system, 15-inch (38 cm) black-painted steel wheels with decorative wheel covers, manual windows, power door locks, full instrumentation, air conditioning, velour door panel inserts, and cloth seating surfaces. The 3.4 L V6 engine available on all other Alero trim levels was not available on the base GX trim level.

The '''GL''' was the midrange trim level of the Alero. It added the following features to the base GX trim level: an AM/FM stereo with cassette player (not applicable for later models), power windows, and 16-inch (40 cm) alloy wheels. The 3.4 L V6 engine was available as an option, though was standard equipment on the '''GL2''' trim level. The '''GL1''' trim level also offered the V6 engine option.

The '''GLS''' trim level was the "luxury" trim level of the Alero. It added the following features to the already well-equipped GL trim level: an AM/FM stereo with cassette and single-disc CD player (later, an MP3-decoding single-disc CD player was added), an eight-speaker "premium" sound system with amplifier, keyless entry, power driver seat, leather upholstery and a security system. The 3.4 L V6 engine was standard for this trim level.

== Variant prototypes ==
[[File:Alero-OSV-Oldsman.JPG|thumb|An Oldsmobile Alero OSV in the mid-2000s]]
General Motors commissioned the construction of Alero [[prototype]]s either for testing or to gather public opinion on possible future plans for the Alero. These variants include:
* Alero OSV - "Oldsmobile Speciality Vehicle", an experiment in an [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] parts brand for Oldsmobile. Featured a body kit, [[supercharged]] four-cylinder engine, custom interior, and special cherry red paint with ghosted Oldsmobile emblems in the rear quarter panels.
* Alero OSV II - Another experimental vehicle, this time featuring an [[GM Premium V engine#LX5|LX5]] [[DOHC]] 3.5 L [[V6]] (used in the [[Oldsmobile Intrigue]] and [[Oldsmobile Aurora|Aurora]]) and featured custom dark green paint.
* Alero 442 - A set of show cars based on the Alero coupe fitted with a body kit similar in design to the [[Oldsmobile 442]]. Each Alero 442 show car had a unique color, including white with gold stripes and white with pink stripes.
* Alero California - A custom built version of the Alero coupe featuring parts including a large rear wing, racing seats, sport tires, and custom graphics painted in brown and yellow.
* Alero Convertible - An experiment in the possibility of creating an Alero with a [[convertible (car)|convertible]] soft top to help broaden the appeal of the car to young buyers. The Oldsmobile O4 concept also hinted that the next generation Alero could have had a convertible model.
* Alero [[Pace Car]] - Built by General Motors as part of their [[fleet vehicles|fleet]] of Oldsmobile safety cars for the [[Indy Racing League]], featuring custom yellow, blue and white [[Racing flag#The checkered flag|checkered flag]] graphics.

== Safety ==
The [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS) gave the 1999&amp;ndash;2005 Grand Am (which was built on the same platform as the 1999&amp;ndash;2004 Alero) a ''Poor'' rating in its frontal crash test for its marginal structural integrity, a possible head injury, a potential right leg injury, and poor dummy control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/ratingsbyseries.aspx?id=514 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Oldsmobile Alero |publisher=Iihs.org |accessdate=October 17, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526205014/http://www.iihs.org/ratings/ratingsbyseries.aspx?id=514 |archivedate=May 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oldsmobile Intrigue''' is a [[mid-size]] [[sedan (car)|sedan]] that was manufactured from 1997 through 2002 by [[Oldsmobile]]. The Intrigue's design cues were first seen in 1995 with the [[Oldsmobile Antares]] [[concept car]], being unveiled in production form in January 1996 at the North American International Auto Show. The Intrigue was the first casualty in the three-year phase-out process of Oldsmobile; Olds' remaining models would last an additional year or two.

[[File:Intriadfsuiofausd.jpg|thumb|left|Oldsmobile Intrigue rear]]
The Oldsmobile Intrigue was introduced on May 5, 1997 as a 1998 model. The Oldsmobile Intrigue had replaced the aging [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]].  It rode on the second-generation of the [[GM W platform|W-body]], which it shared with the [[Buick Regal]]. The Oldsmobile Intrigue was supposed to compete with upscale Japanese and European imports such as [[Acura]] and [[BMW]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1997-06-12-9706110277-story.html|title=Oldsmobile reinvents itself |author=Richard Truett |publisher=[[Orlando Sentinel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oldsmobile Intrigue was heavily inspired by the [[Oldsmobile Aurora]] and the 1995 Oldsmobile Antares concept.

The Intrigue was available in three trim levels: base ''GX'', mid-level ''GL'', and high-end ''GLS''. All models were equipped with standard features such as V6 power, antilock brakes, 4-wheel independent suspension, dual front airbags, and full power accessories. GL trim included the addition of a 6-way power adjustable driver's seat, 6-speaker audio system, foglamps, and dual-zone automatic climate control. Top-line GLS added 6-way power front passenger seat, faux woodgrain interior trim, steering wheel audio controls, leather seating, full-function traction control, and a six-speaker Bose sound system.&lt;ref&gt;Oldsmobile Factory Sales Brochure "1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue"&lt;/ref&gt;

All Intrigues were built at the GM Fairfax plant in [[Kansas City, Kansas]], where the Grand Prix was also built (the Buick Century and Regal, and the Chevrolet Impala and Monte Carlo were all built in [[Oshawa, Ontario]], Canada). For the 1999 model year, a new  3.5&amp;nbsp;L DOHC engine was introduced. It was a six-cylinder design based on Cadillac's [[GM Premium V engine#Northstar|Northstar]] [[V8 engine|V8]], which was nicknamed the "[[GM Premium V engine#LX5|Shortstar]]". The 3.5&amp;nbsp;L engine became standard for 2000, giving the Intrigue the most powerful standard engine of any [[GM W platform|W-body car]].

Another exclusive was a standard 140&amp;nbsp;mph speedometer. With the Autobahn package the Intrigue came with larger 12-inch front brake rotors, being the first 2nd Gen W-body to incorporate bigger brakes. For 1998-99 models the Autobahn package consisted of a 3.29 differential ratio opposed to the standard 3.05, H-rated tires, 12-inch front brakes with ceramic pads, and a 128&amp;nbsp;mph [[speed limiter]]. For 2000 it was renamed Precision Sport Package which included everything from the Autobahn package except the larger 12-inch front brake rotors, and added the Precision Control System (also known as Vehicle Stability Control (VSC)).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} For 2002 the Intrigue Final 500 Collector’s Edition cars came in a unique Dark Cherry Metallic paint and featured Aurora-styled 17x7.5-inch chrome wheels.

On June 14, 2002, the final Intrigue rolled off the assembly line as part of the Final 500 Collectors Edition.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Year-to-year changes==
*'''1998''': The Oldsmobile Intrigue was introduced as an all new model. Available in GX base, GL, and GLS trim, all featured the 3.8 L V6 and 4-speed automatic transmission standard.
*'''1999''': For the beginning of this model year, the DOHC 3.5 L "Shortstar" engine was standard in the top-line GLS and optional on mid-level GL and base GX models. Early GLS models could be ordered with the 3.8L instead of the standard (for GLS) 3.5 L, but later on the 3.8 L was phased out and the 3.5 L became standard on all models. Decklids now wore a small Oldsmobile badge. In the previous model year, there was a complaint that some people couldn't tell that Intrigues were Oldsmobiles. If you look closely, you can read 'Oldsmobile' molded in the backup light lens in the taillight housing on all model years. All models now got a thicker, leather-wrapped steering wheel. An integrated rear radio antenna was standard this year and after.
*'''2000''': New wheels featured a fancier six-spoke design. New to the option list for 2000 was an antiskid system called the Precision Control System. Precision Control System was designed to help keep the car on its intended path by selective braking of one or more individual wheels. Though optional on all models, GX buyers had to order optional traction control to get the new antiskid system. Heated power front seats were now standard on GLS models. Standard leather door inserts trim not cloth, Retained accessory power was standard this year. "Oldsmobile" emblem on deck lid is larger than on 1999 models, although some early 2000 models carried the smaller version. A new gold-trim package was also available. New automatic headlights were now standard on all models.
*'''2001''': On GX models, traction control became standard instead of optional. Premium Leather and Precision Sport option packages were also available for this year. [[OnStar]] is now available as an optional feature.
*'''2002''': GLS models now featured a two-tone interior with sterling accents, as well as standard [[HomeLink]], sunroof, and driver lumbar. All models featured new family of radios with [[Radio Data System|RDS]] and standard CD player (borrowed from the newly redesigned Aurora). Tropic Teal and Indigo Blue were two new exterior colors. All models had new [[Isofix|LATCH]] (Lower Anchor and Top tether for Children) in three rear seat positions. Sun &amp; Sound package was available on GL models (includes [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] sound system and sunroof). New winchester headliner was inside. Production of the Intrigue ended in June 2002 as part of the phaseout of the Oldsmobile brand. The Final 500 Collectors Edition versions came in a unique Dark Cherry Metallic paint with special classic-style Oldsmobile emblems and featured Aurora-styled 17-inch chrome wheels. Owners also received a special commemorative packet.

Final 500 #499 was the last retail model and was special-ordered by a member of the Southern California Chapter of the Oldsmobile Club of America

[[File:XFilesExpo1998.jpg|150px|right]]
* The Oldsmobile Intrigue was featured in several scenes and promotions for the 1998 [[The X-Files|X-Files movie]], ''[[The X-Files (film)|The X-Files: Fight the Future]]''.  As the model's launch coincided with the release of the film, its producers and GM's executives at the time felt the car's name and appearance fit with the aesthetic of the X-Files franchise. Their creative teams launched a national campaign which included an expo tour around "'alternative' venues such as decomissioned [sic] military bases and airplane hangars [throughout the United States]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stanley |first=T.L. |date=January 12, 1998 |title=FOX, GM Generate Intrigue Around X-po |journal=Brandweek|publisher=Prometheus Global Media |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=November 17, 1998 |title=Co-Marketing the Truth in the 'X-Files' and the Oldsmobile Intrigue |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iabc-co-marketing-the-truth-in-the-x-files-and-the-oldsmobile-intrigue-77410557.html |newspaper=International Association of Business Communicators |location=Detroit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oldsmobile  4-4-2''' (also known as the 442) is a [[muscle car]] produced by [[Oldsmobile]] between the 1964 and 1987 [[model year]]s.  Introduced as an option package for US-sold [[Oldsmobile Cutlass|F-85 and Cutlass]] models, it became a model in its own right from 1968 to 1971, spawned the [[Oldsmobile Hurst/Olds|Hurst/Olds]] in 1968, then reverted to an option through the mid-1970s. The name was revived in the 1980s on the [[rear-wheel drive]] [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme|Cutlass Supreme]] and early 1990s as an option package for the new [[front-wheel drive]] [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais|Cutlass Calais]].

The "4-4-2" name (pronounced "Four-four-two") derives from the original car's four-barrel [[carburetor]], four-speed [[manual transmission]], and dual exhausts &lt;ref name="65_brochure"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1965%20Oldsmobile/album/1965%20Oldsmobile-14.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1965 Oldsmobile/album |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muscle Oldsmobiles!, Thomas Bonsall, Bookman Publishing, 1985, pg 4&lt;/ref&gt; (Some maintain that the '2' indicated positive traction rear differential). It was originally written "4-4-2" (with badging showing hyphens between the numerals),&lt;ref name="65_brochure"&gt;http://oldcarbrochures.com/new/021110/1965%20Oldsmobile%204-4-2%20Folder/1965%20Oldsmobile%204-4-2%20Folder-03.html 1965 Oldsmobile 4-4-2 Brochure&lt;/ref&gt; and remained hyphenated throughout Oldsmobile's use of the designation.   Beginning in 1965, the 4-4-2s standard transmission was a 3 speed manual along with optional 2 speed automatic and 4 speed manual, but were still badged as "4-4-2"s. By 1968 badging was shortened to simply "442", but Oldsmobile brochures and internal documents continued to use the "4-4-2" model designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2014/11/17/driven-front-wheel-drive-1968-oldsmobile-a-body/|title=Driven: Front-wheel drive 1968 Oldsmobile A-body|work=Hemmings Motor News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964===
The 4-4-2 was born out of competition between [[Pontiac]] and Oldsmobile divisions of [[General Motors|GM]]. The high performance [[Pontiac GTO|GTO]] version of the [[Pontiac LeMans]] [[mid-size car|intermediate]] had proved an unexpected success midway through the 1964 model year. Oldsmobile's hasty response was to beef up their own popular [[Oldsmobile Cutlass|Cutlass]], a task given to a team led by performance enthusiast and Olds engineer [[John Beltz]] (later responsible for the distinctive and powerful [[Oldsmobile Toronado|Toronado]]), aided by Dale Smith and division Chief Engineer Bob Dorshimer.&lt;ref name="Car Craft, 1/91"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Car Craft |pages=52–55 |year=1991 |volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Introduced in September, 1963&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hotrod.com/articles/pontiac-gto-great-one-turns-50/&lt;/ref&gt; as an option package on the 1964 Tempest LeMans, the GTO package included a 389 cubic inch V-8, technically a violation of GM policy limiting intermediates to 330&amp;nbsp;CID, although the 1963 Pontiac Tempest/LeMans had already done this in 1963, and even though badged as a 326 the 63 Tempest V-8 was already at 336 CID, 1964 it became a true 326. – the Olds offering was a conservative package. Technically the "B09 Police Apprehender Pursuit"&lt;ref name="gunnell2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gunnel l|first=Joh n|title=Standard Catalog of American Muscle Cars 1960–1972 |year=2006 |publisher=Krause Publications |isbn=0-89689-433-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; option, it used the four-barrel [[carburetor|carbureted]] 330&amp;nbsp;CID (5.4&amp;nbsp;L) [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#Jetfire Rocket|V8]] with heavy-duty [[poppet valve|valve gear]], and a hotter [[camshaft]], raising rated (SAE gross) output to 310&amp;nbsp;hp (231.3&amp;nbsp;kW) at 5200&amp;nbsp;rpm. [[Torque]] remained {{convert|355|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}, although the torque peak rose from 2800&amp;nbsp;rpm to 3600&amp;nbsp;rpm. Also included was a stiffened frame, adjustable pinion angle by way of added holes in the frame mounts for the rear upper control arms, Muncie four-speed [[manual transmission]], a heavy duty drive shaft connected to a 3.36:1 rear end, oversized brakes (155.6 vs 118sq.in lining area) and the heavy-duty police-package [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], with heavy duty wheels, higher-rate [[coil spring]]s front and rear, heavy-duty [[shock absorber]]s, a larger front [[anti-roll bar]], an additional rear anti-roll bar bolted to a fully boxed lower control arm, and dual snorkel air cleaner. Two-speed windshield wipers, A/C ($430), an AM/FM radio, an electronic trunk opener, and a tilt steering wheel ($43) were optional.&lt;ref name="gunnell2006"/&gt;  Unlike the 1965 4-4-2 model built in Lansing, the 1964 4-4-2 does not have an option code on the data plate.  There is documentation available showing that the 1964 4-4-2 was built in both Lansing and Fremont.

The package was dubbed '''4-4-2''' based on its combination of four-barrel carburetor, four-speed [[manual transmission]], and dual exhausts.&lt;ref name="65_brochure"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1965%20Oldsmobile/album/1965%20Oldsmobile-14.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1965 Oldsmobile/album |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muscle Oldsmobiles!, Thomas Bonsall, Bookman Publishing, 1985, pg 4&lt;/ref&gt; Priced at $285.14, it was available on any [[Oldsmobile Cutlass|F-85 or Cutlass model]] except the [[station wagon]], although most were Cutlass [[hardtop]] [[coupé]]s (Oldsmobile archives indicate that approximately 10 four-door [[sedan (car)|sedans]] were built with the B09 option).

''[[Motor Trend]]'' tested an early 64 4-4-2 with a 3:55 rear axle (standard ratio was 3.36:1) and found that the 3,440-lb (1,560&amp;nbsp;kg) car would run 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph (0–96&amp;nbsp;km/h) in 7.5 seconds,&lt;ref name="gunnell2006"/&gt; the standing quarter mile in 15.5 seconds at {{convert|90|mi/h|km/h|-1|abbr=on}}, and reached a top speed of 116&amp;nbsp;mph (185.6&amp;nbsp;km/h). A total of 2,999 were sold.

===1965===
With the GTO receiving GM corporate sanction to receive their full-sized car's 389 V-8,&lt;ref&gt;One must understand that unlike the Gen2 Olds engines ALL Pontiac engines are medium blocks and are dimensionally the same from 287 to 455&lt;/ref&gt; Oldsmobile followed suit and replaced the 4-4-2's standard 330&amp;nbsp;CID with the new [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#400|400]]&amp;nbsp;CID (6.6&amp;nbsp;L). The definition of "4-4-2" was then restated as referring to 400 cubic inches, a 4 barrel carburetor (a 515 cfm [[Rochester Products Division|Rochester]] 4-Jet),&lt;ref name="Car Craft, 1/91"/&gt; 2 exhausts.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Output for the big engine rose to {{Convert|345|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|440|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. The standard transmission became a three-speed manual with column shifter, with a floor shifter four-speed and Oldsmobile's two-speed [[Super Turbine 300|Jetaway]] [[automatic transmission]] optional. A heavy duty three-speed with [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] floor shifter was introduced as a mid year option. 

Other touches added to the '65 were chrome body side scoops adorned with 4-4-2 badging, chambered dual exhaust pipes, chrome single snout air cleaner, and 4-4-2 badging on the dash.  Late in the year option N98 was added, which were chrome {{convert|14|x|6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheels. It also offered standard bucket seats when optioned on the Cutlass&lt;ref name="Car Craft, 1/91"/&gt; and a 6,000 rpm [[tachometer]], mounted in the optional console, more as decoration than for usefulness.&lt;ref name="Car Craft, 1/91"/&gt; Retractable front seat belts were optional.&lt;ref name="gunnell2006"/&gt; The turning diameter was 41feet.&lt;ref name="65_brochure"/&gt;

''[[Modern Rod]]'' tested a 1965 F85 4-4-2 with the four-speed manual, slicks, and headers and obtained a quarter mile acceleration of 13.78 seconds at {{convert|102.73|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}}; ''[[Car Life]]'''s automatic '65 ran the quarter mile in 15.5 seconds at {{convert|89|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, with a 0 to 60 time of 7.8 seconds. Car and Driver tested a 1965 4-4-2 and did 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph in 5.5 seconds.&lt;ref name="gunnell2006"/&gt;

Offered in four body styles, 4-4-2 sales rose to 25,003, including 3,468 convertibles,&lt;ref name="Car Craft, 1/91"/&gt; The cost of option W29, the Olds' first use of the W performance code, was $156.02 on the  Cutlass and $190.45 on the F-85 Club Coupe.

===1966===
The 1966 4-4-2 shared a modest facelift with other Cutlasses. It came with a 400 ci '''L78''' V8 rated at {{Convert|350|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}/440&amp;nbsp;lb•ft with a single four-barrel carburetor. Two new optional 400 ci engines offered even higher performance: the {{Convert|360|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} '''L69''', with three two-barrel [[Rochester Products Division|Rochester]] 2GC carburetors on a progressive linkage and {{convert|440|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque, which was priced at US$264.54,&lt;ref&gt;''Hot Rod'', 3/86, p.54.&lt;/ref&gt; and the rare '''W30'''. 

The W30 engine added an outside-air induction system (admitting cool air to the carburetors via tubing from the front grill) and a hotter cam, rated – or, more likely, underrated – the same as the L69. The battery was relocated to the trunk to make room for the air hoses, which prevented the package from being ordered on convertible models. Only 54 W30s were built by the factory, although an additional 97 were produced for dealer installation.

The standard transmission was a three-speed manual with column shift and the two-speed Jetaway automatic with switch-pitch torque converter was optional. Hurst shifters became standard equipment with floor-mounted manual transmissions including the optional heavy-duty three-speed, M-20 wide-ratio four-speed or M-21 close-ratio four-speed. The standard 350-horsepower 400 engine could be ordered with any of the four transmissions, while only manual transmissions could be ordered with the L69 three two-barrel option.

Inside, a revised instrument panel featured two round pods for the speedometer and other instruments, replacing the horizontal sweep speedometer of 1964–65 models, but the rest of the basic dashboard designed was unchanged. F-85 models had base interiors with bench seats and rubber floor mats while the more lavish Cutlass versions came with full carpeting and featured Strato bucket seats of a new design with higher and thinner seat backs, or a no-cost bench seat option. Head rests were a $52 option.&lt;ref name="gunnell2006"/&gt;

''Car Life'' tested an L69 4-4-2 with four-speed transmission and obtained a 0–60 time of 6.3 seconds and a quarter mile of 14.8 seconds at {{convert|97|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="gunnell2006"/&gt; ''Motor Trend'''s similar test car ran 0–60 in 7.2 seconds, with a quarter mile time of 15.2 seconds at {{Convert|96.6|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.

Production slumped to 21,997. The 4-4-2 still constituted only about 10 percent of Cutlass sales, whereas Pontiac's GTO represented nearly a third of all Tempests sold.

===1967===

For 1967 the 4-4-2's styling and base engine remained the same, save for: minor trim changes and a 1967 4-4-2 only distinctive louvered hood as well as an increase in intake valve size to 2.067 from 1.99. but the automatic three-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] with Switch Pitch became available, replacing the two-speed Switch Pitch Jetaway, as was the case with the mid-sized muscle cars from other GM divisions (Pontiac GTO, Chevrolet Chevelle SS396, and Buick GS400). The heavy-duty floor-mounted three-speed manual transmission was now standard with the Muncie M-20 and M-21 four-speeds optional, all with Hurst shifters. Front [[disc brake]]s were a new option this year.

A GM policy decision banning multiple carburetors for all vehicles except Ed Cole's beloved [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]] and the Corvair saw the demise of the L69 with its triple carburetors, a rare option for Olds and an icon for Pontiacs since 1957.   The W30 remained available, although the four-barrel Quadrajet carburetor replaced the tri carb setup. New red plastic inner fender liners became part of the W30 package. 502 factory W30 engines were built to meet [[NHRA]] [[homologation]] rules, along with an unknown number of dealer-installed packages. 

[[Cars (magazine)|''Cars'']] tested a W30 4-4-2 with close-ratio four-speed and 4.33 rear axle (a dealer-installed only option),&lt;ref name="Car Craft, 1/91"/&gt; obtaining a quarter mile of 14.1 seconds at {{convert|103|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}} in completely stock form. 0–60 times were between 6.5 and 6.7 seconds.

Unlike in previous years which the 4-4-2 option could be ordered on either baseline F-85 or upscale Cutlass models, the 1967 4-4-2 package was based on the top-line [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme|Cutlass Supreme]] series including the sport coupe (with center post), Holiday hardtop coupe and convertible. Standard equipment on all models included Strato bucket seats or no-cost notchback bench seat, full carpeting, expanded Morocceen vinyl upholstery, heavy-duty suspension with rear sway bar, and wide-oval tires. Power front disc brakes were $104, while power steering was $94.&lt;ref name="gunnell2006"/&gt;

Like all cars sold in the U.S. for 1967, the 4-4-2 came standard with a group of occupant protection and accident avoidance features as mandated by Federal law.  This safety package included an energy-absorbing steering column and safety steering wheel, padded dash, recessed controls, four-way hazard flashers and a dual-circuit brake hydraulic master cylinder.

Production rallied somewhat from the previous year, rising to 24,833.

The 4-4-2 became a separate model from 1968 through 1971.&lt;ref name="gunnell2006"/&gt; The wheelbase was {{Convert|112|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, and over 33,000 were sold for 1968. Despite the engine displacement staying at 400&amp;nbsp;CID, the engine was based on the new 455 cranktrain (4.25 stroke) and the bore decreased (to 3.87). Torque now came at 3000–3200&amp;nbsp;rpm as opposed to the early 400's 3600&amp;nbsp;rpm peak, mostly due to a milder base cam grind.  ''Car Life'' tested a 1968 4-4-2 with a 3.42:1 rear axle ratio and Hydramatic and attained 0–60 times of 7.0 seconds, and a quarter-mile time of 15.13 seconds at {{convert|92|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. Top speed was reported as {{convert|115|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. The base motor was still rated at {{Convert|350|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, but only with the standard three-speed and optional four-speed; automatics were rated at {{Convert|325|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. W-30s were rated again at {{Convert|360|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Car Life also tested a four-speed W-30 with 4.33 rearend gears and recorded a 13.3 at {{convert|103.30|mi/h|km/h|1|abbr=on}}, which shows the long stroke did ''not'' affect actual performance although long term durability at high (6000 plus) engine speeds might be affected.

All standard 1968 4-4-2 engines are painted a bronze–copper color, as with the 1967s, topped with a fire-red air cleaner. W-30 option cars were equipped with Ram Air intake hoses leading from a chrome-topped dual snorkel black air cleaner to special under-bumper air scoops and set off by bright red plastic fender wells. In addition, a Turnpike Cruiser option was made available with a two-barrel carburetor; this was previously available on the Cutlass Supreme for 1967. 1968 was the first year for side marker lights and front outboard shoulder belts, and the last year for vent windows on hardtops and convertibles. 4-4-2s for '68 had unique rear bumpers, with exhaust cutouts and special exhaust tips.

====Hurst/Olds====
{{main|Oldsmobile Hurst/Olds}}
In 1968 Oldsmobile partnered with [[Hurst Performance]] Research Corporation to create the [[Oldsmobile Hurst/Olds|Hurst/Olds]] rather than just adding Hurst shifters as with earlier models. The limited regular production run of 515 Hurst/Olds (459 Holiday Coupes/56 Sport Coupes) started out as regular 4-4-2s, but were treated to numerous distinct enhancements, both cosmetic and mechanical. All cars were painted Peruvian Silver (a Toronado color) with liberal black striping and white pinstripes, exterior and interior H/O badging (unique to '68), and a real walnut wood dash insert. Mechanically, the cars left the factory with two drive train combinations. Red 455&amp;nbsp;CID engines were backed by modified W-30 Turbo 400 automatic transmissions. A/C cars got a W-46 engine with a 3.08:1 rear while non-A/C cars got a W-45 engine with a 3.91:1 rear. While both engines were rated at {{Convert|390|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, the W-45 engine received the cylinder heads from the W-30 and the camshaft from the W-31, making it more suitable for higher rpms. All cars came with bucket seats and a Hurst Dual-Gate shifter in a mini-console. Also standard were numerous regular 4-4-2 options such as disc brakes, heavy duty cooling, and FE2 suspension. They shared the red fender wells and ram air setup with the W-30. Popular, but not standard, additional options included the tick-tock-tach and wood-grained steering wheel. Power front disc brakes were optional.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1968"/&gt;

Performance for the 1968 Hurst/Olds (390&amp;nbsp;hp): 0–60 in 5.4 sec, 1/4 mile in 13.9 sec at {{convert|103|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="musclecarclub.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musclecarclub.com/musclecars/oldsmobile-442/oldsmobile-442-history.shtml |title=Oldsmobile 442 – Musclecarclub.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421090558/http://www.musclecarclub.com/musclecars/oldsmobile-442/oldsmobile-442-history.shtml |archivedate=2009-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1969===
[[File:'69 Oldsmobile 442 Convertible (Cruisin' At The Boardwalk '10).jpg|thumb|left|1969 Oldsmobile 4-4-2 convertible]]
1969 4-4-2s were very similar to the 1968 except the division tooth between the grilles, the trunk lid inlets for the tail lights, wing windows deleted on Holiday Coupes and convertibles, steering lock ignition switch on the steering column, standard headrests were added to the front seats, and the paint scheme. Twin hood stripes were now available to highlight the new dual-bulged hood. The 4-4-2 numerals grew to nearly double their previous size.  Optional disc brakes now had updated single-piston calipers. The exhaust manifolds featured a new center divider for better performance. Other changes to the engine were minimal, but the Turnpike Cruiser option was deleted. However, another high-performance engine was offered. Called the W-32, it came with the Forced Air Induction plumbing found on the W-30s, but it had a milder cam like the base engine. It was only available with an automatic, and 297 were built, including 25 sport coupes and convertibles each.

The Hurst/Olds returned, with a Cameo White and Fire Frost Gold striped paint scheme, outrageous functional ram air mailbox hood scoops, rear pedestal spoiler, 15" SSII chrome plated rims, European racing mirrors, and a 380-horsepower 455 cid V8 that was detuned slightly from 1968. 906 production Hurst/Olds Holiday Coupes were built, plus 6 prototypes and 2 convertibles for a total of 914 cars. Performance for the 1969 Hurst/Olds(380&amp;nbsp;hp): 0–60 in 5.9 sec, 1/4 mile in 14.03 sec at {{convert|101|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="musclecarclub.com"/&gt;

===1970===
[[File:1970 Oldsmobile 442 (29304725930).jpg|thumb|left|1970 Oldsmobile 4-4-2]]
1970 was the pinnacle of performance from Oldsmobile.&lt;ref&gt;Oldsmobile 4-4-2 &amp; W-Machines Restoration Guide, Sullivan, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;4-4-2 A Source Book, Casteele, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to keep up in the horsepower arms-race, General Motors dropped the cap on engine size in 1970, and Oldsmobile responded by making the [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#455|Olds 455 V8]] the standard 4-4-2 engine. Output was {{Convert|365|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|500|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}}, with a {{Convert|370|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} variant available with the ''W30'' option.

The revised body style and increased performance resulted in the 4-4-2 being awarded pace car duties at the [[Indianapolis 500]] race in 1970. Those seeking to experience the ultimate in performance from Lansing could order a "W-Machine" version of the 4-4-2, dubbed the W-30 package. The 4-4-2 W-30 added a fiberglass hood (option W25) with functional air scoops and low-restriction air cleaner, aluminum intake manifold, special camshaft, cylinder heads, distributor, and carburetor. Two W-30 equipped 4-4-2 Vista Cruisers were produced by special order. Rear shoulder seat belts were optional at $23.&lt;ref name="gunnell2006"/&gt;

Motor Trend tested a 4-4-2 W-30 with a 4-speed manual transmission and 3.91:1 rear gears, clocking a quarter mile time of 14.2 seconds @ {{convert|102|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. However, Motor Trend noted that Oldsmobile engineers had earlier posted a best of 13.7 seconds on the same test car with a fresh tune.

New options for the 1970 4-4-2 included GM's variable-ratio power steering (option N47), a console-mounted Hurst Dual/Gate shifter for use with the Turbo Hydra-matic transmission, and aluminum differential housing and cover (option W27). All Oldsmobile V8s received new Positive Valve Rotators for the 1970s to increase engine valve life.

1970 model year spotting tips:  vertical bars in silver grille, rectangular parking lights in front bumper, vertical tail lights.

A 1970 Oldsmobile 4-4-2 was featured in the chase scene of the movie ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'' starring [[Sylvester Stallone]].

===1971===
[[File:'71 Oldsmobile 442 Convertible (Auto classique Salaberry-De-Valleyfield '11).JPG|thumb|left|1971 Oldsmobile 4-4-2 convertible]]
Despite storm clouds on the muscle car horizon, the 4-4-2 returned in 1971 with only minor modifications from the previous year.  Engine output was down for 1971 due to a lower compression ratio (8.5:1), which affected all of [[General Motors|GM's]] engines as the result of a corporate policy requiring engines to run on lower-octane regular leaded, low lead, or unleaded gasoline, in preparation for the introduction of the catalytic converter on 1975-model cars. The base 455 was rated at {{Convert|340|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, with the W-30 achieving a rating of {{Convert|350|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The W-27 option was downgraded to an aluminum cover for the cast iron differential housing.

The 1971 4-4-2 was available in a hardtop coupe and convertible body type. The sport coupe disappeared for the first time since 1964, only to return in 1972. 1971 Model Year Spotting Tips:  Black grille with silver surround, silver headlight bezels, round parking lights in front bumper, horizontal tail lights.

Quarter mile performance as reported by Road Test magazine was 15.2 seconds at {{convert|99|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, and 0–60 in 8.9 seconds, using the TH400 [[automatic transmission]].

===1972===
[[File:72 Oldsmobile 442 (14531042475).jpg|thumb|1972 Oldsmobile 442 Convertible]]
By 1972, the muscle car era was unmistakably in decline due to the twin blows of rising insurance rates and soaring gas prices.  The 4-4-2 name reverted to an appearance and handling option package (option code W-29) in 1972 on the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass|Cutlass Holiday coupe, Cutlass ''S'' sport coupe and Holiday coupe]], and Cutlass Supreme convertible. The W-29 option was not available on Cutlass Supreme notchback hardtops. The 4-4-2 option package, which carried a modest sticker price of $29, consisted of the "FE2" suspension upgrades (heavy duty springs &amp; shocks, front and rear sway bars, boxed lower rear control arms, and 14- by 7-in [356- by 178-mm] wheels), side striping, fender and decklid badging, faux hood louvers, and a unique grille. The rear bumper sported cutouts for exhaust tips, but only when paired with the optional ''L75'' [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#455|455&amp;nbsp;CID V8]] in place of the standard [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#350|Oldsmobile 350 V8]].

Interior trims differed on each bodystyle for which the 4-4-2 option was offered, much like the early 1964–66 models. For the base Cutlass hardtop coupe, a baseline two-spoke steering wheel, and vinyl or cloth/vinyl bench seat was standard along with rubber floor mats (carpeting was optional); Cutlass S sport coupe and Holiday hardtop coupe featured full carpeting, deluxe steering wheel, courtesy lighting, and bench seats with cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl upholstery or optional Strato bucket seats; and the Cutlass Supreme convertible came with more woodgrain interior accents than the "S" along with an all-vinyl notchback bench seat with armrest or no-cost Strato bucket seats, between which a center console was an extra-cost option. An AM/FM stereo radio with a tape player was $363.&lt;ref name="gunnell2006"/&gt;

4-4-2's could still be ordered with the additional '''W30''' option, which included the still-potent L77 455 engine, which produced {{Convert|300|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|410|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}s of torque and incorporated low-restriction dual exhausts. Other notable components of the W30 package included a lightweight aluminum intake manifold, the W25 fiberglass ram-air hood, anti-spin differential with 3.42:1 gears (3.73:1 available), and heavy duty cooling. Due to the low-vacuum at idle, air conditioning was not available, and power brakes were only available with an automatic transmission. Only 113 W30 convertibles and 659 W30 coupes were made in 1972, making this a very rare option.

A special edition [[Oldsmobile Hurst/Olds|Hurst/Olds]] paced the [[Indianapolis 500|Indy]] in 1972. The H/O coupe was based on the notchback Cutlass Supreme Holiday coupe (not offered with the 4-4-2 option) and the Cutlass Supreme convertible, both of which came standard with a 270-net horsepower 455 Rocket four-barrel V8 or optional 300-net horsepower W-30 option 455. Both H/O engines were mated to Turbo 400 transmissions with console-mounted Hurst Dual Gate shifters. A H/O Vista Cruiser was provided for the Medical Director.

1972 Model Year Spotting Tips: Silver grille with black surround, black headlight bezels, round parking lights in front bumper, 3-section horizontal tail lights.

Originally expected to debut for the 1972 model year, the introduction of the new "Colonnade" body style was delayed until 1973 due to an auto workers strike in 1972.  The body was redesigned to feature massive {{convert|5|ft|m|1|sing=on}} long doors and energy absorbing bumpers. The rear windows were fixed and the roof was reinforced in anticipation of roll-over standards being imposed by the government. These cars were a few hundred pounds heavier and slightly larger than the 1972's.

Consistent with 1972, the 4-4-2 option remained a handling and appearance package, code W-29, and was available on the Cutlass and Cutlass "S". It consisted of a faux louvered hood, FE2 suspension, specific grilles, emblems and stripes. Items such as dual exhaust and super stock wheels had to be ordered ''à la-carte''. This was all part of the industry-wide weaning of U.S. consumers from large, powerful cars.

The W-30 (that had {{Convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in 1972) had become a trim package. The L77 "V" code 455 was there, but only with the 4-speed wide-ratio M-20 transmission. 1973 was also the last year of the 4-speed manual transmission in the Olds "A" body. The L77 "V" code produced 270 net HP, the L75 "U" code 455 AT produced {{Convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while the "K" code 350 single exhaust produced {{Convert|180|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and the "M" code 350 with duals produced {{Convert|200|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}}. Positraction rear ends, axle ratios, gauges, Super Stock wheels, HD cooling and many sport type options were available, but had to be ordered. The L77 "V" code engine was also available in the Hurst/Olds without A/C, code W-46, the W-45 L75 "U" code was standard with A/C. Both 455s used the Turbo Hydra-matic 400 transmission, while the 350 was mated to the Turbo 350.

Interior trims for the '73 4-4-2 included a cloth/vinyl or all-vinyl bench seat and rubber floor covering (carpeting optional) on base Cutlass coupe, while Cutlass S included full carpeting on floor and lower door panels, woodgrain trim, deluxe steering wheel and more luxurious cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl bench seat, or optional swiveling Strato bucket seats with vinyl trim that could be rotated 90 degrees for easy exit/entry. Center console with floor shifter was optional with either the 4-speed manual or Turbo Hydra-matic transmissions.

===1974===
[[File:Oldsmobile442.jpg|thumb|left|Oldsmobile 4-4-2]]
The 1974 4-4-2 received the same facelift as other Cutlasses that year including a revised grille and new flush taillights over a newly mandated {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} rear bumper to match the similarly mandated front bumper introduced in '73. It remained a handling and appearance package available on both base Cutlass and Cutlass S Colonnade coupes. Engine offerings included the standard {{convert|180|hp}} Rocket 350 four-barrel V8 or optional {{convert|230|hp}} Rocket 455, which reintroduced the W-30 code that signified the top 4-4-2 engine option package from 1966 to 1972. Power steering and Turbo Hydra-matic transmission became standard equipment on 4-4-2 and all other Cutlass models. The four-speed manual transmission with Hurst shifter was dropped from the option list.
New option for 1974 were GM-specification radial tires.
Interiors were similar to 1973 with cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl bench seats standard, or optional swiveling Strato bucket seats with Moroceen vinyl upholstery. Center console with floor shifter optional with bucket seats.

===1975===
The 1975 4-4-2 received revised vertical-bar grilles and continued with vertically stacked taillight lenses. It was once again a handling/appearance package on base Cutlass and Cutlass S coupes with content similar to previous years. Radial tires were now standard equipment, along with a GM High Energy electronic ignition.
All engines were mated to catalytic converters, which required use of unleaded gasoline and spelled the end of true dual exhausts. With economy now a selling point following the [[1973 oil crisis|1973–74 energy crisis]] resulting from the Arab Oil Embargo, the '75 4-4-2 and most other Cutlass models no longer included a V8 engine as standard equipment. For the first time since its 1964 introduction, the 4-4-2 came standard with a six-cylinder engine, Chevrolet's 250 cubic-inch inline unit which had previously been offered on some Olds intermediates from 1966 to 1971 and the compact Olds Omega since its 1973 introduction. Also new this year was a small Olds-built 260 cubic-inch Rocket V8 specifically designed for fuel economy. The 170-horsepower 350 Rocket V8 was now an extra-cost option along with the 190-horsepower 455 V8. A three-speed manual transmission was reinstated as standard equipment with the six-cylinder engine with the Turbo Hydra-matic transmission optional with that engine and the only transmission offered with the V8 engines. Interiors again consisted of bench seats with cloth-and-Moroceen vinyl or all-Moroceen trim, or optional swiveling Strato buckets upholstered in Moroceen vinyl. Revised door panels featured pull straps. Console optional with bucket seats.

Due to SAE Net horsepower ratings, it appeared that there was a power drop from earlier engines but this is not the case. The Oldsmobile 455 also had significant torque at low RPM. For 1975 the 4-4-2 equipped with a 455 was rated by Oldsmobile at 190&amp;nbsp;hp @ 3400 rpm and 350&amp;nbsp;lb-ft @ 2000 rpm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powerful-cars.com/php/oldsmobile/1976-cutlass-442.php?p=imperial|title=oldsmobile 1976 cutlass 442 - the history of cars - exotic cars - customs - hot rods - classic cars - vintage cars -|author=Kai Stephan Gruszczynski|work=powerful-cars.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1976===
The 1976 4-4-2 shared a new aerodynamic sloped nose designed for NASCAR with split grilles and new quad rectangular headlights with Cutlass S models, along with revised lower sheetmetal with fewer creases than the 1973–75 models. The 4-4-2 option was offered on Cutlass S coupes and was once again an appearance/handling package. Engine/transmission offerings were unchanged from 1975 except that the 260 V8 could be ordered with a five-speed manual transmission. This was also the final year for the 455 Rocket V8.
Interiors again consisted of bench seats with cloth-and-Moroceen vinyl or all-Moroceen trim, or optional swiveling Strato buckets upholstered in Moroceen vinyl. Console optional with bucket seats.

===1977===
Final year for the 1973-vintage Colonnade body. The 4-4-2 was the only Olds intermediate to feature the NASCAR sloped nose from the '76 model as this year's Cutlass S switched to an upright nose similar to Cutlass Supreme models. Engine offerings were revised with Buick's 231 cubic-inch V6 replacing the Chevy 250 [[Straight-six engine|inline-six]] as base power, with optional powerplants again including the Oldsmobile built 260 and 350 cubic-inch Rocket V8s. Replacing the 455 as the top engine this year was a new Olds 403 cubic-inch Rocket V8 rated at {{convert|180|hp}}. Transmission offerings included a three-speed manual or Turbo Hydra-matic with the [[V6]], five-speed manual or Turbo Hydra-matic for the 260 V8 and Turbo Hydra-matic was the sole offering for the 350 and 403 V8s. Interiors included a standard bench seat with cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl bench seat, or optional Strato bucket seats with all-vinyl upholstery and without the swiveling feature of previous years. Console again optional with bucket seats.

Another limited-edition 4-4-2 model was offered from 1978 through 1980 on the downsized A-body Cutlass introduced for the 1978 model year. Engines varied from a base 3.8L V6 to a 305 4bbl. There was no 350 available to any 4-4-2 offered in 1978 or 1979.  A special-edition [[Oldsmobile Hurst/Olds#1979|Hurst/Olds]] was also offered in 1979.

The 1978–9 version of the 4-4-2 was an option package on the semi-fastback "Aeroback" Oldsmobile Cutlass Salon, which was the lower-trim version of the best-selling Cutlass model range. It was offered with all powertrains available, including the 231 c.i.d., 2V V6, the 260 c.i.d. 2V V8, and 305 c.i.d. 2V (1978) or 4V (1979) V8s. Transmissions offered were 3-spd automatic with all engines, 5 spd manual with the 260 V8 and a 4 spd Saginaw manual with the 305 V8.

Distinctive trim elements included contrasting striping along the rocker panels and lower doors, over both wheel wells, badging on the rear trunk, and interior emblems. All other options offered on the Cutlass Salon were available with the 4-4-2 option package.

===1979===
The 1979 4-4-2 is based on the Cutlass Salon body style. The Hurst Olds H/O was offered again and was the only GM intermediate to have a 350ci. engine. [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#350|Oldsmobile 350&amp;nbsp;CID]] [[V8 engine|V8]].

===1980===
The 4-4-2 model moved to the notchback [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]] Calais to return to its roots as a performance car as it had a larger 350 V8 engine not available on other Cutlass models. It included W-30 badging on the front fenders above the side marker lights, with less dramatic graphics. Otherwise, the cars shared identical powertrain,(minus the Hurst Shifter), with the '79 H/O. Also available only in gold over white or gold over black paint, a total of 886 were built, 540 in Black, and 346 in White.
The [[MSRP]] of a Cutlass Calais in 1980 was $6,919.57. Option W-30 4-4-2 Appearance and Handling Package cost $1,255.12. This package consisted of: Gold Accent Paint Scheme (Y71), Painted Grille Face, Applique Pillar Molding, Aluminum Sport Wheels, "W-30" Decals on Front Fender, Tail Lamp Bezel and Rear Window Molding to Match Body Color, "442" Emblem on Sail Panel and Deck Lid, Engine 5.7 Liter (350 CID) V8, 4-bbl (L34), Sport Console (D55), Rallye Suspension Package (FE2), Tires P205/70R14 Steel Belted Radial Ply Blackwall with Raised White Letters (QFV) and Digital Clock (UE8). The W-30 4-4-2 option was not available in California.

A sample of included options: Interior color: Camel Tan with both fabric and/or vinyl, as well as White Vinyl,(Black could be ordered for Black/Gold cars), Custom Steering Wheel (NK3), Tilt Column (N33), Gauge cluster, AM/FM 8-Track Radio (UM2), Cruise Control (K30), Delay Winshield Wipers (CD4), Tempmatic Air Conditioning (C65), Dual Remote Mirrors, 442 Door Panel Emblems, Rear Window Defogger, 6-Way Power Left Bucket Seat (AC3). The 350,(Vin "R", engine code tag "AR"), 3A heads, 4-bbl M4MC Rochester Carb, 8.5:1 compression, 170&amp;nbsp;hp@3800 and 275 torque@2000. Turbo-Hydromatic 350 Transmission (Code "LJ", special W-30 application). Code "AB" non-locking 2.73 rear axle. A cross-flow muffler gives a "factory" dual exhaust appearance.

The 4-4-2 option was not available 1981–1984, but the Hurst/Olds returned for 1983 and 1984.

==Fifth generation (1985-1987)==

===1985–1987===
{{main|Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme}}
[[File:1986 Olds 442.JPG|thumb|right|1986 Oldsmobile 4-4-2]]
The 4-4-2 name was revived in 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1985%20Oldsmobile/1985%20Oldsmobile%20Cutlass%20Brochure%20-%20Album_2/1985%20Oldsmobile%20Cutlass-22.html|title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1985 Oldsmobile/1985 Oldsmobile Cutlass Brochure - Album_2|work=oldcarbrochures.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[rear-wheel drive]] [[GM G platform (RWD)|G-body]] [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]] due to the demise of Oldsmobile and Hurst's official collaboration on the Hurst/Olds but Oldsmobile wanted to continue to offer a performance-oriented Cutlass model to the public. The name was now defined as referring to the car's '''4'''-speed 200r4 [[automatic transmission]], '''4'''-barrel [[carburetor]], and '''2''' exhausts. This ''W42'' model replaced the 1983 and 1984 '''[[Oldsmobile Hurst/Olds|Hurst/Olds]]''' model and used the same 5.0&amp;nbsp;L [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#LG8|LG8 V8]]. The shifter was mounted on the floor in a console between the front seats, and the upgraded ''F41'' suspension package was included. 3,000 were produced in the first year, and all were sold quickly. 4,273 were produced for 1986, and 4,208 were made in 1987.

All 1985 and 1986 4-4-2s used the already-sporty Cutlass Salon model as their base platform. Due to cost concerns, for 1987 it was decided they would use the less-expensive Cutlass Supreme model to base the 4-4-2 on. The package included a beefier drive train, 15 X 7 fully chromed styled-steel wheels with gold trim, manually inflated air shocks in the rear, special paint scheme (always silver at the bottom) and gold body stripe decal package, dual-snorkel air cleaner with chrome lid, mandatory A/C and door panel 4-4-2 emblems. With few exceptions (vinyl tops, painted pinstripes, chrome outside mirrors and wire wheel covers, for example), 4-4-2s could be ordered with much of the optional equipment found on other Cutlass models.

The 1984 Hurst/Olds and 1985–87 4-4-2 were equipped with an 8.5" GM corporate differential and all were equipped with 3.73:1 ring and pinion final drive gears. Rather than using the weaker 7.5" rear differential found in the Monte Carlo SS, these models used the same stout unit found in the Buick Grand National. Many 4-4-2s (and G-body Hurst/Olds) did not come with RPO G80 (limited-slip). This was, in large part, due to dealer ordering "packages" that grouped popular options together for ease of ordering. Problem was, G80 was not part of a single one of those popular option packages, but could be added "a la carte." For the most part, performance-savvy dealers and customers were the only ones opting for the limited-slip.

The 1983–84 Hurst/Olds and 1985–87 4-4-2s are distinguishable by there being a "9" as the engine code found in the 8th character of their VINs.  These were the only models to get the hotter VIN 9 307 cubic inch engine, and it was the only engine available.  From 1983–1985, this engine was flat-tappet valve train, and rated at 180&amp;nbsp;hp/240&amp;nbsp;lb•ft torque. In 1986, the 307 engine received a roller-camshaft valve train and new swirl-port heads to improve economy and low-end torque.  HP dropped to 170, with torque climbing to 255LBS FT. The 1985 4-4-2 used an OZ code THM 200-4R transmission (as did the 1983–84 Hurst/Olds). Both 1986 and 1987 4-4-2 used the KZF code THM 200-4R. The KZF removed much of the shift harshness of the original OZ coded transmissions, but were still firmer than the run-of-the-mill overdrive transmissions used in the rest of Oldsmobile's lineup.

==Sixth generation (1990-1991)==

===1990–1991===
{{main|Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais}}
The 4-4-2 option was revived on the '''Quad 4-4-2''' [[front-wheel drive]] 1990–1991 [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais|Cutlass Calais]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Rs2c66sZGgC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=1990+%22cutlass+calais%22+%224-4-2%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Cw3WeZAbBt&amp;sig=bVPrJxiEFvYaTty_zacdhIU25S4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xM6yVMCkGufHsQTr0oGwDA&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=1990%20%22cutlass%20calais%22%20%224-4-2%22&amp;f=false|title=Steve Magnante's 1001 Muscle Car Facts|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model used a 2.3&amp;nbsp;L [[GM Quad-4 engine#LG0|''LG0'' Quad-4]] [[Inline-four engine|'''4'''-cylinder]] engine with '''4''' valves per cylinder and '''2''' camshafts.  The engine was tuned with higher output camshafts which produced more top end power at the expense of idle quality. It used a single exhaust with a dual tipped muffler and produced {{Convert|180|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with a 5-speed [[manual transmission]]. This engine was a technological stretch and proved unreliable.

This version of the 4-4-2 also played upon the "W-30" option code used in past versions of the 4-4-2, the exception being that this model used the option code "W-40".  A low production, late 1991 model year version used the option code "W-41"; the key differences of "W-41" package was a {{Convert|190|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine with a different geared 5 speed transmission.

This 4-4-2 model lasted just two years. It was a stretch to group this model with the prior, venerable 4-4-2's and in essence was merely a marketing ploy by Oldsmobile.

Production totals:

1990 "W-40" = 2629

1991 "W-40" = 1160

1991 "W-41" = 204

GM literature referred to the 1992 &amp; 1993 Oldsmobile Achieva SCX as a 4--42, the last time the designation was used. The Achieva SCX used the same 'W41' drive train as the very limited production 1991 4-4-2-W41.

      <text bytes="3050" xml:space="preserve">'''Hurst Hairy Olds''' is the name given to a pair of exhibition [[funny car]]s campaigned by [[Hurst Performance]] in 1966 and 1967.  

Developed with help from [[General Motors]] engineer [[John Beltz]], the Hurst Hairy Olds was built to be a showcase for the then-new chain-driven automatic transaxle of the 1966 [[Oldsmobile Toronado]] as well as a rival to the [[Hurst Hemi Under Glass]].  There were doubts in the automotive press as to the strength of such a system; the Hairy Olds was designed to dispel these doubts.

The car debuted at a meet in [[Bakersfield, California]] on March 4, 1966.  Driven by [[Joe Schubeck]], the Hurst Hairy Olds began as a fully trimmed and later upholstered [[Oldsmobile 442]] in [[body in white|body in white (BIW)]] form.  Hurst installed not one but two 425 in³ (7 L) Oldsmobile engines and Toronado transaxles both front and rear; a pair of drag parachutes were mounted in the stock taillight positions and four-wheel disc brakes were fitted as well.  Two engines meant two of virtually everything in the cockpit related to the operation of the car, including two cable-operated shifters, two tachometers, two sets of oil pressure and temperature gauges and even two accelerator pedals.  Additional power was provided via a [[Global Entertainment Corporation|Cragar Equipment]]-modified 6-71 [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] supercharger atop each engine, each burning a blend of [[nitromethane]] and [[alcohol fuel|alcohol]].  Weight was reduced through the use of aluminum body components and [[Plexiglas]] windows.  The result was a 2400-horsepower, four-wheel-drive exhibition drag racer which smoked its front and rear tires down the length of the race track with times in the eleven-second range.   

Although the drive chains held up admirably, the car was not without its problems.  The tremendous amount of power at the front wheels caused massive [[torque steer]], resulting in difficulty in keeping the car in a straight line.  The rear engine contributed to unloading of the front wheels, which in turn caused the front engine to overspeed.  Visibility was poor as well due to tire smoke from both ends of the car.  This coupled with engine oil spray out of the valve cover breathers because of the pressure of the superchargers.

A second Hurst Hairy Olds was built in 1967, but was wrecked during an exhibition race in [[Niagara, New York]].

      <text bytes="1258" xml:space="preserve">The Model 20 was a compact car produced by Oldsmobile in 1909. Since Oldsmobile was a brand belonging to [[General Motors]], the Model 20 was derived from the previously established Buick brand from the [[Buick Model B]].

==History==
The Model 20 was equipped with a side-valve, in-line 2,704cc [[Multi-cylinder engine|four-cylinder engine]] developing 22 bhp. The engine was installed in the front, driving the rear wheels through a transmission shaft. The [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]] had three forward gears, with the gearshift lever positioned to the right of the driver.

The brake pedal came into contact with the engine's [[crankshaft]], while the parking brake came into contact with a [[Drum brake|brake drum]] on the rear wheels. The Model 20 was available with only four doors. The headlights used [[acetylene]].

A total of 6,575 Oldsmobile vehicles were manufactured in 1909, with 5,325 of those being the Model 20.

The '''''Panthermobile''''' is a [[show car]] built for the cartoon TV series ''[[The Pink Panther Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/motoring/the-pink-panthermobile-has-been-restored-to-its-former-glory-after-years-off-the-road/news-story/860cc2a1f5a6d211262108c17f745cf5 News.com.au] (retrieved 15 January 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Called “the world’s most flamboyant vehicle”, the bright pink [[custom car]] was built in 1969 at Bob Reisner California Show Cars by [[Ed Newton|Ed "Newt" Newton]], TV personality Dan Woods, and customizers [[Joe Bailon]], [[Bill Hines (customizer)|Bill "The Leadslinger" Hines]], and Bill Honda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carbodydesign.com/2011/09/panthermobile-goes-to-auction/ Carbodydesign] (retrieved 15 January  2017); [http://jalopnik.com/the-return-of-the-pink-panthermobile-1787019000 Jalopnik] (retrieved 15 January 2017);  [http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/motoring/the-pink-panthermobile-has-been-restored-to-its-former-glory-after-years-off-the-road/news-story/860cc2a1f5a6d211262108c17f745cf5 News.com.au] (retrieved 15 January 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;  It was used in the title and credit sequences of the original cartoon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/motoring/the-pink-panthermobile-has-been-restored-to-its-former-glory-after-years-off-the-road/news-story/860cc2a1f5a6d211262108c17f745cf5 News.com.au] (retrieved 15 January 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

It was one of several famous television show cars of the era in the US, including the original [[Batmobile#Batman (1960s film/television series)|''Batmobile'']], the ''[[Monkeemobile]]'', and the ''[[Munster Koach]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://jalopnik.com/the-return-of-the-pink-panthermobile-1787019000 Jalopnik] (retrieved 15 January 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; and one of many radical contemporary custom cars, such as [[Red Baron (custom car)|''Red Baron'']].

The ''Panthermobile'' cost $100,000 to build in 1976, which equates to around $450,000 in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carbodydesign.com/2011/09/panthermobile-goes-to-auction/ Carbodydesign] (retrieved 15 January  2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifications==
Built on an [[Oldsmobile Toronado]] [[chassis]],
&lt;ref&gt;[http://jalopnik.com/the-return-of-the-pink-panthermobile-1787019000 Jalopnik] (retrieved 15 January 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; it measured {{convert|23|ft|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|6|ft|cm|abbr=on}} wide, with an exposed driving compartment requiring the driver to wear a helmet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/motoring/the-pink-panthermobile-has-been-restored-to-its-former-glory-after-years-off-the-road/news-story/860cc2a1f5a6d211262108c17f745cf5 News.com.au] (retrieved 15 January 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; In the cartoon's title sequence, the driver was a boy. Instead of rearview mirrors, the driver had a camera and black-and-white television monitor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/motoring/the-pink-panthermobile-has-been-restored-to-its-former-glory-after-years-off-the-road/news-story/860cc2a1f5a6d211262108c17f745cf5 News.com.au] (retrieved 15 January 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;  The body is sheet metal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jalopnik.com/the-return-of-the-pink-panthermobile-1787019000 Jalopnik] (retrieved 15 January 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind the open cockpit was a compartment, accessed by a large [[clamshell door]] opening to the curb side, which contained pink [[shag (fabric)|shag]]-covered reclining seats, square-tufted upholstery, half a dozen ''faux''-fur pillows, a [[mobile phone]], and a bar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/motoring/the-pink-panthermobile-has-been-restored-to-its-former-glory-after-years-off-the-road/news-story/860cc2a1f5a6d211262108c17f745cf5 News.com.au] (retrieved 15 January 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; The upholstery was done by Joe Perez.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/motoring/the-pink-panthermobile-has-been-restored-to-its-former-glory-after-years-off-the-road/news-story/860cc2a1f5a6d211262108c17f745cf5 News.com.au] (retrieved 15 January 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven liter Oldsmobile V8 engine,  longitudinally-mounted right behind the driver’s head,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jalopnik.com/the-return-of-the-pink-panthermobile-1787019000 Jalopnik] (retrieved 15 January 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; drove the front wheels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/motoring/the-pink-panthermobile-has-been-restored-to-its-former-glory-after-years-off-the-road/news-story/860cc2a1f5a6d211262108c17f745cf5 News.com.au] (retrieved 15 January 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

The car was a challenge to drive due to the long snout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/motoring/the-pink-panthermobile-has-been-restored-to-its-former-glory-after-years-off-the-road/news-story/860cc2a1f5a6d211262108c17f745cf5 News.com.au] (retrieved 15 January 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
The ''Panthermobile'' was purchased at auction in 2011 and restored by Galpin Auto Sports  in [[Los Angeles, California]], under the supervision of Dave Shuten.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/motoring/the-pink-panthermobile-has-been-restored-to-its-former-glory-after-years-off-the-road/news-story/860cc2a1f5a6d211262108c17f745cf5 News.com.au] (retrieved 15 January 2017); [http://jalopnik.com/the-return-of-the-pink-panthermobile-1787019000 Jalopnik] (retrieved 15 January 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;  A complete restoration of the car's drivetrain, suspension, interior, and paint was required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jalopnik.com/the-return-of-the-pink-panthermobile-1787019000 Jalopnik] (retrieved 15 January 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="5835" xml:space="preserve">'''''Polynesian''''' is a [[Custom car|custom]]ized 1950 [[Oldsmobile]] [[Oldsmobile 88#First generation (1949–1953)|Holiday 88]] built by [[Neil Emory]] and [[Clayton Jensen]] at [[Valley Custom Shop]]. It was built at the request of original owner Jack Stewart in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.customrodder.com/features/0609cr_1950_oldsmobile_polynesian/index.html%7C_new ''Custom Rodder'' online] (retrieved 28 July 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
Unlike most owners at the time, Stewart wanted the car built all at once.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.customrodder.com/features/0609cr_1950_oldsmobile_polynesian/index.html%7C_new ''Custom Rodder'' online] (retrieved 28 July 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

The car was inspired by Ron Dunn's [[Custom car#Language|sectioned]] '50 Ford, also built by Valley Custom, essentially to Stewart's original design;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.customrodder.com/features/0609cr_1950_oldsmobile_polynesian/index.html%7C_new ''Custom Rodder'' online] (retrieved 28 July 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; only his desire to have the top chop was changed, under persuasion from Emory.&lt;ref&gt;''Hot Rod'', September 1953.{{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The car was built over a period of nine months. It was sectioned {{convert|4|in|cm|abbr=on}}, wheelwells re-radiused, and the rear fenders bulges fitted with brake vents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rikhovingkustoms.com/RHK1/JackStewart50Olds.html] (retrieved 28 July 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; It was nosed and decked, and the doors converted to electrically-operated solenoids.&lt;ref&gt;''Hot Rod'', September 1953.{{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1947 Studebaker taillights were [[Custom car#Language|tunnelled]] into the rear fenders.&lt;ref&gt;''Hot Rod'', September 1953.{{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhaust pipes exited through a modified rear bumper.&lt;ref&gt;''Hot Rod'', September 1953.{{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The engine was a {{convert|303|cid|cc|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile V8 engine|Olds]] from an [[Oldsmobile 88]], with 1952 heads and 4-barrel (4-choke) [[Rochester Products Division|Rochester]] carburetor.&lt;ref&gt;''Hot Rod'', September 1953.{{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interior was done by [[Wayne Tipton]] of [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] at a cost of US$450,&lt;ref&gt;''Hot Rod'', September 1953.{{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was finished in lemon yellow and eggshell white tuck-and-rolled [[Naugahyde]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hot Rod'', September 1953.{{page needed|date=July 2018}}; [http://www.ohio.com/lifestyle/48535197.html Ohio.com] (retrieved 28 July 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

The car was finished in a shade of purple dubbed Orchid Flame, which lent the car its name.&lt;ref&gt;''Hot Rod'', September 1953.{{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total cost was US$1800.&lt;ref&gt;''Hot Rod'', September 1953.{{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after taking delivery, Stewart showed ''Polynesian'' at the [[North American International Auto Show|Detroit Auto Show]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hot Rod'', September 1953.{{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Polynesian'' was featured in the August 1953 issues of [[Hot Rod (magazine)|''Hot Rod'']]&lt;ref&gt;''Rod &amp; Custom'', 8/89, p.68.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rod and Custom Magazine|''Rod and Custom'']] in September,{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} and also saw 54 pages of construction details in ''[[Motor Trend]] Custom Car Annual'' in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;''Rod &amp; Custom'', 8/89, p.68.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Stewart bought the car in 1950.  After customizing was complete, he used it as a daily driver for several years before selling it to John Zagray.&lt;ref&gt;''Custom Cars'', December 1958.{{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zagray made some modifications of his own.&lt;ref&gt;''Custom Cars'', December 1958.{{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some time later, the car disappeared.

It resurfaced in 1971, when the owner of the Red Lacquer Room body and restoration shop, [[Gene Blackford]], found the car in a barn near [[Robertsville, Ohio]], where sixth owner Warren Wise had stored it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.customrodder.com/features/0609cr_1950_oldsmobile_polynesian/index.html%7C_new ''Custom Rodder'' online] (retrieved 28 July 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; Blackford, who had first seen the car in its original custom form at age 12, paid Wise $1000 for what was left and put it in storage for thirty-three more years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.customrodder.com/features/0609cr_1950_oldsmobile_polynesian/index.html%7C_new ''Custom Rodder'' online] (retrieved 28 July 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he and six friends began a complete restoration to the Valley Custom standard, a process which took nine months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.customrodder.com/features/0609cr_1950_oldsmobile_polynesian/index.html%7C_new ''Custom Rodder'' online] (retrieved 28 July 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly-restored ''Polynesian'' won the Preservation Award at the 2006 [[Detroit Autorama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohio.com/lifestyle/48535197.html Ohio.com] (retrieved 28 July 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackford gave the engine a rebuild in 2006, and rebuilt the transmission in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohio.com/lifestyle/48535197.html Ohio.com] (retrieved 28 July 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Polynesian'' went on display at the [[Peterson Car Museum]] from 2006 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohio.com/lifestyle/48535197.html Ohio.com] (retrieved 28 July 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;
