The '''Mercury Park Lane''' is a [[Full-size car|full-size automobile]] which was produced by the [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] division of [[Ford Motor Company]]. While not officially introduced as the replacement of the [[Mercury Turnpike Cruiser]], the Park Lane became the flagship of the Mercury model line upon its introduction. The second-generation Park Lane was positioned above the [[Mercury Montclair]].

In 1969 the [[Mercury Marquis]] was expanded to a full model line and replaced the Park Lane in the Mercury range.

== First use of name ==
In 1956, the Park Lane name was used by the Ford division as it created a two-door station wagon intended as a competitor for the [[Chevrolet Nomad]].  Based on the Ford Fairlane, the [[Ford Parklane]] (spelled as a single word) outsold the Nomad nearly two-to-one, though Ford marketers felt the vehicle had missed its target market; it was discontinued after its only year of production.

The Mercury Park Lane was introduced for the 1958 model year as a premium model line for the division.  In design, it was conceptualized as a '''Super Mercury''' that would compete with [[General Motors]]' [[Buick Roadmaster]].  Available in two-door and four-door hardtop and two-door convertibles, the Park Lane offered the same body styles as the Turnpike Cruiser, though its distinctive "breezeway" rear window was adopted by the Continental Mark line.

Sharing its chassis with the [[Mercury Colony Park#1957–1958|Colony Park]] station wagon (and Edsel Citation/Corsair), the Park Lane had a 125-inch wheelbase (3 inches longer than the standard Mercury chassis).   In 1959, the Park Lane wheelbase was stretched to 128 inches (2 inches longer than other Mercurys).  For 1960, the Park Lane wheelbase was again changed, matching the 126 inches of the standard Mercury line.

The Park Lane was powered by a single engine: a 430 cubic-inch [[Ford MEL engine|Ford ''MEL'' V8]].  Initially rated at 360&amp;nbsp;hp for 1958, the ''Super Marauder'' engine option package allowed any Mercury with the 430 to increase its output to 400&amp;nbsp;hp (the first mass-production engine in an American automobile to be rated at 400&amp;nbsp;hp).  For 1959, the Super Marauder was discontinued, with the standard engine rated at 345&amp;nbsp;hp, retuned to 310&amp;nbsp;hp in 1960.  All Park Lanes were equipped with a 3-speed [[Cruise-O-Matic|Merc-O-Matic]] automatic transmission.

For 1960, the Park Lane saw a minor styling update distinguished by new taillamps, rear fender skirts, 5 chrome accent bars ahead of the rear wheel openings, wide rocker panel moldings, and the addition of a padded dashboard.

In 1961, the Park Lane name was dropped (along with the Montclair) as the division reorganized its marketing efforts towards the better-selling Monterey alongside the introduction of the [[Mercury Comet]] compact.

For the 1964 model year, the Mercury Park Lane made its return as the Mercury division expanded its model line.  Above the Monterey and newly reintroduced Montclair, the Park Lane again topped the Mercury line.  In contrast to the previous generation, the Park Lane used the same wheelbase as other Mercury lines, differing primarily in trim.

As the highest-priced, premium trim, many Park Lanes were fitted with the option of a "breezeway" reverse-slant retractable rear window (first used on the Turnpike Cruiser and the 1958-1960 Continental).  In addition, Mercury offered the Park Lane with a fastback roofline as part of Marauder option package (seen on any full-size Mercury); the fastback design proved popular on its Ford Galaxie 500 counterpart.

For 1965, the chassis of full-size Ford and Mercury cars were redesigned; the Mercury line was given a much more slab-sided appearance.  For 1967, to complement the Mercury Marquis (available only as a 2-door hardtop), the [[Mercury Brougham|Park Lane Brougham]] was introduced as a sub-model of the Park Lane.  For an option on hardtop coupe/convertible models, the Brougham introduced "yacht deck paneling" body trim (essentially the same simulated woodgrain [[DI-NOC]] used for the Colony Park); "yacht deck paneling" was a rarely ordered option.

As the division redesigned its full-size line for 1969, the Marquis was expanded to a full model range, taking over the place of the Park Lane (the Brougham would largely be replaced by the later [[Mercury Grand Marquis|Grand Marquis]]).

The '''Park Lane Brougham''' was the Ford Motor Company's flagship [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] model during its two-year run from 1967-1968.  Powerful and luxurious, it was offered as a four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]], a four-door [[hardtop]] and, quite rarely, as a two-door [[hardtop]] (1968 only).  The Brougham differentiated itself from the standard '''Park Lane''' by featuring 50-50 split bench seats with deep foam and thick box pleating, upscale door panels with higher trim levels and pull straps, and unique ornamentation.

== Use in media ==
In the 1968-1980 [[CBS]] crime drama ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', [[Jack Lord]]'s character [[Steve McGarrett]] frequently drove a triple-black 1968 Mercury Park Lane Brougham 4-door hardtop.

The '''Mercury Tracer''' is an automobile that was marketed by [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] from the 1988 through 1999 model years.  Introduced as the successor to the Mercury Lynx, three generations of the Tracer were sold in the United States and Canada.  Initially introduced as a [[Subcompact car|subcompact]], the two succeeding generations were sold in the [[Compact car|compact]] segment.  Throughout its production, the Tracer was marketed as a hatchback, four-door sedan, and five-door station wagon.    

After the 1999 model year, Mercury ended sales of the Tracer.  While the model line was not directly replaced, its Ford Escort counterpart was replaced by the [[Ford Focus (first generation)|Ford Focus]].            

The replacement for the [[Ford Escort (North America)|Ford Escort]]-derived [[Mercury Lynx|Lynx]], the first generation of the Tracer was a modified version of the Asia-Pacific market [[Ford Laser]], itself a variant of the [[Mazda 323]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zY21AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22mercury+tracer%22+ford+laser&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22mercury+tracer%22++ ''International Motor Business''], Issues 137-140, Economist Intelligence Unit, 1989, page 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Y-QDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=mercury%20tracer%20ford%20laser&amp;pg=PA124#v=onepage&amp;q=mercury%20tracer%20ford%20laser&amp;f=false Special Report: Imports '87], ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', February 1987, page 124&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 for the 1991 model year, the Tracer became the Mercury counterpart of the Ford Escort in North America.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rt60AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22mercury+tracer%22+ford+laser&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22mercury+tracer%22++ ''The Global Strategies of Multinational Enterprises and Government Policies: Ford Motor Company and the Automobile Industry in Canada and Mexico''], Volume 2, Isabel Studer-Noguez, 1997, page 340&lt;/ref&gt; All three generations of the Tracer were based on variations of the [[Mazda Familia|Mazda 323/Protegé]].

The [[Ford Focus (first generation)|Ford Focus]] would serve as a common replacement for both the Ford Escort and the Mercury Tracer.

For 1988, Mercury introduced the Tracer as its subcompact model range replacing the Lynx. The Tracer became the first Mercury assembled outside of North America.  Three-door hatchbacks (for the United States) were assembled by Mazda in [[Hiroshima (Mazda factory)|Hiroshima]]; five-door hatchbacks and station wagons were assembled by Ford in Mexico by [[Hermosillo Stamping &amp; Assembly]]. Canadian production (three-door and five-door hatchbacks) was sourced from  [[Ford Lio Ho]] in [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mtW2AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Ford+Lio+Ho+exports+canada+tracer+five+door&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22mercury+tracers%22++ ''Trade Opportunities in Taiwan''], Volume 15, Issues 1-26, Far East Trade Services, Incorporated, 1987, page 19&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Chassis ===
The Mercury Tracer is an American counterpart of the Australian-market [[Ford Laser#Second generation (1985–1989)|Ford Laser KE]], sold in Japan, Asia, and South Africa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  While sharing a slightly different body, the Laser shared a common chassis with the front-wheel drive [[Mazda Familia#Fifth generation (BF; 1985–1989)|Mazda 323]], designated the [[Mazda B platform#BF|Mazda BF platform]].  A 1.6L [[Mazda B engine#B6|B6]] inline-4 from the 323 was offered with the Tracer.  For Canadian-market examples, a 71-hp carbureted engine was offered, with an 84-hp fuel-injected engine offered in the United States.  A 5-speed manual was standard, with a 3-speed automatic offered as an option.   

=== Body ===
In line with its Lynx predecessor, the Tracer was offered as in 3-door and 5-door hatchback configurations; for the United States, a 5-door station wagon was offered.  Sharing its body panels with the Ford Laser, the Tracer was distinguished by a Mercury grille, badging, and wheel covers; slight revisions were made to the hatchback and station wagon liftgate.  Along with a base L trim, the Tracer was offered in GS and LS trim, in line with the Topaz, Sable, and Grand Marquis model lines.   &lt;gallery mode="packed" caption="First-generation Mercury Tracer"&gt;

For 1991, the second-generation Tracer was introduced in early 1990, skipping the 1990 model year altogether.  While again derived from Mazda underpinnings, the Tracer became the Mercury counterpart of the Ford Escort as all three model lines were redesigned for 1991, with the 323 becoming the [[Mazda Familia#Sixth generation (BG; 1989–1994)|Mazda Protegé]] sedan in North America.  In another shift, the Tracer grew in size, shifting from the subcompact to the compact segment, with all assembly consolidated at Hermosillo Stamping in Mexico.  

The Mercury Tracer LTS was named to ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 1991.

=== Chassis ===
The second-generation Tracer is derived from the front-wheel drive [[Mazda B platform#BG|Mazda BG platform]] (officially designated the Ford CT120 platform), sharing a 98.4-inch wheelbase with the Escort and Protegé.  An 88-hp 1.9L [[Ford CVH engine|CVH]] inline-4 is the standard engine (shared with the Escort).  From 1991 to 1994, a 127-hp 1.8L [[Mazda B engine#BP|BP]] inline-4 (shared with the Ford Escort GT and Mazda Protegé LX) was offered.  A 5-speed manual was standard with both engines, with a 4-speed automatic offered with the 1.9L engine.  

=== Body ===
The second-generation Tracer was offered in two configurations; along with the station wagon, a four-door sedan replaced the previous hatchbacks (offered as an Escort).  While sharing almost no body panels with its Mazda counterpart, the Tracer differed little from the Escort, with the latter distinguished largely by amber turn signal lenses.      

During its production, the second-generation Tracer saw few external changes.  For 1991, the Tracer was styled with a body-color front grille, replaced by a light-bar grille for 1992 (in line with the Topaz and Sable); for 1996, Tracer sedans received revised taillamps.  For 1993, the Tracer was given a drivers' side airbag as a passive restraint, replacing automatic seatbelts; for 1994, the addition of a passenger airbag required a redesign of the dashboard.    

In line with other Mercury model ranges, the Tracer was marketed in GS and LS trims, with an LTS trim (Luxury Touring Sedan) serving as the flagship of the model range.  Largely the counterpart of the Ford Escort LX-E (the four-door version of the Ford Escort GT), the LTS was powered by a 127hp Mazda 1.8L engine; the LTS was produced through the 1994 model year.  &lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

For 1997, the Tracer underwent a substantial redesign; although using the same chassis underpinnings, the powertrain and body saw extensive revisions.  

=== Chassis ===
The third-generation Tracer is derived from the front-wheel drive [[Ford CT120 platform]], used again by Ford, sharing the same 98.4-inch wheelbase as the previous generation.  The sole engine is a 110-hp 2.0L  [[Ford CVH engine|SPI 2000]] inline-4, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission.     

=== Body ===
The third-generation Tracer again was offered in four-door sedan and five-door station wagon configurations (with the Escort hatchbacks withdrawn altogether).  The Tracer largely was distinguished from the Escort by its front fascia and taillamps, along with model-specific wheelcovers.  The Tracer station wagon carried over much of the second-generation bodyshell, with updates limited to the front fascia, sideview mirrors, door handles, badging, and dashboard.   

As with previous generations, the third-generation Tracer was sold in GS and LS trims, with Mercury selling a Trio appearance package for the GS.  The LS trim was distinguished by alloy wheels, leather interior, keyless entry, power windows and door locks, and tachometer.  

Following the 1999 model year, the Tracer was withdrawn (along with the Escort station wagon).  For 1999,  23,146 examples were sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/press/date/20010103/press033466.html|title=Ford Motor Company Sets New Full Year U.S. Sales Record|date=|publisher=Theautochannel.com|accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The final Mercury Tracer rolled off the assembly line on July 2, 1999.&lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

== Proposed 2011 revival ==
Shortly before the end of the Mercury division, Ford planned a revival of the Tracer model line.  As Ford confirmed its 2012 model lines with dealers in early 2010, Mercury was to add a compact sedan (derived from the  [[Ford Focus (North America)|2012 Ford Focus]]) as an additional sedan line.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/110021524573/new-ford-focus-badged-as-mercury-tracer-due-in-2011|title=&lt;nowiki&gt;worldcarfans.com|New Ford Focus Badged as Mercury Tracer Due in 2011&lt;/nowiki&gt;|last=|first=|date=|year=2011|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Slotted below the Milan, the Focus-derived Mercury was unofficially confirmed to adopt the Mercury Tracer nameplate (ending a 13-year hiatus).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Following the planned discontinuation of the Grand Marquis, a 2012 Tracer was to expand Mercury to two sedan lines.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   

In the summer in 2010, Ford announced the withdrawal of the Mercury division, cancelling the revival of the Mercury Tracer; to expand Ford Focus model range, Ford introduced the premium Titanium trim.

The '''Mercury Turnpike Cruiser''' is a series of automobiles that were produced by the [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] division of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]].  Named by Mercury to commemorate the creation of the [[Interstate Highway System]], the Turnpike Cruiser was the flagship Mercury model line, slotted above the [[Mercury Montclair|Montclair]].

The Turnpike Cruiser was produced as a two-door and a four-door hardtop sedan.  A convertible (called the Convertible Cruiser) was built during 1957, serving as one of the first [[Indianapolis 500 pace cars#Cars|replica pace cars]].  Mercury fitted the Turnpike Cruiser with a wide variety of advanced features for the time of its production, including a retractable rear window, compound-curve windshield, and a trip computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1957%20Mercury/album/1957%20Mercury-03.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1957 Mercury/album|date=|publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com|accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1957-1958-mercury-turnpike-cruiser2.htm | title=1957-1958 Mercury Turnpike Cruiser| date=2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1957%20Mercury/1957_Mercury_Foldout/1957%20Mercury%20Foldout-03.html | title=Directory Index: Mercury/1957 Mercury/1957_Mercury_Foldout}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, 23,268 examples of the Turnpike Cruiser were produced over two years.  For 1959, Mercury discontinued the Turnpike Cruiser, phasing its content into the [[Mercury Park Lane|Park Lane]] product line.

==Model overview==
The Turnpike Cruiser derives its name from the 1956 Mercury XM-Turnpike Cruiser concept car,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hemmings.com/blog/2016/10/26/predicting-the-near-future-mercurys-1956-xm-turnpike-cruiser-concept/|website=www.hemmings.com|access-date=2019-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; a two-door hardtop which largely served as a preview of the 1957 Mercury model line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1957-1958-mercury-turnpike-cruiser5.htm|title=1957-1958 Mercury Turnpike Cruiser|date=2007-10-29|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|access-date=2019-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For 1957, the Turnpike Cruiser was offered as the flagship Mercury model line.  For 1958, the Turnpike Cruiser was phased into the Montclair line, sharing the flagship role with the newly introduced Park Lane.

=== Chassis ===
The Turnpike Cruiser shared its rear-wheel drive chassis with the Monterey and Montclair, using a 122-inch wheelbase.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1957%20Mercury/1957_Mercury_Foldout/1957%20Mercury%20Foldout-05.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1957 Mercury/1957_Mercury_Foldout|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using body-on frame construction, the front axle of the Turnpike Cruiser was fitted with independent ball-joint front suspension with coil springs; the live rear axle was fitted with leaf springs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  11-inch drum brakes were fitted to all four wheels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For 1958, the chassis (using a 124-inch wheelbase) was adopted by Edsel for its premium [[Edsel Corsair|Corsair]] and [[Edsel Citation|Citation]] model lines.

==== Powertrain ====
For 1957, the Turnpike Cruiser was fitted with a 368 cubic-inch V8, producing 290&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1957%20Mercury/1957_Mercury_Foldout/1957%20Mercury%20Foldout-03.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1957 Mercury/1957_Mercury_Foldout|date=|publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com|accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sharing its name with the car, the 290-hp engine was offered as an option across the rest of the Mercury line.  For 1958, two all-new "Marauder" engines were introduced.  The standard engine (shared with the Montclair and Colony Park) was a 383 cubic-inch V8, producing 330&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1958%20Mercury/1958_Mercury_Brochure/1958%20Mercury%20Brochure-32.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1958 Mercury/1958_Mercury_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 430 cubic-inch version (shared with the Park Lane) produced 360&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://ford-mel-engine.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=14 |title = MEL 430 Engine Specifications -}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a special order option, a triple-carburetor "Super Marauder" version of the 430 V8 produced 400&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://ford-mel-engine.com/viewforum.php?f=104 |title = The MEL Engine Tripower Heaven -}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://ford-mel-engine.com/viewtopic.php?f=110&amp;t=1286 |title = 430 Super Marauder -}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exclusive to Mercury, the Super Marauder was the first factory-produced engine with a 400&amp;nbsp;hp output.

All Turnpike Cruiser engines were paired with a 3-speed "[[Cruise-O-Matic|Merc-O-Matic]]" automatic.  In place of a column-mounted shifter, the transmission shifter was push-button operated (along with the parking brake).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1957%20Mercury/1957_Mercury_Foldout/1957%20Mercury%20Foldout-02.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1957 Mercury/1957_Mercury_Foldout|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For 1958, the shifter was redesigned, adding multiple drive ranges.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1958%20Mercury/1958_Mercury_Flyer/1958%20Mercury%20Flyer-11.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1958 Mercury/1958_Mercury_Flyer|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1958%20Mercury/1958_Mercury_Brochure/1958%20Mercury%20Brochure-10-11.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1958 Mercury/1958_Mercury_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1957 Mercury Turnpike Cruiser - 15781944220.jpg|left|thumb|Closeup image of rooftop air intake/radio antenna, 1957 Turnpike Cruiser]]
During its production, the Turnpike Cruiser was offered as a two-door and four-door hardtop.  To serve as the pace car for the [[1957 Indianapolis 500]], a convertible was created (named the Convertible Cruiser), leading Mercury to offer a version for sale.  Effectively one of the first replica pace cars, the Convertible Cruiser was offered in a single yellow (Sun Glitter) exterior color and were fitted with the optional [[continental tire]] kit.

While sharing much of its body with the Montclair, the Turnpike Cruiser was distinguished by several exterior design features.  Although not legalized across the entire United States until 1958, quad headlamps were fitted as standard equipment (the only 1957 Mercury to do so, as well as one of very few cars from that year to be equipped as such); for states that still allowed the use of single headlights only, the Turnpike Cruiser also used the then-standard singles setup.  In place of contrasting paint, the scalloped tailfins were gold-anodized.  Distinguished by its retractable "Breezeway" rear window, the Turnpike Cruiser received a separate roofline, along with a windshield curving into the roof;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1957-1958-mercury-turnpike-cruiser2.htm|title=1957-1958 Mercury Turnpike Cruiser|date=2007-10-29|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|access-date=2019-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the windshield was among the first to use tint to reduce solar glare.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  As a consequence of the compound-curve design of the windshield, Mercury added rooftop ventilation intakes to the Turnpike Cruiser to cover a body seam (in a secondary function, each intake also housed a radio antenna).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Coupled with the retractable rear window, the Turnpike Cruiser was among the first cars to offer flow-through ventilation; air conditioning and power side windows were an additional cost options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1957%20Mercury/1957%20Mercury%20Turnpike%20Cruiser%20Brochure/image3.html|title=1957 Mercury Turnpike Cruiser Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For 1958, the Turnpike Cruiser adapted the styling changes of the Montclair and Monterey, shifting the grilles into the front bumper.  The rear fascia multiple changes, as the gold-anodized trim was removed from the scalloped fins; "rocket-style" taillamps were added.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1957-1958-mercury-turnpike-cruiser4.htm|title=1957-1958 Mercury Turnpike Cruiser|date=2007-10-29|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|access-date=2019-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To distinguish the model line from the Montclair (and Park Lane), the Turnpike Cruiser was given gold trim for its badging (including the Mercury "M" grille badge).

The interior of the Turnpike Cruiser offered several features distinct from other Mercury sedans.  To aid forward visibility, a flat-top deep-dish steering wheel was fitted (to match the curve of the instrument panel).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1957%20Mercury/1957_Mercury_Brochure/1957%20Mercury%20Brochure-31.html;|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1957 Mercury/1957_Mercury_Brochure|website=How Stuff Works|publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alongside a tachometer ("to measure engine efficiency"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;),&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the instrument panel was fitted with a clock to calculate average speed and a trip odometer (effectively, a trip computer).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  One of the first memory seats, "Seat-O-Matic" was programmable and moved down and back when the ignition was off.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1958%20Mercury/1958_Mercury_Brochure/1958%20Mercury%20Brochure-28.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1958 Mercury/1958_Mercury_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While not equipped with cruise control, in 1958, the Turnpike Cruiser (alongside all Mercurys) was introduced with a programmable speed warning, setting off a warning if a preset speed was exceeded.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

While the Turnpike Cruiser was produced only for two years, elements of its design would be adopted across several other Lincoln-Mercury vehicles.  For 1958, Lincoln introduced the Continental Mark III; to distinguish it from the standard Lincoln, the Mark III was fitted with a retractable rear window on all body styles (including convertibles).  While using a similar roofline as the Turnpike Cruiser, Continental used a reverse-slant rear window.

For 1959, following the discontinuation of the Turnpike Cruiser, Mercury designated its hardtop roofline as a Hardtop Cruiser, with all Park Lanes (except convertibles) produced as hardtops.  A compound-curved rear window was introduced, creating a fastback roofline, adopted by the 1960s [[Mercury Marauder]] and [[Mercury S-55]].

Following the 1960 Continental Mark V, Lincoln discontinued the retractable rear window design feature.  For 1963, the design feature was revived by Mercury, making a reverse-slant retractable rear window standard on its full-size sedans (including the Monterey, Montclair, S-55, and Park Lane).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1963%20Mercury/1963%20Mercury%20Full%20Line%20Brochure/image6.html|title=1963 Mercury Full Line Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1964%20Mercury/1964_Mercury_and_Comet_Brochure/1964%20Mercury%20and%20Comet-08-09.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1964 Mercury/1964_Mercury_and_Comet_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1965, the roofline became an option and was discontinued after 1966.

For 2001, the [[Ford Explorer Sport Trac]] mid-size pickup truck adopted a retractable rear window between the cab and cargo area.  While vertical in design, the Sport Trac used a retracting center portion in line with the previous Mercury and Lincoln designs.

The '''Mercury Comet''' is an [[automobile]] that was produced by [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] from 1962–1969 and 1971–1977 — variously as either a compact or an intermediate car.

The Comet was initially based on the compact [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]], then on the intermediate [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Ford Fairlane]] and finally on the compact [[Ford Maverick (Americas)|Ford Maverick]]. As a Mercury, early Comets received better grade interior trim than concurrent Falcons, and a slightly longer wheelbase.

==Relationship to Edsel==
The Comet was originally planned as an [[Edsel]] model. Ford announced the end of the Edsel program on November 19, 1959. However, production of 1960 Edsels continued until late November. The Comet was reassigned to the Lincoln-Mercury division to sell at Mercury-Comet dealerships, where it was marketed as a stand-alone product for 1960 and 1961 as the ''Comet'' without any Mercury divisional badging.

Developed concurrently with the [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]], early pre-production photographs of the sedan show a car remarkably close to the Comet that emerged, but with a split grille following the pattern established by Edsel models. Early Ford styling mules for the station wagon model carried the Edsel name as well.

At their debut, the split grille was replaced by one more in keeping with Mercury's design themes. However, the canted elliptical taillights, first seen on the Edsel prototype, were used and carried the "E" (Edsel) part number on them. While the short lived 1960 Edsels used elliptical shaped taillights, the lenses used on both cars differed in length and width. Certain other parts from the 1959 Edsel parts bin, including the parking lights and dashboard knobs, were used on the first-year Comet. Keys for the 1960 and 1961 Comets were shaped like Edsel keys, with the center bar of the "E" removed to form a "C".

The "comet" name was trademarked to [[Wayne Corporation#Cotner-Bevington|Cotner-Bevington]] as the Comet Coach Company, building [[ambulance]] and [[hearse]] commercial vehicles. Ford bought the name in 1959.

==Overview==
From 1960–1965, the Comet was based on the [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]] platform (stretched {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} for sedans, but not for wagons). The 1960–1963 Comets share a similar basic shape. These are sometimes referred to as the "round body" Comets. For 1962 and 1963, the Comet shared a considerable number of body and mechanical parts with the short-lived [[Ford Fairlane (North America)|Fairlane]]-based [[Mercury Meteor]] intermediate.

[[File:MercComet60Backleft.jpg|thumb|left|1960 Mercury Comet two-door sedan, with its very distinct tailfins]]
The Comet was initially released without any divisional badging, only "Comet" badges, similar to Valiant which didn't have Plymouth badging at first. It was sold through Mercury-Comet dealers, but would not be branded as a Mercury Comet for two more years. This was similar to Ford's treatment of the Meteor and Frontenac of Canada, sold thru Meteor - Mercury - Frontenac dealers.

[[File:1961 Comet.jpg|thumb|left| 1961 Comet 4-door sedan new grille design ]]
Introduced in March 1960, initial body styles were 2-door and 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedans]] and 2- and 4-door [[station wagon]]s. Two trim levels were available, standard and "Custom", with the custom package including badging, additional chrome trim and all-vinyl interiors. In 1960, the only engine available was the 144 [[cubic inch displacement|cid]] ''[[Ford Straight-6 engine#144|Thriftpower]]'' straight six with a single-barrel Holley carburetor which produced {{convert|90|hp|abbr=on}} at 4200&amp;nbsp;rpm. (Some sources list it as producing {{convert|85|hp|abbr=on}} at 4200&amp;nbsp;rpm). Transmission options were a column-shifted 3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] and a 2-speed Merc-O-Matic [[automatic transmission]] (unique to the Comet, despite sharing a name with the [[Cruise-O-Matic|Merc-O-Matic]] installed in other Mercurys).

Ford had purchased the name "Comet" from Comet Coach Company, a professional car manufacturer in which the term belonged to a line of funeral coaches, mainly Oldsmobiles. The coach company then was renamed ''Cotner-Bevington''.

In [[Canada]], for the 1960 model year, Meteor-Mercury dealers sold a compact car called the "Frontenac". Frontenac was considered a marque in its own right and was a badge-engineered version of the Ford Falcon with only minor trim differences to distinguish it from the Falcon. The Frontenac was produced for only one year. The Comet was introduced to the Canadian market for the 1961 model year and replaced the Frontenac as the compact offering by Meteor-Mercury dealers.

[[File:1962 Mercury Comet 4-dr Station Wagon, front left.jpg|thumb|left|1962 Comet 4-door station wagon]]
In response to complaints about the low performance of the 144 cid engine, a 170 cid [[Straight-six engine|straight-six]] with a single-barrel Holley carburetor producing {{convert|101|hp|abbr=on}} at 4400&amp;nbsp;rpm was released for the 1961 model year. A new 4-speed manual transmission was also an option (a Dagenham without 1st gear synchromesh). The changes to the 1961 Comet were minimal such as moving the Comet Script from the front fender to the rear quarter as well as a new grille design. 
[[File:Mercury Comet Custom Convertible, 1963, Rear (4800718560).jpg|thumb|left|1963 Mercury Comet S-22 convertible]]
The optional S-22 package was released. Available only on the 2-door sedan, it was billed as a "sport" package, although it shared the same mechanicals as regular Comets, with the only changes being S-22 badging, bucket seats and a [[center console (automobile)|center console]].

Comet was officially made a Mercury model for the 1962 model year, and it received some minor restyling, mainly a redesign of the trunk and taillight area to bring the car more in line with the Mercury look. This is the first year the car carried Mercury badging.
The S-22 had six bullet shaped tail lights, while regular Comets had four oval with 2 optional flat reverse lights. A Comet Villager station wagon, basically a Comet Custom 4-door station wagon with [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] side panels, was added to the lineup. (The [[Edsel Villager|Villager]] name had previously been used to denote the 4-door steel-sided station wagon in the Edsel Ranger series.)

While the 1963 model looked almost identical to the earlier models, the chassis and suspension were redesigned to accommodate an optional 260 cid [[V8 engine|V8]] engine (Borrowed from the [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Fairlane]]) using a 2-barrel carburetor and producing {{convert|164|hp|abbr=on}}. [[Convertible (car)|Convertible]] and [[Hardtop Coupe|hardtop]] (pillar-less) coupe models were added to the Comet Custom and Comet S-22 lines this year.

The front ends of these Comets differed from their Falcon counterparts in that they had four headlights instead of two; similar situations would resurface in the late 1970s, with the [[Ford Thunderbird]][[Mercury Cougar|/Mercury Cougar]] and the [[Ford Fairmont|Ford Fairmont/Mercury Zephyr]].

[[File:1964 Mercury Comet Caliente (5201367394).jpg|thumb|left|1964 Mercury Comet Caliente.  This is a right hand drive version located in Australia.]]
The 1964 Comet was redesigned with a much more square shape, though it was still built on the same unibody as the 1963 model. Its basic lines were shared with the new Falcon, but the front grille used styling similar to that of the [[Lincoln Continental#Fourth generation (1961–1969)|Lincoln Continental]]. Along with the redesign, the model designations were changed. The performance version was known as the '''[[Mercury Cyclone|Cyclone]]''', replacing the previous S-22. Then in descending order of trim levels were the '''Caliente''', '''404''' and '''202''', replacing the previous '''Custom''' and '''base''' models. The 2-door station wagon bodystyle was discontinued. The top-of-the-line [[station wagon]] continued to be known as the '''Villager'''. The base 144 cid six engine was dropped and the 170 cid six became the new base engine. The 260 V8 was available at the beginning of the production run, with the new 289 being available mid-year.  Due to the success of the full size Ford and Mercury "fastback" roofline introduced in mid-1963, the Falcon and Comet 2-door hardtops got a similar roofline with sharper corners. 

For 1964, Ford produced about 50 ultra high performance lightweight Comet Cyclones, equipped with their racing two-carburetor 427 engine, similar to their cousin, the [[Ford Fairlane (North American)#Thunderbolt|Ford Thunderbolt]]. To avoid competing with each other, the Thunderbolts ran in super stock on {{convert|7|in|mm|sing=on}} tires, but the Cyclones were modified to run in A/FX on {{convert|10|in|mm|sing=on}} tires, where they were as dominant as the Thunderbolts were in super stock.  Drivers included [[Ronnie Sox]], [[Don Nicholson]] and [[Wild Bill Shrewsberry]] in conjunction with [[Jack Chrisman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.69hemi.com/compcar/page_01.htm | title= List of '64 427 A/FX drivers| website= 69hemi.com| date= | access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shrewsberry still owns his original 427 Comet in Caliente trim.{{cn|date= August 2019}}
[[File:1965 Mercury Comet -- 06-30-2011.jpg|thumb|left|1965 Mercury Comet Caliente Two-Door Hardtop]]
For 1965, the Comet received updated styling front and rear (including stacked headlights, similar to what [[Pontiac (automobile)|Pontiac]]s and [[Cadillac (automobile)|Cadillac]]s would use at the same time). The base 6-cylinder engine was increased from 170 cid to 200 cid. Still using a single-barrel carburetor, it produced {{convert|120|hp|abbr=on}} at 4400&amp;nbsp;rpm. The base 8-cylinder engine was increased from 260 to 289 cid and, using a 2-barrel carburetor, it produced {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on}} at 4400&amp;nbsp;rpm. The standard transmission continued as a column-shifted 3-speed manual transmission. The optional automatic was changed to a "Merc-O-Matic" 3-speed automatic transmission (essentially a [[Ford C4 transmission]]). The 289 V8 was available in three horsepower ratings, base 2-barrel 200&amp;nbsp;hp, 4-barrel {{convert|225|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and the premier driveline option was the 289 cubic inch, {{convert|271|hp|kW|abbr=on}} high-performance engine and four-speed manual transmission found on the [[Ford Mustang]].

Beginning in 1966, the Comet grew from a compact to become a mid-sized car. It was now based on the same chassis as the [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Ford Fairlane]] intermediate (and the previous Mercury Meteor intermediate which was only offered in 1962–1963). These intermediate-sized cars used the same basic chassis as the original Ford Falcon and Mercury Comet compacts, but were stretched with longer wheelbases. The previous generation Comet shared its platform with the all-new Ford Mustang in 1964, and when the Comet graduated to the intermediate platform, the [[Mercury Cougar]] became the platform shared with the Mustang. 

The Comet wagon would introduce a Dual-Action tailgate, able to both fold down or swing aside, an idea soon copied by all the major U.S. manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960–1972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), p.456.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1967 Mercury Caliente.jpg|thumb|left|1967 Mercury Comet Caliente convertible]]
The 1966 Comet received distinct outer body panels. The '''Comet Capri''' replaced the previous Comet 404 and the '''Comet Voyager''' 4-door station wagon replaced the previous Comet 404 station wagon. The Voyager name had previously been used to designate a full-sized Mercury station wagon that was positioned between the base Commuter and the top-of-the-line Colony Park station wagon models. The Comet 202 4-door station wagon was discontinued. The new top-of-the-line series was the '''Comet Cyclone GT'''.

New engines available in the Comet for 1966 included a 390 cid V8 engine with a 2-barrel carburetor producing {{convert|265|hp|abbr=on}} at 4400&amp;nbsp;rpm, a 390 cid V8 engine with a 4-barrel carburetor producing {{convert|275|hp|abbr=on}}, and 390 cid V8 engine that produced {{convert|335|hp|abbr=on}}. The 335&amp;nbsp;hp 390 cid V8 engine was standard on the Cyclone GT and optional on other models. The Cyclone GT when equipped with an automatic transmission was referred to as the '''Cyclone GTA'''.

A Cyclone GT convertible was the [[pace car]] for the 1966 [[Indianapolis 500]].

Beginning with the 1967 model year, the Comet name was used only on the base '''Comet 202''' model, available only in 2 or 4-door sedan body styles. Other models were now referred to by what had previously been their subseries names. Mercury's mid-size line-up ranged from the basic Comet 202, through the '''Capri''', '''Caliente''', '''Cyclone''', and '''Cyclone GT''' models, as well as steel-sided '''Voyager''' and simulated wood paneled '''Villager''' station wagon models, which were comparable to the Capri.

In 1968, Mercury's mid-sized models again received new sheet metal and styling that resembled the full-sized Mercury models and shared their chassis and many parts with Ford's mid-sized '''Fairlane''' and '''Torino''' models. The mid-sized base model was the '''Comet''' (Mercury dropped the '''202''' suffix) available only as a 2-door coupe. The '''Capri''' was replaced by the '''Montego''', and the '''Caliente''' by the '''Montego MX'''. There was also a more luxurious '''Montego MX Brougham''', basically an option package for the '''Montego MX'''. Top-of-the-line mid-sized models continued to use the '''Cyclone''' and '''Cyclone GT''' names.

A 302 cid V8 engine using a 2-barrel carburetor and generating {{convert|210|hp|abbr=on}} at 4600&amp;nbsp;rpm would replace the previous 289 cid V8 midway in the 1968 model year. For the 1969 [[model year]], the grille was modified and the headlight surrounds were removed.  The taillights were also slightly re-styled. There would be few changes to Mercury's mid-sized lineup for the 1969 model year, the last year that the '''Comet''' name would grace a mid-sized model. A Comet 4-door sedan for 1969 was supposedly planned, but never offered. New top-of-the-line '''Cyclone Spoiler''' and '''Cyclone CJ''' models would join the lineup.

A 250 cid [[inline-6]] using a single-barrel carburetor and generating {{convert|155|hp|abbr=on}} at 4000&amp;nbsp;rpm would replace the previous 200 cid 6 as standard. New engine options included a 302 cid V-8 engine using a 4-barrel carburetor and generating {{convert|220|hp|abbr=on}} at 4400&amp;nbsp;rpm (standard on the Cyclone), a 351 cid V-8 using a 4-barrel carburetor generating {{convert|290|hp|abbr=on}} at 5200&amp;nbsp;rpm (standard on the Cyclone Spoiler), and a 428 cid V-8 using a 4-barrel carburetor generating {{convert|335|hp|abbr=on}} at 5200&amp;nbsp;rpm (standard on the Cyclone CJ&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartype.com/pages/3538/mercury_cyclone_cj__1969 |title=Mercury Cyclone CJ : 1969 |publisher=Cartype |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;). These new V-8s replaced the previous 390 cid V-8s.

==1970==
Still using the same basic chassis, 1970 models would receive dramatic new styling, but the base model would now be the '''Montego'''. Comet was no longer the base level intermediate. The '''[[Mercury Cyclone|Cyclone]]''' name would continue to be used through the 1971 model year.

For 1971, the '''Comet''' name was revived on Mercury's version of the [[Ford Maverick (Americas)|Ford Maverick]] compact. Sharing most of its sheet-metal with the '''Maverick''', it used a different [[grille]], [[taillight]]s, and [[hood (vehicle)|hood]], as well as different badging. The taillight pods were shared with the 1970 and 1971 '''Montego''' and '''Cyclone''' models. Underneath it all was the same basic chassis that had originally been used for the Ford Falcon, the original Comet, and for the mid-sized Ford Fairlane, Mercury Meteor, and later Mercury Comets.

The base engine was the 170 cid inline-6 with a single-barrel carburetor producing {{convert|100|hp|abbr=on}} at 4200&amp;nbsp;rpm. Optional engines were the 200 cid inline-6 with a single-barrel carburetor producing {{convert|115|hp|abbr=on}} and a 302 cid V8 with a 2-barrel carburetor producing {{convert|210|hp|abbr=on}}. Transmissions were either a 3-speed manual or 3-speed automatic with either column or floor-mounted shifters.

The Comet was available as 2- and 4-door sedans and in base (1971–1977), and "[[muscle car]]" '''Comet GT''' series (2-door sedan-only 1971-1975). The '''GT''' featured a blacked-out grille, dual body-side tape stripes, high-back bucket seats, wheel trim rings, dual racing mirrors, bright window frames, black instrument panel, deluxe door trim panels, and a simulated hood scoop.

In 1972 models, the base 170 cid six was rated at {{convert|82|hp|abbr=on}} at 4400 rpm, the 200 cid six at {{convert|91|hp|abbr=on}}, and the 302 cid V8 at {{convert|138|hp|abbr=on}}. A new engine option for 1972 was the 250 cid six with a single-barrel carburetor rated at {{convert|98|hp|abbr=on}}.

For 1973 models, the base 170 cid six was dropped and the 200 cid six became the base engine. Horsepower ratings would fluctuate slightly up or down through the years the Comet would remain in production, but not by very much. A new, larger front bumper to meet federal standards was added to all models in 1973. A new Custom decor package featuring vinyl roof, body-colored wheel covers, wide vinyl-insert body-side moldings, vinyl bucket seats, luxury carpeting, and extra sound insulation was a popular option.

Changes for 1974 included even larger front bumpers and new larger rear bumpers to match. They added {{convert|2.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} to the length of the 2-door model and {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} to the length of the 4-door model.

Ford had originally planned to the replace the Comet and its Ford Maverick counterpart for the 1975 model year with updated and extensively redesigned models that would continue to use the Comet and Maverick names. Fairly late, though, they decided that the updated versions would be built alongside the original Maverick and the Comet that had originally been introduced for 1971. These would-be replacements, also using the same basic chassis as the Comet and Maverick, became the [[Mercury Monarch]] and the American [[Ford Granada (North America)|Ford Granada]], came with more standard and optional equipment than the Comet and Maverick, and were considered to be "luxury compacts," a step up from the Comet and Maverick.

Although 1975 was the last year for the '''Mercury Comet GT''', the GT features remained available in 1976 and 1977 with the "Sports Accent" option group.

The model was offered with comparatively few changes through the 1977 model year, and was then discontinued to make room for the new [[Mercury Zephyr]] for the 1978 model year.

==High mileage record==
In July 2010, ''[[USA Today]]'' reported on a 91-year-old Florida woman, Rachel Veitch, who was still driving her 1964 Comet Caliente daily. The car was purchased new, and Veitch set a record by accumulating over 562,000 documented miles. The car was retired in 2012 after accumulating 576,000 miles, as Veitch had decided to stop driving due to her eyesight becoming too weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher= British Broadcasting Corporation|title=For sale: 1964 Mercury, one lady owner, 576,000 miles|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-17603598| work= BBC.co.uk| accessdate=3 April 2012|date=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mercury Cyclone==
{{Main|Mercury Cyclone}}
The '''Cyclone''' was a performance model of the Comet. It was built from 1964–1971.&lt;ref name="FordMuscle"&gt;Holder, Bill; Kunz, Phil. ''Ford Muscle''. F+W Publications, Inc. 2004, p. 83-90. {{ISBN|0-87349-835-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1971 Mercury Cyclone.jpg|thumb|left|1971 Mercury Cyclone]]
===1968–1969 Mercury Cyclone===
The Cyclone received Mercury’s biggest facelift in 1968, switching from 1967’s boxy, Fairlane-derived coupe body to the super-streamlined Torino-based fastback. Unfortunately, the Cyclone GT lost the 335-hp, 390-cid V-8 as its standard engine, instead replaced by the 210-hp, 302-cid V-8. No matter, though, as the fastback was handsome and could be equipped with a 230-hp 302, 265- or 325-hp 390-cid V-8s, (briefly) a 390-hp version of the 427-cid V-8, or a 335-hp, 428-cid V-8.

By 1969, the Mercury Cyclone formal hardtop had been canceled and the GT fastback was also available as a CJ model. That came with the 335-hp, 428-cid V-8 standard, a four-speed transmission, and a plain bench seat interior. At $3,207, the CJ was aimed at the Plymouth Road Runner, and a 335-hp version could run 0-60 in 6.1 seconds with a quarter-mile time of 13.9 seconds. The Mercury Cyclone Spoiler and the Ford Torino Talladega launched the NASCAR streamliner battle when Cale Yarborough won the Daytona 500 in 1968 in a Woods Brothers Cyclone. Dodge produced the Daytona 500 and Ford retaliated with the Torino Talladega and Mercury Spoiler. Both were to have streamlined noses, but the Mercury launch was delayed until the mid-year Cyclone Spoiler II. Only 519 were sold, all with 351-cid V-8s instead of the bigger 428. A Dan Gurney special edition had a dark blue roof, striping, and a signature decal on the white lowers, while the Cale Yarborough edition was red and white like his Woods Brothers car, with a signature.

===1970 Mercury Cyclone===
Three Cyclone models were produced for 1970, all of which shared the Torino’s semi-fastback body, and all of which carried a four-part nose. The base car had a 360-hp, 429-cid V-8 and a four-speed transmission. Options included a 370-hp, 429-cid V-8 engine and a 375-hp, Super CJ 429-cid engine. There were also a few Boss 429s installed, though those cars are quite rare today. Meanwhile, the Cyclone GT was detuned to a 250-hp, 351-cid V-8 and the Spoiler packed a Ram-Air 370-hp, 429.

===1971 Mercury Cyclone===
The 1971 model year was the Cyclone’s last, as the muscle car wars wound down. With few changes from 1970, the Cyclone was absorbed into the Mercury Montego line, and only 444 Montego Cyclones were sold, along with 2,287 Cyclone GTs and 353 Cyclone Spoilers. Engine options ranged from the 210-hp, 302-cid V-8, all the way to the fire-breathing 370-hp, 429-cid Cobra-Jet V-8, to which a Ram-Air package could be added.

Mercury Cyclones occupy a niche in the muscle car world, along with Oldsmobile W-30s and Buick GSX Stage Is. The car is a fantastic expression of American muscle, albeit one from a mid-level, luxury-oriented nameplate. As a result, the Cyclone is mostly overshadowed by the Ford Mustang and Torino. The Cyclone’s sleeper status makes it a great value, and most cars remain within reach of any buyer. As with any muscle car of the era, the importance of documentation in terms of market price rises exponentially as the car’s horsepower ratings climb.

'''Capri''' (later '''Mercury Capri''') is a nameplate marketed by the [[Mercury (automobile)|Lincoln-Mercury]] division of Ford Motor Company on three distinct series of automobiles between 1970 and 1994.  From 1970 to 1978, the Capri was a [[sport compact]] marketed without any Ford divisional branding&lt;ref name="hemmings_I" /&gt;, sourced as a [[captive import]] from [[Ford of Europe]].  From 1979 to 1986, the Capri became part of the Mercury model line as a [[pony car]].   From 1991 to 1994, the Mercury Capri was a [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]], sourced as a captive import by [[Ford Australia|Ford of Australia]].    

In North America, the Capri was marketed without a direct Ford-brand counterpart for its first and third generations, although sold elsewhere under the Ford brand.

==Origin of name==
The Capri nameplate is derived from the namesake [[Capri|Italian island]], in automotive use, it has used by all three Ford divisions.  In 1952, the [[Lincoln Capri]] marked the first use of the nameplate, serving as its premium trim level during the early 1950s.  From 1962 to 1964, Ford of Britain introduced a [[Ford Consul Classic#Consul Capri|Ford Consul Capri]] two-door hardtop coupe.  For 1966 and 1967, the Capri name was first used by Mercury, denoting the standard trim of the [[Mercury Comet#1966-1967|Mercury Comet]].  

For 1968, Ford of Europe developed the [[Ford Capri]] two-door coupé as its counterpart to the Mustang.  In line with the Mustang, the Capri was styled with a long hood and a short deck (trunklid; later hatchback) with a fastback-style roofline.

=== Capri (1970–1975) ===
The first generation of the Capri was a [[captive import]] produced by Ford of Europe in Cologne, Germany.  Introduced in Europe for 1968 (and designed by [[Ford of Britain]] using local sourced components from the Cortina MkII and Escort with plans dating back to 1964 when development of a European variant of the Mustang commenced), the Ford Capri was marketed by the Lincoln-Mercury Division starting in April 1970.  While marketed as part of the Mercury model line, the Capri did not carry any divisional identification.&lt;ref name="hemmings_I"&gt;[http://www.hemmings.com/magazine/hmn/2007/05/1970--74-Ford-Capri/1453865.html 1970-'74 Ford Capri, www.hemmings.com] Retrieved 10 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  Priced at $2,300 at the time of its launch, the Capri was marketed as an economical sporty coupe (with no upscale trim levels unlike its European market variants e.g. the GT, RS, L, XL, and XLR which were trim levels), far smaller than the Mercury Cougar and Montego.&lt;ref name="hemmings_I" /&gt;    

In its adaptation to the American market, the Capri saw several minor revisions, with the two rectangular headlights of the Ford Capri replaced by four circular headlamps (shared with some upscale Capri models sold for the European market eg the RS or GT - the rectangular lighting did not meet FMVSS 108), grille-mounted turn signals, and side marker lights; [[Rostyle wheel|Rostyle wheels]] were fitted as standard equipment.  While produced in Germany as a variant of the [[Ford Cortina]], the Capri adopted powertrain commonality with the newly introduced [[Ford Pinto]].  Originally powered by a 1.6L [[Ford Kent engine|Kent "crossflow"]] inline-four, the Capri received a [[Ford Pinto engine#2.0 (TL20)|2.0L "OHC"]] inline-4 for 1971.  As an option, for 1972, Mercury introduced a 2.6L [[Ford Cologne V6 engine#2.6|Cologne]] V6, becoming the first American-market vehicle marketed by Ford Motor Company with a V6 engine.  For 1974, the V6 was enlarged to 2.8L, as Ford revised castings for both the engine block and cylinder heads.  

For 1973, the front bumper underwent a revision to comply with 5-mph bumper standards.  The previous chrome bumper was reinforced with a steel tube and attached to the frame with shock absorbers (extending the length of the body several inches).  As part of the change, the Capri saw revisions to the grille, taillamps, and its rear quarter trim grilles.  As part of an interior revision, the Capri was given a new steering wheel, dashboard, and seat trim along with a redesigned wiring harness.  For 1974, [[5 mph bumper|5 mph bumpers]] were fitted to both front and rear, replacing the previous chrome tube bumpers with reinforced body-colored plastic bumpers.&lt;gallery mode="packed-hover" heights="150"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Capri II (1976–1978)===

After the 1974 redesign of the Ford Capri, Lincoln-Mercury commenced American sales of the Capri Mk II in 1975 as an early 1976 model.  Skipping the 1975 model year entirely, Lincoln-Mercury renamed the Capri the Capri II, again omitting any formal divisional identification from the vehicle.&lt;ref name="hemmings_I" /&gt;  While sharing similar styling to its predecessor, the Capri II adopted a hatchback roofline.  As with the 1970–1974 Capri, to adapt to the American market, the Capri II was fitted with quad sealed-beam headlamps, grille-mounted turn signals, 5-mph bumpers, and body-color side-view mirror(s).    

Again maintaining powertrain commonality with the Ford Pinto, Ford Mustang II and Mercury Bobcat, the Capri II was fitted with the 2.3L OHC engine, offering a 2.8L V6 as an option.  

After the 1977 model year, Lincoln-Mercury ended imports of the Capri II from Ford of Europe, with unsold examples sold during the 1978 model year.  In total, 513,500 Capri/Capri IIs were sold from 1970 to 1978 by Lincoln-Mercury. At its peak, yearly Capri sales in North America were the highest for any import vehicle (with the exception of the [[Volkswagen Beetle]]).  Ford of Europe continued production of the Capri for another generation, through the end of 1986.  &lt;gallery mode="packed-hover" heights="150"&gt;

===Reception===
{{ad|date=September 2018}}
[[File:Advertisement for the 1971 Mercury Capri.jpg|thumb|left|Lincoln-Mercury advertisement-1971]]
''[[Road &amp; Track]]'' magazine on the 1970 Capri 1600: "...But styling and image sells cars, right? And if that's true, then it's our opinion that Lincoln-Mercury has a real winner in the Capri."&lt;ref&gt;Road &amp; Track 1971 Road test annual 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

''R&amp;T'' on the Capri 2000 in February, 1971: "The Capri has a lot to recommend it. It's a solidly built, sporty compact car and (especially with the 2-liter engine) fun to drive."&lt;ref&gt;Road &amp; Track-February 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

''R&amp;T'' on the Capri 2600 V6 in March, 1972: "...the Capri 2600 V6 is an outstanding car. We'll bet Lincoln-Mercury dealers won't be able to get enough of them to satisfy the demand."&lt;ref&gt;Road &amp; Track-March 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

''R&amp;T'' on the Capri 2800 V6: "...the V6 Capri remains a very attractive sporting car. It's solid as a Mercedes, still compact and light in the context of 1974 barrier busters, fast, reasonably economical of fuel, precise-handling, and quick-stopping: its engine and drivetrain are both sporty and refined. It's no wonder Lincoln-Mercury sold nearly 120,000 of them in 1973..."&lt;ref&gt;Road &amp; Track-1975 Road Test annual&lt;/ref&gt;

''R&amp;T'' on the Capri II 2.8 V6: "Once again we can report that the Capri V6 is an attractive, competent, and enjoyable car at a reasonable price. It goes, stops, and handles, it's well built and it has that sturdy, precise European character that makes it something special for Americans and Canadians. On top of all this it's a more practical car because of its new hatchback body.

'''1976–1977 JPS Capri II, Capri II S''' - Black or white car body with gold striping, "black chrome" trim, gold and black styled steel wheels and gold badging and grille surround.     

In Europe, the JPS Capri II celebrated the success of the John Player Special-sponsored [[Team Lotus]] Formula 1 team, and emulated its black and gold livery. In the US, anti-tobacco advertising laws required a name change to Capri II S. The interior received special seats and door panels: black with gold cloth inserts. {{Clear}}

For the 1979 model year, a second generation of the Capri was introduced.  As part of several changes over its predecessor, the Capri was officially part of the Mercury model line as Lincoln-Mercury ended captive imports of the Ford Capri in favor of creating a Mercury counterpart of the [[Ford Mustang (third generation)|1979 Ford Mustang]].  Sharing the [[Ford Fox platform|Fox platform]] with the Mustang, the 1979 Mercury Capri marked the first Mercury "pony car" since the 1970 Mercury Cougar.    

While visually similar to the Mustang, the second-generation Capri was offered solely in the three-door hatchback configuration.  The Capri was styled with its own front fascia, a vertically-mounted grille, and dark-tinted taillamps with horizontally-ribbed lenses.  In place of the widely flared wheel openings of the Mustang, the Capri was styled with slightly-flared wheel openings and widened front and rear fenders.  For 1983, the Capri received a redesign of the rear hatchback, distinguished with a large compound-curve "bubble-back" rear window.   For 1984, the front fascia of the Capri RS was fitted with a front air dam, with the same exterior continuing through 1986.  

Along with the base-trim Capri, Mercury offered the Capri Ghia (shared with the Mustang), Capri GS, Capri RS, and Capri Turbo RS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1980_Lincoln/1980_Lincoln-Mercury_Brochure/1980%20Lincoln-Mercury-10.html|title=Directory Index: Lincoln/1980_Lincoln/1980_Lincoln-Mercury_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Capri RS/Turbo RS was the Capri equivalent of a Mustang GT.  During its production, the second-generation Capri maintained powertrain commonality with the Ford Mustang, with inline-four, inline-6, V6, and V8 engines offered during its production; the only Mustang model with no Capri equivalent was the [[Ford Mustang SVO|Mustang SVO]].     

The second-generation Capri was produced through the 1986 model year.  For 1987, while the Mustang underwent a mid-cycle update (lasting to 1993), Mercury withdrew the Capri, focusing on the Cougar XR7 as its two-door performance vehicle; the next Mercury hatchback sports coupe was the 1999 Cougar.    

===Special editions===
'''1981–1983 Black Magic''' - Black cars with gold striping, gold metric [[Michelin TRX|TRX]] wheels and a gold cat's head on each side of the front valance.  The interior received special black seats with sand-colored inserts (code YA), with [[Recaro]] seating optional in 1982 (code TA) and Sport Performance seating optional in 1983 (code HA). In the 1981 and 1982 models years the Black Magic option could be ordered with polar white (code 9D) paint but otherwise had the same exterior appointments as the black cars (gold striping, gold TRX wheels, and gold cat's heads). Magazine ads for the 9D Black Magic used the term "white lightning" but the name of the package was still ''Black Magic''. The 1983 model is extremely rare and the only Black Magic to receive the compound rear window.

'''1983 Crimson Cat''' - Bright red (code 27) paint with gold striping and Cougar XR-7 TRX wheels set this car apart. Crimson Cat received black sport performance seating with red inserts (code KA).

'''1984 Charcoal Turbo RS''' - A Capri RS Turbo that was only available in charcoal upper-silver lower exterior paint with light grey striped rub mouldings, [[Garrett AiResearch|Garrett]] 60 trim turbocharger, enhanced multiport EFI four-cylinder [[Internal combustion engine|engine]], [[Michelin]] TRX package, 5.0 HO Sway bars, 3.45:1 limited slip rear axle, hood scoop, and orange and red lettering and striping. Sun- and T-top roofs were optional.

'''1985 Mercury Motorsport Capri''' - Built as pace cars replicas to commemorate the Mercury Motorcity 100, the Trans Am Series race run during the fourth year of the [[Detroit Grand Prix]] weekend. These were also modified by [[American Sunroof Company|ASC]] McLaren for Mercury and are highly sought after for their racing heritage and low production of 55 total units (50 replicas, 4 track cars and 1 prototype).

===Motorsport===
This particular generation was successful in the [[Trans Am Series]], winning the championship from 1984-1985 with an aftermarket V8 engine. The Mercury Capri 5.0L was the car used by the [[Jack Roush]] team with [[Wally Dallenbach Jr.]] driving to win the 1985 [[Sports Car Club of America]] (SCCA) Trans AM championship.

==== ASC McLaren (1984–1986) ==== 
[[File:85ASCMcLarenConveritble.jpg|thumb|1985 ASC McLaren Mercury Capri convertible]]
ASC (American Sunroof Corporation, now known as [[American Specialty Cars]]) produced several conversions of Mercury Capris from 1984 to 1986.  Along with convertible conversions, hatchbacks were restyled (renamed as coupes by the company).   

The coupes were tuned and enhanced with a number of suspension and visual upgrades including striping, a built-in [[radar detector]], ground effects, Hella fog lights, headlight and taillight covers and Italian [[Campagnolo]] honeycomb-style wheels.   

For 1984, coupes (25 produced) were all painted midnight blue. The 1985-1986 coupes (150 produced in 1985) were either painted blue or white. In 1986 (115 made), the last year for the coupes, customers had an even larger choice of colors, including smoke charcoal grey and raven black, joining the Oxford white and midnight blue, as well as silver metallic. http://www.ascmclaren.com/capripics.htm

In comparison to the coupes, convertibles were a far more involved project, as the conversion required the redesign of the unibody chassis.  As part of the conversion, the convertible top replaced the rear seats.  The manual top design is specific to the vehicle, requiring design-specific equipment (such as seals, weatherstripping, and windshield moldings).  Fabrication required a replacement rear deck lid, floor reinforcements, quarter panel caps, [[tonneau cover]] and a windshield that was raked back an extra 10 degrees

In total, 557 convertibles were built during its 1984-1986 production run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ascmclaren.org/WhatIsAnAscMcLaren.html|title=ascMcLaren Capri and Mustang Information, Pictures and Resources|date=|publisher=ascMcLaren.org|accessdate=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

===== Powertrain upgrades =====
ASC McLaren coupes were equipped with the [[Ford Motorsport]] B303 camshaft,&lt;ref&gt;ascMcLaren Coupe Modifications http://www.ascmclaren.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=24&lt;/ref&gt; creating significantly more power than the rated {{convert|200|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}/{{convert|210|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} of the standard 5.0L motors. Additionally, all coupes were shod with [[BFGoodrich]] Comp T/A radials. The 225/50/15 low profile size of these tires (as opposed to the standard 5.0L Capri's 225/60/15) raised the ASC/McLaren Coupe's effective gear ratio from 3.08:1 to approximately 3.35:1. 

These were the quickest cars produced by Ford in 1985 and 1986 with zero to sixty times well under six seconds and quarter mile times in the mid-13 second range.

====Ford Mustang (Mexico, 1981–1984)====
[[File:Image auto de colección..jpg|alt=|thumb|1982 Ford Mustang coupé, Mexican market version]]
The third-generation Ford Mustang was manufactured in the Ford [[Cuautitlán Assembly|Cuautitlán Itzcalli plant]] (located in [[Mexico City]]) from 1979 to 1984.  Produced for sale in Mexico, the vehicles were produced in both hatchback and notchback coupe body configurations.  

From 1981 to 1984, Cuautitlán Assembly produced the Mustang using components from both the Mustang and Mercury Capri.  Along with the taillights of the Capri, the Mustangs were produced using the front fascia of the Capri (with Ford badging) from 1982 to 1983.  From 1983 to 1984, the facility produced the Mustang hatchback with front and rear fenders of the Capri, along with its "bubble-back" rear hatch.

{{Main article|Ford Capri (Australia)}}[[File:1991 Mercury Capri XR2 Turbo roadster, rear left.jpg|thumb|left|Mercury Capri convertible]]
For the 1991 model year, the Mercury Capri made its return to the Mercury division after a five-year hiatus.  To give Lincoln-Mercury a competitor for the [[Mazda MX-5|Mazda MX-5 Miata]] and [[Toyota MR2]], the Capri was released as two-door roadster. In a fashion similar to the first-generation Mercury Capri, the third-generation version is a [[captive import]]; produced by [[Ford Australia|Ford of Australia]] alongside its Ford Capri counterpart and the Ford Falcon, the Mercury Capri was intended for American exports. For the first time since 1978, the Mercury Capri was the first Mercury without any Ford counterpart in North America.  

Derived from the Australian [[Ford Laser]] (sold in the United States as the first-generation [[Mercury Tracer]]), the Ford Capri also shares drivetrain commonality with the [[Mazda 323]]. To adapt the Capri for North American sale, Lincoln-Mercury made several changes over the Australian-market Capri. Along with the addition of a driver-side airbag (required to meet passive restraint requirements), the dashboard was changed to non-metric gauges; Mercury Capris are fitted with body-color bumpers.  

While both two-door convertibles similar in size and price, the Mercury Capri and Mazda MX-5 featured major departures in powertrain and interior configurations, with the Capri adopting a front-wheel drive powertrain. While the MX-5 was strictly a two-seat vehicle, the Capri was a [[2+2 (car body style)|2+2]], with (small) rear seats.  Along with folding back seats (allowing access to the trunk), the Capri also offered the option of a removable hard top (similar to the MX-5).        

From 1991 to 1993, the Mercury Capri was sold with minimal revisions; for 1994, the Mercury Capri received the new taillamps and front and rear bumpers received by the Ford Capri in 1993.  During its entire production, the Mercury Capri was sold under two trim levels: base-trim and XR2, distinguished largely by powertrain. The base trim was equipped with a 100hp Mazda 1.6L DOHC inline-4; the XR2 was equipped with a turbocharged version of the 1.6L engine, rated at 132hp. A five-speed manual transmission was standard for both trims, with a four-speed automatic available on base-trim Capris. The XR2 came standard with a new suspension tune, better tires, and revised appearance.

The '''Mercury Meta One''' is a [[concept car]] that was created by [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]].  A four-door crossover sport-utility vehicle, the Meta One made its debut at the [[North American International Auto Show#2005|2005 North American International Auto Show]] in Detroit, Michigan.  The Meta One is notable for being the first concept vehicle designed with a [[Partial zero-emissions vehicle|PZEV]] [[Diesel-electric transmission#Concepts|diesel-hybrid powertrain]].&lt;ref name="FORD_OFF"&gt;"Mercury Meta One Concept Vehicle." ''Ford Motor Company''. February 4, 2007 {{cite web |url=http://www.mercuryvehicles.com/metaone |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060413163814/http://www.mercuryvehicles.com/metaone/ |archivedate=2006-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
Loosely based upon the body of the production [[Ford Taurus X|Ford Freestyle]], the Mercury Meta One was a luxury crossover SUV with four seats.  Serving as a testbed for in-vehicle technology, the Meta One featured an always-on [[Wi-Fi]] connection; along with the ability to connect handheld devices and the built in [[Sirius Satellite Radio]], it also allowed the on-board navigation system to deliver real-time updates for traffic and route conditions.&lt;ref name="FORD_OFF" /&gt;  Instead of a traditional instrument panel, the vehicle featured multiple computer displays that were reconfigurable to fit driver needs.&lt;ref name="FORD_OFF" /&gt;  A special design for the [[smart key]] allowed it to double as a [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDA]], allowing it to also store emergency contacts.

In collaboration with Volvo, the Mercury Meta One was designed with a number of safety technologies unseen on a production Ford Motor Company vehicle.  These included [[Lane departure warning system|lane departure control]] and [[Collision Mitigation Avoidance System|collision mitigation]] by pre-charging the brakes if an on-board camera and radar sensor senses the likelihood of an accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mercury Meta One Concept|url = http://www.supercars.net/cars/3059.html|website = www.supercars.net|accessdate = 2015-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Powertrain ==
The Meta One was powered by a 248&amp;nbsp;hp twin-[[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] diesel [[V6 engine|V6]]; the 2.7L engine was sourced from the Australian [[Ford Territory (Australia)|Ford Territory]] (sized similar to the Freestyle) and the [[LR3#Discovery 3 .2F LR3|Land Rover Discovery]] product lines.  Coupled with the continuously variable transmission (as used in the Freestyle) was an electric motor, providing start-stop technology to increase fuel economy.  The combined [[torque]] output of the powertrain was {{convert|431|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} ; it was 97% cleaner than the Tier I emissions standard for [[Nitrogen oxide#NOx|NOx]] .&lt;ref name="FORD_OFF" /&gt;  

While the technology has not been applied to diesel engines, the Ford [[Ford EcoBoost engine|EcoBoost]] family of gasoline engines has utilized turbocharging in the same manner in the effort to lower emissions while increasing power.  In place of a traditional V8 engine, the [[Ford Taurus SHO]] and [[Lincoln MKS]] utilize a 365&amp;nbsp;hp twin-turbocharged V6.

== Fate ==
Although sharing the architecture of the Ford Freestyle, the Meta One was not released as a production vehicle.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Neff, John. "UPDATE: Mercury Meta One not happening." ''AutoBlog'', October 20, 2006. February 4, 2007 [http://www.autoblog.com/2006/10/20/update-mercury-meta-one-not-happening].&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2006, during the development of the Ford Taurus X, prototype development mules were spotted using front bodywork of Meta One prototypes, leading to speculation that the Mercury division would be given a production form of the Meta One, possibly named either the Mercury Monticello or Mercury Magellan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/10/19/spy-shots-2009-magellan-meta-one/ | title=Spy Shots: 2009 Mercury Magellan (Meta One) | accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

As with its Ford Freestyle predecessor, the Ford Taurus X reached production without a Mercury (or Lincoln) counterpart.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Meta One's current location, or if it still exists, is unknown.

The '''Mercury Marquis''' is a model line of automobiles that was marketed by the [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] division of [[Ford Motor Company]].  Deriving its name from a [[Marquess|French nobility title]], the Marquis was sold across four generations from 1967 to 1986; through its entire production, the model line was the Mercury divisional counterpart of the [[Ford LTD (Americas)|Ford LTD]].  Initially introduced as the flagship Mercury range, the Marquis line was later expanded to include the [[Mercury Grand Marquis]] slotted above it.       

Mercury marketed the first three generations of the Marquis as a full-size sedan (alongside the [[Mercury Colony Park]] [[station wagon]]).  The fourth generation was a mid-size [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]], as Mercury split the Marquis and Grand Marquis into distinct product lines for 1983.  As Ford transitioned its product ranges to [[front-wheel drive]], the Marquis was withdrawn after the 1986 model year, replaced by the [[Mercury Sable|Sable]] (the Mercury counterpart of the [[Ford Taurus (first generation)|Ford Taurus]]).     

For its first three generations, the Marquis was produced in [[Hapeville, Georgia]] ([[Atlanta Assembly]]), [[Hazelwood, Missouri]] ([[St. Louis Assembly Plant|St. Louis Assembly]]), and [[Pico Rivera, California]] ([[Los Angeles Assembly]]); the fourth generation was produced by Atlanta Assembly and in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]] ([[Chicago Assembly]]).

For 1967, Mercury introduced two hardtop model lines above the Park Lane to serve as the counterpart of the [[Ford LTD (Americas)|Ford LTD]].  The [[Mercury Park Lane#Mercury Park Lane Brougham|(Park Lane) Brougham]] was a four-door, with the Marquis offered solely as a two-door.  While all full-size Mercury two-doors were hardtops, the Marquis was fitted with a standard vinyl roof (giving it a wider C-pillar).      

While sharing a roofline with the Ford LTD, the Marquis differed from its Ford counterpart from the use of higher-specification interior trim (wood trim in place of simulated wood, optional leather unavailable on the LTD).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1967%20Mercury/album_001/1967%20Mercury-05.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1967 Mercury/album_001|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1967_Ford/1967_Ford_Full_Size_Brochure/1967%20Ford%20Full%20Size-06-07.html|title=Directory Index: Ford/1967_Ford/1967_Ford_Full_Size_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with other Mercury sedans, the Marquis was built on a 123-inch wheelbase (4 inches longer than the LTD).      

In contrast to the full-width bench seat of other Mercury lines, the Marquis was fitted with "Twin Comfort Lounge" front seats.  Designed as a 50/50 split bench seat, the design combined the 3-passenger capacity of a bench seat with the individual legroom adjustment of bucket seats.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In various forms, the design would gradually replace traditional bench seats in many American cars during the 1970s and 1980s.    

=== Mechanical details ===
For 1967, the standard engine for the Marquis was a 410 cubic-inch [[Ford FE engine#410|Marauder]] V8, producing 330 hp.  Exclusive to the division, the Marauder V8 was optional across the full-size Mercury line.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1967%20Mercury/album_001/1967%20Mercury-31.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1967 Mercury/album_001|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 4-speed manual transmission was standard, with a 3-speed automatic as an option.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  

For 1968, the 410 was replaced by a 390 cubic-inch [[Ford FE engine#390|Marauder Super 390]] V8, producing 315 hp; shared with the Park Lane and Brougham, the engine was optional for lower-trim full-size Mercurys.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1968%20Mercury/1968%20Mercury%20Full%20Line%20Brochure/image52.html|title=1968 Mercury Full Line Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 3-speed manual replaced the previous 4-speed, with the automatic returning as an option.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  

As an option for both years, the 428 cubic-inch [[Ford FE engine#428|Super Marauder]] V8 was offered, producing 345 hp&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;; for 1968, the engine was retuned to 340 hp.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

}}For 1969, Mercury underwent a revision of its full-size range.  Serving as the successor to the Brougham and Park Lane, the second-generation Marquis was expanded to a full range of body styles, slotted above the Monterey.  For 1975, the full-size Mercury range was reduced solely to the Marquis (including the Brougham and Grand Marquis trims).    

In Canada, the Meteor brand marketed the Marquis as its flagship Meteor LeMoyne from 1969 to 1970.  After the 1976 closure of the brand, Ford Canada continued the use of the Meteor name within Mercury, selling a Marquis Meteor as a base trim level for 1977 and 1978.  

=== Chassis specifications    ===
The second-generation Mercury Marquis shares its chassis with the full-size Ford model range introduced in 1969, using a rear-wheel drive perimeter frame chassis.  Following a tradition starting in 1961, Mercury sedans used a longer wheelbase (124 inches) than Fords (121 inches, also used by Ford/Mercury station wagons).  For 1970, the chassis was adopted by the Lincoln division for the Continental on a 127-inch wheelbase.                  

Carried over from the previous-generation full-size chassis, the suspension was a 3-link [[Beam axle|live rear axle]] and [[Double wishbone suspension|double wishbone]] [[Independent suspension|independent front suspension]] (with a front stabilizer bar); coil springs were fitted to at all four corners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1978%20Mercury/album/1978%20Mercury%20Marquis-09.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1978 Mercury/album|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;             

Front disc brake and rear drum brakes were standard; power brakes became standard in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1970%20Mercury/album/70Merc26.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1970 Mercury/album|date=|publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com|accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1971%20Mercury/1971%20Mercury%20Full%20Line%20Brochure/image4.html|title=1971 Mercury Full Line Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2020-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For 1973, "Sure-Track", an early form of [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock braking]], was introduced as an option&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1973%20Mercury/1973%20Mercury%20Full%20Line%20Brochure/1973%20Mercury-34.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1973 Mercury/1973 Mercury Full Line Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;; four-wheel disc brakes became an option for 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1975_Mercury/1975%20Lincoln%20Mercury%20Brochure/image6.html|title=1975 Lincoln Mercury Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;           

==== Powertrain ====
For the second generation of the Marquis, Mercury revised the powertrain line. Along with ending its Marauder branding for engines, Mercury replaced both the 390 and 428 FE-series engines with a 429-cubic inch [[Ford 385 engine|385-series]] V8.  A short-stroke version of the Lincoln 460 V8, the Marquis offered the 429 with 2-barrel and 4-barrel carburetors (320 and 360 hp, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1969%20Mercury/1969_Mercury_Full_Size_Brochure/1969%20Mercury%20Full%20Size-32.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1969 Mercury/1969_Mercury_Full_Size_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The manual transmission was discontinued, paired solely with the 3-speed [[Ford C6 transmission|Ford C6]] heavy-duty automatic.  During the 1972 model year, the Marquis received the 460 from Lincoln as an option&lt;ref name=oldbroch23&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1972%20Mercury/album/1972%20Mercury-23.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1972 Mercury/album|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;; for 1974, the 460 replaced the 429 outright.

As the 1970s progressed, Mercury began efforts to improve emissions and fuel economy of its full-size range; following the discontinuation of the Monterey and the introduction of the Grand Marquis, smaller-displacement [[Ford 335 engine|Ford 335]] engines replaced the 460 as the standard engine offering.  For 1975&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1975_Mercury/1975%20Lincoln%20Mercury%20Brochure/image17.html|title=1975 Lincoln Mercury Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the 402 cubic-inch [[Ford 335 engine#400|Ford 400]] V8 was introduced (largely as a successor to the 429), with the 351 cubic-inch [[Ford 335 engine#351M|Ford 351M]] V8 becoming the standard engine for the Marquis in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1978%20Mercury/album/1978%20Mercury%20Marquis-08.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1978 Mercury/album|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In California and for "high-altitude" use, the 400 remained standard equipment; regardless of usage, the 460 (standard on the Marquis Brougham and Grand Marquis through 1977) remained available as an option until the end of the generation.&lt;ref name="Odin"&gt;Odin, L.C. ''A concise guide to the Ford and Mercury full-size automobile production 1969-1978''. Belvedere Publishing, 2016. ASIN: B01HE91Y4K.&lt;/ref&gt;  The C6 transmission remained paired to the 460, with the 400 and 351M using the lighter-duty FMX transmission.

=== Body design ===
The second-generation Marquis was expanded from the previous two-door hardtop to a full range of body styles, inheriting  the four-door hardtop from the Brougham and four-door sedan and two-door convertible from the Park Lane series.  Under the 1969 rebranding of Ford and Mercury station wagons, the [[Mercury Colony Park|Colony Park]] station wagon became part of the Marquis line.&lt;ref name="Odin" /&gt;  

For 1969 and 1970, the [[Mercury Marauder]] made its return, unofficially replacing the S-55.  Designed as a competitor for the Oldsmobile Toronado and Buick Riviera, the Marauder was a fastback coupe combining the front bodywork of the Marquis with the roofline of the [[Ford Galaxie#1969%E2%80%931974|Ford XL/Ford Galaxie 500 SportsRoof]].&lt;ref name="Odin" /&gt;; along with the Colony Park, the Marauder was built on the 121-inch wheelbase used by Ford.    

During its production, the second generation underwent two updates, including a 1971 mid-cycle revision of the exterior and interior. In 1973, to coincide with the addition with 5-mph bumpers, the exterior and interior underwent a complete redesign, with the two-door hardtop receiving a different roofline from the Ford LTD.  

==== 1969-1972 ====
For 1969, the Mercury full-size range was redesigned (alongside its Ford counterparts); the Marquis remained a counterpart of the Ford LTD model range.  Alongside the addition of four-door sedans, the Marquis line gained a station wagon, as the Colony Park woodgrained station wagon was integrated into the model line.     

While the Marquis four-door shared much of its roofline with its Ford counterpart, the two-door hardtop was given its own roofline.  The front fascia of the Marquis adopted many elements from the Lincoln Continental, including its hood and grille proportions and chrome-topped fenders; the Marquis, LTD/Galaxie/Custom, and Continental each received their own horizontal taillamp design.  Initially sharing its [[Hidden headlamp|hidden headlamps]] with the LTD, the usage of the design largely became exclusive to Lincoln-Mercury flagships after 1970, including the Marquis, Lincoln Continental, and Mark-series (the LTD Landau became the only Ford to use the configuration).  The system was vacuum-operated, closing the headlight covers using a vacuum canister powered by the engine; as a fail-safe. the system was designed to retract the headlight covers following any vacuum loss.&lt;ref name="Odin" /&gt;   

For 1970, the Marquis saw few visible changes to the exterior and interior.  In compliance with federal safety regulations, all full-size Mercurys received a new steering column, with a [[Rim Blow|rim-blow steering wheel]] replacing the previous horn ring design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1970%20Mercury/album/70Merc11.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1970 Mercury/album|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alongside the woodgrained Colony Park, a Marquis station wagon (without wood paneling) was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1970%20Mercury/1970%20Mercury%20Wagons%20Brochure/image2.html|title=1970 Mercury Wagons Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

For 1971, the Marquis underwent a revision of the exterior and interior; the convertible body style was dropped (along with the Marauder fastback).  Distinguished by the elimination of vent windows and framed door glass (for sedans and station wagons), Mercury saw the introduction of the "pillared hardtop", a sedan combining a thin B-pillar and frameless door glass (to mimic the appearance of a pillarless design).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1971%20Mercury/1971%20Mercury%20Full%20Line%20Prestige%20Brochure%20(Rev)/image3.html|title=1971 Mercury Full Line Prestige Brochure (Rev)|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The revision also included the use of [[fender skirts]] and wraparound taillamps. The dashboard underwent a redesign, clustering the instruments and controls closer to the steering wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1972%20Mercury/album/1972%20Mercury-03.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1972 Mercury/album|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

For 1972, the grille shifted to an egg-crate design (with a similar panel between the taillamps). In line with federal mandates, the Marquis adopted seatbelt warning buzzers.&lt;ref name="Odin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=oldbroch23/&gt; For the first time, the model line introduced a power sunroof option (requiring the selection of a vinyl roof).&lt;ref name="Odin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1972%20Mercury/album/1972%20Mercury-04.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1972 Mercury/album|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== 1973-1978 ====
For 1973, the Marquis underwent an extensive mid-cycle revision.  Largely coinciding with the addition of [[Bumper (car)|5-mph bumpers]] for the front and rear fascias, the roofline of the Marquis saw a complete redesign.&lt;ref name="Odin" /&gt;  Though distinguished further from the Lincoln Continental, the four-door Marquis shared its roofline with the Ford LTD; in contrast to the LTD, the two-door remained a hardtop with retractable side windows (enlarged for better visibility).  Alongside the four-door hardtop, the four-door sedan and station wagon were marketed as "pillared hardtops" (produced with thin chromed B-pillars, allowing frameless door glass).  The interior saw a revision of the trim and seats, with a redesign of the dashboard (clustering the instruments behind the steering wheel and the secondary controls to the center of the dashboard&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1973%20Mercury/1973%20Mercury%20Full%20Line%20Brochure/1973%20Mercury-08.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1973 Mercury/1973 Mercury Full Line Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  

For 1974, the grille underwent a redesign (nearly matching that of the Lincoln Continental), shifting to a vertically-oriented layout and eliminating the egg-crate trim of the headlamp covers.  Following their addition to the front fascia, the Marquis received 5-mph rear bumpers.  In response to pending safety regulations, the four-door hardtop was offered for the last time.    

For 1975, the front fascia saw several revisions, with a larger radiator-style grille (with the "Mercury" block lettering replaced by a script above the left headlamp); in contrast to the Ford LTD Landau and the Lincoln Continental, the headlamp doors were revised with chrome border trim and a crest emblem.  The rear fascia received padded vinyl trim (body color or contrasting) between the taillamps.  While Ford and Lincoln added B-pillars (and [[Opera window|opera windows]]) to their two-door sedans, Mercury retained its hardtop roofline.   

For 1976 though 1978, the Marquis saw few visible changes; in 1976, a Landau vinyl roof option was introduced for Brougham and Grand Marquis two-doors, while all versions of the Marquis were marketed as "Ride-Engineered"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1977_Mercury/1977_Lincoln-Mercury_Foldout/1977%20Lincoln%20Mercury%20Foldout-01.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1977_Mercury/1977_Lincoln-Mercury_Foldout|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (promoting its successful ride comparisons against more expensive European sedans of the time).  For 1978, the Marquis was given a redesigned grille, retaining a similar radiator-style design.   

Alongside the 1978 [[Chrysler New Yorker]] two-door, the 1978 Mercury Marquis was the final pillarless two-door hardtop (with retractable rear side windows) offered by an American automobile manufacturer.

=== Trim ===
In 1969, Mercury adopted the Brougham name from the Park Lane series, continuing its use as the highest Mercury trim line.  Following the discontinuation of the Monterey after 1974, all full-size Mercury sedans took on the Marquis nameplate.&lt;ref name="Odin" /&gt;  Introduced as an interior option package for the Marquis Brougham in 1974&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1974%20Mercury/1974_Lincoln-Mercury_Brochure/1974%20Lincoln-Mercury-08.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1974 Mercury/1974_Lincoln-Mercury_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Grand Marquis became a stand-alone trim line above the Brougham for 1975.

From 1969 to 1978, the Colony Park was included as part of the Marquis model range, with Mercury offering a non-woodgrain Marquis station wagon.  {{Clear}}

}}For the 1979 model year, the third-generation Marquis was introduced as the full-size Ford and Mercury model lines underwent [[Downsize (automobile)|downsizing]].  Seventeen inches shorter and over 1,000 pounds lighter than its 1978 predecessor, the 1979 Marquis traded places with the Cougar as the longest Mercury vehicle (prior to its own downsizing for 1980).  For the first time since 1955, the full-size Mercury station wagon was produced with a curb weight under 4,000 pounds.

Although the redesign of the Marquis resulted in an exterior footprint smaller than that of the intermediate-segment Mercury Cougar sedan, the Marquis gained interior space over its predecessor through a taller roofline (contributing to improved visibility through increased glass area&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1979%20Mercury/1979%20Mercury%20Marquis%20Brochure/image2.html|title=1979 Mercury Marquis Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and redesigned seats.

For 1983, the full-size Marquis was rebranded as the Grand Marquis; the third-generation Marquis design continued production through the 1991 model year.

=== Chassis specifications ===
The third-generation Marquis is based upon the rear-wheel drive [[Ford Panther platform]].  Developed for the downsizing of the full-size Ford Motor Company product ranges, the architecture is an evolution of the previous-generation chassis (introduced in 1969).  For the first time in the history of the division, Mercury shared a common wheelbase with Ford, as both the Marquis and its Ford LTD counterpart adopted a 114.3 inch wheelbase (a 9.7 reduction from the previous 124 inches; 121 inches from Ford and all station wagons).  For 1980, the use of the chassis was expanded as Lincoln introduced the downsized Continental and the Continental Mark VI.

The suspension design was revised for the Panther chassis; a double-wishbone independent front suspension returned with a live rear axle, but the 3-link rear suspension was replaced with a 4-link design (coil springs remained for all four wheels).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1979%20Mercury/1979%20Mercury%20Marquis%20Brochure/image9.html|title=1979 Mercury Marquis Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The anti-lock brake and four-wheel disc brake options were dropped, with the Panther platform receiving upgraded front disc brakes; power brakes were standard.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Powertrain ====
The third-generation Marquis marked the introduction of a powertrain lineup completely new to the model line.  As a central part of downsizing, the Panther chassis adopted smaller-displacement engines in the interest of fuel economy; in contrast to its Chrysler and General Motors counterparts, a V8 engine remained standard equipment for the Marquis.  The 351M, 400, and 460 V8 engines were dropped, with the Marquis now powered by [[Ford Windsor engine|Windsor small-block V8]] engines.

As Ford transitioned to metric engine displacement designations at the end of the 1970s, the standard engine for the Marquis was now a 4.9L V8&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; (rounded up to 5.0L, to distinguish it from the 4.9L I6); the rebranded 302 V8 was shared with the Cougar, Monarch, and Zephyr.  A 5.8L V8 (the 351 from the Cougar XR7) was offered as an option.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  For 1980, a 4.2L V8 (a smaller-bore version of the 4.9L engine) became the standard engine on base-trim versions of the Marquis, with the 5.0L V8 shifting to the Brougham and Grand Marquis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1982%20Mercury/1982%20Mercury%20Marquis%20Brochure/image8.html|title=1982 Mercury Marquis Brochure|last=Ristic-Petrovic|first=Dusan|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1981, a 4.2L V8 was added as the standard engine on base-trim versions of the Marquis, with the 5.0L engine offered on four-door versions of the Marquis Brougham and Grand Marquis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In 1982, the 5.8L V8 was dropped from the Marquis line in the U.S but continued to be offered in Canada.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  In 1979-81 the 351M was offered in Canadian spec cars with the optional heavy-duty towing package only paired to the C6 transmission.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}  When introduced for 1979, both V8 engines were paired with a 3-speed [[Ford C4 transmission|SelectShift]] automatic.  For 1980, the Marquis received the 4-speed [[Ford AOD transmission|AOD]] overdrive automatic transmission as standard equipment with the 4.2L V8 and was offered as an option with the 5.0L and 5.8L engines.  For 1982, the AOD became the sole transmission for all three engines.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grandmarq.net/tiggie/Box%20History/History.htm|title=The Official Box Panther History of GMN|website=www.grandmarq.net|access-date=2019-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction with the downsizing of the model line, the third-generation Marquis and the adoption of the Panther chassis transitioned towards increased parts commonality between Ford and Lincoln-Mercury full-size lines.  Along with a common wheelbase (for the first time), the Marquis and the Ford LTD shared nearly their entire bodyshell; many non-visible components were shared with the Lincoln Continental/Town Car and Continental Mark VI.  Distinguished primarily by trim, the LTD and Marquis shared a common roofline (the Marquis 4-door is distinguished by a full-length vinyl roof&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1979%20Mercury/1979%20Mercury%20Marquis%20Brochure/image8.html|title=1979 Mercury Marquis Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;).   The two-door hardtop and four-door pillared hardtop were replaced by sedans with fully framed door glass with fixed [[quarter glass]] in the rear side doors (each model had its own door design).

While both model lines shared a common bodyshell, several detail changes were made by stylists to distinguish Ford and Mercury full-size sedans from one another.  While the LTD received an egg-crate grille design, the Marquis was given a vertically-oriented grille (similar to the 1978 Marquis and the 1980 Cougar XR7) and parking lamps similar to the 1975-1978 Marquis; hidden headlamps were abandoned.  In line with the previous generation, the Marquis received full-width taillamps (bordering the license plate).  In a feature adopted from the Mark series, the Marquis was styled with (non-functional) fender louvers behind the front wheels (and vents in the front bumper).  Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury each received its own dashboard design; Mercury received an instrument panel with square white-face instrument bezels.   In 1982, the Marquis introduced a digital trip computer (an option, replacing the analog clock in the dashboard).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

During its production, the third-generation Marquis saw few major revisions. For 1981, the air vents were removed from the front bumper (and from the fenders in 1982).&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Trim ===
The third-generation Marquis carried over its trim nomenclature from the previous generation.  Alongside the standard Marquis, Mercury also sold the Marquis Brougham and the top-trim Grand Marquis.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Alongside a body-color Marquis station wagon, the woodgrain-trim Colony Park wagon made its return (trimmed as a standard Marquis and as a Grand Marquis&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;).    In Canada, the Marquis Meteor continued as the base trim through 1981 (marking the final use of the Meteor nameplate by Ford).  From 1981 to 1982, Mercury offered a police-use version of the Marquis, derived from the standard trim four-door sedan.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Along with its Ford LTD counterpart, police-use versions of the Marquis were fitted with a model-specific speedometer&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; and a 165-hp version of the 5.8L V8.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;   {{Clear}}

For 1983, the fourth-generation Marquis was introduced as Mercury shifted the nameplate to the midsize segment to replace the slow-selling Cougar sedan and station wagon.  Within Mercury, the Cougar XR-7 was replaced by a redesigned two-door Cougar, with all full-size Mercury sedans adopting the Grand Marquis nameplate.

Effectively downsizing the model range for a second time, the 1983 Marquis shed nearly 9 inches in wheelbase, nearly 16 inches in length, and up to 900 pounds of curb weight (dependent on powertrain and bodystyle).&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1983%20Mercury/1983_Mercury_Marquis_Brochure/1983%20Mercury%20Marquis-11.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1983 Mercury/1983_Mercury_Marquis_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with previous generations, the fourth-generation Marquis was the Mercury counterpart of the Ford LTD (in 1983, rebranded to replace the Granada).

Coinciding with the design change, production of the model line shifted from St. Louis Assembly to Chicago Assembly (Atlanta Assembly adopted production of the fourth-generation Marquis).  Ford Venezuela marketed the Mercury Marquis (under slight trim revisions) as the Ford Cougar from 1983 to 1985.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifhp97/35089033676/|title=1983 Ford Cougar Brougham (Venezuela)|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Ford transitioned its car platforms to front-wheel drive, the Marquis was discontinued after the 1986 model year, replaced by the [[Mercury Sable]].

=== Chassis specifications ===
The fourth-generation Marquis is based upon the rear-wheel drive [[Ford Fox platform]].  Initially developed for compact sedans, the architecture was expanded for a wide range of Ford and Lincoln-Mercury vehicles; as a multiple-wheelbase design, the Fox platform was introduced for the mid-size segment for 1980.  A 105.6 inch wheelbase&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; is shared between the Marquis, Ford LTD, and the Ford Granada/Mercury Cougar.  The Fox architecture uses a unibody chassis (in contrast to body-on-frame design used by full-size Ford and Lincoln-Mercury vehicles).

In line with other Fox-platform vehicles, the Marquis uses a front suspension of [[MacPherson strut|MacPherson struts]] with a four-link live rear axle (using coil springs).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1983%20Mercury/1983_Mercury_Marquis_Brochure/1983%20Mercury%20Marquis-10.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1983 Mercury/1983_Mercury_Marquis_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with the previous generation, the Marquis used front disc brakes with rear drum brakes.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Powertrain ====
The fourth-generation Marquis was produced with four separate engines over its production.  Sedans were fitted with a 2.3L inline-4 as standard equipment; a propane-fuel version of the engine was an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1983%20Mercury/1983_Mercury_Marquis_Brochure/1983%20Mercury%20Marquis-12.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1983 Mercury/1983_Mercury_Marquis_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Station wagons were sold only with six-cylinder engines; a 3.3L inline-6 (dating back to the Falcon/Comet) was the standard engine for station wagons and optional on sedans.  A 3.8L V6 was optional on both body styles, replacing the inline-6 entirely for 1984.  Sold only in Canada from 1984 to 1985, the Marquis LTS was powered by the 5.0L HO V8 (shared with the Mustang).

A 4-speed manual was standard with the 2.3L engine, but was deleted after 1983; subsequent production used the previously optional 3-speed [[Ford C3 transmission|C3]] automatic.  The 3.3L six was paired solely with a 3-speed [[Ford C4 transmission#C5|C5]] automatic. The 3.8L V6 used two different transmissions: the 4-speed [[Ford AOD transmission|AOD]] automatic was standard for 1983, becoming an option for 1984; the 3-speed C5 became standard for 1984 (replacing the AOD entirely for 1985).  All examples with the 5.0L V8 (the LTS) used the 4-speed AOD automatic.

=== Body design ===
The fourth-generation Marquis was produced as a four-door sedan and as a five-door station wagon (the two-door was discontinued, with the Cougar becoming the sole Mercury mid-size coupe.  Sharing its entire bodyshell with its Ford LTD, the Marquis was distinguished by its own grille, taillamps, and parking lamp lenses.  For the 1985 model year, the Marquis underwent a minor exterior revision; along with revised taillamps, Mercury lettering in the grille was replaced with a centered crest emblem.

The interior of the Marquis and LTD was largely shared between the two model lines (with the exception of the interior door panels).  To save development costs, the Marquis retained the dashboard design of the Cougar XR-7 coupe (mixing wood and silver trim), adopting its electronic instrument panel option.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1983%20Mercury/1983_Mercury_Marquis_Brochure/1983%20Mercury%20Marquis-12.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1983 Mercury/1983_Mercury_Marquis_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adopted from the full-size Marquis and the Cougar XR-7, the Marquis continued the use of an electronic trip computer.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Trim ===
The fourth-generation Marquis sedan was produced in two trim levels: the base Marquis and the Marquis Brougham.  The station wagon was not available under the Brougham trim level; a woodgrain exterior trim option was offered (dropping the [[Mercury Villager#Etymology|Villager]] trim name).

During the 1984 model year, the Marquis LTS was introduced.  Sold only in Canada, the LTS was a counterpart of the [[Ford LTD (Americas)#LTD%20LX|Ford LTD LX]].  Powered by 165 hp 5.0L V8, the LTS and LX adopted suspension and brake components from the police-package version of the LTD.  After the 1985 model year, the trim was discontinued; only 134 were produced (making it one of the rarest vehicles ever sold by Mercury).{{Clear}}

== Discontinuation ==
For the 1986 model year, Mercury introduced the front-wheel drive Mercury Sable, replacing the Marquis as its mid-size model line; both models were sold concurrently through the 1986 model year.  The final example was produced by Atlanta Assembly on December, 13, 1985 and by Chicago Assembly on January 3, 1986.  Originally introduced as the third-generation Marquis in 1979, the design of the Grand Marquis was produced nearly unchanged through the 1991 model year.  After an extensive redesign (though retaining the Panther chassis) for 1992, the Grand Marquis remained in production for 19 model years, becoming the final vehicle produced for the brand in January 2011.     {{Clear}}
== Appearance in media ==
On the final two seasons of CBS comedy series ''[[Green Acres]],'' metallic gold 1969 and 1970 Marquis convertibles (very low production) were used by [[Oliver Wendell Douglas]] ([[Eddie Albert]]), replacing the previous 1965-1967 Lincoln Continental convertible.    

The drama series [[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|''Hawaii Five-O'']] featured a black 1967 Marquis 2-door hardtop driven by [[Steve McGarrett]] ([[Jack Lord]]) in the pilot episode; stock footage of the vehicle was used for later episodes of the series.

The '''Mercury Mountaineer''' is a mid-size luxury [[sport utility vehicle]] (SUV) that was sold by [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] from 1996 until 2010.  Sharing many of its features with the [[Ford Explorer]], the vehicles were virtually identical in terms of hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edmunds.com/mercury/mountaineer/|title=Used 2010 Mercury Mountaineer Prices, Reviews, and Pictures|website=Edmunds}}&lt;/ref&gt; Externally, they were styled somewhat differently, and the Mountaineer was positioned with a more upscale interior, with the Mountaineer's [[suggested retail price|MSRP]] coming in at $1,000–$6,000 more than the Explorer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2001/12/10/1210test.html Forbes, 2000 Mountaineer review]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was last redesigned for the 2006 model year with a new frame, looking very similar to its previous model.

Some controversy resulted after the media highlighted a number of rollovers involving Explorers and Mountaineers fitted with Firestone tires. The Mountaineer has been praised for its excellent handling and stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216143700/http://www.edmunds.com/mercury/mountaineer/2007/review.html|title=2007 Mercury Mountaineer SUV Review - Edmunds.com|date=February 16, 2007|website=web.archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mountaineer was never sold in Canada.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} As part of the discontinuation of the Mercury brand, production of the Mountaineer ended in late 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2010/07/12/mercury-production-to-cease-in-late-september/#comments "Mercury production to cease in late September?"] from Autoblog (July 12, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Wiki cars 076.jpg|left|thumb|Ford Explorer Limited (1993), indirect Ford predecessor of the Mercury Mountaineer]]
In 1990, General Motors introduced the [[Oldsmobile Bravada]] sport-utility vehicle, derived from the four-door [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer]].  Though far lower in price, the Bravada was marketed as a competitor to the [[Range Rover]] (and the later [[Land Rover Discovery]]) and [[Toyota Land Cruiser]].  While sharing its body with the Blazer, Oldsmobile differentiated the Bravada with the use of model-specific trim and a dedicated all-wheel drive powertrain (in place of part-time four-wheel drive).  For 1993, Jeep briefly revived the long-running Grand Wagoneer nameplate as part of the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] model line, using [[Woodie (car body style)|woodgrain exterior trim]] and a leather interior; limited sales led to its cancellation after a single model year.

As a response to the Bravada and the Grand Wagoneer, Ford introduced the 1993 Ford Explorer Limited in 1992.  In contrast to the outdoors-themed Explorer Eddie Bauer, the Limited was geared towards on-road driving; it was fitted with all-wheel drive in place of traditional four-wheel drive.  The Limited was also distinguished by monochromatic body trim, body-color bumpers, and chrome wheels.

As part of the redesign of the Explorer for 1995, the Limited remained part of the Explorer lineup, with the segment gaining additional competitors through the use of badge engineering.  For 1996, the [[Acura SLX]] (Isuzu Trooper), [[Infiniti QX4]] (Nissan Pathfinder), and the larger [[Lexus LX450]] (Toyota Land Cruiser) were introduced together.

As these brands, along with Oldsmobile, competed more directly with luxury brands than the Ford model line, Ford Motor Company sought to develop SUVs for its Lincoln-Mercury division.  To minimize model overlap, Mercury was chosen to sell a version of the mid-size Ford Explorer, while Lincoln would sell a version of the then-upcoming full-size [[Ford Expedition]].

[[File:1997-Mercury-Mountaineer.jpg|left|thumb|1997 Mercury Mountaineer]]
[[File:'97 Mercury Mountaineer V8 -- Rear.jpg|left|thumb|1997 Mercury Mountaineer]]
The Mercury Mountaineer began production in April 1996&lt;ref&gt;fordauthority.com/fmc/ford-motor-company-plants-facilities/ford-motor-company-usa-plants-facilities/ford-motor-company-louisville-assembly-plant-louisville-kentucky-usa/&lt;/ref&gt; as a 1997 model.  As with the Ford Explorer Limited, the Mercury Mountaineer was offered only in a four-door body configuration.  After its first year, sales of the Mountaineer fell short of Lincoln-Mercury sales projections.  Following several revisions in 1997 and 1998, the Mountaineer would go on to become the third-best selling vehicle in the Mercury division, behind only the Sable and the Grand Marquis.

=== Body ===
At its launch, the Mercury Mountaineer was closest in appearance to the Ford Explorer XLT, though trimmed between the Explorer Eddie Bauer and Explorer Limited.  To differentiate it from its Ford counterpart, the Mountaineer was styled with a distinct dark-gray lower body color scheme; while visually similar to the Explorer, the Mountaineer adopted the chrome waterfall grille styling of the Grand Marquis.  While the taillights were model-specific, the rear hatch and bumper were shared with the European-export version of the Explorer.

As part of a 1998 model revision, the Mountaineer was given a model-specific grille and headlights, larger wheels, and a new rear hatch design.

=== Chassis ===
The 1997-2001 Mercury Mountaineer shares the chassis of the four-door Ford Explorer, following its 1995 redesign.  Though heavily based upon the first-generation Ford Ranger, the sport-utility vehicles are wider and are based on a separate wheelbase.  As with the Ford Explorer, the Mountaineer is fitted with fully independent wishbone front suspension.

For 1997, the Mercury Mountaineer was fitted with a 215hp 5.0L V8 with a 4-speed automatic transmission. For 1998, the 205hp 4.0L V6 SOHC was offered as an option. Like the Ford Explorer, the V8 engine was mated to either rear-wheel drive or full time all-wheel drive (viscous coupling center differential); part-time four-wheel drive was not available with the V8 engine. The V6 Mountaineer or Explorer were offered either as rear-wheel drive or [[ControlTrac]] with "Auto", "High" and "Low" modes.

=== Trim ===
The first-generation Mercury Mountaineer was introduced in a single trim level, offering many optional features of the Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer and Limited as standard.  For 1998, Mercury introduced a V6-engined version of the Mountaineer to expand its price range.  Though including a different powertrain, Mercury chose to offer largely the same features on both versions.

For the 2002 model year, the second-generation Mercury Mountaineer was introduced as a counterpart to the third-generation Ford Explorer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.2002mountaineer.com/nojavascript.asp |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 6, 2001 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010506235803/http://www.2002mountaineer.com/nojavascript.asp |archive-date=May 6, 2001 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previewed by a concept vehicle at the [[Los Angeles Auto Show#2000|2000 Los Angeles Auto Show]], the 2002 Mercury Mountaineer marked the introduction of a new design language for the Mercury line, highlighted by a silver waterfall grille and silver-trimmed taillamps.  In various forms, style elements of the Mountaineer would appear across the Mercury line, including the Grand Marquis, Montego, Milan, Monterey, and Mariner.

As part of the redesign, the Mountaineer was given further differentiation from the Explorer; while sharing the same roofline and doors, much of the lower sheetmetal was different, with the Mountaineer having different front fenders and hood, front and rear bumpers, liftgate, and taillamps.

Sharing a chassis with the third-generation Ford Explorer, the Mountaineer was fitted with four-wheel independent suspension.  Sharing the 4.0L V6 of its predecessor, the second-generation Mountaineer also was fitted with the 4.6L V8 engine option of the Explorer, with four-wheel drive and all-wheel drive optional powertrain layouts; a 5-speed automatic transmission was standard.

In line with other Mercury models, the Mountaineer expanded from a single trim level to a base Convenience trim and a deluxe Premier trim; slotted above the Explorer Limited, the Mountaineer Premier offered features including a rear TV/DVD player, rear ceiling air vents, chrome exhaust tip and roof rack, and body-color bumpers.{{clear}}

For the 2006 model year, Ford redesigned its mid-size SUVs.  While its [[Ford U platform#U2|U251 platform]] was all-new, the third-generation Mountaineer followed on with the success of its predecessor by retaining nearly its entire exterior, unlike the Explorer.  For the 2006 Mountaineer, the exterior redesign featured clear lens taillamps, turn signal repeaters on the front fenders, larger wheels, satin silver trim on the sideview mirrors and bumpers; the Mercury logos on the grille and tailgate were enlarged.

Since the discontinuation of the [[Lincoln Aviator]] left the Mountaineer as the top nameplate of the Ford mid-size SUV model lineup, much of the attention of the redesign was focused in the interior trim and features to better differentiate it from the Explorer Eddie Bauer and Limited.  Carried over from the Lincoln Aviator was the option of a DVD-based navigation system with voice control; this system would be unavailable on the Explorer until 2008.  As an option, power retracting running boards (as seen on the Lincoln Navigator) were a new feature.

As with all Mountaineers since 2001, a 210&amp;nbsp;hp [[Ford Cologne V6 engine#SOHC|4.0L SOHC V6]] was the standard engine.  As with the Explorer, the 292&amp;nbsp;hp [[Ford Modular engine#4.6L#3-valve|4.6L Modular 24-valve V8]] was an option.  V6 Mountaineers used a 5-speed 5R55W automatic transmission.  For V8 models, Ford developed an all-new 6-speed transmission based on a ZF design; the 6R automatic was fitted to all V8 Explorers and Mountaineers.

During its production, this generation saw relatively few functional changes.  In 2008, side curtain airbags became standard.  On the outside, the ''"MOUNTAINEER"'' lettering was deleted from the front doors.  Due to reliability issues, the retracting running boards were discontinued.  For 2009, versions of the Mountaineer configured for towing were upgraded as trailer sway control was made standard.  To potentially save fuel for drivers, the navigation system was given upgrades, including traffic flow monitoring and live updates on gasoline prices from nearby service stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edmunds.com/mercury/mountaineer/2009/review/|title=2009 Mercury Mountaineer Review &amp; Ratings|website=Edmunds}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For 2010, Ford's [[MyKey]] was added as a standard feature on all trim levels; it is a programmable security system designed for vehicles owned by multiple drivers.

== Discontinuation ==
Following the June 2010 announcement by Ford Motor Company to shelve the Mercury brand, 2010 would be the end of Mountaineer production; the final vehicle was produced on October 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=32749 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514121635/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=32749 |archivedate=2011-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the Milan, Mariner, and Grand Marquis, the Mountaineer was not produced for a short 2011 model year due to the 2011 redesign and resizing to a [[crossover (automobile)|crossover]] of the Ford Explorer.  The third-best selling vehicle of the division in 2000, the Mountaineer was the worst-selling Mercury ten years later.  One replacement for the Mountaineer was the [[Lincoln MKT]], the luxury counterpart to the 5th-generation Explorer. {{clear}}

==Firestone tire controversy==
{{main|Firestone vs Ford Motor Company controversy}}

In May 2000, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) contacted [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] about the high incidence of tire failure on first generation [[Mercury Mountaineer#first generation|Mercury Mountaineers]], first and second generation [[Ford Explorer#first generation|Ford Explorers]], and [[Mazda Navajo|Mazda Navajo 3-doors]] fitted with Firestone tires. Ford investigated and found that several models of 15-inch (381&amp;nbsp;mm) Firestone tires (''ATX'', ''ATX II'', and ''Wilderness AT'') had very high failure rates, especially those made at Firestone's [[Decatur, Illinois]] plant. To this day the Ford Motor Company refuses to equip any vehicle they sell with Firestones. Individuals can still opt to purchase tires aftermarket though.

The '''(my) mercury Concept''' (sometimes known as the '''Mercury My''') is a [[concept car]] that was created by [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]]. The my mercury was first introduced at the [[North American International Auto Show#1999|1999 North American International Auto Show]]. The my mercury was designed by [[J Mays]], the same designer of the [[Volkswagen New Beetle]]. This might also explain why the my mercury's curved roofline resembles the New Beetle's. The assembly of the Mercury My concept car was made in [[Pretoria]], South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concept Vehicle. Mercury MY 1999|url=http://www.chicagoautoshow.com/concepts/vehicle/1999/mercury/-my-/|publisher=Chicago Auto Show|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The my mercury features suicide-style doors that are center-opening. It also features two amber glass panels. The my mercury also sports a center console that holds a [[trackball]] which controls the sound system, climate controls and integrated global positioning system that is displayed on a screen mounted in the center. The entire my mercury looks like neither a [[car]], [[truck]], nor an [[SUV]]; it was a foreshadowing of the CUV cross-over segment to follow in the early part of the next decade.

The '''Mercury Colony Park''' is a [[full-size]] [[station wagon]] that was marketed by the [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] division of [[Ford Motor Company]] between 1957 and 1991.  Distinguished by its [[Woodie (car body style)|simulated wood-grain]] paneling, the Colony Park was marketed as either the premium-trim or the sole full-size station wagon offering of the division.  Following the demise of [[Edsel]], full-size Mercury and Ford vehicles adopted similar bodyshells, with the Colony Park becoming the counterpart of the [[Ford Country Squire]] until their discontinuation.

As the minivan and four-door SUV segment expanded in the late 1980s, sales of full-size station wagons declined, including the Colony Park.  As the Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis sedans underwent a major redesign for the 1992 model year, the station wagon body style was dropped from the model lineup, leaving the Colony Park with no direct replacement (through the closure of the Mercury brand in 2010).

For 1957, the Mercury model line underwent major revisions.   Instead of sharing bodies with trim distinguishing each division, Edsel and Mercury would share the chassis and powertrain (an all-new line of V8 engines), with each model line having different wheelbases and completely distinct exterior panels.

Another change involved the branding of station wagons, involving both Ford and Mercury. Split away from the Monterey model line, Mercury introduced three new station wagons as a separate model line for 1957.  Two-door and four-door station wagons were sold as a base-trim [[Mercury Commuter]] and mid-price [[Mercury Voyager]]; the top-trim wood-grained Mercury Colony Park was sold with only four-doors.  To distinguish itself from Ford (and Edsel), all Mercury station wagons given [[hardtop]] rooflines.    

Marketed as the flagship of the Mercury station wagon model line (alongside the Ford-based [[Edsel Bermuda]] sold only for 1958), the Mercury Colony Park was trimmed similar to the [[Mercury Montclair]], above the Monterey.  The interior featured an electric clock as a standard feature; a padded dash was optional.&lt;ref name="Flory, Jr. 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1957%20Mercury/1957_Mercury_Brochure/1957%20Mercury%20Brochure-31.html&lt;/ref&gt;  

Sharing its powertrain with the Montclair and the [[Mercury Turnpike Cruiser]], the 1957 Colony Park was fitted with a 368 cubic-inch [[Lincoln Y-block V8 engine#368|Lincoln Y-Block V8]].  For 1958, the Y-block was replaced by two "MEL" V8s.  The standard engine was a 383 cubic-inch V8 with a 430 cubic-inch V8 available as an option; a "Super Marauder" triple-carburetor option for the 430 was the first American mass-production engine rated at 400&amp;nbsp;hp.

For the 1959 model year, the Mercury Colony Park underwent a complete redesign.  Following the introduction of the 1958 [[Mercury Park Lane]], the Colony Park (and the rest of the Mercury line) extended its wheelbase to {{convert|126.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}.  Originally intended to share a chassis with the premium [[Edsel Corsair]] and [[Edsel Citation]] (Edsel wagons were Ford-based, including the woodgrain [[Edsel Bermuda]]), the Mercury division was left with its own chassis for 1959.  

As with the previous generation, the station wagon line remained distinct from Mercury sedans; the Mercury Voyager and the two-door Mercury Commuter were dropped.  As before, all four-door Mercury station wagons were produced with hardtop rooflines.      

For 1959, the Colony Park shared its 322hp Marauder V8 with the Montclair and Monterey.  For 1960, the 430 V8 made its return. In place of the 400hp Super Marauder triple-carburetor version, a single  4-barrel carburetor was fitted, reducing output down to 310 hp; this engine was shared with Lincoln, Continental, and the [[Ford Thunderbird (second generation)|Ford Thunderbird]]. As with the previous generation, both engines were paired with the [[Cruise-O-Matic|Merc-O-Matic]] 3-speed automatic transmission.

Following the closure of the Edsel division during the 1960 model year, Ford product planners scrambled to build to a better business case for both Lincoln and Mercury divisions.  To decrease its production costs, Mercury ended its use of a division-specific chassis and streamlined its product range, with full-size sedans reduced largely to the Monterey.  Mercury station wagon nameplates remained the same, with the Commuter differentiated from the Colony Park (by its lack of wood-grain trim).  In following with the compact Mercury Comet, all full-size 1961 Mercury lines began production using Ford bodywork and chassis.  Now sharing its roofline with the Ford Country Squire, the Colony Park moved from sharing its interior trim from the Montclair to the Monterey.   

Though the 1961 redesign of the Mercury product line was not intended as [[Downsize (automobile)|downsizing]], the transition between second and third generations marked a significant decrease in exterior dimensions.  From 1960 to 1961, the Mercury Colony Park shed approximately five inches in length, six inches in wheelbase, and approximately 500 pounds of curb weight.     

In place of the 430 MEL V8, Mercury fitted the Colony Park with three separate V8 engines.  A 292 [[Ford Y-block engine|Y-Block V8]] was the standard engine for 1961 and 1962, with 352 and 390 [[Ford FE engine|FE]] V8s as options.  In 1963, the 390 became the standard engine.  For the first time, 3 and 4-speed manual transmissions were offered in the Colony Park, with 3-speed Merc-O-Matic as an option.

For 1965, Ford redesigned its entire full-size sedan and station wagon product line, including the Mercury Colony Park.  While retaining a body-on-frame chassis, the leaf-sprung rear suspension was replaced by a coil-spring live rear axle configuration; through several design changes, the basic layout would be retained through the final Crown Victoria produced in 2011.  While the Colony Park retained its roofline alongside the Ford Country Squire, it adopted the slab-sided design language taken on by Mercury sedans, heavily influenced by the exterior of the Lincoln Continental.  

Through this generation, Mercury would make several design changes.  For 1966, the rear tailgate was updated, marking the debut of the two-way "Magic Doorgate" shared with all other Ford and Mercury station wagons; the design allowed the tailgate to fold down as a tailgate as well as swing oututo the drivers' side as a door.  For 1967, passenger capacity was expanded as sideways-facing third-row seats were added as an option.  To increase ventilation for the rear of the vehicle, the Colony Park introduced fresh-air ventilation through channels integrated into the D-pillar, allowing ventilation if the rear window was retracted.

The Colony Park underwent two exterior revisions, in 1967 and 1968, following Lincoln Continental styling updates; redesigns were made to the simulated wood paneling.  For 1967 and 1968, the [[Mercury Park Lane#Second generation (1964-1968)|Mercury Park Lane]] coupe and convertible featured the same simulated wood paneling as the Colony Park as an option package.  Called "yacht deck paneling" by Mercury, the option was rarely ordered and was discontinued as the Park Lane was replaced by the Mercury Marquis.

For 1965, the 390 V8 was the sole engine.  In 1966, Mercury added two additional FE V8s, a 330&amp;nbsp;hp 410 "Marauder" V8&lt;ref&gt;1968 Kelley Blue Book&lt;/ref&gt; and a 345&amp;nbsp;hp 428 "Super Marauder" V8.  For 1968, the 410 was dropped, replaced by a 315&amp;nbsp;hp version of the 390 V8.

Alongside a redesign for the 1969 model year, Ford integrated its station wagon product lines of both Ford and Mercury brands within the nameplates of their sedan counterparts.&lt;ref name=Odin&gt;Odin, L.C. ''A concise guide to the Ford and Mercury full-size automobile production 1969-1978''. Belvedere Publishing, 2016. ASIN: B01HE91Y4K.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the Colony Park, this change made it part of the [[Mercury Marquis]] model line.   In contrast to the Marquis sedan, the Colony Park was based on the {{convert|121.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase of the Ford Country Squire and the Ford LTD.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;  

This generation introduced covered headlights, which were deployed using a vacuum canister system that kept the doors down when a vacuum condition existed in the lines, provided by the engine when it was running. If a loss of vacuum occurred, the doors would retract up so that the headlights were visible if the system should fail.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;  The Magic Doorgate was reworked so that it could swing outward without having to roll the window down.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;

Coinciding with the addition of 5–mph bumpers, Ford and Mercury station wagons underwent a major redesign for 1973, including a completely new roofline.  In place of the framed doors, the station wagons were marketed as "pillarless hardtops"; though the roof was fitted with slim B-pillars, the doors were fitted with frameless door glass.   

Although narrower than the 1959–1960 generation, this generation of the Colony Park would be the longest and heaviest station wagon ever sold by Mercury.  Due to its nearly 5,000&amp;nbsp;lb curb weight, the standard engine was a 400 cubic-inch V8 with a 429 cubic-inch V8 as an option; in 1972, the 429 was replaced by a 460 cubic-inch V8 sourced from Lincoln.  For the 1978 model year, a 351 Windsor V8 became standard (outside of California and high-altitude areas), with the 400 and 460 as options.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;  However, most surviving examples are equipped with one of the two larger V8 engines, as they were far more popular, with the 351 proving to have little fuel-economy gains.

Approximately 7,850,000 full-size Fords and Mercurys were sold over 1969-1978.&lt;ref name="kowalke1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kowalke|first=Ron|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975|year=1997|publisher=Krause publications|isbn=0-87341-521-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/standardcatalogo00beve}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flammang, James 1999"&gt;Flammang, James ''Standard Catalog of American Cars 1976–1999 3rd Edition'' (Iola, WI: Krause Publications, Inc 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it the second-best selling Ford [[automobile platform]] after the [[Ford Model T]].&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;

For 1979, Ford redesigned its full-size sedan and station wagons; the Ford Panther platform brought Ford in line with the [[Downsize (automobile)|downsizing]] introduced by the 1977 General Motors B-body full-size cars.  To remain competitive (in terms of size and fuel economy) with the [[Buick Estate]] and [[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]] (1978 marked the end of the full-size [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country (1941–1988)|Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] station wagon), Ford made extensive changes to its full-size station wagons.  In terms of size, the 1979 Colony Park shed over 11 inches in length, 6.6 inches in wheelbase, 0.4 inches in width, and had lost slightly over 1,000&amp;nbsp;lbs in weight (in comparison to its 1978 predecessor).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.automobile-catalog.com/auta_cmp2.php&lt;/ref&gt;  Though technically smaller than the "intermediate" Montego/Cougar station wagon, the Colony Park reduced its cargo-carrying capability only slightly over the 1978 Colony Park.  As before, 8-passenger seating remained standard equipment.      

In a revision of the Mercury product range, the Colony Park was moved to the Grand Marquis model line, the flagship of the Mercury brand.  Effectively, it placed the Colony Park above its Country Squire counterpart in terms of trim; also, the decision also cleared room for a Marquis station wagon without woodgrain trim.    

In the interest of fuel economy, the Mercury Colony Park underwent an extensive revision of its powertrain lineup.  Although V8 power remained in place, the 400 and 460 V8 engines were removed from all Ford cars, with the Colony Park sharing the 302 [[Ford Windsor engine|Windsor]] V8 with the Mercury Monarch, the previous base 351 [[Ford Windsor engine#351W|Windsor]] V8 was offered as an option.  For 1981, Ford and Mercury underwent the powertrain revisions of the 1980 Lincoln Continental; the 302 V8 was given fuel injection (now marketed in metric as a "5.0&amp;nbsp;L"), with both engines paired to the 4-speed [[Ford AOD transmission|AOD]] overdrive transmission, the first of its type in an American full-size car.  For 1982, the fuel-injected "5.0" V8 became the sole engine offering in all Mercury full-size cars.  During 1986, the carbureted 5.8&amp;nbsp;L V8 returned as an option; examples specified with this engine are rare.

This generation of Colony Park would see few substantial changes during its thirteen-year lifespan.  For 1983, it became the sole full-size Mercury wagon as the previous year's 'base' Marquis wagon was no longer offered as a full-size model.  For 1984, the non-woodgrain Grand Marquis (previously Marquis) station wagon was dropped, leaving the Colony Park as the sole version.  For 1987, Mercury brought the Colony Park in line with the Sable and Topaz by introducing GS and LS trim levels.       

After nine years with only detail changes to the body and trim, the Colony Park received a major update alongside the Grand Marquis for 1988.  From the windshield forward, a more aerodynamic front end better integrated the fenders, grille, headlights, and bumpers.  Inside, the front seats were modernized.  For 1990, as part of an addition of a driver's side airbag, the entire instrument panel and dashboard received a redesign; all outboard seats received 3-point seatbelts. 1991 was the final shortened model year for the Colony Park with production ending in December 1990.

The '''Mercury Montclair''' was a [[full-size]] [[automobile]] [[brand|marque]] which was produced by [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] from 1955 to 1957, for the M-E-L ([[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln]], [[Edsel]] &amp; Mercury) divisions of Ford Motor Company, between 1958 and 1960 and by the [[Lincoln Mercury]] division of the Ford Motor Company from 1964 to 1968.  Its appearance followed the concept show car in 1954 called the [[Mercury XM-800]].

== 1955–1960 ==
The vehicle name was introduced in 1955 and applied to Mercury's premium automobile line. Ford historians are at a loss as to where the name originated; the consensus is that it's taken from the upper class community of [[Montclair, New Jersey]]. For 1955 and 1956, Montclairs featured Mercury's best appointments; extra chrome trim, and different two-tone paint combinations to set them apart from other Mercury products. 1956 was the year Ford introduced its Lifeguard safety program, and the Mercury Montclair came standard with a deep-dish steering wheel to help protect the driver from the steering column, safety door locks, a breakaway rear view mirror, and optional seat belts and padded dashboards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1956%20Mercury/album_002/1956%20Mercury%20Hardtops-10-11.html |title=Directory Index: Mercury/1956 Mercury/album_002 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dash was redesigned with a  new three-tier instrument panel.

The Montclair model line also included the '''[[Ford Crown Victoria Skyliner|Sun Valley]]''', which featured a [[Plexiglas]] "bubble" over the front half of the roof section. While futuristic cars were often featured with clear glass tops in the 1950s (like the concept car [[Lincoln Futura]]), consumers rejected the tinted glass roof Sun Valleys (only 1,500 were produced in 1955) because of the heat buildup in the interior of the vehicles. Following lower sales of the Sun Valley for 1956, the version was discontinued for 1957. In 1956 the Montclair received some minor changes, including a new Z-shaped side spear incorporating a false vent behind the front doors, and a large, beefy, chromed "M" logo on the bonnet.

In 1957, the Montclair name was pushed down market by the introduction of the [[Mercury Turnpike Cruiser|Turnpike Cruiser]]. A new frame was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1957%20Mercury/1957_Mercury_Brochure/1957%20Mercury%20Brochure-30.html |title=Directory Index: Mercury/1957 Mercury/1957_Mercury_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it could now be ordered with the same {{convert|368|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Lincoln Y-block V8 engine#341|Lincoln Y-Block]] [[V8 engine|V8]] that came standard on the Turnpike Cruiser. Fuel economy was 16.2MPG at 50&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HOEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Popular Mechanics - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 the Turnpike Cruiser became a Montclair trim level, and Mercury assigned its premium model the name [[Mercury Park Lane|Park Lane]].

In 1959, Popular Mechanics wrote that head room was not good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttsDAAAAMBAJ|title=Popular Mechanics|last=Magazines|first=Hearst|date=1959-07-01|publisher=Hearst Magazines|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1964–1969 ==

In 1961 Mercury dropped the Montclair and Park Lane in favor of [[Mercury Meteor|Meteor]] and [[Mercury Monterey|Monterey]]; in 1962 these were replaced by the Monterey and Monterey Custom, and the Meteor name transferred to Mercury's new intermediate line based on the [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Ford Fairlane]].

The Montclair and Park Lane models were resurrected for 1964 as trim levels on full-sized Mercurys. Intermittent windshield wipers were standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1965%20Mercury/1965_Mercury_Full_Size_Brochure/1965%20Mercury%20Full%20Size-18-19.html |title=Directory Index: Mercury/1965 Mercury/1965_Mercury_Full_Size_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They remained in place until replaced by the Monterey Custom in 1969.

The '''Mercury Meteor''' is an [[automobile]] that was produced by [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] from 1961 to 1963. For 1961, the name was applied to low-end full-sized vehicles; for 1962 and 1963, the name was applied to Mercury's mid-sized sedans, in a marketing attempt to appeal to the excitement surrounding the [[Space Race]], before being discontinued. Introduced while Mercury as a marque was in flux, and never a solid marketplace performer in consumer sales, the Meteor remains more a side note than a well known Mercury product.

==Meteor (Ford of Canada brand)==
{{See also|Meteor (automobile)}}
[[File:MeteorNiagara.jpg|left|thumb|1954 Meteor Niagara]]
'''Meteor''' was first used by [[Ford Motor Company of Canada|Ford of Canada]] as the brand name for a distinct line of models introduced in 1949.  The standalone Meteor brand name used then-contemporary Ford models, trimmed specifically for the Canadian market with unique grilles, taillights and other trim to marginally differentiate them from the Ford vehicles. This was done to give Canadian Lincoln-Mercury dealerships a product to sell in the low-price field, similar to Ford of Canada dealerships offering the [[Monarch (marque)|Monarch]] line of lower-price vehicles which were actually another variation of Ford models with unique trim and model names. This was typical practice in the Canadian market (compared to that of the United States), where smaller towns might have only a Ford dealer or a Lincoln-Mercury dealer, but often not both.  The introduction of Meteor also gave Lincoln-Mercury a direct competitor to the GM [[Pontiac]] brand in Canada.[[File:1968 Meteor Rideau (14252728170).jpg|thumb|right|1968 Meteor Rideau 500 two-door hardtop. Although this car bears close resemblance to the U.S. market Monterey, it is actually based on the Ford Galaxie 500.]]

From 1961 to 1963, the Meteor brand was temporarily discontinued, as the Mercury division used the Meteor name for a midsize car based on the Ford [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Fairlane]].  In addition, in both the United States and Canada, the Mercury division was shifted downward in price.

In 1964, Lincoln-Mercury reintroduced the Meteor brand, replacing the Mercury Monterey in Canada.  In contrast to previous versions, new Meteors used Mercury bodies, distinguished by the use of Ford interior trim.  After 1976, the separate Meteor model lines were discontinued,&lt;ref name="Odin"&gt;Odin, L.C. ''A concise guide to the Ford and Mercury full-size automobile production 1969-1978''. Belvedere Publishing, 2016. ASIN: B01HE91Y4K.&lt;/ref&gt; with the nameplate becoming a low-cost trim of the Mercury Marquis in Canada through the 1981 model year.

==Background==
In the mid-1950s, Ford executives were convinced by Ernest Breech that, in order to compete with General Motors, the automaker had to meet each sales segment with a unique product. The plan affected Mercury by calling for the marque's first completely new platform and body design since World War II in order to differentiate it from Fords, beginning with the 1957 model year.

Historically, Mercury was usually considered a "lower-medium-priced" car, most often compared to Pontiac and Dodge. Under Breech's plan Mercury would move upmarket and compete more directly with Buick, Oldsmobile, Chrysler and DeSoto and the [[Edsel]] would take over Mercury's previous role as the lower-medium-priced car and compete more directly with Pontiac and Dodge.

While Breech’s plan could have succeeded in the early 1950s, by the late 1950s the bottom was beginning to drop out of the middle price car market; the 1958 recession effectively rendered Breech’s plan obsolete. Sales of Ford’s Edsel marque were a complete disaster.

Sales of Mercury products failed to reach expected levels, leading to cost cutting decisions beginning in the 1961 model year. Had [[Robert S. McNamara]], then head of the Ford division, had his way, Lincoln, Edsel and Mercury would have been eliminated. Instead, a compromise was made, and beginning in 1961 Ford and Mercury used the basic Ford body shells, and relied upon unique trim elements to differentiate the marques one from another. Edsel, meanwhile, was discontinued after a short run of 1960 models; what emerged as the 1961 Mercury Meteor was initially envisioned as the 1961 Edsel.

Mercury product planning underwent another shift with the departure of fiscal conservative McNamara from Ford. What had been McNamara’s attempts to remake Mercury as a senior Ford were discarded, and instead, for 1965, Mercury was marketed as being "built in the Lincoln tradition".

The first step towards this goal was the elimination of the compact-bodied [[Mercury Comet|Comet]]. Although Mercury had no mid-sized car for the 1964 and 1965 model years, the Comet continued to sell well during this time. Because the Comet name had better recognition than Meteor, the Comet name was transferred to Mercury's mid-sized car based on the Ford Fairlane beginning with the 1966 model year, in effect finally replacing the Meteor model and name that had last been built and used in 1963.  For 1964, the Meteor name returned on a series of full-size models in the Canadian market, much as had been the case until 1961.

The first step taken to make Mercury more cost effective within Ford, was to shed its higher priced [[Mercury Montclair|Montclair]] and [[Mercury Park Lane|Park Lane]] models. The [[Mercury Monterey|Monterey]], previously the entry-level full-sized Mercury offering and priced slightly higher for the 1961 model year than comparable 1960 models, became the new top-of-the-line model. It was joined by the new, lower-priced Meteor 600 and Meteor 800. The Meteor 600 and Meteor 800 were, respectively, the evolution of the Medalist and Custom models last offered in 1956, as well as replacements for the discontinued Edsel. All full-sized 1961 Mercurys rode on a 120” wheelbase.

For 1961, the Meteor was a full-sized model, differentiated from the Monterey through its trim and taillights. Meteor 600 taillights were oblong, while the Meteor 800 and upmarket Monterey used six circular tail lights, three on each side. Meteor 600s, available only as two- and four-door sedans, featured chrome spears from the taillights to the front wheels. Meteor 800s, available in two- and four-door sedan and hardtop body styles, featured the spear and three chrome bars on the front fenders, chrome fender fin trim, rocker panel trim and back-up lights.

The [[Mercury Commuter|Commuter]] four-door station wagon was trimmed comparably to the Meteors, while the [[Mercury Colony Park|Colony Park]] with [[Woodie (car body style)|simulated woodgrain]] trim on the side-panels was outfitted comparably to the Monterey.

The standard engine in the Meteor and Commuter was a 223 cubic inch displacement inline six-cylinder with a single-barrel carburetor that generated {{convert|135|hp}} at 4000 rpm. Optional engines included a 292 cubic inch V-8 with a two-barrel carburetor generating {{convert|175|hp}} at 4200 rpm (standard on the Monterey and Colony Park), as well as a 352 cubic inch Marauder V-8 with a two-barrel carburetor generating {{convert|220|hp}}, a 390 cubic inch Marauder V-8 with a four-barrel carburetor generating {{convert|300|hp|0|abbr=}}, and a 390 cubic inch Marauder V-8 with a four-barrel carburetor generating {{convert|330|hp|0|abbr=}}.
The standard transmission was a three-speed manual with overdrive available as an option. Merc-O-Matic and Multi-Drive automatic transmissions were available as options.

}}

For 1962, Mercury marketing decided that the Monterey nameplate had better consumer recognition than the Meteor moniker as far as full-sized vehicles were concerned (despite the fact that the Meteor outsold the Monterey), and instead assigned the Meteor name to a new line of mid-sized cars based on the [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Ford Fairlane]] which, in turn, was based on a long-wheelbase version of the Ford Falcon chassis. This smaller, mid-sized Meteor filled the product gap between the full-sized Monterey and the compact, Ford Falcon-based Mercury Comet.

Riding the Fairlane’s 116.5 inch wheelbase, the 1962 Meteors wore unique rear quarter panels that mimicked the Monterey's jet-pod tail lights. The base Meteor and better-trimmed Meteor Custom were available as two- and four-door sedans. The Meteor S-33 was a specially appointed two-door sedan featuring premium exterior trim and interior amenities including bucket seats, and a center console. Its styling and features were similar to the Fairlane 500 Sports Coupe.

For 1963, Meteors received a trim update and the addition of two body styles, a four-door station wagon and a two-door hardtop coupé. The four-door station wagon was added to both the Meteor and Meteor Custom series. In the Meteor Custom series the station wagon was referred to as the Mercury Country Cruise and featured simulated wood-grain trim on the exterior. The hardtop coupe was added to the Meteor Custom  and Meteor S-33 series. The hardtop coupé replaced the two-door sedan in the Meteor S-33 series, as had the Fairlane Sports Coupe.

The base Meteor engine was a 170 cubic inch, inline six-cylinder engine with a one-barrel carburetor {{convert|101|hp|kW|abbr=on}} at 4000&amp;nbsp;rpm. Optional engines included a 221 cubic inch V-8 with a two-barrel carburetor that generated {{convert|145|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and a 260 cubic inch V-8 with a two-barrel carburetor that generated {{convert|164|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. A three-speed manual transmission was standard. Overdrive and Merc-O-Matic automatic transmissions were options. A four-speed manual transmission became an option for 1963.

Sales of the mid-sized Mercury Meteor were less than expected and the model was discontinued at the end of the 1963 model year.

The '''Mercury Mariner''' is a [[compact car|compact]] [[crossover SUV]] that was introduced in 2005.  It is a sibling of the [[Mazda Tribute]] and [[Ford Escape]], although it is more  upmarket than the other two.  The Mariner is Mercury's first car-based SUV, and is slotted below the [[Mercury Mountaineer|Mountaineer]] in the lineup.   When Ford eliminated the Mercury brand, the Mariner ended production in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2010/07/12/mercury-production-to-cease-in-late-september/#comments "Mercury production to cease in late September?"] from Autoblog (July 12, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mariner was officially offered in the U.S., Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the U.A.E.

Introduced during the 2005 refresh of the Ford Escape, the Mercury Mariner was positioned above both it and the Mazda Tribute in the compact sport utility vehicle group.  It also includes stylistic differences, such as a two-tone interior, turn signal repeaters borrowed from the European-market [[Ford Escape|Ford Maverick]], monotone cladding, and the signature [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] "waterfall" front grille.  
Unlike its counterparts, a manual transmission was not part of the powertrain lineup.  The Mariner was the first Mercury with a [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]] since the [[Mercury Cougar#Seventh generation|Mercury Cougar]] was dropped in 2002.  For 2006, the lineup was expanded with the introduction of the Mariner Hybrid.

For the 2008 model year the Mariner was significantly updated with a new look although it remained on the [[Ford CD2 platform]] used by the previous generation.

The changes included a new seats, headlights, taillights, a new liftgate, a higher beltline and new doors and wheels. The interior was also significantly updated with higher quality materials and more refined features. The engines remained the same but the 3.0&amp;nbsp;L Duratec [[V6]] has been modified to reduce fuel consumption by 10%.

Mariner and its [[Ford Escape#2008–present|Ford Escape]] sibling were the first vehicles to feature Ford's pull-drift steering compensation, an enhancement made possible by applying [[software]] control to the [[Electric Power Steering]] (EPS)  system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=30019 |title=Ford builds on electric power steering technology to enhance drive quality, enable more features |date=March 12, 2009 |work=Media.Ford.com |accessdate=2009-11-09 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first 2008 Mercury Mariner was unveiled at the South Florida International Auto Show on October 6, 2006 and was touted as a new direction for the Mercury brand.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}

===2009 changes===
The 2009 Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner were unveiled at the 2008 Washington Auto Show. Sporting a 2.5-liter engine and 6-speed automatic transmission that replaced the four-speed [[automatic transmission]], the new powertrain improved the EPA fuel economy by 1 mile per gallon and increased power by 11% to {{convert|170|hp}}. Also, the existing 3.0-liter Duratec V6 was bumped from {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on}} to {{convert|240|hp|abbr=on}}.

The new engine was also the new basis for Ford's hybrid models, including the Ford Escape Hybrid and Mercury Mariner Hybrid. “For every eight Escape and Mariner vehicles we sell, one of them is a hybrid, and the appeal is growing,” says Sue Ciscke, Ford senior vice president, Sustainability, Environment and Safety Engineering.

===2010 changes===
For the 2010 model year, the Mariner added Ford's MyKey and trailer sway controls as standard on all trim levels. The Mariner engine has a [[Flexible-fuel vehicle|Flex-Fuel]] option on all of them which features being able to use E85 fuel and/or regular unleaded only on the optional V6 engine. Ford has also done away with the Euro-style turn signal repeaters for this model year.

===2011 changes===
For the 2011 model year, the Mariner featured [[HD Radio]] as a standard, but continued with the same features as the 2010 models.  This version of the Mariner was its last, as Ford discontinued the Mercury brand due to declining sales. Ford ended production of the Mariner in October 2010.

The last one rolled off the assembly line on October 5, 2010.

[[File:Mariner Hybrid 08 2009 DCA 6980 with badging.jpg|thumb|Mercury Mariner Hybrid]] 
The Mariner Hybrid [[powertrain]] was identical to its [[sibling]], the ''[[Ford Escape Hybrid]].'' It was launched to the U.S. market in 2006 and was discontinued in 2010 with the rest of the brand. The Mariner hybrid sold a total of 12,300 units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1076382_green-car-death-list-2012-models-to-which-we-bid-adieu |title=Green-Car Death List: 2012 Models To Which We Bid Adieu|author=John Voelcker|publisher=Green Car Reports|date=2012-05-22|accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Like the Ford Escape Hybrid, the Mariner Hybrid is a "full" hybrid electric system, meaning the system can switch automatically between pure electric power, pure gasoline engine power, or a combination of electric battery and gasoline engine operating together, for maximum performance and efficiency at all speeds and loads. When braking or decelerating, the Mariner's hybrid system uses regenerative braking, where the electric drive motor becomes a generator, converting the vehicle's momentum back to electricity for storage in the batteries. With {{Convert|155|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, the Mariner Hybrid has nearly the same acceleration performance as the conventional {{Convert|200|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} [[V6]] Mariner. Again, just like the Escape Hybrid, it gets a respectable average of {{convert|34|mpgUS|L/100 km mpgimp}} and is sometimes said to be the most fuel efficient [[sport utility vehicle]] on the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automoblog.net/2008/11/11/2009-mercury-mariner-hybrid-review/|title=2009 Mercury Mariner Hybrid Review|publisher=Automoblog.net|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Presidential Edition ===

On September 7, 2006 Ford delivered a special "Presidential Edition" Mercury Mariner Hybrid to former President [[Bill Clinton]]. Its custom features include:

* LED lighting
* A 110-volt outlet
* Rear bucket seats
* Center console &amp; rear seat fold-out writing desks
* Personal DVD players for each seat
* Refrigerator
* Increased rear seat legroom

There have also been several undisclosed security modifications made to the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/AUTOS/09/07/clinton_hybrid/index.html |work=CNN.com |title=Clinton to get custom hybrid SUV |date=September 7, 2006|accessdate=2009-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mercury Monterey''' is a series of [[Full-size car|full-size cars]] that were manufactured and marketed by the [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] division of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] from 1952 to 1974.  Deriving its name from [[Monterey Bay]], the Mercury Monterey served as the replacement for the Mercury Eight, the debut model line of the Mercury division.  During its production, the Monterey would be offered in multiple body styles, ranging from coupes, sedans, hardtops, and station wagons.  

Over its 22 years of production, the Monterey served as the flagship, mid-range, and entry-level offering of the full-size Mercury product range.  The only Mercury nameplate to be in continuous production throughout the 1960s&lt;ref name="hsw7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/mercury-cars7.htm|title=Full-Size Mercury Cars of the 1960s|work=How Mercury Cars Work|publisher=HowStuffWorks.com|accessdate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Monterey was slotted above the Medalist, Custom, and Meteor; later, it was slotted below the Turnpike Cruiser, Montclair, Park Lane, and Marquis. 

Following the 1974 model year, Mercury discontinued the Monterey, consolidating its full-size range down to the Marquis and Colony Park station wagon.  For 2004, the Monterey nameplate was revived, becoming the counterpart of the  [[Ford Freestar]] minivan; it was produced through the 2007 model year.

==Early history==
The Monterey (model 72C) was introduced in 1950 as a high-end two-door coupe as part of the [[Mercury Eight]] series in the same vein as the [[Ford Crestliner]], the [[Lincoln EL-series|Lincoln]] [[Lincoln Lido|Lido]] coupe and the [[Lincoln Cosmopolitian|Lincoln Cosmopolitan]] [[Lincoln Capri|Capri]] coupe in order to compete with the [[hardtop]] coupes [[General Motors]] had introduced the previous model year. Montereys had either a canvas covered top for $2146 or vinyl for $2157. Standard features included leather faced seats, simulated leather headliner, wool carpets, chrome-plated interior garnish moldings, two-toned dashboard, special black steering wheel, fender skirts, dual outside rearview mirrors, full wheelcovers &amp; gold winged hood ornament. For $10 more all leather seats were an option. Two special colors were offered, Turquoise Blue with dark blue top and Cortaro Red metallic with black top. Black with yellow top was also available. Few Montereys were sold.

The fullsize Mercury was redesigned for 1957 and grew considerably larger as well, riding on an exclusive {{Convert|122|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase. A new frame design allowed a lower floor which made the car look lower and longer. Interior features included a front seat track stop(to keep the front seat from breaking loose), a new design for the safety steering wheel, a new radio, and memory power front seats.&lt;ref&gt;http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---February/1957-Mercury-Quick-Facts-Booklet/1957-Mercury-Quick-Facts-13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---February/1957-Mercury-Quick-Facts-Booklet/1957-Mercury-Quick-Facts-14&lt;/ref&gt; The station wagons were divested from the Monterey series, with the Commuter, Voyager, and [[Mercury Colony Park|Colony Park]] lines.

Mercury's full-size offerings were completely revamped for 1961. Bodies, interiors, and chassis were basically the same as the big Ford's, although trim was different in order to distinguish the marques.  The Montclair and Park Lane were discontinued and the [[Mercury Meteor|Meteor]] was added at the bottom of the range, making Monterey once again the top of Mercury's lineup. The {{convert|292|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Ford Y-block was standard, with {{convert|352|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} versions of the [[Ford FE engine|FE]] [[V8 engine|V8]] available.&lt;ref name='hsw5'&gt;{{cite web |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/mercury-cars5.htm |title=The 1960s: More Mercury Models, Fewer Buyers |author=Consumer Guide |work=How Mercury Cars Work |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |accessdate=2008-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Meteor nameplate was moved to a new intermediate line for 1962, so the '''Monterey 6''' with a {{convert|135|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{convert|223|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford Straight-6 engine#223|Mileage Maker]] [[straight-six]] was added to fill the gap, but only for this year.&lt;ref name='hsw5'/&gt;

1963 brought the return of the "Breezeway" window, a powered reverse slanted rear window that was borrowed from Ford's station wagons, and was first used on the [[Mercury Turnpike Cruiser]] and the 1958–60 [[Lincoln Continental]]. It also brought a {{convert|406|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} FE engine. The six-cylinder, and 292 and 352 V8s were dropped and the 390 [[V8 engine|V8]] became the standard engine with 250 horsepower and two-barrel carburetor with a 300-horsepower four-barrel version optional. At mid-year, the fastback [[Mercury Marauder|Marauder]] was introduced.&lt;ref name='hsw7'/&gt;  Mid-1963 saw the introduction of the "Marauder," basically the 1963 1/2 Ford Sports Hardtop "fastback" roofline adapted to the Mercury body. A performance "S-55" package included a big-block 300-bhp 390 V8 and a sporty interior that was similar to the Ford Galaxie 500/XL.

Monterey became the entry-level full-size Mercury again for 1964, with the return of the Montclair and Park Lane. Grilles and taillights were restyled and toned down a bit, making this model especially attractive, a big car but not bulky-looking.  The 406 was replaced by the {{convert|427|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} version, producing {{convert|410|hp|kW|abbr=on}} standard with an option for {{convert|425|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name='hsw7'/&gt;  The Marauder fastback hardtop continued to be offered in all three Mercury series.

The full-size Mercurys were redesigned for 1965 with a new torque-box frame and a more slab-sided look, reflecting the popularity of the [[Lincoln Continental#Fourth generation (1961–69)|Continental]]. The Breezeway window was now only available on pillared sedans, with all two door hardtops being fastbacks. 

The Mercury-exclusive {{convert|410|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} and the {{convert|428|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} FE engines were added for 1966. 1967 brought a refresh, and the vertical Breezeway roofline disappeared although they could still be had with a drop-down rear window. The 410 was dropped for 1968.&lt;ref name='hsw7'/&gt;

For 1969, the Mercury model line underwent a significant revision, with the Montclair repackaged as the Monterey Custom trim level.  An all-new chassis made its debut; sedans were based on a 124-inch wheelbase, Monterey station wagons used a 121-inch wheelbase (alongside Ford station wagons and sedans).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1969%20Mercury/1969_Mercury_Full_Line_Brochure/1969%20Mercury-24.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1969 Mercury/1969_Mercury_Full_Line_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Odin"&gt;Odin, L.C. ''A concise guide to the Ford and Mercury full-size automobile production 1969-1978''. Belvedere Publishing, 2016. ASIN: B01HE91Y4K.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the expansion of the Marquis to a full model range, the Monterey was the base-trim model range, offered as a two-door hardtop, two-door convertible, four-door sedan, four-door hardtop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1969%20Mercury/1969_Mercury_Full_Size_Brochure/1969%20Mercury%20Full%20Size-32.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1969 Mercury/1969_Mercury_Full_Size_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In another revision, Mercury station wagons were no longer a separate model range, with the Mercury Commuter renamed the Monterey station wagon.   

More rounded in styling than the previous generation, the Monterey and Monterey Custom were distinguished from the Marquis by their lack of hidden headlights, differing from Fords in grille and taillamp styling.  For 1970, the grille underwent a further revision and wider taillamps were introduced to better differentiate the Monterey from its Ford counterparts.

In 1971, the Mercury full-size model range underwent a exterior restyling.  While retaining the roofline shared with Ford, the Monterey adopted design elements similar to the larger Lincoln Continental, included its wide-pointing grille and taillamps.  In a major change, Ford and Mercury introduced "pillarless hardtops", using frameless door glass on both hardtops and four-door sedans; vent windows were discontinued.  Redesigned door handles no longer protruded from the exterior; rear fender skirts were standardized on all full-size Mercury sedans except the base-trim Monterey.  The Monterey and Marquis convertibles were discontinued for 1971, leaving the Cougar as the sole Mercury convertible. 

For 1972, the Monterey underwent minor exterior revisions, replacing the full-width horizontal grille for an egg-crate style design.  In line with federal regulations, front seatbelt warning buzzers were introduced.  For the first time, an automatic transmission was standard, along with power steering and power brakes.&lt;ref name="Odin" /&gt;  

For 1973, the full-size Mercury line underwent an exterior redesign, adapting to the introduction of federally mandated [[5 mph bumper|5&amp;nbsp;mph bumpers]].&lt;ref name="Odin" /&gt;  Along with slightly more angular styling, the Monterey adapted much of the front fascia of the Ford Galaxie, distinguished largely by a centered eggcrate grille, with fender skirts becoming an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1973%20Mercury/1973%20Mercury%20Full%20Line%20Brochure/1973%20Mercury-34.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1973 Mercury/1973 Mercury Full Line Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For 1974, the Monterey saw a revision to its grille and headlight trim.      

For 1975, Mercury discontinued the Monterey, consolidating its full-size range down to the Marquis.&lt;ref name="Odin" /&gt;  The same year, the Grand Marquis was introduced as a sub-model, becoming a distinct model range in 1983.    

Approximately 7,850,000 full-size Fords and Mercurys were sold over 1969–78; this makes it the second best selling Ford [[automobile platform]] after the [[Ford Model T]].&lt;ref name="Odin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kowalke1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kowalke|first=Ron|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975|year=1997|publisher=Krause publications|isbn=0-87341-521-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/standardcatalogo00beve}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flammang, James 1999"&gt;Flammang, James ''Standard Catalog of American Cars 1976–1999 3rd Edition'' (Iola, WI: Krause Publications, Inc 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Powertrain ====
The [[Ford Windsor engine|351 Windsor]] and {{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford 335 engine#400|Cleveland]] V8s were added for 1971, the final year for the 390.  The [[Ford 385 engine|429]] [[V8 engine|V8]], which was standard on the Marquis beginning in 1969, was available as an extra cost option on all Monterey models each year including a two-barrel 320-horsepower version and a four-barrel 360-horsepower option from 1969 to 1971. Both of those 429s were replaced by single 209 net horsepower 429 four-barrel for 1972, which was designed to run on regular, low lead or unleaded gasoline as was the case with all Ford Motor Company engines starting with the 1972 model year.&lt;ref name="Odin" /&gt;  Engine offerings for 1973–74 included the 351 Windsor two-barrel standard on base Montereys and the 400 Cleveland two-barrel standard on Monterey Custom and optional on base models. The 429 V8 was discontinued after 1973 and Lincoln's 460 V8 became the top option on all models for 1974.{{clear}}

==The Monterey in Canada==

After 1963, the Monterey was not sold in [[Canada]], but was supplanted by the resurrected [[Meteor (automobile)|Meteor]].  Meteor competed in the low-priced field, but its upper trim series (Montcalm and LeMoyne) were typically very similar to the U.S. Monterey both in styling and appointments.  Meteor continued as a separate marque through 1976 (1975–76 models continued the 1974 Monterey's front end styling&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;) after which the name was applied to a base trim version of the Marquis, as the "Mercury Marquis Meteor" through 1981.

}}The '''Mercury Cyclone''' is an [[automobile]] that was marketed by the [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] division of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] from 1964 to 1971.  Introduced in 1964 as the '''Mercury Comet Cyclone''', the Cyclone replaced the S-22 as the performance-oriented version of the [[Mercury Comet]] model line.  The Cyclone became a distinct nameplate for the 1968 model year, as the [[Mercury Montego]] was phased in to replace the Comet.&lt;ref name="Ford Muscle2004" /&gt;  

Within Mercury, the Cyclone was slotted between the Cougar pony car and the Marquis/Marauder full-size two-doors.  Though largely overshadowed by the Cougar, the Cyclone was positioned as a muscle car, representing the Mercury brand in racing.  

Four generations of the Cyclone were produced, with production ending after the 1971 model year.  For the 1972 model year, the Cyclone returned as an option package for the Montego; only 30 examples were produced.  Within the Mercury line, the Cyclone was not directly replaced. The Cougar XR7 was repackaged as a personal luxury version of the Montego for 1974.

==First generation (1964-1965)==
[[File:1964 Mercury Comet Cyclone (35574336244).jpg|thumb|1964 Mercury Comet Cyclone]]

=== 1964 ===
The Cyclone started as an option for the 1964 [[Mercury Comet]]. It featured a {{convert|289|cid|cc|abbr=on|sigfig=4}}, {{convert|210|hp|kW|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} engine and a sporty look. It had a spoked [[steering wheel]] and [[bucket seats]]. Some of the engine parts were [[chrome plating|chromed]].

=== 1965 ===
In the 1965 models, the engine was updated to the four-barrel [[carburetor|carbureted]] version of the {{convert|289|cid|cc|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} unit, but generated {{convert|200|hp|kW|abbr=on|sigfig=4}}.  This model had a few performance options, which included a handling package, a special fan, and a "power transfer" rear axle. Special features included a black-out, stand-up grille, bucket seats with sewn-through pleats, center console, chrome-plated wheel covers with lug nuts, engine "dress up kit", unique insignias, a vinyl roof in black or white and a "Power-Pac" gauge cluster for the heavily padded instrument panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mays|first=James C|title=1965 Mercury Comet|url=http://www.oldcarscanada.com/2013/02/1965-mercury-comet.html|work=www.OldCarsCanada.com|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second generation (1966-1967) ==
[[File:1964 Mercury Cyclone GT.jpg|thumb|right|1966 Mercury Comet Cyclone GT hardtop]]

=== 1966 ===
The 1966 models underwent a major styling change. The body received "sculpturing" that ran the length of the car, and was based on the body of the [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Ford Fairlane]]. The models introduced new engines. The 390 Y code was a {{convert|390|cid|cc|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} engine with a two-barrel [[carburetor]] and {{convert|265|hp|kW|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}.  The 390 H code had a four-barrel carburetor and {{convert|275|hp|kW|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}.

The GT option used a 390 S code engine which was a {{convert|390|cid|cc|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} engine with a four-barrel carburetor and {{convert|335|hp|kW|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}. The GT featured car stripes, a fiberglass [[bonnet (automobile)|hood (bonnet)]] with two air scoops and several other performance options.

=== 1967 ===
The 1967 model was produced with several engine options. The standard engine was the 289 V8 with {{convert|289|cid|cc|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} and {{convert|200|hp|kW|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}. The GT's engine was {{convert|390|cid|cc|abbr=on|sigfig=4}}, but was quoted with 15 fewer horses at {{convert|320|hp|kW|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}.

Neither the 1966 Cyclone nor the 1967 Cyclone used the {{convert|427|cid|cc|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} [[Ford FE engine]] that went into the standard Comet. For Comet Cyclones equipped with the optional 427 [[Ford FE engine|Ford FE]] {{convert|410|hp|kW|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} engine there were no changes to the body work. Only a small, chromed badge with the designation '427' located on each front fender reflected the larger displacement engine under the hood (bonnet).

==Third generation (1968-1969) ==
[[File:Mercury Cyclone 1969 (6142560102).jpg|thumb|1969 Mercury Cyclone]]
[[File:1969 Mercury Cyclone Cobra Jet.jpg|alt=|thumb|1969 Mercury Cyclone Cobra Jet]]
[[File:Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II Dan Gurney.jpg|thumb|1969 Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II]]

=== 1968 ===
The 1968 models dropped "Comet" from their name. The Cyclones had a mid tire level body tape stripe.  The Cyclone GT's had an upper level body stripe, buckets, wide whitewall tires, special wheel covers, all vinyl interior, and the special handling package. 
It was named the fastest car of that year,{{how|date=November 2012}} because it set a world record speed of {{convert|189.22|mph|kph||abbr=on}} at Daytona.{{clarify|date=November 2012}}

Several engines were available for the Cyclones:&lt;!--- see talk page under 1968  ---&gt;

The {{convert|302|cid|cc|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} standard engine was available as either the two-barrel carburetor, which generated {{convert|210|hp|kW|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}, or the four-barrel carburetor, which generated {{convert|230|hp|kW|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}.

The {{convert|390|cid|cc|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} optional engine (standard for GT) was available as either the two-barrel carburetor, which generated {{convert|265|hp|kW|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}, or the four-barrel carburetor, which generated {{convert|325|hp|kW|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}.

The limited production 428CJ became available mid year and was rated 335hp

=== 1969 ===
In 1969, the Cyclones had several engine options:

The {{convert|302|cid|cc|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} engine was available with {{convert|220|hp|kW|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}.

The {{convert|351|cid|cc|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} engine had two versions: one was {{convert|250|hp|kW|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} and the other was {{convert|290|hp|kW|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}.

The {{convert|390|cid|cc|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} engine for the GTs was available with {{convert|320|hp|kW|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}.

There was also a Cyclone Spoiler with a 390 Improved Performance engine that made 325Hp with the  735cfm Holley Carb  

&lt;br /&gt;

====Spoiler II====
{{main|Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II}}
Mercury produced a version of the Cyclone for [[NASCAR]] called the Cyclone Spoiler II. The model was available in two flavors. The street version featured a  {{convert|351|cid|cc|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} [[Ford Windsor engine|Windsor]] block, and was used to enter into the NASCAR business. The racing version featured a {{convert|429|cid|cc|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} [[Boss 429|Boss]] block, which was the same engine as the one in the [[Ford Mustang (first generation)#1969–1970|1969 Boss Mustang]].

====Cobra Jet====
Mercury also added a new model to the Cyclone line: the Cobra Jet (CJ).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.houseofamericancars.com/you-probably-havent-even-heard-of-these-5-exceptional-classic-muscle-cars/3/|title=You probably haven’t even heard of these 5 exceptional classic muscle cars!!!! {{!}} Page 3 of 6 {{!}} House Of American Cars|date=2018-06-16|work=House Of American Cars|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cobra Jet's engine was a {{convert|428|cid|cc|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} which generated {{convert|335|hp|kW|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}. The engine had a Ram Air option, a 735 [[cubic feet per minute|CFM]] Holley four-barrel carburetor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shea|first1=Terry|title=1969 Mercury Cyclone CJ|url=https://www.hemmings.com/magazine/mus/2012/08/1969-Mercury-Cyclone-CJ/3715091.html|website=Hemmings Muscle Machines|publisher=Hemmings Motor News|accessdate=14 February 2018|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the option showed no quoted difference in horsepower rating. The Mercury Cyclone CJ had the following enhancements over the Cyclone and Cyclone GT: it had a blacked-out grille; dual exhausts; 3:50:1 axle ratio; engine dress-up kit ([[chrome plating|chromed]] parts); hood (bonnet) stripes; and a competition handling package.

==Fourth generation (1970-1971) ==

=== 1970 ===
[[File:1970 Mercury Cyclone GT.jpg|alt=|thumb|275x275px|A 1970 Cyclone GT (429 Cobra Jet).]]
[[File:1970 Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II.jpg|thumb|1970 Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II (1 built) ]]
The CJ model was dropped from the Cyclone lineup, and applied to some of the engine names in the series. Mercury thus featured the Cyclone, Cyclone Spoiler and Cyclone GT. The Cyclones consisted of 351 cid V8s and 429 cid V8 engines.

The standard engine for the base Cyclone was the {{convert|429|cid|cc|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} four-barrel with dual exhaust that was rated at {{convert|360|hp|kW|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} SAE gross ({{convert|250|hp|kW|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} net). It was the standard engine in the 1970 [[Mercury Marauder|Mercury Marauder X-100]] and was available in other full-size models. It featured a 575 CFM carburetor.

Two optional engines were available for the Cyclone. The 429 Cobra Jet was the {{convert|429|cid|cc|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} four-barrel with dual exhaust but with the Ram Air induction.  It was rated at {{convert|370|hp|kW|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} SAE gross ({{convert|305|hp|kW|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} net) and had a 720 CFM Rochester Quadrajet 4 BBL carburetor. The 429 Super Cobra Jet, which was part of a Drag Pack option, was a {{convert|429|cid|cc|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} four-barrel with dual exhaust and Ram Air induction, but it was rated at {{convert|375|hp|kW|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} SAE gross ({{convert|335|hp|kW|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} net), and had a 780 CFM Holley 4 BBL carburetor.

====1970 Cyclone Spoiler====
The Cyclone Spoiler was for the performance-minded with front and rear spoilers, black or white racing stripes that went from front to the rear of the car, an integrated functional hood scoop for ram air induction, 140&amp;nbsp;mph speedometer with a four-gauge suite including an 8,000&amp;nbsp;rpm tachometer with adjustable red line,  vinyl bucket seats, dual racing mirrors and a competition suspension package.  The 429 Cobra Jet with Ram Air was the standard engine for the Cyclone Spoiler, with the 429 Super Cobra Jet with Drag Pak and Super Drag Pak optional. The Super Cobra Jet upgraded the block to four main bolts and provided a mechanical flat-tappet camshaft, and the carburetor was changed from a 720&amp;nbsp;cfm Rochester QudraJet to a 780&amp;nbsp;cfm Holley. Standard with the SCJ was the Drag Pack, this package added a front-mounted engine oil cooler and a 3.91 ratio gear, while the Super Drag Pack offered a 4.30 ratio gear and a Detroit "no spin" locker differential.  Colors for the Spoiler were limited to Competition Yellow, Competition Blue, pastel blue, Competition Gold, Competition Green and Competition Orange but for a premium Ford included the 'color of your dreams' program, and 31 buyers took advantage.

Ford had intended to continue the Spoiler II option for 1970 with an even more aggressive nose profile. However, none were actually built, and the photos that exist from Ford were of a clay model built as a styling study.

====1970 Cyclone GT====
For the sporting gentleman that placed more emphasis in style than speed, there was the Cyclone GT. The basic package offered comfort weave bucket seats, full-length console, twin racing mirrors, integrated hood scoop that could be made functional for optional ram air induction, hide-away headlights, three pod tail lights and unique lower-body line trim. The cost of all of this style was the having a 351 Cleveland small block with 2-barrel carburetor and a three-speed manual transmission as standard fare. However, there were options, and they were good ones. The 4-barrel version of the Cleveland small block followed by a set of 429 cid big blocks up to the Super Cobra Jet and the Drag Pak plus a four-speed transmission and a selection of automatics. Although early sales literature shows the BOSS 429 as an option, none were actually built. An oddity with the GT was the Action Special Package, for which 933 buyers pulled the trigger. Most notable about the package was the loss of the comfort weave buckets in favor of a spectrum stripe bench seat.

=== 1971 ===
In 1971, the Cyclone had some minor styling updates; most noticeable was center section of the grill received a larger ring in the gun site with the GT receiving a unique badge. The Spoiler received a revised stripe package, and the rear spoiler was painted flat black, and the Base Cyclone now had the integrated hood scoop like the GT and Spoiler. Under the hood things were different as well. Gone was the Super Cobra Jet and Drag Pak options, and the base engine for the Base and Spoiler became the M code 351 Cleveland with 4-barrel carburetor. For the Spoiler, Ram Air also became option as opposed to part of the package for 1970. Beyond minor changes in the color pallet and available options, the 1971 Cyclone line was a carry over from 1970.

==Fifth generation (1972) ==

=== 1972 ===
For 1972, the Mercury Montego was fully redesigned with body-on-frame construction, front and rear coil spring suspension, and a new shorter 114-inch wheelbase for two-door models.  The Cyclone was reverted to a performance option package available on Mercury Montego, Mercury Montego MX two-door, and the Mercury Montego GT.  The package included one of two engines, the  {{convert|351|cid|cc|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} 4-barrel Cleveland small block engine rated at {{convert|205|hp|kW|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} SAE net or the {{convert|429|cid|cc|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} 4-barrel Cobra Jet rated at {{convert|248|hp|kW|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} SAE net.  The option group included a functional Ram Air induction through twin integrated hood scoops, Traction-Lok (limited slip) differential, F70-14 for {{convert|351|cid|cc|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} cars, and G70-14 tires for {{convert|429|cid|cc|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} powered cars, hub caps and trim rings, body striping and identification, three-spoke steering wheel and dual racing mirrors.  The {{convert|351|cid|cc|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} was available with either a 4-speed manual transmission or 3-speed automatic, while the {{convert|429|cid|cc|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} was only sold with an automatic transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matthew Litwin|url=http://www.hemmings.com/mus/stories/2013/02/01/hmn_buyers_guide1.html|title=1972-'73 Mercury Montego GT|publisher=Hemmings Motor News|date=2013-02-01|accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Mercury factory literature showed this option available, while later editions did not have any information on the Cyclone package.  Only 30 1972 Cyclone package cars were produced, 29 Montego GT's and one Montego MX.  Twenty of these Cyclones were equipped with the {{convert|429|cid|cc|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matthew Litwin|url=http://www.hemmings.com/mus/stories/2013/02/01/hmn_buyers_guide1.html|title=1972-'73 Mercury Montego GT|publisher=Hemmings Motor News|date=2013-02-01|accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in motorsport ==
[[File:Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum in 2017 - A.J. Foyt, A Legendary Exhibition - 34.jpg|thumb|1971 Cyclone driven by [[A. J. Foyt]] and [[David Pearson (racing driver)|David Pearson]]]]
During its production, the Mercury (Comet) Cyclone represented the brand in motorsport.  Initially gaining use in [[drag racing]], the Cyclone was raced in [[NASCAR]] alongside the Fairlane and its Torino successor, with the fourth-generation Cyclone becoming one of the most dominant body styles ever used in [[Winston Cup|Winston Cup racing]].  In the [[1968 Daytona 500]], the Cyclone took both first and second place.  The [[Wood Brothers Racing]] #21 1971 Cyclone still holds a NASCAR record, for 18 wins out of 32 races.  For the [[1972 Daytona 500]], 12 of the 40 cars in the race were Cyclones.  

The dominance of the Cyclone would lead to the development of the "[[Aero Warriors]]", body styles of production muscle cars aerodynamically optimized for Winston Cup racing (following their homologation).  Alongside the [[Ford Torino Talladega]], the Cyclone Spoiler II was introduced to compete with [[Dodge Charger Daytona]] and [[Plymouth Superbird]]. Although a redesigned Spoiler II was developed in 1970, only a single prototype was produced (alongside three Torino King Cobra counterparts). 

For 1971, NASCAR changed its rules to end the production of aerodynamically-optimized cars, increasing their homologation requirements and restricting their engine displacement.

Following the shift of the Cougar from the Mustang to the Montego chassis, Mercury-body NASCAR teams phased out the Cyclone in favor of the Cougar XR7, introduced in 1974.

The '''Mercury Eight''' is an automobile that was marketed by the [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] division of Ford between 1939 and 1951.  The debut model line of the Mercury division, Ford slotted the full-size Mercury Eight between the [[1937 Ford|Ford Deluxe]] (later [[1941 Ford|Custom]]) model lines and the [[Lincoln H-series|Lincoln]].  In total, Ford assembled three generations of the Eight (before and after World War II).    

During its production, the Eight offered a full range of body styles, including coupes, sedans, convertibles, and station wagons.  For its first generation, the Eight was produced with its own body, adapting its own version of a Ford body for its second generation; for the third generation, the Eight shared its body with the [[Lincoln EL-series|Lincoln]].

For the 1952 model year, Ford expanded its namesake division to three nameplates and Lincoln and Mercury to two each, with Mercury replacing the Eight with [[Mercury Monterey|Monterey]] (introduced in 1950 as a trim option), lasting until 1974.

The advertisements for this car declared it to be "The car that truly dares to ask 'Why?'", referring to the idea that a big car couldn't also be economical.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; The Mercury was priced in the thousand dollar range, several hundred dollars more than the Ford V-8, several hundred less than the [[Lincoln-Zephyr]] and about the same as the upper-range [[Oldsmobile]] and [[Dodge]]s, [[Hudson (automobile)|Hudson]]s, and the lower-range [[Buick]]s and [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]]s, sales from all of which, it was hoped, the new Mercury would usurp.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; Its engine was a 95&amp;nbsp;hp version of the [[Ford flathead V8 engine]], its styling was inspired by the [[Lincoln-Zephyr|Zephyr]], and it had [[hydraulic brake]]s from the beginning.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; With a wheelbase of {{Convert|116.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} and an overall length of {{Convert|196.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, it was a good-sized car, which the Ford company advertised extensively, together with its up-to-20 mpg performance-"few cars of any size can equal such economy."&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; Double sun visors became standard in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1940_Mercury/1940_Mercury_Brochure/1940%20Mercury-05-06.html |title=Directory Index: Mercury/1940_Mercury/1940_Mercury_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Braking was via 12-inch [[Drum brakes|drums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1940_Mercury/1940_Mercury_Brochure/1940%20Mercury-19.html |title=Directory Index: Mercury/1940_Mercury/1940_Mercury_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although "Eight" script would not appear on the front of the hood until the 1941 model year, sales literature prominently referred to the car as the "Mercury Eight" from the very beginning. This is no doubt because the actual series names, 99A in 1939&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; and 09A in 1940,&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; were somewhat less enticing. A 1940 09A model has the words "Mercury Eight" in an emblem that runs from front to rear alongside the top hood lines on both sides.  It appears as chrome wording on top of a double red bar.

By the end of 1940 Mercury could run with the headline "It's made 150,000 owners change cars!"&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;

The 1941 Mercury Eight got all-new styling and some engineering improvements. The Mercury now shared its bodyshell with Ford, probably to lower Mercury production costs. Mercury's wheelbase was expanded by {{Convert|2.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} to {{Convert|118.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; There were many chassis refinements, including improved spring lengths, rates, and deflections, plus changes in shackling, shocks, and an improved stabilizer bar, but the old fashioned transverse springs were still used. The new body featured door bottoms that flared out over the running boards, allowing for wider seats and interiors. The car had {{Convert|2.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} more headroom, two-piece front fenders (three-piece at first), and more glass area. The front pillars were made slimmer and the windshield was widened, deepened, and angled more steeply. Parking lights were separate and set atop the fenders for greater visibility. Headlight bezels were redesigned. In all closed Mercurys the rear-quarter windows opened out. Front vent wings were now crank-operated, and in closed cars the ventilation wing support bars rolled down with the windows. The 4-door [[convertible]], offered in 1940, was gone, but a [[station wagon]] was added. The [[Woodie (car body style)|woodie]] wagon's body behind the engine cowl was identical to Ford's, and produced at the company's [[Ford Iron Mountain Plant|Iron Mountain plant]] in [[Michigan]]'s [[Upper Peninsula]]. The "Eight" script was moved to the rear of the hood. 90,556 Mercury Eights were sold in the 1941 model year.

In 1942 the Mercury Eight's slender bullet parking lights were replaced with rectangular units placed high on the fenders inboard of the headlights. Running boards were now completely concealed under flared door bottoms. The instrument panel now features two identical circles for speedometer and clock with gauges to the left of the speedometer, a glove compartment to the right of the clock, and a large radio speaker cover in the center. The grille looked more like that of the [[Lincoln-Zephyr]] and [[Lincoln Continental|Continental]]. The "Eight" script was gone but an "8" appeared at the top of the grille center. Horsepower was increased to 100. Mercury's biggest engineering news for 1942 was "Liquamatic," Ford's first [[semiautomatic transmission]]. It wasn't much of a success and Mercury wouldn't have another [[automatic transmission]] until [[Cruise-O-Matic|Merc-O-Matic]] appeared in 1951, which was of course a true automatic. Mercury production for the short 1942 model year totaled only 1,902. Output was halted in February 1942 as American auto plants were converted to the exclusive production of war material.

Although Mercury's prewar history was short, the Mercury Eight had already earned for itself the image of being a fine performer in mph as well as mpg, this "hot car" image quite in keeping with its name, chosen by [[Edsel Ford]], that of the fleet-footed messenger of the gods of [[Roman mythology]].&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; The Mercury Eight was strongly identified as an upmarket Ford during this period. In 1945 the Lincoln-Mercury division would be established to change that.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;

A new grille was the most noticeable difference between the 1942 and 1946 Mercurys.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; It had thin vertical bars surrounded by a trim piece painted the same color as the car.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; An "Eight" script now appeared down its center. The Liquimatic automatic transmission option was eliminated.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; The most distinctive new Mercury was the Sportsman convertible.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; It featured wood body panels.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Only 205 examples of it were produced and it was discontinued the following model year.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Mercury Eight sales totaled 86,603.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;

Styling changes were slight in 1947.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; The Mercury name was placed on the side of the hood.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Different hubcaps were used.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; The border around the grille was chrome plated.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; The "Eight" script still ran down its center. There was also new trunk trim.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; More chrome was used on the interior and the dash dial faces were redesigned.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; The convertible and station wagon came with leather upholstery.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; The other body styles used fabric.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; The wood paneled Sportsman convertible was gone.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; 86,363 Mercury Eights were sold.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;

For all practical purposes the 1948 Mercury Eights were identical to the 1947s.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; The major changes consisted of different dial faces and no steering column lock.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; 50,268 Mercury Eights were sold.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;

The first [[World War II|postwar]] Mercury was introduced in the 1949 model year. The engine was a [[Ford Flathead engine|flathead]] [[V8 engine|V8]] that produced slightly more power than the then also newly designed [[1949 Ford]]. A new overdrive system was optional, activated by a handle under the dash.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1950%20Mercury/album_001/1950%20Mercury%20Manual-10-11.html |title=Directory Index: Mercury/1950 Mercury/album_001 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The styling of the Mercury Eight, when it was released in 1949, adopted the "[[Ponton (automobile)|ponton]]" appearance, and was successful in both ending the monotony of warmed-over pre-war style, and differentiating Mercury from its comparable Ford cousin, a trick that spelled sales success.  Sales figures for both Ford and Mercury broke records in 1949. The new approach to styling was also evident on the completely redesigned [[Lincoln EL-series|Lincoln]] and the all-new [[Lincoln Cosmopolitian|Lincoln Cosmopolitan]]. The Mercury Eight used full instrumentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1950%20Mercury/album_001/1950%20Mercury%20Manual-02-03.html |title=Directory Index: Mercury/1950 Mercury/album_001 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; An 8 tube [[AM radio]] was available as an option. The 4-door [[station wagon]] was replaced with a 2-door model.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Although the wagon now featured an all-metal roof, its sides still consisted of wood panels, manufactured at the [[Ford Iron Mountain Plant]].&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;

Within its era and beyond, the Mercury Eight was popular with customizers.  In 1949, [[George Barris (auto customizer)|Sam Barris]] built the first [[lead sled]] from a 1949 Mercury Eight; the Eight became the definitive "[[lead sled]]", much as the [[Ford V-8]] (as the [[Hot rod#Language|"deuce"]]) was becoming the definitive [[hot rod]]. The Eights were among the first models to receive an aftermarket [[Overhead valve|OHV]] engine swap, since [[Oldsmobile]] and [[Cadillac]] developed the first high-compression OHV V8 engines in 1949, whereas Ford was still using a sidevalve engine. Sam and George Barris also used the 1949 body style to build "the most famous custom car ever",&lt;ref&gt;''Rod &amp; Custom'', 8/89, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Hirohata Merc]], for customer Bob Hirohata in 1953. Setting a style and an attitude, it had a "momentous effect" on custom car builders,&lt;ref&gt;DeWitt, John. ''Cool cars, high art: the rise of [[kustom kulture]]'' (University Press of Mississippi, 2001), p.69.&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in several magazines at the time,&lt;ref name="DeWitt, p.70"&gt;DeWitt, p.70&lt;/ref&gt; and reappeared numerous times since, earning an honorable mention on ''Rod &amp; Custom''{{'}}s "Twenty Best of All Time" list in 1991.&lt;ref name="DeWitt, p.70"/&gt; The Eight remains a very popular subject for car modellers.

[[Fiberglass]] replicas of the Eight, inspired by Sam Barris's car, are still in production and are popular with [[custom car|custom]] and rod enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1949-mercury.com/1949-mercury/how-to-chop-a-1949-mercury.htm |title=49 Merc replica (Jan 30, 2009) |publisher=1949-mercury.com |date=2008-02-25 |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, a high-end two-door [[Mercury Monterey|Monterey]] coupe was introduced in the same vein as the [[Ford Crestliner]], the [[Lincoln EL-series|Lincoln]] [[Lincoln Lido|Lido]] coupe and the [[Lincoln Cosmopolitian|Lincoln Cosmopolitan]] [[Lincoln Capri|Capri]] coupe in order to compete with the [[hardtop]] coupes [[General Motors]] had introduced the previous model year. The front suspension was independent with stabilizer bars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1950%20Mercury/1950_Mercury_Foldout/1950%20Mercury%20Foldout-04.html |title=Directory Index: Mercury/1950 Mercury/1950_Mercury_Foldout |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 the Monterey would become its own series.

In 1990, [[Mattel]] [[Hot Wheels]] created a model of 1949 Mercury with a chopped top. It is called ''Purple Passion''.{{CN|date=September 2017}}

{{About|the Mercury station wagon sold from 1957 to 1958|the minivan|Plymouth Voyager|and|Chrysler Voyager|the Mercury station wagon sold from 1966 to 1967|Mercury Comet}}

The '''Mercury Voyager''' is a station wagon that was sold by the [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] division of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] for the 1957 and 1958 model years.  For the 1957 model year, Mercury created a model range of station wagons distinct from sedans, following Ford (and later Edsel).  The Voyager served as the mid-range offering, slotted above the base-trim Mercury Commuter, with the [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|woodgrained]] [[Mercury Colony Park|Colony Park]] serving as the top-range offering. 

For the 1959 model year, Ford consolidated the station wagon nameplates of its non-Lincoln divisions, with the Voyager withdrawn alongside the [[Ford Del Rio]], [[Edsel Roundup]], and [[Edsel Bermuda]].   

== Design overview ==
Following the 1956 introduction of the hardtop station wagon by [[Rambler Six and V8|Rambler]], in 1957, Mercury became the first American manufacturer to produce its entire station wagon line in a hardtop bodystyle.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1957%20Mercury/1957%20Mercury%20Wagons%20Brochure/image3.html|title=1957 Mercury Wagons Brochure|last=Ristic-Petrovic|first=Dusan|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Serving as the mid-range Mercury station wagon, the Voyager was trimmed between the [[Mercury Monterey]] and [[Mercury Montclair]] sedans.  

=== Chassis ===
As with the Commuter, Colony Park, and Mercury sedans of the time, the 1957-1958 Mercury Voyager was constructed using a [[body-on-frame]] chassis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1957%20Mercury/1957%20Mercury%20Wagons%20Brochure/image7.html|title=1957 Mercury Wagons Brochure|last=Ristic-Petrovic|first=Dusan|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sharing its chassis with the rest of the Mercury range, the Voyager is built on a 122-inch wheelbase.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/mercury-cars3.htm|title=How Mercury Cars Work|date=2007-06-06|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its production, the Voyager was offered exclusively with V8 engines.  For 1957, the standard engine was a 312 cubic-inch "[[Ford Y-block engine#312|Safety-Surge]]" V8, producing 255 hp, with a 368 cubic-inch "[[Lincoln Y-block V8 engine#368|Turnpike Cruiser]]" V8 producing 290 hp as an option.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For 1958, Mercury revised its engine offerings, introducing the [[Ford MEL engine|MEL-series V8]].  A 383 cubic-inch "[[Ford MEL engine#383|Marauder]]" V8 producing 330 hp, was standard for the Voyager, with a 430 cubic-inch "[[Ford MEL engine#430|Super Marauder]]" V8 was an option, producing 400 hp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1958%20Mercury/1958_Mercury_Wagons_Brochure/1958%20Mercury%20Wagons-12.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1958 Mercury/1958_Mercury_Wagons_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Super Marauder V8 was notable for becoming the first American mass-produced engine to reach an output of 400 hp.  

For all four V8 engines, a 3-speed "[[Cruise-O-Matic|Merc-O-Matic]]" automatic transmission was used.  In a break from Ford and Edsel, Mercury used dashboard-mounted push-button controls for the automatic transmission.       

=== Body design ===
During its production, the Voyager was offered in two body configurations: two-door and four-door.  Produced solely as a [[Hardtop#United States|pillarless hardtop]], a forward-facing third-row seat was offered on four-door Voyagers, expanding seating capacity from six to nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1957%20Mercury/1957%20Mercury%20Wagons%20Brochure/image4.html|title=1957 Mercury Wagons Brochure|last=Ristic-Petrovic|first=Dusan|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1958%20Mercury/1958_Mercury_Wagons_Brochure/1958%20Mercury%20Wagons-06-07.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1958 Mercury/1958_Mercury_Wagons_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a design that would be modified on later Ford/Mercury station wagons, the rear window lowers into the tailgate, which folds flat against the load floor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;    

For 1958, the exterior underwent a minor revision.  Along with the standardization of quad headlamps, more conservative front styling was added.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/mercury-cars4.htm|title=How Mercury Cars Work|date=2007-06-06|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the revision was centered around an effort to better integrate the grille and front bumper, the "pie-wedge" taillamps were replaced by a "rocket-style" design, along with additional chrome trim on the C-pillar.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;      &lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

The '''Mercury Commuter''' is a [[full-size]] [[station wagon]] that was produced by [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] from 1957 to 1968. When introduced for the 1957 model year it was priced below Mercury's other two new full size wagons, the [[Mercury Voyager|Voyager]] and the [[Mercury Colony Park|Colony Park]]. In 1957 the same {{convert|368|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Lincoln_Y-block_V8_engine#368|Lincoln Y-Block]] [[V8 engine|V8]] that was standard equipment on the [[Mercury Turnpike Cruiser]] was optional equipment on the Commuter. 

It was initially available as a two-door wagon and as a four-door wagon with the former discontinued after the 1959 model year. The Commuter was temporarily absent in 1963, in concession to the new [[Mercury Meteor|Meteor]] station wagons, but was reinstated for 1964, when the Meteor was discontinued. The Commuter was phased out for good, like the full-size Mercury [[Mercury Montclair|Montclair]] and [[Mercury Park Lane|Park Lane]], after the 1968 model year.

'''Mercury Cougar''' is a nameplate applied to a diverse series of automobiles sold by the [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] division of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] from 1967 to 1997 and from 1999 to 2002. While the nameplate is most commonly associated with two-door coupes, at various times during its production, the Cougar was also marketed as a convertible, four-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]], station wagon, and hatchback.

With 2,972,784 examples produced, the Cougar is the highest-selling vehicle ever produced by the Mercury brand; its 34-year production is second only to the [[Mercury Grand Marquis|Grand Marquis]] in the Mercury model line (produced for 36 years). During the 1970s and 1980s, the Cougar was closely tied to the marketing of the Mercury division; Mercury advertised its dealers as "The Sign of the Cat" with [[big cat]]s atop Lincoln-Mercury dealer signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gretoville.com/interest_autos_cougarhistory.htm|title=The Sign of the Cat |last=Jewett |first=Larry |date=|publisher=Gretoville.com|accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with the Cougar, several animal-related nameplates were adopted by the division, including the Bobcat, Lynx, and Sable.

During its production, the Cougar was assembled at the [[Dearborn Assembly Plant]] (part of the [[Ford River Rouge Complex]]) in [[Dearborn, Michigan]] from 1967 to 1973, [[San Jose Assembly Plant|San Jose Assembly]] ([[Milpitas, California]]) from 1968 into early 1969, [[Lorain Assembly]] ([[Lorain, Ohio]]) from 1974 to 1997, and at [[Flat Rock Assembly Plant|Flat Rock Assembly]] ([[Flat Rock, Michigan]]) from 1999 to 2002.
{{TOC limit|3}}

== Overview ==
During much of its production life, the Cougar followed tradition within the Mercury division, marketed as a Mercury counterpart of a Ford vehicle. The models were distinguished by a exterior ranging in degree from grilles and lighting components to nearly the entire exterior, the Cougar shared its chassis underpinnings with Ford vehicles throughout its production life.

For its first two generations, the Cougar was derived from the Ford Mustang; initially developed as a pony car, it replaced the Cyclone muscle car in the Mercury model line.

For its third and fourth generations, the Cougar adopted the chassis of the Ford Torino intermediate. Initially the counterpart of the [[Ford Elite|Ford (Gran Torino) Elite]], the fourth generation was split into two model lines, replacing the Montego as the Mercury intermediate (alongside the Ford LTD II), with the Cougar XR7 becoming the counterpart of the Ford Thunderbird.

For its fifth and sixth generations, the Cougar adopted the compact Fox platform. For the fifth generation, the Cougar was again two model lines, with the Cougar XR7 derived from the Thunderbird and the standard Cougar replacing the Monarch as the counterpart of the Ford Granada. The sixth generation Cougar, derived from the Thunderbird, reverted to the two-door coupe body style.

For its seventh generation, the Cougar introduced the [[Ford MN12 platform|MN12]] platform, developed for the Cougar, Thunderbird and Lincoln Mark VIII. After 1997, the Cougar and Thunderbird were discontinued (the Mark VIII was discontinued after 1998).

For its eighth generation, the Cougar returned for 1999 as a [[Sport compact|sports compact]] hatchback. Sharing a chassis with the [[Ford Mondeo (first generation)|Ford Contour]], the model line began development as a third generation of the Ford Probe, shifting to Mercury as its development neared completion. Sold only under the Mercury brand, this generation is the only version of the Cougar with no direct Ford counterpart (though export examples were badged as Ford Cougars).

The introduction of the Cougar finally gave Mercury its own "[[pony car]]". Slotted between the Ford Mustang and the Ford Thunderbird, the Cougar was the performance icon and eventually the icon for the Mercury name for several decades. The Cougar was available in two models (base and XR-7) and only came in one body style (a two-door [[hardtop]], no center or B-pillar). Engine choices ranged from the {{convert|200|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|289|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} two-barrel [[V8 engine|V8]] to the {{convert|335|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} four-barrel V8. A performance package called the GT was available on both the base and XR-7 Cougars. This included the {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, as well as a performance handling package and other performance enhancements.

The 1967 Cougar, with the internal code T-7, went on sale 30 September 1966.&lt;ref name=aw&gt;{{cite journal|last=Severson |first=Aaron |title=Hand-Me-Down Cat |journal=Autoweek |date=18 March 2013 |volume=63 |issue=6 |pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on the 1967 refreshed first-generation Mustang,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/newsroom/feature_display.cfm?release=25373 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606065905/http://media.ford.com/newsroom/feature_display.cfm?release=25373 |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 June 2007 |title=Ford Motor Company – Featured Story – Fords Past, Present and Future Come to Carlisle |publisher=Media.ford.com |accessdate=2012-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but with a 3-in-longer (111&amp;nbsp;in) wheelbase and new sheet metal. A full-width divided grille with [[hidden headlamp]]s and vertical bars defined the front fascia—it was sometimes called the electric shaver grille. At the rear, a similar treatment had the [[license plate]] surrounded on both sides with vertically slatted grillework concealing tail lights (with [[sequential turn signals]]), a styling touch taken from the Thunderbird.

A deliberate effort was made to give the car a more "European" flavor than the Mustang, at least to American buyers' eyes, drawing inspiration from the popular [[Jaguar E-Type]]. Aside from the base model and the luxurious XR-7, only one performance package was available for either model: the sporty GT. The XR-7 model brought a simulated wood-grained [[dashboard]] with a full set of black-faced competition instruments and [[toggle switch]]es, an overhead console, a T-type center automatic transmission shifter (if equipped with the optional Merc-O-Matic transmission), and leather-vinyl upholstery.

This was the only generation with covered headlights. In 1967 and 1968, they were deployed using a vacuum canister system that opened and closed the headlamp doors. For 1969 and 1970, a redesigned vacuum system kept the doors down when a vacuum condition existed in the lines, provided by the engine when it was running. If a loss of vacuum occurred, the doors would retract up so that the headlights were visible if the system should fail.

The GT package included Ford's {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford FE engine|FE-series big block]], along with an upgraded suspension to handle the extra weight of the big engine and give better handling, more powerful brakes, better tires, and a low-restriction exhaust system. Introduced with the music of [[Herb Alpert]] and the Tijuana Brass' "The Work Song", the Cougar was a sales success from its introduction and helped the Lincoln-Mercury Division's 1967 sales figures substantially. The Cougar was ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Motor Trend Car of the Year|car of the year]] for 1967.

The Cougar continued to be a Mustang twin for seven years, and could be optioned as a [[muscle car]]. Nevertheless, the focus continued away from performance and toward luxury, evolving it into a plush pony car. The signs were becoming clear as early as 1970, when special options styled by fashion designer [[Pauline Trigère]] appeared, a [[houndstooth]]-patterned [[vinyl roof]] and matching upholstery, available together or separately. A facelift in 1971 did away with the hidden headlights and hidden wipers were adopted. Between 1969 and 1973, Cougar [[convertible (car)|convertible]]s were offered.

The 1968 model year included federally mandated [[side marker light]]s and front outboard [[Seat belt#Sash|shoulder belts (sash belt, shoulder harness)]] among some minor changes. A {{convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|302|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} two-barrel V8 was the base engine on all XR-7s and early standard Cougars. Three new engines were added to the option list this year: the {{convert|230|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|302|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}, four-barrel V8; the {{convert|335|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|428|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}, four-barrel V8; and the {{convert|390|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|427|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}, four-barrel V8. In addition, the {{convert|289|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine was made standard on base cars without the interior decor group midway through the model year.

Comfort and performance options available for the Cougar included the "Tilt-Away" steering wheel that swung up and out of the way when the driver's door was opened, the transmission in "park", and the ignition was off,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Ford Swing-Away, Tilt-Away, and Tilt Steering Wheels|url= http://automotivemileposts.com/tbird1961swingaway.html |website=Automotive Mileposts|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1971, a power driver's seat. The new option appeared in 1968: Ford's first factory-installed electric [[sunroof]]. It was available on any hardtop Cougar, but rarely ordered on early cars.

Mercury also made limited versions of Cougar in the performance-market segment. The XR7-G, named for Mercury road racer [[Dan Gurney]], included performance add-ons, such as a [[hood scoop]], Lucas (brand) [[fog lamp]]s, and hood pins. Engine selection was limited to the 302, 390, and 428 V8s. A total of 619 XR7-Gs were produced, and only 14 Gs were produced with the 428 CJ. The 7.0&amp;nbsp;L GT-E package was available on both the standard and XR-7 Cougars and came with the 427 V8. The 428 Cobra Jet [[Ram-air intake|Ram Air]] was available in limited numbers on the GT-E beginning 1 April 1968.&lt;ref&gt;''Guide to Muscle Cars'' Magazine, 6/87, p.79.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservatively rated at {{convert|335|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5200 rpm and {{convert|440|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] at 3400 rpm, the 428 Cobra Jet could produce more than the {{convert|306|kW|hp|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} from the factory. A total of 394 GT-Es were manufactured, 357 with the 427 and 37 with the 428.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CCOA, cougarclub.org |url=http://www.cougarclub.org/registry/productionnumbers.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011224959/http://www.cougarclub.org/registry/productionnumbers.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-10-11 |title=Cougar Club of America production statistics courtesy of Marti Auto Works |publisher=Cougarclub.org |accessdate=2012-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The GT-E came with power front disc brakes as standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunnell|first=John|title=standard catalog of American Muscle Cars 1960–1972|year=2006|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=0-89689-433-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third year of production, 1969, brought several new additions to the Cougar lineup. A convertible model was now available in either standard and XR-7 trim. The grille switched from vertical bars to horizontal bars. Tail lights still spanned the entire rear of the car and retained vertical chrome dividers, but were now concave rather than convex. Body sides now featured a prominent line that swept downward from the nose to just ahead of the rear wheels. Vent windows were removed.&lt;ref&gt;http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---Oct/1969-Mercury-Cougar-Brochgure-Rev/1969-Mercury-Cougar-Rev--05&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance packages were revised. The GT, XR-7G, and 7.0-L GT-E were discontinued, but the 390 and 428 V8s remained. The 302 engines were dropped, except for the "Boss" version, available only with the Eliminator package. The new standard Cougar engine was a 250-horsepower 351 Windsor. A {{convert|290|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 351 Windsor V8 was also added to the engine lineup. The Eliminator performance package appeared for the first time. A {{convert|351|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} four-barrel Windsor V8 was standard, with the 390 four-barrel V8, the 428CJ, and the Boss 302 available as options. The Eliminator also featured a blacked-out grille, special side stripes, front and rear spoilers, an optional [[Cold air intake|Ram Air induction]] system, a full gauge package including tachometer, upgraded "Decor" interior trim, special high-back bucket seats, rally wheels, raised white letter tires, and a performance-tuned suspension and handling package. It also came in vibrant colors, such as white, bright blue metallic, competition orange, and bright yellow.

Only two Cougars were produced with the Boss 429 V8 as factory drag cars for "Fast Eddie" Schartman and "Dyno" Don Nicholson. A 1969-only package was the Cougar Sports Special that included unique pin striping, "turbine" style wheel covers, and rocker panel moldings with simulated side scoops. Décor interior and performance suspension were available for the Sports Special, as were any of the optional Cougar engines, other than the Boss 302. No badges or decals denoted the Sports Special option on either the interior or exterior.

For 1970, the Cougar appearance was similar to the 1969 model, but changes were made. A new front end featured a pronounced center hood extension and electric shaver grille similar to the 1967 and 1968 Cougars. Federally mandated locking steering columns appeared inside, and high-backed bucket seats, similar to those included in the 1969 Eliminator package, became standard on all Cougars. Other changes included revised tail light bezels, new front bumper and front fender extensions, and larger, recessed side markers. The {{convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 351 "Cleveland" V8 was now more available, having been featured in some 1969 XR7 models. though both the Cleveland and Windsor engines were available as the base model two-barrel engine. The 390 FE engine was now dropped, and the Boss 302 and 428CJ continued. The Eliminator received with new striping, revised colors, and the four-barrel 351 Cleveland replacing the four-barrel 351 Windsor as the standard engine. The upgraded "Décor" interior and styled steel wheels, standard '69 Eliminator equipment, were moved to the options list for the 1970 Eliminator. No Eliminator convertibles were factory produced in either 1969 or 1970. New options for the 1970 Cougar were interior upholstery and vinyl top in bold houndstooth check patterns.

For 1971, the Cougar was restyled, weighed less, and had only a one-inch-longer wheelbase than its predecessors (112 vs. 111 – which was similar to GM's intermediate-sized two-door models, such as the Olds Cutlass). The front end now featured four exposed headlights; the disappearing headlights were eliminated. The center grille piece was now larger, sharing its appearance with the 1971 [[Mercury Cyclone]]. The rear featured a semifastback with a "[[flying buttress]]" sail-panel. The [[convertible (car)|convertible]] returned, as did the XR-7 and the GT package. The Eliminator package was dropped, but the Ram Air option remained. The engine lineup was revised for 1971, as well. Now only three engines were offered—the standard {{convert|240|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 351 (Cleveland or Windsor) two-barrel V8, the {{convert|285|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 351 Cleveland four-barrel V8, and the {{convert|370|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 429 Cobra Jet four-barrel V8.

By 1972, the climate had begun to change as the muscle car era ended. No longer able to use gross power numbers, the manufacturers had to use net power figures, which dropped the once-mighty figures down substantially. Engines were shuffled around a bit with the 429 engine option no longer available. They were now the standard {{Convert|163|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 351 Cleveland two-barrel V8, or the {{convert|266|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 351C four-barrel Cobra Jet V8. Other than that, the Cougar remained a carryover from 1971. Only minor trim details were changed in 1972. The big-block engines were gone for 1972 and 1973. The days of performance-oriented muscle cars were coming to an end.

Aside from minor grille and taillight changes, 1973 would be largely a carryover year for the Cougar, but it would mark the last year of the Mustang-based Cougar and the final run of Cougar convertibles; a light blue/white Cougar XR-7 convertible was actually the "last" convertible built by Ford Motor Company in the 1970s. An automatic transmission and power front disc brakes became standard, though a 4-speed manual transmission was still available as a rarely ordered option. Many changes were scheduled for the 1973 models. Power figures continued to change, as new federal/[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] regulations began their stranglehold on the V8 engines. The new figures continued to fluctuate, but engine options remained unchanged from 1972. The standard engine continued to be the {{convert|168|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 351 Cleveland two-barrel V8. Optional was the {{convert|264|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 351 Cobra Jet V8.

Additionally, an arguably little known trim style and certain mandatory options (e.g. hardtop) of Cougar was the "Bronze Age" edition made by Mercury in 1973 (also made for the models: [[Mercury Monterey]], Mercury Montego MX, and [[Mercury Comet]] of that year).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontiernet.net/~cougardb/dealers.htm |title=Other Special Cougars |work=Cougar Club of America |year=2000 |accessdate=2016-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Cougar A Source Book, edited and annotated by Thomas E Bonsall, 1967 Thru 1976" page 118.&lt;/ref&gt; While it was marketed primarily in copper metallic colors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mclellansautomotive.com/photos/B38784-2.jpg|title=Auto Literature, Car Sales Brochures &amp; Catalogs: McLellans Automotive|first=Robert|last=McLellan|website=www.mclellansautomotive.com}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was also available in 6 other colors: ivy glamour metallic, green metallic, medium brown metallic, saddle bronze, medium yellow gold and white.

For 1974, the Cougar was shifted from its Mustang ponycar origins and upsized onto a different platform and into a new market as a [[personal luxury car]]. It now shared a chassis with the larger [[Mercury Montego]]/[[Ford Torino]] intermediates and lent itself to create a Ford badged version released in February 1974 called [[Ford Elite|Gran Torino Elite]]. The wheelbase grew to {{convert|114|in|mm|0}} and became practically the only car to be upsized during the downsizing decade of the 1970s. These years marked the end of the "luxurious Mustang", and the beginning of the Cougar's move towards becoming a "junior Thunderbird" and eventually a sibling of the Thunderbird. TV commercials compared the Cougar to the [[Lincoln Continental Mark IV|Continental Mark IV]], the most notable featuring [[Farrah Fawcett]] in a 1975 TV ad.

The Cougar was marketed as an intermediate-sized personal-luxury car to compete against GM's [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]] and [[Buick Regal]], in addition to the 1975 [[Chrysler Cordoba]], while its corporate twin the Elite with its Thunderbird-like styling competed against the [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]], [[Pontiac Grand Prix]], and the [[Dodge Charger]]. Almost every GM division had an entry in this market by 1974, and the market was too large to ignore so both Ford and Mercury expanded their offerings to compete.

The new Cougar paid homage to its smaller predecessor with a three-piece grille up front, topped by a new hood ornament which featured the Jaguar-like silhouette of a creeping Cougar. The car's Montego heritage was fairly evident from the sides and back. The Cougar acquired the ''[[sine qua non]]'' of the personal luxury car in the 1970s: [[opera window]]s. The opera windows were rectangular shaped glass mounted in the C-pillars and accompanied by a standard partial rear section vinyl roof. This body ran unchanged for three years, and during this period all Cougars were XR-7s; the base model and convertible were dropped.

Engine offerings for 1974 included a standard 351 V8 Cleveland 2V, optional but seldom ordered Q-code 351 "Cobra Jet" V8, 400 2V, and 460 4V; in 1975 the Cleveland 2V was replaced by the 351M. The automatic transmission became standard for all Cougars.

Since the Cougar was based on the Montego, it used the same interior except for some minor trim and upholstery. Interior offerings during these three years included a standard bench seat with cloth or vinyl upholstery, an optional Twin-Comfort Lounge 60/40 bench seat with center armrest and cloth, vinyl or optional leather trim; or all-vinyl bucket seats with center console. Although the car still lacked a fixed "B" pillar, the rear windows no longer rolled down, making the car more like a coupe than a true [[hardtop]].

In 1975, the Cougar XR-7 continued to add more luxury features as it moved upmarket. But with more features, the Cougar was gaining in weight, as well. Compared to the 1967 version, the 1975 version weighed a full 1,000&amp;nbsp;lb (450&amp;nbsp;kg) more. Despite the added weight, the buying public wanted the Cougar, and sales figures reflected that fact. For the performance fans, however, a high-performance rear axle and 'Traction-Lok' differential continued to be on the option sheet. The standard engine continued to be the {{convert|148|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 351M two-barrel V8 with the {{convert|158|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 400 two-barrel V8 and {{convert|216|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 460 four-barrel V8 optional. Visually, the only change from 1974 was the addition of two rectangular openings in the center section of the front bumper.&lt;ref&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975, Revised 4th Edition, page 546&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1976 Cougar carried over largely unchanged from 1975. Minor trim pieces served to differentiate this year from last. Engines continued unchanged, as well. The high-performance axle and Traction-Lok differential were dropped. Twin Comfort Lounge reclining seats, with or without [[velour]] cloth trim, were the only major change for the interior.

The sheetmetal of this generation remained in use in [[stock car racing]] during the mid-1970s. A [[Wood Brothers Racing]] Mercury Cougar was the winner of the 1976 Daytona 500. Other teams, including [[Bud Moore Engineering]], would continue to race this generation of Cougar in [[Winston Cup]] through the 1980 season.

For the 1977 model year, the fourth-generation Cougar was part of a revision of the Ford intermediate model line. The Cougar XR-7 underwent a redesign with the standard Cougar returning (for the first time since 1973) in place of the Montego. For the first time, the Cougar XR-7 was the Mercury counterpart of the [[Ford Thunderbird (seventh generation)|Ford Thunderbird]] (a pairing that lasted through 1997) with Ford marketing the standard Cougar as the [[Ford LTD II]]. 

The fourth generation is the best-selling version of the Cougar; with 1978 as the top-selling year for the entire model line. For 1980, Ford ended production of Torino-based vehicles, downsizing the Cougar XR-7 to a long-wheelbase version of the Fox platform.

=== Chassis ===
As with its predecessor, the fourth-generation Cougar was based from the [[Ford Torino]] "split-wheelbase" chassis. Cougar coupes and Cougar XR-7s had a 114-inch wheelbase while Cougar four-doors and station wagons had a 118-inch wheel base.

In the redesign, the powertrain offerings were revised. In the interest of fuel economy, the 460 V8 was withdrawn from intermediates, with the 173&amp;nbsp;hp 400 V8 as the highest-displacement engine. The base V8 in coupes and sedans was a 134&amp;nbsp;hp 302 Windsor V8, with a 149&amp;nbsp;hp 351 Windsor as the standard engine in station wagons; a 161&amp;nbsp;hp 351M V8 was optional in coupes and sedans. A 3-speed automatic transmission was paired to each V8 engine.

For 1978, the Cougar offered the same engines from 1977; for 1979, the 400 was discontinued.

=== Body design ===
In its replacement of the Montego, for 1977, the Cougar model line was expanded from one body style to four. Along with previous Cougar XR-7 luxury coupe, Mercury introduced a Cougar two-door coupe, a four-door sedan, and a five-door station wagon.

A central part of the 1977 redesign of the Ford intermediate range was a transition from "fuselage styling" to sharper-edged lines. As funds were concentrated on development of future models, a complete exterior redesign was precluded. On coupes, sedans, and XR-7s, all sheetmetal above the bumpers was revised. As a revision of the station wagon rear bodywork was too extensive, the Cougar/LTD II wagons adopted the redesigned 1977 front fascia on the bodywork of the previous Montego station wagon. Following the 1977 model year, the Cougar wagon was withdrawn in favor of the all new [[Ford Fairmont|Mercury Zephyr]] wagon.

To bring the exterior closer in line with the larger Marquis, the Cougar adopted a nearly square radiator-style grille; in place of hidden headlamps, the Cougar adopted four square headlamps.

For 1979, though in its last year, the Cougar adopted a few body revisions, with revised taillamps and body-color grille inserts, along with an electronic voltage regulator and a plastic battery tray.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Trim ===
For 1977, the Cougar was introduced in three trim levels: a base trim level and Brougham trim (for wagons, a Villager trim was offered). For 1978, the Cougar became a single trim level, with the Brougham returning as an option package.

=== Cougar XR-7 ===
As with the previous generation, the Cougar personal luxury coupe continued as the Cougar XR-7. No longer a "junior Thunderbird", the XR-7 was the direct Mercury counterpart of the Thunderbird (a commonality remaining for the next 20 years). To differentiate the model from its Ford counterpart (and from standard Cougars), the XR-7 was given its own rear fascia. Evoking the flagship [[Lincoln Continental Mark V|Continental Mark V]], the rear fascia was given a (vestigial) [[continental tire]] trunklid (with angular lines) and taillights similar to the [[Lincoln Continental Mark IV|Continental Mark IV]]. The XR-7 roofline was distinguished from standard Cougar coupes by narrower hardtop windows and the use of louvers on the forward section of the opera windows.

The XR-7 included power disc brakes and steering, 15-inch wheels, rear stabilizer bar, walnut wood-tone instrument panel, Flight Bench seat, "XR-7" trunk key-hole door, "COUGAR" decklid script, large [[hood ornament]] (with cat emblem), and sport-styled roofline with back-half vinyl and rear opera side windows and louvers. Some XR-7s had the Rally Sport Tachometer and Gauge package (only 25% of all Cougars came with this option).

For 1978, two new decor packages became available, the XR-7 Decor Option and the Midnight/Chamois Decor Option. In line with the Designer Series from the Mark V, the latter option offered a color-coordinated exterior and interior, with a half-vinyl roof, padded "Continental" type rear deck, and Midnight Blue and Chamois interior with Tiffany carpeting.

For the 1980 model year, Mercury downsized the Cougar XR-7. Alongside its Thunderbird counterpart, the XR-7 entered the mid-size segment for the first time, shedding 15 inches in length, 4 inches of width, and approximately 900 pounds of curb weight (depending on powertrain). In a strategy similar to 1977, the standard Cougar returned for 1981 in place of the Monarch in the Mercury product line (sharing its body with the redesigned Ford Granada).

The first Cougar not to offer a V8 as standard equipment, the standard Cougar was produced as a two-door and four-door sedan, adopting the five-door station wagon from the Zephyr from 1982; the model line was repackaged as the Marquis for 1983 as Ford revised its full-size and mid-size product branding.

=== Chassis ===
Both the Cougar XR-7 and mid-size Cougar were produced using the [[Ford Fox platform]].&lt;ref&gt;Dave Epperson, Popular Hot Rodding's All About 1981 Cars, page 49&lt;/ref&gt; The Cougar XR-7 was produced upon an extended-wheelbase Fox chassis (to 108.5 inches), shared with the 1980–1982 Ford Thunderbird, 1982–1987 Lincoln Continental, 1984–1985 Continental Mark VII and 1986–1992 Lincoln Mark VII. The mid-size Cougar shared its 105.5 wheelbase with the Ford Fairmont and Mercury Zephyr, the launch vehicles of the Fox platform.

====Powertrain====
The Cougar XR7 was offered with two V8 engines. Shared with the Mercury Marquis/Colony Park, a 4.2&amp;nbsp;L V8 was standard, with a 4.9&amp;nbsp;L V8 offered as an option; both engines were paired with a 4-speed Ford [[Ford AOD transmission|AOD]] overdrive automatic.

The mid-size Cougar was offered with its own powertrain lineup. Shared with the Fairmont/Zephyr and Mustang/Capri, a 2.3&amp;nbsp;L inline-4 was the standard engine, with a 3.3&amp;nbsp;L inline-6 and a 4.2&amp;nbsp;L V8 offered as options; the four and six-cylinder engines were paired with a 3-speed automatic transmission.

For 1982, an all-new 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 replaced the inline-6; in various forms, the engine would be used by the Cougar and Thunderbird through their 1997 discontinuation. The 4.9&amp;nbsp;L V8 option was withdrawn from the Fox platform, leaving the 4.2&amp;nbsp;L engine as the sole V8 offering for both the Cougar and Cougar XR-7.

=== Body ===
In its development, many design elements of the 1977–1979 Cougar XR-7 were carried forward in the fifth-generation redesign, including its Continental-style trunklid, louvered opera windows, and sharp-edged fender lines. While the fourth-generation Cougar XR-7 had proven highly successful in the marketplace, the design elements fell out of proportion on a radically smaller car, leading to a highly negative reception. In what would prove disastrous, the Cougar saw little to no differentiation from its Ford Thunderbird and Ford Granada counterparts, with the XR-7 externally distinguished only by its grille, exposed headlamps, taillamps, and trunklid.

During the production of the fifth-generation Cougar, the Cougar XR-7 was produced solely as a two-door coupe, with the mid-size Cougar produced as a two-door notchback coupe and four-door sedan. For 1982 only, the mid-size Cougar was offered as a station wagon replacing the Zephyr station wagon. For the first time, Cougar two-door models featured a fixed "B" pillar and a fixed steel frame around front door windows, as in the sedan.

In what would become a long-running tradition for the Mercury brand, 1981 marked the debut of ''GS'' and ''LS'' trim lines for both the mid-size and XR-7 Cougars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1981_Mercury/1981_Mercury_Cougar_Brochure/1981%20Mercury%20Cougar-04.html |title=1981 Mercury Cougar brochure |website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both trim packages were largely similar, though the LS was exclusive to four-doors. The GS package focused on appearance, while the LS package offered luxury touches such as power windows, [[Remote keyless entry|keyless entry external number pad]], and other luxury trim touches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1981_Mercury/1981_Mercury_Cougar_Brochure/1981%20Mercury%20Cougar-13.html |title=1981 Mercury Cougar brochure |website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cougar station wagon was offered in either GS trim or woodgrained Villager trim (the Mercury equivalent of a Ford Squire station wagon).

Ford of Venezuela marketed the Fox-platform Cougar from 1983 to 1986 as the Ford Cougar Brougham four-door sedan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifhp97/35089033676/|title=1983 Ford Cougar Brougham (Venezuela)|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derived from the fifth-generation Cougar sedan, the Ford-badged Cougar Brougham was produced with the front and rear fascias of the 1983–1986 [[Mercury Marquis#Fourth generation (1983–1986)|Mercury Marquis]].

For the 1983 model year, Mercury introduced the sixth generation of the Cougar. As part of an extensive revision of the Ford and Mercury model ranges, the mid-size Mercury model range shifted from the Cougar to the [[Mercury Marquis|Marquis]] (split from the full-size [[Mercury Grand Marquis|Grand Marquis]]). Reverting to its traditional role of a two-door coupe (for the first time since 1976), the Cougar remained a counterpart of the Ford Thunderbird with the two vehicles repackaged as "luxury sport coupes".&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.coolcats.net/modelyear/1983.html|title=Cool Cats, Celebrating The 1983–88 Mercury Cougar|website=www.coolcats.net |access-date=2019-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within Mercury, the Cougar was slotted above the Capri and below the two-door Grand Marquis (both would be discontinued during its production).

Along with marking the first major use of aerodynamic-intensive design in an American automobile, the Cougar and Thunderbird were also the first Ford vehicles developed using [[computer-aided design]] (CAD).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; While given a less aerodynamic roofline than the Thunderbird, the 1983 Cougar was far sleeker than the 1982 Cougar XR7, reducing its [[Drag coefficient|coefficient of drag]] from 0.50 to 0.40&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://validate.perfdrive.com/captcha?ssa=4ce206c6-2f3d-40fe-afe0-97ba4b9e38b1&amp;ssb=g55mb014km50p5zb3bhic6cc6&amp;ssc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.automobile-catalog.com%2Fcar%2F1982%2F1882655%2Fmercury_cougar_xr-7_ls_3_8l_v-6_automatic_overdrive.html&amp;ssd=963554687505970&amp;sse=feglfhikipobm@n&amp;ssf=fd2f22ace0953f4e73d37dd5e1ad94c69d2d757b&amp;ssg=e847953b-5817-1632-3988-c60abdc42f77&amp;ssh=0d38187a-9110-1632-398a-21bfdaa7aa51&amp;ssi=c9c85cc1-a2c8-1632-3488-cc1b84f71659&amp;ssj=e522ef29-65fb-1632-398b-8760468e0348&amp;ssk=support@shieldsquare.com&amp;ssl=326595009698&amp;ssm=29160497950934164104024302639133&amp;ssn=18a67ab25f78edb4b4d909ebc19d4b573f775c391632322096.07659130e2&amp;sso=44d4d369be601f9ef6a6682320da9d9aa0adecff9ced&amp;ssp=23141964851547293007154721533904470&amp;ssq=08691064510619633033245106570569844130286&amp;ssr=MjA4LjgwLjE1NC40OQ==&amp;sss=Mozilla/5.0%20(compatible;%20Googlebot/2.1;%20+http://www.google.com/bot.html)&amp;sst=Citoid%20(Wikimedia%20tool;%20learn%20more%20at%20https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Citoid)&amp;ssu=Chrome/5.0%20(iPhone;%20U;%20CPU%20iPhone%20OS%203_0%20like%20Mac%20OS%20X;%20en-us)%20AppleWebKit/528.18%20(KHTML,%20like%20Gecko)%20Version/4.0%20Mobile/7A341%20Safari/528.16&amp;ssv=unnv3s22mn49p@3&amp;ssw=&amp;ssx=394006721066678&amp;ssy=fa@ajgdneebipmmch@gpjpmidficfdpifmlpmc@b&amp;ssz=3bd1d76e9ea6a34|title=ShieldSquare Captcha|website=validate.perfdrive.com|access-date=2019-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In 1987, the sixth-generation Cougar underwent a mid-cycle revision with aerodynamic improvements, reducing its drag coefficient to 0.36.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.coolcats.net/modelyear/1987.html|title=Cool Cats, Celebrating The 1983–88 Mercury Cougar|website=www.coolcats.net |access-date=2019-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chassis ===
The sixth-generation Cougar retained the rear-wheel drive Ford Fox platform from the fifth generation. In a departure from its predecessor, a shorter 104-inch wheelbase was used (4 inches shorter than the previous XR7).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; As before, traditional Fox-platform underpinnings were retained, including a MacPherson strut/A-arm front suspension with a four-link coil-sprung solid rear axle with front and rear anti-roll bars.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

As with the previous generation, 14-inch wheels and tires were standard, with [[Michelin TRX]] tires and metric-size wheels as an option (shared with the Thunderbird and Capri/Mustang).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; For 1985, 15-inch wheels became an option for the XR7.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coolcats.net/modelyear/1985.html|title=Cool Cats, Celebrating The 1983–88 Mercury Cougar|website=www.coolcats.net |access-date=2019-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Powertrain ====
For its 1983 launch, the sixth-generation Cougar offered a 120&amp;nbsp;hp 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 from its predecessor as a standard engine; a 130&amp;nbsp;hp 4.9&amp;nbsp;L V8 made its return as an optional engine.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; For 1986, the V8 was changed to sequential fuel injection, increasing output to 150&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.coolcats.net/modelyear/1986.html|title=Cool Cats, Celebrating The 1983–88 Mercury Cougar|website=www.coolcats.net |access-date=2019-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 1988, the 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 was given multiport fuel injection, increasing output to 140&amp;nbsp;hp; the 4.9&amp;nbsp;L V8 was retuned to 155&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.coolcats.net/modelyear/1988.html|title=Cool Cats, Celebrating The 1983–88 Mercury Cougar|website=www.coolcats.net |access-date=2019-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1984 to 1986, the XR7 was equipped with a 2.3 L turbocharged inline-4; shared with the Thunderbird Turbo Coupe, the engine produced 145&amp;nbsp;hp with an automatic transmission (155&amp;nbsp;hp with a manual transmission).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; For 1987, the XR7 dropped the turbocharged engine (and 5-speed manual transmission) in favor of the 4.9&amp;nbsp;L V8.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

The 2.3L inline-four was paired with a 5-speed manual transmission; a 3-speed automatic transmission was optional. The 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 was paired with a 3-speed automatic; a 4-speed overdrive automatic was optional (the only transmission with the 4.9&amp;nbsp;L V8).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coolcats.net/modelyear/1986.html|title=Cool Cats, Celebrating The 1983–88 Mercury Cougar|website=www.coolcats.net |access-date=2019-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 1987 and 1988, the 4-speed AOD transmission was fitted to both the 3.8&amp;nbsp;L and 4.9&amp;nbsp;L engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.coolcats.net/modelyear/1988.html|title=Cool Cats, Celebrating The 1983–88 Mercury Cougar |website=www.coolcats.net |access-date=2019-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Exterior ====
The exterior design of the sixth-generation Cougar was designed largely in response to the negative market response to the introduction of the fifth-generation Cougar. While retaining a common chassis, a primary objective for designers was to maximize the visual differentiation between the Thunderbird and Cougar.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; To reduce production costs, the two model lines shared exterior body parts, including front and rear bumpers, both doors, the windshield, the hood and front fenders.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; While the Thunderbird adopted a fastback roofline, the Cougar adopted a notchback roofline with a near-vertical backlight, distinguished by upswept rear side windows.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

During its production, the sixth-generation Cougar underwent several exterior revisions. For 1984, the hood ornament was replaced by a flat hood emblem.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.coolcats.net/modelyear/1984.html|title=Cool Cats, Celebrating The 1983–88 Mercury Cougar|website=www.coolcats.net |access-date=2019-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 1985, the waterfall-style grille was replaced with an egg-crate design (similar to Mercedes-Benz); the red taillamp lenses were replaced by a dark gray design.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; 1986 saw few changes, highlighted by the addition of a government-mandated center rear brake light (CHMSL) and a power-operated moonroof;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; for the last time, the Cougar was available with vent windows.

To mark its 20th year of production, the Cougar underwent an extensive mid-cycle revision for 1987.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Originally slated for the 1986 model year,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; nearly every exterior panel was changed. To visually stretch the roofline, a compound-curved rear window replaced the nearly flat rear glass and the rear quarter windows were redesigned (with a curve inversely matching the windshield angle).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; To further distinguish the model line from the Thunderbird, the 1987 Cougar received its own grille (with a large "cat" emblem), front bumper cover and aerodynamic composite headlamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1987_Mercury/1987_Mercury_Cougar_Brochure/1987%20Mercury%20Cougar-04.html |website=oldcarbrochures.com |title=1987 Mercury Couga brochure |page=4 |accessdate=2020-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shared with the Mustang GT, the Cougar received new 15-inch wheels, becoming the standard alloy wheel design for 1988.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; For 1988, the exterior of the Cougar underwent no changes, introducing several monochromatic paint options.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Interior ====
For its 1983 launch, to lower production costs, the sixth-generation Cougar was required to carry over interior parts from the 1980–1982 Cougar XR7, including a modified dashboard; an analog instrument panel was standard, with a digital instrument panel offered as an option.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; For 1984, the steering column was redesigned, returning horn control to the steering wheel.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; As part of introduction of the XR7, the model introduced an instrument panel including a tachometer and turbocharger boost gauge.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; For 1985, the interior underwent a complete redesign, with new door panels and dashboard; a redesigned rear seat expanded seating capacity to five passengers (four passengers with full-length console).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The standard instrument panel was a digital speedometer with analog secondary gauges; a fully digital instrument panel was optional (the XR7 was given a fully analog instrument panel).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

For the 1987 model year, the Cougar saw few changes to its interior, with the XR7 adopting a fully digital dashboard as standard equipment.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; For 1988, the analog XR7 dashboard made its return; along with the deletion of the boost gauge, the tachometer was revised for a lower-revving V8 engine.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Trim ===
The sixth-generation Cougar continued the trim nomenclature of its predecessor in modified form, with the Cougar GS serving as the base trim, the Cougar LS as the luxury trim, and the Cougar XR7 as the high-performance version. The GS trim was largely used for internal purposes, with advertising dropping the designation entirely.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; For 1987, to move the Cougar upmarket, the Cougar LS became the standard trim level, with both V6 and V8 engines available.

For 1984, the XR7 made its return after a year-long hiatus. Serving as the counterpart of the Thunderbird Turbo Coupe, the XR7 was fitted with a performance-oriented suspension, a turbocharged 2.3&amp;nbsp;L engine (shared with the Turbo Coupe and Mustang SVO), blacked-out window trim, and full analog instrumentation. In 1987, to better distinguish the Cougar XR7 from the Thunderbird Turbo Coupe, the turbocharged inline-4 was replaced by a 302 CI 5.0 V8, along with a standard 4-speed automatic.

====20th Anniversary====
For the 1987 model year, Mercury produced the '''Mercury 20th Anniversary Cougar''' as a commemorative edition.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coolcats.net/modelyear/20thanniversary.html|title=Cool Cats, Celebrating The 1983–88 Mercury Cougar|website=www.coolcats.net |access-date=2019-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derived from the Cougar LS, the 20th Anniversary Cougar was produced in a near-monochromatic exterior (Cabernet Red with Midnight Smoke moldings); the wheels, all badging, and regular chrome trim were finished in [[24 karat]] gold, with a gold-trimmed C-pillar emblem.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The trunk was fitted with a (non-functional) luggage rack.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

The 20th Anniversary Cougar was fitted with the 5.0&amp;nbsp;L V8, sport-handling suspension with quad rear shocks (derived from the XR7) and 15-inch alloy wheels (from the Mustang GT, painted gold).&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Along with a limited-slip rear axle, the only options offered were a power moonroof, power antenna, illuminated entry, keyless entry, automatic climate control, and an engine block heater.

In total, Mercury produced 5,002 20th Anniversary Cougars; 800 were reserved for Canada.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

On 26 December 1988, the seventh-generation Mercury Cougar was introduced for the 1989 model year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aerocats.net/1989.html|title=AERO CATS, Celebrating The 1989–97 Mercury Cougar|website=www.aerocats.net|language=en|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed from the second quarter of 1984, as a counterpart of the [[Ford Thunderbird (tenth generation)|tenth-generation Ford Thunderbird]], the $2 billion redesign of the two vehicles was intended to create handling benchmarked against far more expensive coupes (BMW 6-Series, Mercedes-Benz 560SEC, Jaguar XJS) while remaining in the same price segment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=d0LnCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=en53+1987+ford#v=onepage&amp;q=en53%201987%20ford&amp;f=false |title = The Perpetual Enterprise Machine: Seven Keys to Corporate Renewal Through Successful Product and Process Development|isbn = 9780195080520|last1 = Holloway|first1 = Charles A.|last2 = Bowen|first2 = Professor H. Kent|last3 = Clark|first3 = Kim B.|last4 = Wheelwright|first4 = Steven C.|year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the development of the 1989 Cougar, the form factor of coupes shifted significantly, as the quartet of GM G-body coupes were replaced by front-wheel drive vehicles; the introduction of the [[Acura Legend]] by Honda marked the introduction of Japanese-produced luxury vehicles.

At its 1989 debut, the Cougar was marketed largely as the flagship coupe of the Mercury division. As Mercury revised its model line during the 1990s, the Cougar became the sole two-door model offered by the division. As market demand shifted away from large two-door coupes, the Mercury Cougar and Ford Thunderbird were discontinued after the 1997 model year, with the final example produced on 4 September 1997.

=== Chassis ===
The seventh-generation Mercury Cougar is built upon the [[Ford MN12 platform]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Designed specifically for the Mercury Cougar and Ford Thunderbird, the MN12 chassis retained the use of rear-wheel drive. While its exterior footprint changed negligibly, in a major change, the wheelbase was expanded nine inches to 113 inches (longer than a Mercedes-Benz 560SEC).

Centered around the design of the MN12 chassis was its use of four-wheel independent suspension in place of a live rear axle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the exception of the Chevrolet Corvette, the Ford MN12 chassis marked its first use in a mass-produced American automobile. In front, the Mercury Cougar was configured with a short/long arm wishbone suspension.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As an option, the Cougar was available with 4-wheel antilock disc brakes (standard on the Cougar XR7).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As part of the 1989 redesign, the MN12 chassis was powered solely by a 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6, as the lowered hoodline of the MN12 was too low to properly house the 5.0&amp;nbsp;L V8, the engine was removed from the model line (marking the first time no V8 was available for the Cougar or Thunderbird).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; LS-trim Cougars were offered with a naturally aspirated 140&amp;nbsp;hp version of the V6, while the XR7 was powered by a 210&amp;nbsp;hp supercharged version (serving as the replacement for the turbocharged 2.3&amp;nbsp;L inline-4). The naturally aspirated V6 was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the supercharged V6 was offered with a 5-speed manual (with the automatic as an option).

For 1991, to increase demand for the Cougar, Mercury introduced a 200&amp;nbsp;hp version of the 5.0&amp;nbsp;L V8, a redesigned intake manifold allowed for sufficient underhood clearance.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.aerocats.net/1991.html |title=AERO CATS, Celebrating The 1989–97 Mercury Cougar|website=www.aerocats.net|language=en|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offered as an option on the Cougar LS, the V8 replaced the supercharged V6 in the XR7 (which also marked the end of the 5-speed manual in the MN12 Cougar). Originally slated for 1993, the 1994 Cougar shifted from the overhead-valve 5.0&amp;nbsp;L V8 to a 205&amp;nbsp;hp 4.6&amp;nbsp;L SOHC V8 (shared with the Mercury Grand Marquis).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aerocats.net/1994.html |title=AERO CATS, Celebrating The 1989–97 Mercury Cougar |website=www.aerocats.net |access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another 1994 change, the 4R70W electronically controlled version of the AOD 4-speed automatic was introduced for both the V6 and V8 engines.

=== Body ===
As the sixth-generation Mercury Cougar had proved successful in the marketplace, the 1989 redesign of the Cougar was largely an evolution of the previous generation, with updates of many previous design elements. The upright notchback roofline underwent a major revision, with the controversial upswept quarter windows of the previous generation abandoned.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While proportioned differently, wraparound headlamps and taillamps were modeled similar to the Mercury Sable. As a result of the longer wheelbase, the rear overhang was shortened. During development of MN12, Ford designers sought to develop increased differentiation between the Cougar and Thunderbird. While fenders and doors are common between the two vehicles, in comparison to the 1983–1987 generation, fewer visible parts are shared.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As part of the shift to the wider MN12 chassis, the Cougar again became a 5-passenger vehicle (for the first time since 1982). As a result of the wider interior, all Cougars were fitted with a center console with a floor-mounted shifter.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In following with the previous generation, LS-trim Cougars were fitted with digital instrumentation; the Cougar XR7 was fitted with an analog instrument panel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Originally slated to be launched with dual airbags, cost overruns and market demand necessitated the use of automatic seatbelts to meet passive-restraint requirements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For 1994, the interior underwent a complete redesign (similar to the Lincoln Mark VIII), with dual airbags replacing the automatic seatbelts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For 1997, the Cougar received a new instrument panel (similar to the Taurus/Sable), with cupholders added to the center console;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aerocats.net/1997.html|title=AERO CATS, Celebrating The 1989–97 Mercury Cougar|website=www.aerocats.net|language=en|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; several items were removed as part of de-contenting, including the courtesy lamps, underhood light and glove box light.

During its production, the seventh-generation Mercury Cougar underwent several revisions. For 1991, the Cougar underwent a slight facelift, with new headlamps and taillamps and front bumper; the facelift is distinguished by a smaller grille (1989–1990 versions extend above the headlamps).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For 1994, a second facelift saw a revision of the grille, taillamps and a simplification of the side molding. The interior was also revised at this time and now included dual airbags with a wraparound style interior.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For 1996, the Cougar received a major restyling sharing its entire front fascia with the Ford Thunderbird except for the front bumper cover and grille. The bodysides received wide body-colored cladding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aerocats.net/1996.html|title=AERO CATS, Celebrating The 1989–97 Mercury Cougar|website=www.aerocats.net|language=en|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trim ===
At its launch, the seventh-generation Mercury Cougar retained the same model trims as before, with the LS geared towards luxury and convenience features and the XR7 geared towards performance and handling. Externally, the LS was given chrome window trim while the XR7 was nearly monochromatic with black window trim.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To optimize its handling capabilities, the XR7 was fitted with many model-specific features. In addition to the 210&amp;nbsp;hp supercharged V6 (replaced by a 5.0L V8 in 1991), the XR7 featured four-wheel antilock disc brakes, electronically adjustable handling suspension, 16-inch alloy wheels, and a 5-speed manual transmission.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---July/1989-Mercury-Cougar-Brochure/1989-Mercury-Cougar-20|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818093455/http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---July/1989-Mercury-Cougar-Brochure/1989-Mercury-Cougar-20|archivedate=18 August 2017|url-status=dead|accessdate=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---July/1989-Mercury-Cougar-Brochure/1989-Mercury-Cougar-21-22|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818092833/http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---July/1989-Mercury-Cougar-Brochure/1989-Mercury-Cougar-21-22|archivedate=18 August 2017|url-status=dead|accessdate=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; To differentiate the XR7 from the LS, the model was fitted with sport seats, two-spoke sport steering wheel, and full analog instrumentation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

For 1993, Mercury revised the Cougar model line, with the XR7 becoming the sole trim level, dropping the LS and the monochromatic sport-oriented XR7 (eliminating some overlap with the Ford Thunderbird). Adapting much of the equipment of the previous LS, the 1993 XR7 adapted chrome exterior trim and a standard digital instrument cluster, with four-wheel disc brakes becoming an option.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aerocats.net/1993.html|title=AERO CATS, Celebrating The 1989–97 Mercury Cougar|website=www.aerocats.net|language=en|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the previous LS, the 1993 XR7 offered both V6 and V8 engines.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Alongside the LS and both versions of the XR7, several limited editions of the Cougar were produced. To commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Mercury Cougar, in 1992, the 25th Anniversary Mercury Cougar was an option package (nearly exclusively on XR7 models).&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aerocats.net/25thanniversary.html|title=AERO CATS, Celebrating The 1989–97 Mercury Cougar|website=www.aerocats.net|language=en|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equipped with 15" BBS alloy wheels, all examples were painted green with a tan interior (with green carpet). Other features included model-specific trunklid and C-pillar badging and an imitation trunklid luggage rack.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Mercury Cougar, for 1997, Mercury produced a 30th Anniversary Mercury Cougar XR7 as an option package.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aerocats.net/30thanniversary.html|title=AERO CATS, Celebrating The 1989–97 Mercury Cougar|website=www.aerocats.net|language=en|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distinguished by its use of Lincoln Mark VIII wheels, the 30th Anniversary Cougar featured model-specific C-pillar emblems, embroidered seat and floormat emblems; the option also included commemorative items shipped to the owner.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Approximately 5,000 25th anniversary and 5,000 30th anniversary Cougars were produced.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

By the mid-1990s, Ford engineers had completed design work on the third generation of the Ford Probe. Intended for a 1998 model year launch, the new Probe shifted its design from the [[Mazda MX-6]] to a platform shared with the [[Ford Mondeo (first generation)|Ford Contour]]. At the end of the 1997 model year, Ford announced a major streamlining of its coupe offerings, with Ford discontinuing the Thunderbird and Probe; Lincoln-Mercury lost the Cougar and Lincoln Mark VIII (the latter, after 1998). To make room for the updated 1999 [[Ford Mustang (fourth generation)|Ford Mustang]] and all-new [[Ford Escort (North America)#ZX2|Ford Escort ZX2]], the Contour-based Ford Probe continued into production, with Ford shifting the vehicle to the Lincoln-Mercury Division to adopt the Mercury Cougar name.

After skipping the 1998 model year, Mercury introduced the eighth-generation Mercury Cougar for the 1999 model year at the [[LA Auto Show#1998|1998 Los Angeles Auto Show]]. Serving as the replacement for the Ford Probe, the first front-wheel drive Cougar shifted market segments from two-door personal luxury coupe to three-door [[sport compact]], introducing the first Mercury sport hatchback coupe since the 1986 [[Mercury Capri]].

While marketed in Europe and Australia under the Ford brand, the eighth-generation Mercury Cougar was the first Mercury car since the 1991–1994 Mercury Capri sold without a direct Ford model equivalent in North America.

Initially outranking its predecessor in sales, the eighth-generation Cougar (marketed towards younger buyers, similar to the ZX2) struggled to compete for sales against sedans (the Mercury Sable and Grand Marquis) in the Mercury model line. While coupes had traditionally been offered in Lincoln-Mercury dealerships for several decades, the shift of the Cougar to the sports compact segment presented a challenge to sales personnel acquainted to marketing luxury-segment vehicles to new-car buyers along with attracting younger buyers into Mercury showrooms.

In 2002, Ford announced another restructuring of its model line, with 2002 marking the final year for the Cougar, [[Mercury Villager]], [[Lincoln Continental]], and [[Ford Escort (North America)|Ford Escort]]. The [[Ford Mondeo (first generation)|Ford Contour/Mercury Mystique]] (Ford Mondeo MkII) ended production in 2000, with the Cougar outliving it by two model years. As part of the model line revision, the Ford Mondeo platform was no longer used in North America until its consolidation with the 2013 Ford Fusion; the Mercury Cougar was effectively left without a donor platform.

The last Mercury Cougar rolled off the assembly line on 9 August 2002; following the end of its production, the Mercury model line offered no cars with [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]] engines until the 2006 [[Mercury Milan]].

The 1999 Cougar shared the [[Ford CDW27 platform|Ford CDW27 world-car platform]] introduced by the Ford Contour/Mercury Mystique. The first front-wheel drive Cougar, it was designed with fully independent multilink suspension.

The 1999–2002 Cougars were available with two engine options, the 2.0-L [[Zetec]] [[straight-4 engine]] with {{convert|125|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, and the 2.5-L [[Ford Duratec V6 engine|Duratec V6]] with {{convert|170|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. Also, two transaxle options were available: the [[Manual transmission|manual]] [[Ford MTX-75 transmission]] or the [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] [[Ford CD4E transmission]] (available in the US with either engine, although the I4/automatic combination was extremely rare; supposedly only 500 Cougars were built with the I4/auto).

"Sport Package" models of the V6 featured four-wheel vented disc brakes (from the Contour SVT), 16-inch alloy wheels, and the [[Governor (device)|speed governor]] removed. {{Citation needed span|With the electronic speed limiter removed, the top speed of the car was limited by drag and engine power in top gear at redline, around {{convert|135|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.|date=November 2008}} While this was considered attainable given enough road, the automatic transmission version could not reach this speed without significant engine modification. However the manual transmission version of the car, when given enough road, was capable of reaching speeds of around 145. Without the sport package, the speed governor was set at {{convert|115|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}} due to the H-rated tires with which the car was equipped.

Ford also prepared two high-performance concept-only versions; one dubbed the "Eliminator", which was a supercharged version built with aftermarket available parts, and the other the "Cougar S", which featured new body work, all-wheel drive and a 3.0-L Duratec engine.

A high-performance Cougar S (not to be confused with the concept) was discussed in the press, which was essentially a Cougar with a Contour SVT engine; however, this version never made it into production. {{Citation needed span|The Cougar S was so close to production, though, many of its parts are still available to order from the dealership and it is listed in many parts catalogs and insurance databases.|date=April 2010}} It was also to be sold in Europe as the Ford Cougar ST200.

=== Body ===
[[File:MercuryCougar-non.jpg|left|thumb|Mercury Cougar]]
This generation of Cougar had a far more contemporary package, with modern DOHC 24-valve six-cylinder Duratec engines, a fully independent multilink suspension, and [[front-wheel drive]]. This was also the first hatchback Cougar, and the first to have its own body, unshared by any Ford (except its European twin [[Ford Cougar]]). The body design used a philosophy Ford dubbed "New Edge" design: a combination of organic upper body lines with sharp, concave creases in the lower areas. The Cougar's body, and the [[New Edge]] idea in general, was introduced as a concept called the Mercury MC2 in 1997, and was considered a bigger version of the European [[Ford Puma (sport compact)|Ford Puma]].

Ford also sold this generation of Cougar in Europe and Australia as the [[Ford Cougar]], and it was a sales success.

To help create excitement for the Cougar, Mercury created several paint and trim packages:
*Special Edition (2000 model year) available in Zinc Yellow, leather interior with yellow stitching on the seats
*C2 (2001–2002 model years) available in either French Blue, Silver Frost, or Vibrant White, along with special blue interior accents
*Zn (2001 model year) available with special Zinc Yellow, special Visteon hood scoop and spoiler
*XR (2002 model year) available in either Black or XR Racing Red, with special black and red seats and interior trim, also came with 17-inch silver wheels with black accents on the inner spokes
*35th Anniversary (2002 model year) versions were available in Laser Red, French Blue, Satin Silver, and Black; most came with leather interiors with silver center sections on the seats. They also came with 17-inch machined wheels, the same as the XRs without the black paint on the center spokes.
*Roush Edition (1999–2000 model year) Available mostly in white and silver color choices, this car was built under the Roush name with body work done to the front bumper, back, side skirts and more. It is considered the rarest of all Cougars, since only 112 were ever made during its two-year production.

For the 2001 model year, the Cougar was updated with new headlights, front and rear fascias, and updated interior trim.

===Ford Cougar (Export)===
[[File:Ford Cougar.jpg|thumb|250px|Export Ford Cougar]]
{{Main|Ford Cougar}}
In 1998, Ford launched the Cougar at the [[1998 British Grand Prix]] at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukcougar.com/about_the_cougar.htm|title=About the Ford Cougar|publisher=The Ford Cougar Owners Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the Mercury brand in Europe and Australia, Ford marketed the Cougar as the '''Ford Cougar''' through [[Ford of Europe]] and [[Ford Australia|Ford of Australia]] from 1999 to 2002. Replacing the Ford Probe in European markets, the Ford Cougar was manufactured in the United States. Slotted above the [[Ford Ka]] and [[Ford Puma (sport compact)|Ford Puma]] (both based on the [[Ford Fiesta]] subcompact), the Cougar was marketed as a mid-sized coupe.

With the exception of Ford Blue Oval badging replacing Cougar emblems on the exterior and interior, Ford and Mercury versions are essentially identical. Export Cougars also have clear marker light lenses (in place of amber) and amber rear turn signals. In the United States, the Ford Cougar was built in both left and right-hand drive, with the latter allowing for its sale in the UK and Australia.

==Racing==
In 1967, renowned NASCAR race car builder [[Bud Moore (NASCAR owner)|Bud Moore]] campaigned Mercury Cougars in the [[Trans-Am Series]] with [[Ford Motor Company]] factory support. The team featured superstar-caliber drivers, such as Captain [[Dan Gurney]], [[Parnelli Jones]], [[Peter Revson]], [[David Pearson (NASCAR driver)|David Pearson]], and Ed Leslie. Factory support dried up towards the end of the season and the Cougars began to show their wear. Ultimately, Mercury lost the championship to Ford by two points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trans-amseries.com/results/1967.pdf 1967 Trans-Am Scores at www.trans-amseries.com] Retrieved on 5 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Bud Moore took his Cougars [[NASCAR]] racing in the newly formed [[Grand American]] series. Star driver [[Tiny Lund]] dominated the series and took the championship. After the Cougar changed to the Thunderbird platform in 1974, the bodystyle was raced in NASCAR. The [[Wood Brothers Racing]] team with [[David Pearson (NASCAR driver)|David Pearson]] and later [[Neil Bonnett]] was very successful with the car and scored a number of victories until the bodystyle became ineligible following the 1980 season. The next year (1981) saw the previous Cougar teams switch to the Thunderbird when NASCAR mandated the smaller (110-inch-wheelbased) cars, though oddly the Thunderbirds had to have their wheel bases stretched 6 inches, as the production cars wheelbase was only 104 inches.

From 1989 to 1990, [[Lincoln-Mercury]] Motorsport fielded Cougars of the new body style in the GTO class of the [[IMSA GT Championship]]. The cars collected the championship both years, and continued the teams' streak to seven [[manufacturer]]'s championships.

The '''Mercury Montego''' is a nameplate that was applied to three separate generations of vehicles marketed by the [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] division of [[Ford Motor Company]].  Taking its name from [[Montego Bay|Montego Bay, Jamaica]], the nameplate made its first appearance for 1967 in the Canadian market as part of the Mercury-derived [[Meteor (automobile)|Meteor]] model line.  For 1968, the Mercury Montego made its debut across North America, becoming the Mercury counterpart of the [[Ford Torino]] intermediate-size model line for two generations.

For the 1977 model year, Ford revised the intermediate-size product ranges of both its Ford and Mercury divisions; as part of a mid-cycle update, Mercury discontinued the Montego nameplate and expanded the [[Mercury Cougar]] line to include a full range of sedans and wagons (with the Ford Gran Torino becoming the [[Ford LTD II]]).

After a 28-year absence, the Mercury Montego nameplate was revived for the 2005 model year, shifting to a full-size sedan.  Slotted in size between the [[Mercury Milan]] and the [[Mercury Grand Marquis]], the 2005 Montego was the Mercury counterpart of the [[Ford Five Hundred]]. For the 2008 model year, the Montego adopted the nameplate of the car it had replaced, becoming the final generation of the [[Mercury Sable]].

==First generation (1968–1971)==

For 1968, Mercury introduced the Montego as part of its intermediate [[Mercury Comet]] product line, consolidating the Comet Capri and Comet Caliente into a single nameplate; the high-performance [[Mercury Cyclone]] became a distinct model line.  As the Comet was the Mercury counterpart of the [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Ford Fairlane]], the Montego was introduced alongside the [[Ford Torino]].  For 1970, Mercury intermediates adopted the Montego nameplate entirely (as the Comet became the Mercury counterpart of the [[Ford Maverick (Americas)|Ford Maverick]]).        

The first-generation Montego was offered as a four-door sedan, two-door hardtop, four-door station wagon, and two-door convertible.  The model line was offered in base and MX trims (replacing the Comet Capri and Comet Caliente, respectively).  

For 1970, the Montego underwent a mid-cycle exterior redesign to add a forward-thrusting hood and grille design.  The convertible was withdrawn, replaced by a four-door hardtop.  For all sedans, a MX Brougham trim was added (with a woodgrained MX Villager station wagon), distinguished by concealed headlamps.&lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

|interiorimage = 1974 Mercury Montego MX Brougham interior.jpg}}

For 1972, the second-generation Montego was introduced alongside the Ford Torino (and all-new Ford Gran Torino).&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960-1972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), p.911.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a major design shift, the intermediate Ford/Mercury model lines shifted from unibody to body-on-frame construction; in line with the General Motors A-platform, the Torino/Montego adopted a split-wheelbase chassis (114-inch for two-doors, 118-inch for four-doors and station wagons).  In a preview of the full-size lines for 1973, true four-door hardtops were replaced by "pillared hardtops" (frameless door glass remained, supported by a thin B-pillar).  Two-door Montegos retained hardtop rooflines, though with much wider C-pillars.

The Cyclone had reverted from a stand-alone model line to an option package for 1972 for the Montego; only 30 1972 Cyclones would be produced, making it among the rarest Mercury vehicles.  As a replacement for the Cyclone, Mercury introduced the Montego GT, a counterpart of the Ford Gran Torino SportsRoof for the first time; the Montego GT was offered from 1972 to 1973.      

As a standard engine, the Montego was equipped with a 250 cubic-inch inline-six, with five different V8 engines available as options.  Starting in 1974, the Mercury Montego was available with a 460 V8, shared with the Mercury Marquis/Colony Park.

The redesign was initially met with success, as 1972 Montego sales increased 136% over 1971;&lt;ref name="Flory, p.914"&gt;Flory, p.914.&lt;/ref&gt; the MX Brougham saw the largest increases in sales, as the two-door increased its sales by 897% while the four-door increased by 1,021%.&lt;ref name="Flory, p.914" /&gt;  

Following the 1973 gas crisis, sales were depressed by industry-wide fuel economy concerns.  The 1974 redesign of the Mercury Cougar began to produce model overlap (shifting from the [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Ford Mustang]] chassis to the [[Ford Elite]] chassis, itself a counterpart of the Gran Torino/Montego) along with the success of the [[Mercury Monarch]], as buyers shifted from intermediates and full-size cars towards fuel-efficient compact sedans.

For 1977, in a mid-cycle redesign of the Ford intermediate lines, several nameplates were shifted.  Mercury rebranded the Montego as the Cougar, in favor of offering a full range of body styles for the Cougar line (alongside the flagship XR7 personal luxury coupe); Ford rebranded the Torino/Gran Torino as a facelifted LTD II, with the Elite rebranded as a [[Ford Thunderbird (seventh generation)|downsized 1977 Thunderbird]].

}}{{See also|Ford Five Hundred}}
For the 2005 model year, Mercury revived the Montego nameplate after a 28-year hiatus.  The Mercury counterpart of the [[Ford Five Hundred]], the third-generation Montego entered production on July 12, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 2005 |publisher=Ward's Communications, Inc |editor=Binder, Alan K |year=2005 |page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Slotted below the Grand Marquis, the third-generation Montego was introduced as a replacement for the Sable alongside the 2006 [[Mercury Milan|Milan]]. 

In place of the three trims of the Five Hundred, the Montego was offered in two: Luxury and Premier. 

The third-generation Montego was manufactured at the [[Chicago Assembly]] facility in [[Chicago, Illinois]] alongside the Ford Five Hundred and the Ford Freestyle; the latter was a CUV wagon serving as a replacement for the Taurus/Sable station wagon. 

=== Chassis ===
[[File:California - USA (3158684209).jpg|thumb|left|2005 Mercury Montego]]
The third-generation Montego was built on the [[Ford D3 platform]].  Developed in collaboration with Volvo, the D3 chassis is the first full-size Ford platform to utilize front-wheel drive (or its optional all-wheel drive).  Shifting away from the body-on-frame Panther platform, the D3 chassis utilizes unibody construction.  Only two inches shorter than the Grand Marquis in wheelbase, the Montego was nearly 500 pounds lighter in curb weight.    

The Montego was equipped with a single engine, shared with the previous Taurus/Sable, a 203 hp version of the 3.0L DOHC ''[[Ford Mondeo engine#VVT|Duratec]]'' V6.  Front-wheel drive versions were equipped with a 6-speed Aisin AW F21++ [[automatic transmission|automatic]] while AWD versions were equipped with a ZF [[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]].

==== Total Vehicle Geometry (TVG) ====
The Montego, Five Hundred and Ford Freestyle were manufactured using a Volvo-derived system called Total Vehicle Geometry (TVG) to ensure fit, finish and craftsmanship &amp;mdash; by requiring comprehensive participation by all engineers as well as suppliers and vendors.  Heavily using computer-aided design, TVG tracks all design modifications, translating them into the central CAD database which in turn allows each engineer access to current project data.  The system improves part tolerance at the body-in-white stage as well as early cabin integrity testing, via air leakage testing.  TVG improved fit and finish at the first prototype stage and decreases pilot manufacturing times.&lt;ref name="montegointro" /&gt;  

For side impact protection the bodywork is braced at the B-pillar via an energy-channeling structural cross-car roof tube and a corresponding undercar energy channelling cross-tube &amp;mdash; with the front seats mounted above the lower tube, locating them above a side impact energy path.  The system derives from a side-impact safety design marketed by Volvo as its [[Side Impact Protection System]] (SIPS).&lt;ref name="montegointro"&gt;{{cite web

=== Exterior ===
The first completely new full-size Mercury since the 1992 model year, the third-generation Montego was offered solely as a four-door sedan.  With a height over five feet tall (matching the far-longer [[Maybach 57 and 62|Maybach 57]]), the Montego was the tallest Mercury sedan in over 50 years.  

While visibly sharing much of its exterior with its Ford Five Hundred counterpart, the third-generation Montego was distinguished by exterior several design features.  In line with other Mercury vehicles, the Montego was styled with a vertical waterfall-style grille with satin aluminum exterior trim (limiting chrome to the roofline).&lt;ref name="montegointro" /&gt;  Exclusive to the Montego, HID headlamps and LED taillamps were standard equipment (the latter, the largest array of LED lights on any Ford vehicle worldwide).&lt;ref name="montegointro" /&gt;   

Ford chief designer, George Bucher, said "it was a challenge to sculpt a Ford-styled body around a Volvo chassis, and added that designers used what he calls plainer surfaces with taut lines to give the car a modern look without losing its passenger-car proportions."&lt;ref name="Volvostruc2"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = 2006 Ford Five Hundred
  | publisher = Larry Edsall, Twincities.com
  | url = http://cars.twincities.com/reviews/ford/five-hundred/2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interior ===
[[File:2006 Mercury Montego interior.JPG|left|thumb|Interior]]
In contrast to both the Grand Marquis and the Sable, the third-generation Montego was available solely in a five-passenger configuration.  In line with the 2001-2003/2005 Grand Marquis LSE and 2003-2004 Marauder, the Montego was configured with bucket seats and a console-mounted shifter.    

Slotted in between the Five Hundred SE and SEL, the Montego Luxury featured cloth seats as standard, with leather seats as optional.  The Mercury equivalent of a Five Hundred Limited, the Montego Premier featured leather seats as standard; all-wheel drive and a sunroof were among the few available options.  

In contrast to the Grand Marquis, the Montego offered a 60/40 fold-down rear seat, expanding the 21 cubic-foot trunk space.  With the decklid closed, objects up to 10 feet in length could be transported within the car (when using the optional fold-down front passenger seat).

At its launch, two airbags were standard, with four more available as an option (front-seat airbags and side-curtain)&lt;ref name="montegointro" /&gt;   

A design feature of the Montego includes its overall height to add interior space to the vehicle.  To appeal to buyers of both sedans and sport-utility vehicles, Ford raised the viewpoint of the driver.  Marketed as ''Command Seating'', the Montego features high [[H-point]] seating (the location of the occupants hip-point relative to the road or the vehicle floor); its [[H-point]] is closer to the ground than that of a sport utility vehicle, but higher than a typical sedan, easing entry and exit. Also, the distance from the H-point to the floor of the vehicle is reflective of more upright seating. At its press launch, Ford said the Five Hundred's H-point is up to four and a half inches higher than its competitors.  The Montego also features theater seating, where second row seats are higher: in the front row, the distance between the H-point and the heel point, where the occupant's foot touches the floor, is 12.7 inches &amp;mdash; in the second row the distance between the H-point and the heel point is 15.7 inches.

===Discontinuation===

Following a poor critical reception, the Mercury Montego and Ford Five Hundred fell under sales projections from the 2005 to 2007 model years.  For the 2008 model year, the Montego and Five Hundred underwent a mid-cycle update, with pre-production prototypes unveiled at 2007 auto shows.  After his installation as Ford CEO, [[Alan Mulally]] ordered the model lines renamed before entering production, claiming higher brand value and recognition; the 2008 Mercury Montego adopted the Mercury Sable nameplate.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070207234651/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17003763/]    

For 2008, Mercury received an exterior styling update that better differentiated the two model lines; a powertrain upgrade replaced the 3.0L engine with a 3.5L engine (increasing output to 263 hp).{{clear}}

In the 1968 [[NASCAR Grand National]] stock car season, the fastback Fairlane body style proved much slicker than other makes, but the nose of the Mercury Cyclone Fastback was the main reason pointed to it being even slightly faster than its Ford counterpart. [[Cale Yarborough]] drove a Wood Brothers Cyclone to victory in the Daytona 500, and the Mercury bodies would remain a major force in NASCAR through 2 generations of bodies. 

The battle over aerodynamics would prompt Chrysler to respond with specialized "winged wonder" Daytona and Superbird bodies after its own fastback bodies proved disappointing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cartersclassicmusclecars.com/Cyclone/cyclone.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110193856/http://cartersclassicmusclecars.com/Cyclone/cyclone.htm |archivedate=2010-01-10 }} 68 Mercury Cyclone GT&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mercury Sable''' is a range of automobiles that were manufactured and marketed by the [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] brand of [[Ford Motor Company]].  Introduced on December 26, 1985 as the replacement for the [[Mercury Marquis]], the Sable marked the transition of the mid-size Mercury product range to front-wheel drive.

For its entire production life, the Sable served as the Mercury counterpart of the [[Ford Taurus]] (no Sable equivalent of the [[Ford Taurus SHO|Taurus SHO]] was ever produced), slotted below the [[Mercury Grand Marquis|Grand Marquis]].  From the 1986 to 2005 model years, the Sable was produced as a mid-size vehicle; four-door sedan and five-door station wagon body styles were offered.  For 2006, the Sable was withdrawn, replaced by the full-size Montego and mid-size Milan.  For 2008, the Sable was reintroduced as a full-size car, offered solely as a four-door sedan.

Due to declining sales, the Sable was discontinued after the 2009 model year, leaving no Mercury counterpart of the [[Ford Taurus (sixth generation)|sixth-generation Taurus]].  The final Sable was produced on May 21, 2009; in total, 2,112,374 Sables were produced during its 1985–2005 production.&lt;ref name="endagain"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.detnews.com/article/20090517/AUTO01/905170326/1148/rss25|title=Sable reaches end of the line|author=Hoffman, Bryce G|date=May 17, 2009|work=The Detroit News|accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Specs/Production.php|title=Production Figures|work=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia|publisher=Taurus Car Club of America|accessdate=2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mercury Sable nameplate was derived from the [[sable]], a weasel-like mammal from Russia that is valued for its smooth, dark fur.

== Background ==
In early 1980, the Mercury Sable began development alongside the Ford Taurus; the $3.5 billion project would become the largest development ever undertaken by Ford at the time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-06-04-8602090462-story.html|title=TAURUS BRINGS TEAM APPROACH TO FORD|last=News|first=Dallas Morning|website=chicagotribune.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0L02DwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT67&amp;dq=%22spring%20of%201980%22%20ford%20taurus&amp;pg=PT67#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Concurrent Engineering: Shortening Lead Times, Raising Quality, and Lowering Costs|last=Hartley|first=John R.|date=2017-09-20|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781351458351|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hemmings.com/blog/2014/01/30/cars-of-futures-past-1986-ford-taurus/|title=Cars of Futures Past – 1986 Ford Taurus|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hemmings.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally intended to replace its full-size and mid-size rear-wheel drive product lines ([[Ford Panther platform|Panther]] and [[Ford Fox platform|Fox]] platforms, respectively), the Taurus/Sable were focused toward the mid-size segment in 1981 (the company felt stabilization of gasoline prices justified the continuation of its full-size model lines).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The Taurus was to replace the Ford LTD while the Sable replaced the Mercury Marquis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

While designed entirely in North America, the Taurus/Sable were designed under a similar approach as the [[Ford Escort (North America)|Ford Escort]], using an interdisciplinary team approach; each element of the vehicle was designed concurrently, including manufacturing and assembly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Along with input from potential buyers (in stark contrast to the [[Edsel]]), Ford used [[reverse engineering]] of competitive vehicles as a design input tool.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

During the development of the Sable, Mercury had become one of the final American brands to adopt front-wheel drive into its vehicle line.  In 1982, as a sedan/station wagon version of the [[Chevrolet Citation]], General Motors produced the quartet of the [[Chevrolet Celebrity]]/[[Pontiac 6000]]/[[Oldsmobile Cutlass]]/[[Buick Century]]; a year later, Chrysler expanded its [[Chrysler K cars|K cars]] into the mid-size segment with the first front-wheel drive [[Chrysler New Yorker]].&lt;ref name="Taub"&gt;{{cite book|title=Taurus: The Making of the Car That Saved Ford|last=Taub|first=Eric|date=November 1991|publisher=[[E. P. Dutton]]|isbn=0-525-93372-7|url=https://archive.org/details/taurusmakingofca00taub}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coinciding with the 1986 launch of the Sable, General Motors downsized Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac full-size sedans to front-wheel drive, only slightly larger than the mid-size Sable.

For 1983, Mercury underwent a brand revision, with the Cougar reverting to its traditional role as a two-door personal coupe alongside the Ford Thunderbird; while retaining the same chassis underpinnings, the Thunderbird and Cougar underwent a complete exterior redesign, becoming the first Ford cars produced with highly aerodynamic designs, a central objective of the Taurus/Sable design.&lt;ref name="Coolcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coolcats.net/fox/1983.html|title=Cool Cats: The 1983 Mercury Cougar|date=16 February 2005|work=coolcats.new|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427131704/http://www.coolcats.net/fox/1983.html|archivedate=27 April 2007|url-status = dead|accessdate=2007-03-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/mercury-cars12.htm|title=How Mercury Cars Work|last=|first=|date=2007-06-06|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1983 Cougar was well received in the marketplace (outselling the 1983 Thunderbird&lt;ref name="Coolcat" /&gt;); Ford would choose to abandon "boxy" car design altogether, influencing other car manufacturers to follow suit during the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Taub" /&gt;  Following the Thunderbird and Cougar, Ford introduced the 1984 [[Ford Tempo]] and Mercury Topaz.  The compact front-wheel drive replacements for the Ford Fairmont/Mercury Zephyr, the Tempo/Topaz marked the first use of aerodynamic body design by Ford for a sedan.

}}In mid-1985, Ford unveiled the Mercury Sable alongside the Ford Taurus as a 1986 model.  In place of a traditional auto show unveiling, the launch was held an [[MGM Studios]] soundstage (where ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' was filmed). Ford workers came into the room, which was decorated in space-age decor, holding cups shaped like flying saucers and the Taurus and Sable were sitting behind a curtain.   With the flashing of strobe lights and a drum-roll, the curtain was pulled back and the two cars were revealed to the public.&lt;ref name="Taub" /&gt;

Replacing the mid-size Marquis (Cougar prior to 1983) sedan and station wagon, to protect its investment, Ford produced both model lines for the 1986 model year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  While it would not outsell its Taurus counterpart, the Sable would prove successful during its production, competing with the Grand Marquis as the highest-selling Mercury model line.  As the Mercury brand was not sold in Mexico, Ford of Mexico marketed the Sable as the Ford Taurus.

The Sable was on [[Car and Driver]] magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] on its release in 1986 and again in 1990 and 1991.&lt;ref name="bestselling"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=46007|title=Inside Line: Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable|last=DiPetro|first=John|date=2003-04-18|website=|publisher=Edmunds|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050626081824/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=46007/|archivedate=2005-06-25|accessdate=2019-05-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chassis specification ===
The first-generation Sable used the front-wheel drive [[Ford DN5 platform]], sharing its 106-inch wheelbase with the Ford Taurus.  As with its Marquis predecessor, the Sable used unibody construction.  The Sable is equipped with four-wheel independent suspension.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1988%20Mercury/1988%20Mercury%20Sable%20Brochure/image18.html|title=1988 Mercury Sable Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front axle is fitted with [[MacPherson strut]]s and a stabilizer bar; the rear axle on sedans is a coil-sprung 4-link layout with a coil-sprung double-wishbone (short/long arm) for station wagons, along with a stabilizer bar.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  As with the Marquis, the Sable was equipped with front disc brakes and rear drum brakes; station wagons were fitted with larger rear brakes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Powertrain ====
For the first year on the market, Sable buyers had the choice of a 90&amp;nbsp;hp [[Ford HSC engine#2.5|HSC]] [[Straight-4|4-cylinder]] mated to a three-speed automatic [[transaxle]] or a 140&amp;nbsp;hp [[Ford Vulcan engine|Vulcan]] [[V6]] with a four-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]], with the latter having much higher sales. 4-cylinder Sable sales were so poor that the engine was dropped in 1987 (it remained an option for the Taurus until 1991). Ford's 3.8&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)|Essex]]'' [[V6]] was added to the line-up in 1988. Although the power output was rated at the same 140&amp;nbsp;hp (104&amp;nbsp;kW) as the 3.0&amp;nbsp;L engine, this large V6 produced 215&amp;nbsp;ft·lbf (291&amp;nbsp;N·m) of [[torque]], a welcome addition, especially in the heavier [[station wagon]]s. However, the 3.8 suffered from premature head gasket failure, which was primarily a fault with Ford's supplier of gaskets, not with the engine itself. Some also attribute this to reduced under-hood cooling.&lt;ref name="bestselling" /&gt; Unlike the Taurus, no manual transmission was offered in the Sable.

=== Body design ===
The first-generation Sable was offered in two body styles: a four-door sedan and a five-door station wagon.  In an extensive departure from its Marquis predecessor, the Sable sedan shares only its doors and roof stamping with the Taurus.  To differentiate its roofline, the B, C, and D-pillars of the Sable sedan were blacked out for a "floating roof" effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/mercury-cars13.htm|title=How Mercury Cars Work|last=|first=|date=2007-06-06|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a design that would be adapted by the Mercury Topaz and Tracer (and other automakers in the early 1990s),&lt;ref&gt;[http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1990-to-1996-pontiac-grand-prix-5.htm Pontiac Grand Prix at Consumer Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015065945/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1990-to-1996-pontiac-grand-prix-5.htm|date=2007-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1990-to-1994-mitsubishi-eclipse-5.htm Mitsubishi Eclipse at Consumer Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309140754/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1990-to-1994-mitsubishi-eclipse-5.htm|date=2007-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; a low-wattage "lightbar" was fitted between the headlamps.  The lightbar design element further showcased the lack of a conventional grille, a design pioneered by the [[Citroën DS]] and shared with the [[Ford Mustang SVO]] and [[Ford Sierra]].&lt;ref name="Taub" /&gt;  Alongside the Taurus, the Sable was the first American-produced sedan to use aerodynamic composite headlights with replaceable halogen bulbs; to begin their use, Ford (and other auto manufacturers) lobbied the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) to have them approved, with the 1984 [[Lincoln Continental Mark VII|Continental Mark VII]] becoming the first American car to use them.&lt;ref name="Taub" /&gt;

During its production, the first-generation Sable underwent few changes.  For 1989, the exterior underwent a mid-cycle revision; the amber parking lamp lenses were replaced by clear units and sedans saw revisions to taillamp lenses.

While sharing largely the same features as the Taurus interior, in a departure from tradition, the Sable was designed with a separate interior, with a dashboard as part of the door panels.&lt;ref name="bestselling" /&gt;  In sedans, six-passenger seating was standard, with optional front bucket seats reducing capacity to five.&lt;ref name="bestselling" /&gt;  In station wagons, a two-passenger rear-facing third-row seat was an option  (the first mid-size Mercury station wagon to do so since the 1977 Cougar).&lt;ref name="bestselling" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1988%20Mercury/1988%20Mercury%20Sable%20Brochure/image19.html|title=1988 Mercury Sable Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For 1990, the Sable underwent a redesign of the dashboard to accommodate the addition of a driver-side airbag; a CD player was added as an option.&lt;ref name="bestselling" /&gt;  &lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

=== Trim ===
The first-generation Mercury Sable was sold in two trim levels, in line with other Mercury models: base-trim GS and top-trim LS.  As the first-generation Sable was never sold with a manual transmission, there was no equivalent to the Taurus MT-5 or Taurus SHO.&lt;ref name="bestselling" /&gt;

For the 1992 model year, the second-generation Sable was introduced.  As part of a $650 million investment in the Taurus and Sable, both model lines received significant updates, focusing on the interior and front and rear fascias.&lt;ref name = "bestselling" /&gt;  In contrast to the previous Sable, Ford chose an evolutionary change for the model line; though visibly similar to the previous generation, every body panel on the Sable sedan (except the doors) was changed.&lt;ref name="TCCAG2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/G2/index.html|title=Taurus/Sable spotters guide (Generation 2)|last=|first=|date=|work=taurusclub.com/encyclopedia|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061119023629/https://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/G2/index.html|archive-date=2006-11-19|accessdate=2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the station wagon (shared with both the Sable and Taurus), the front fascia was redesigned, along with the interior.  

The interior of the Sable underwent a redesign of the door panels, dashboard, and interior controls.&lt;ref name="TCCAG2" /&gt;  Following the 1990 addition of a driver-side airbag, the Sable gained a passenger-side airbag as an option for 1992 (becoming standard in 1993).&lt;ref name="TCCAG2" /&gt;  For 1993, the steering wheel was redesigned (returning the horn to the center of the steering wheel).&lt;ref name="TCCAG2" /&gt;     

The base "GS" and luxury "LS" trim levels were carried over from the previous generation. A front cloth bench seat was standard on GS sedans and wagons, although cloth bucket seats were available on GS sedans only. Higher-end cloth bucket seats were standard on LS sedans, but a bench seat was a no cost option. A front bench was standard on LS wagons, with bucket seats optional. Leather seating surfaces were available on all LS Sables.

In 1992 for MY 1993, unpopular optional features such as the "[[Quickclear|InstaClear]]" heated windshield were eliminated.&lt;ref name="TCCAG2" /&gt; For 3.0 L V6 engines, the drive belt system became a single-belt setup for 1993 (previously, the 3.0 L [[alternator (auto)|alternator]] had used a separate belt).&lt;ref name="TCCAG2" /&gt;  Also some 3.0&amp;nbsp;L 1994 models began receiving the new [[Ford AXOD transmission#AX4N|AX4N]] transmission.

The wagon version was available with mostly the same options as the sedan versions.&lt;ref name = "TCCAG2" /&gt; Wagons had a maximum of 81.1 cubic feet of cargo area with the 60/40 split rear seat folded down.&lt;ref name="Consumerguide"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1990-to-1995-ford-taurus.htm |title=1990-1995 Ford Taurus Review |work=Consumer Guide |accessdate=2007-02-13 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328192510/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1990-to-1995-ford-taurus.htm |archivedate=2007-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They featured a 2-way liftgate (raise the entire liftgate or just the window), a roof rack with crossbar and tie-downs, an optional rear-facing third seat, a lockable under-floor compartment, and an optional fold-out picnic table. With both rear split seats in the upright position, standard cargo capacity was 45.7 cubic feet.&lt;ref name = "TCCAG2" /&gt; Wagons that were equipped with the front bench seat and rear folding seat could seat eight people; while over two feet shorter than the 1991 Mercury Colony Park, the Sable wagon became the sole eight-passenger vehicle offered by Lincoln-Mercury (as the [[Mercury Villager]] minivan seated seven).

1995 was the final model year of the second-generation Sable; the rare LTS trim level was added.  It featured leather bucket seats, Taurus LX-style alloy wheels, special cladding, and many leather wrapped interior trim parts.&lt;ref name = "TCCAG2" /&gt; The LTS trim had either the standard 3.0 L Vulcan V6 or the optional 3.8 L Essex V6.

As before, the Sable returned as a four-door sedan and five-door station wagon.    

While mechanically identical to its Ford Taurus counterpart, the sedans of the two model lines shared less sheetmetal than before, with only the front doors, hood, and front fenders common between the Taurus and Sable (as before, the Sable served as the basis for Ford and Mercury station wagons).   In contrast to the oval-influenced roofline of the Ford Taurus, the Sable was styled with a sloped roofline with a rectangular rear window; the model received its own front and rear fascias.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  In place of the long-running lightbar, the Sable received a chrome-trimmed grille (in line with the Mystique) with oval headlight housings.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  In a design first for the model line, the Sable was fitted with the same interior as the Taurus (with the exception of seat fabrics).&lt;ref name="bestselling" /&gt;        

The trim lines saw a minor revision, with the Sable G introduced as a new entry-level model and the Sable LTS discontinued.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The Sable G was offered solely as a sedan, with several standard power options (but only an AM/FM radio&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;).  For higher sales volumes, the GS and LS made their return, offered both in sedan and station wagon form.  For the Sable G and GS, the standard engine was the 3.0L Vulcan V6, producing 145 hp.  For the Sable LS, the standard engine was a 3.0L DOHC ''[[Ford Duratec engine#Duratec 30|Duratec]]'' V6, producing 200 hp&lt;ref name="CG96"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1996-to-1999-mercury-sable.htm|title=1996-1999 Mercury Sable at Consumer Guide|date=|work=consumerguide.howstuffworks.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823102851/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1996-to-1999-mercury-sable.htm|archivedate=2007-08-23|accessdate=2007-08-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;; optional in the Sable GS, the Duratec engine was an enlarged version of the engine from the Mercury Mystique.

The Sable received another redesign in 1999 for MY 2000, which minimized some of the oval design elements from the 1996 model, replacing them with more conventional styling.&lt;ref name = "Consumerguide00" /&gt; The redesign also featured a taller roof over the rear-passenger space, to increase passenger headroom that had been sacrificed by the tapered 1996 design.&lt;ref name = "Consumerguide00" /&gt; The taller and roomier trunk also served to make the vehicle more functional.&lt;ref name = "bestselling" /&gt; The interior was completely changed for a much more conservative design.&lt;ref name = "Consumerguide00" /&gt; Certain elements of the interior were retained from the 1996 model, such as the integrated control console, which combined the sound system and climate controls into one panel; but the shape of that panel was changed from the controversial oval to a more conventional and conservative trapezoid. The [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] was also softened to appeal to a broader, non-sporting audience.&lt;ref name = "Consumerguide00" /&gt; To reduce the price and increase profitability, many features such as four-wheel [[disc brake]]s were eliminated &lt;ref name="Consumerguide00"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2000-to-2005-mercury-sable.htm |title=2000-2005 Mercury Sable |work=Consumer Guide |accessdate=2007-02-13 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210080341/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2000-to-2005-mercury-sable.htm |archivedate=2007-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the sedan; station wagons retained four-wheel disc brakes.
[[Image:04-05 Mercury Sable GS sedan.jpg|thumb|left|2004-2005 Mercury Sable GS sedan]]
The 2002 Sable included extra equipment on every trim level, including a CD player and power driver's seat on the GS, and a power [[moonroof]] or leather interior on the LS.&lt;ref name = "bestselling" /&gt; Side airbags and [[traction control system|traction control]] were added as options on all models.&lt;ref name = "bestselling" /&gt; For 2004, the Sable received minor cosmetic changes to the front and rear fascias, most noticeably the grille was made fully chrome. Inside were a new instrument cluster and steering wheel.&lt;ref name = "Consumerguide00" /&gt;

Due to the Mercury brand's discontinuation in Canada, the fourth generation Sable was never available in the Canadian market.  Thus it was unique to the [[United States|US]] and [[Mexico]].

The 2005 [[Mercury Montego]] and 2006 [[Mercury Milan|Milan]] were launched as replacements for the Sable.&lt;ref name = "Consumerguide00" /&gt; Shortly after the Montego's introduction the Sable was discontinued, along with the Taurus wagon; the Taurus sedan continued to be produced, but primarily for the fleet market.

}}The fifth-generation Mercury Sable was launched for the 2008 model year.  Developed as a mid-cycle update of the Mercury Montego, the production vehicle revived the more widely-recognized Sable nameplate at the [[Chicago Auto Show#2007|2007 Chicago Auto Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/products/press_article_display.cfm?article_id=25374&amp;vehicle_id=1539|title=Mercury Sable Returns to Showrooms With More Power, Style and Sophistication|work=Media.

While approximately 10 inches shorter and 500 pounds lighter than the Grand Marquis, the fifth-generation Sable was the first produced as a full-size car.  For the first time, the model line was offered exclusively as a four-door sedan (no Mercury counterpart of the Taurus X wagon was developed).  Front-wheel drive remained standard, with all-wheel drive becoming an option for the first time.     

In the transition to the Montego to the Sable, a number of changes were made to the body and chassis.  Alongside the addition of the 263&amp;nbsp;hp 3.5L V6 and 6-speed 6F automatic, the exterior underwent several revisions, including a new front bumper and grille, redesigned headlamps; the LED taillamps were retained, but given white lenses.  The fifth-generation Sable adopted the trim lines of the Montego and Milan, with an unnamed standard trim level and a top Premier trim.

==Special editions==
A few rare special editions of the Sable were made, all consisting of first generation models.

During MY 1987, Mercury introduced a special edition of the Sable called the "LS Monochrome Edition", which as an option would color the bumpers, side trim, and wheels white.&lt;ref name = "TCCAG1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/G1/index.html |title=Generation 1 Spotter's Guide |work=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |date= |accessdate=2007-02-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411113954/http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/G1/index.html |archive-date=2008-04-11 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only offered during MY 1987; the production quantity is not known and it is also unknown how many still exist.&lt;ref name = "TCCAG1" /&gt;

During MY 1989, Mercury created a "50th Anniversary" edition of the Sable, to celebrate Mercury's 50th Anniversary. Keeping with the name, only 50 were sold, combined between GS and LS models. This Sable was actually a test bed for creating a Luxury sports version of the Sable called the LTS, similar to that of the Ford Taurus SHO. It was meant to use the SHO's chassis, interior, and suspension, but not the engine.&lt;ref name = "Rarez" /&gt; After the launch of the SHO, and all the publicity and praise it got, Ford shelved the Sable LTS to focus on the SHO, and because they were afraid it would take sales away from the SHO. The Sable LTS remained in a "[[development hell]]" until mid-1994 when it was introduced as a high end version of the Sable, but by then, it was just a highly optioned LS. An unknown number of these Sables still exist, but a pristine condition GS in this trim was sold on [[eBay]] in 2007.&lt;ref name = "Rarez"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Specials/50th-sable.html |title=1989 50th Anniversary Mercury Sable|work=encyclopedia.taurusclub.com |date= |accessdate=2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special one-of-a-kind Sable convertible was created in 1987 for the 1988 [[North American International Auto Show|Detroit SAE auto show]]. It was built from a sedan chassis and featured a completely custom two-door body with a custom folding top. However, it was shelved; the only one sat in a warehouse for years until it was given a [[VIN]], titled, and driven. It was sold on eBay in 2006.&lt;ref name = "Convert"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Concepts/88convert.html |title=1988 Sable Convertible concept |work=www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article in Automotive News (circa 1990) an all aluminum "body in white" was made for a Sable. In an accompanying photo it is shown being held up by two middle aged women, leading to the belief it would weigh less than 600&amp;nbsp;lbs. At the time Audi had just released the A8, so it might have been an engineering exercise for constructing all aluminum frames, as Jaguar has now. Whatever became of the "Aluminum Sable Unibody", or if there was more than one, is unknown.

The '''Mercury Villager''' is a [[minivan]] that was marketed by the Mercury division of Ford.  The first minivan ever sold by Mercury, two generations were sold from the 1992 to 2002 model years.  Competing against the [[Chrysler minivans (AS)|Chrysler minivans]] and the General Motors [[GM U platform#1990–1996|APV minivans]], the front-wheel drive Villager was introduced between the [[Ford Aerostar]] and the [[Ford Windstar]].

Throughout its production, the Villager was a product of a joint venture between Ford and Nissan; developed by both manufacturers, the Villager and the [[Nissan Quest]] were produced by Ford at its [[Ohio Assembly]] plant in [[Avon Lake, Ohio]] (alongside the [[Ford E-Series|Ford Econoline/Club Wagon]]).

After the 2002 model year, Mercury discontinued the Villager, replacing the model line for the 2004 model year with a revived [[Ford Windstar#Mercury Monterey|Monterey]] (a Mercury counterpart of the [[Ford Windstar#Third generation (Ford Freestar; 2004–2007)|Ford Freestar]]).{{TOC left}}

The Villager nameplate was first used by Ford Motor Company in 1958 as the [[Edsel Villager]] was introduced as the mid-range Edsel station wagon. Along with Ranger, Villager was the only nameplate produced through the entire existence of the brand.

Following the demise of Edsel, the Villager name was revived by Mercury in 1962, denoting the Comet station wagon with [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] trim.  Subsequently, the Villager trim became the Mercury counterpart of the Ford "Squire" trim denoting wood-trim station wagons.  With the exception of the full-size [[Mercury Colony Park]], the Villager nameplate was used by Mercury from 1962 to 1984 on six model ranges, including the [[Mercury Comet|Comet]] (1962–1967), [[Mercury Montego|Montego]] (1970–1976), [[Mercury Bobcat|Bobcat]] (1975–1980), [[Mercury Cougar|Cougar]] (1977, 1982), [[Mercury Zephyr|Zephyr]] (1978–1981) and [[Mercury Lynx|Lynx]] (1981–1984).

Following the introduction of the 1983 Marquis, the Villager nameplate was dropped from wood-trim station wagons (the 1986 Sable that replaced it was never offered with woodgrain exterior trim).

=== Development ===
[[File:Mercury Villager and Nissan Quest.jpg|left|thumb|500x500px|Mercury Villager (red) and Nissan Quest (blue)]]
At the beginning of 1988, Ford and Nissan entered a joint venture to develop an all-new minivan sold by both automakers.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;https://www.cars.com/reviews/indystar-coms-view-1420689126103/&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the terms of the agreement, the development and engineering of the vehicles was done by Nissan (in the United States); the company also supplied the engine and transmission.  Ford would manufacture the vehicles in its own facility, providing components for the vehicle.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Development officially commenced later that year, codenamed VX54.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}  Under Nissan, the VX54 program was to jointly replace the [[Nissan Vanette#United States|Van]] and the [[Nissan Axxess|Axxess]] in North America; the Ford version became a Mercury (coinciding with the simultaneous development of the WIN88 program, later the Ford Windstar)  The final designs were chosen by Nissan in 1989, with both companies commencing testing of prototypes in 1990{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}; real-world testing was done through 1991, as development concluded at the end of that year.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}

While 1980s minivans traditionally replaced full-size station wagons as family-use vehicles, during the development process, designers benchmarked the mid-size Mercury Sable station wagon (instead of the full-size Mercury Colony Park) as its goal for features, ride, and handling.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  While all-wheel drive was initially planned in the VX54 program, slow sales of Chrysler AWD minivans led to Ford dropping it from development of the Villager.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

}}Launched in July 1992 as a 1993 model, the Mercury Villager was introduced at the 1992 Chicago Auto Show.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;https://www.cars.com/reviews/chicagotribune-coms-view-1420689071057/&lt;/ref&gt;  After having forgone the minivan segment since the 1986 introduction of the Aerostar, the Villager marked the first time since 1960 that the division sold a vehicle with no Ford (or Lincoln) counterpart.

=== Chassis specification ===
The first-generation Villager uses the front-wheel drive [[Ford VX54 platform]]; while using a Ford codename, the platform is an evolution of the Nissan Maxima ([[Nissan Maxima#Third generation (J30; 1989–1994)|1989-1994 J30 chassis]]).  The VX54 chassis has a 112.2-inch wheelbase (sized nearly identically to the short-wheelbase Chrysler minivans).

The Villager uses MacPherson struts for the front suspension and leaf springs for the solid rear axle.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/mercury-cars14.htm] https://www.driverside.com/specs/mercury-villager-2000-3003-6370-0&lt;/ref&gt;  The front brakes were vented discs with rear drums;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1993/1893170/mercury_villager_gs.html|title=Detailed specs review of 1993 Mercury Villager GS offered since mid-year 1992 for North America U.S.|website=www.automobile-catalog.com|access-date=2019-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; anti-lock brakes were fitted as standard equipment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Powertrain ====
The first-generation Villager (and its Quest counterpart) was powered by a single engine through its production.  Sharing its engine with the Nissan Maxima, the Villager was powered by a 3.0L Nissan [[Nissan VG engine#VG30E|VG30E]] V6 (detuned from 160 to 151 horsepower).  A [[Jatco]]-supplied 4-speed automatic was the sole transmission offering.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the development of the VX54 model line, Ford requested several design changes from Nissan before it would use the engine.  Along with making the VG30E a non-interference engine,&lt;ref name="Earth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~vqfaq/Villager_Timing_Belt/|title=Villager and Quest Frequently Asked Questions: ''Villager and Quest Timing Belt''|accessdate=December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford requested the addition of an oil level sensor and the relocation of the oil filter assembly (for better access).

=== Body design ===

At 190 inches long, the first-generation Villager nearly matches the extended-length 1991-1995 Chrysler minivans in length.  In contrast to the Aerostar, the Villager was produced solely as a passenger van and in a single body length.  All versions were produced with single sliding door.

In line with the Mercury Sable and Mercury Topaz sedans, the Villager was distinguished from its Nissan Quest counterpart by its front lightbar grille.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  While the Quest was styled with a monochromatic exterior (for all trims), the Villager used multiple two-toned exterior trims (base trims used wide gray moldings, in line with the 1992 Grand Marquis).  To aid aerodynamics, the exterior door handles were faired into the doors.  In a minivan first, the rear liftgate was modeled after compact station wagons; the rear window opened independently from the door.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For 1996, the exterior underwent a mid-cycle revision.  A conventional grille (modeled after the Sable and Mystique) replaced the lightbar, with restyled taillamps (joined by a red panel), badging, and the introduction of monochromatic exterior trim (for lower trims).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://consumerguide.com/used/1993-98-mercury-villager/|title=1993-98 Mercury Villager|date=2014-07-22|website=Consumer Guide Auto|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the exterior and interior of the vehicle was designed primarily by Nissan, many interior components were sourced from Ford.  In line with the Aerostar, the Villager was equipped with optional rear-seat radio controls and air-conditioning vents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Along with folding/removable second-row seats (bench or bucket, dependent on trim), the third-row bench seat was mounted on sliding tracks, allowing the interior to be reconfigured (for passengers or cargo) without its removal.  To meet passive-restraint requirements, the Villager was initially equipped with automatic seatbelts (the only American-market minivan to do so); for 1994, a driver-side airbag was added, with dual airbags becoming standard for 1996 (replacing the automatic seatbelts).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Trim ===

For 1993, the Villager was offered with ''GS'' and ''LS'' trim levels, in line with Mercury sedans.  The second-row seat of the GS was a two-passenger bench seat; the LS was available with either a bench seat or two bucket seats.  At its launch, the exterior of the GS was produced with wide gray door/bumper moldings (similar to the 1992 Grand Marquis), switching to monochromatic trim for the 1996 model year (with optional two-tone trim); the LS was offered with standard two-tone trim from 1993 to 1998.

==== Villager Nautica ====
[[File:Mercury-Villager.jpg|left|thumb|1994-1995 Mercury Villager Nautica]]
In 1994, Mercury introduced the ''Nautica'' special edition of the Villager.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  In line with [[Eddie Bauer]]-edition Ford vehicles (including the Aerostar minivan), the trim denoted the [[Nautica (clothing company)|namesake clothing company]].  Externally denoted by a blue-and-white color scheme (with a yellow pinstripe), the Nautica was fitted with multi-color leather seats (blue with white inserts); a complimentary luggage set included Nautica-designed duffel bags.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clunkerture.com/home/2014/6/26/adventures-in-special-editions-the-mercury-villager-nautica|title=Adventures in Special Editions: The Mercury Villager Nautica|website=CLUNKERTURE|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jalopnik.com/meh-car-monday-ugh-the-mercury-villager-especially-t-1823903483|title=Meh Car Monday: Ugh, The Mercury Villager, Especially That Nautica One|website=Jalopnik|access-date=2019-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the 1996, multiple two-tone color schemes joined the blue/white exterior.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

For the 1999 model year, Mercury introduced the second-generation Villager.  Again a counterpart of the Nissan Quest, the 1999 Villager shared no sheetmetal with its predecessor.  As with the larger Ford Windstar, a central change of the redesign included the addition of a second sliding door.

=== Chassis specification ===
Carried over from the previous generation, the Ford VX54 platform underpinned the second-generation Mercury Villager and Nissan Quest, sharing its 112.2-inch wheelbase.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1999/1896260/mercury_villager.html|title=Detailed specs review of 1999 Mercury Villager offered since mid-year 1998 for North America U.S.|website=www.automobile-catalog.com|access-date=2019-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Retuned for a softer ride,&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;https://www.cars.com/reviews/chicagotribune-coms-view-1420689119439/&lt;/ref&gt;  the second-generation Villager retained its suspension configuration from the previous generation, including front MacPherson struts and a rear beam axle.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cars.com/reviews/orlando-sentinels-view-1420689134223/&lt;/ref&gt;  The front brakes were vented discs with rear drum brakes; ABS was offered as an option.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://consumerguide.com/used/1999-02-mercury-villager/|title=1999-02 Mercury Villager|date=2014-07-22|website=Consumer Guide Auto|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Powertrain ====
The second-generation Villager received a new V6 engine, again supplied by Nissan.  For 1999, the 3.3L [[Nissan VG engine#VG33E|VG33E]] V6 replaced the previous 3.0L V6; producing 170&amp;nbsp;hp,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; the engine was shared with Nissan light trucks and SUVs in the United States.  A Jatco-supplied 4-speed automatic was the sole transmission paired with the engine.

=== Body design ===

While sharing its wheelbase with its predecessor, the second-generation Villager was five inches longer than its predecessor; slightly larger than the [[Toyota Sienna]], the Villager was approximately six inches shorter than the extended-length GM and Chrysler minivans (and the Ford Windstar).  In contrast to its competitors (except the Chrysler Town &amp; Country), the second-generation Villager/Quest was sold solely with two sliding doors, abandoning the previous single side-door configuration.

While again sharing most body stampings, the exterior of the second-generation Quest and Villager were designed separately, with Ford designer [[Moray Callum]] responsible for the exterior of the Villager.  In place of the chrome-ringed horizontal grille, the Villager adopted a waterfall-style grille (with a much larger Mercury emblem); the rear fascia was given a red trim panel between the taillamps (with amber turn signals).  Several design features from the first generation made a return, including the design of the exterior door handles and the two-way rear liftgate.

Carrying over the reconfigurable 3rd-row seat design from the previous generation,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; the cargo area was revised with the addition of a removable parcel shelf.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  For 2000, a 3-person 2nd-row seat was introduced (increasing capacity to 8) as an option.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  As a $1,295 option, a rear-seat entertainment system was introduced, including a flip-down LCD screen connected to a VCR or video-game console.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/buy/2002-Mercury-Villager/expert-review/|title=2002 Mercury Villager|publisher=Autoblog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2001, the front and rear fascias were revised; the Mercury emblem was centered and enlarged on the grille and liftgate (the foglamps were changed to round lenses).  The instrument panel was redesigned (the electronic instrument panel returned as an option).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;  &lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Trim ===

Abandoning the GS/LS trim nomenclature used by the previous generation, the second-generation Villager was offered in three trim levels:  Villager, Villager Sport, and Villager Estate; the special-edition Nautica trim was discontinued. Externally, the standard Villager was offered in monochomatic colors or with a silver lower body; the Sport was painted with a gray lower body and received upgraded suspension settings and larger wheels and tires.  The Estate was distinguished by a gold lower body, wheels, and badging.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Chinese production ==
From 1995 to 2001, the first-generation Mercury Villager was marketed by Chinese auto manufacturers through the use of [[Knock-down kit|CKD kits]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chinacarhistory.com/2018/02/11/chinese-car-brands-that-time-forgot-guangzhou-yunbao/|title=Chinese Car Brands That Time Forgot: Guangzhou Yunbao|last=Faulkner|first=Author Sam|date=2018-02-11|website=ChinaCarHistory|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://carnewschina.com/2012/09/30/spotted-in-china-dongfeng-fengshen-eq6482/|title=Spotted in China: Dongfeng-Fengshen EQ6482|last=Feijter|first=Author Tycho de|date=2012-09-30|website=CarNewsChina.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guangzhou Yunbao (today part of [[Dongfeng Fengshen]]) marketed the Yunbao YB6480; traditionally using CKD vehicles from Nissan, the YB6480 retained its Mercury badging.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  As largely the same vehicle, Dongfeng Fengshen marketed the Villager as the Fengshen EQ6482.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  While the bodies were manufactured in the United States (for CKD purposes), the engines were manufactured in China (marketed through manufacturers in joint ventures with Nissan).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Through its passenger car division, Guangdong Bus Works produced the GDK6480; with nearly all assembly completed in the United States, only a few parts were added to the vehicle in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chinacarhistory.com/2018/05/07/crazy-car-production-days-of-guangdong-guangdong-passenger-car-factory-gaodeng/|title=Crazy Car Production Days of Guangdong: Guangdong Passenger Car Factory – Gaodeng|last=Feijter|first=Author Tycho de|date=2018-05-07|website=ChinaCarHistory|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Replacement == {{sources|date=March 2020}}{{original research|date=March 2020}}
[[File:BlackMonterey.jpg|thumb|2004-2007 Mercury Monterey]]
In 2000, Ford and Nissan chose to end their joint venture, as both companies had commenced design work on new generations of the Ford Windstar and the Nissan Quest.  Following a shortened 2002 model year, the Ford-Nissan joint venture was concluded, with the final Mercury Villager assembled on June 27, 2002.

After skipping the 2003 model year, both Mercury and Nissan would reenter the minivan segment.  A third generation of the Quest was developed and manufactured by Nissan in the United States (derived from the Maxima), while Mercury replaced the Villager with the Monterey, a counterpart of the Freestar (as Ford renamed the Windstar), intended to compete directly against the Chrysler Town &amp; Country.

The '''Mercury S-55''' is a [[full-size car]] that was marketed by the [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] division of the [[Ford Motor Company]] during the 1960s.  Developed as a performance-oriented version of the [[Mercury Monterey]], the S-55 was the largest vehicle of the Mercury "S" (Special) range introduced in 1962; its Ford equivalent was the [[Ford Galaxie|Ford Galaxie 500XL]].

As consumer buying habits in full-size sedans shifted in the late 1960s, performance-oriented vehicles such as the S-55 fell out of favor, with personal luxury coupes and muscle cars taking its place.  After the 1967 model year, the S-55 was discontinued; its role was largely taken over by the 1969 [[Mercury Marauder]], produced until 1970. 

==  Mercury S (Special) Series ==
For the 1962 model year, to maintain interest in the Ford and Mercury product lines, Ford Motor Company introduced performance-oriented trim packages for both divisions.  Mercury introduced the S (Special) line of sub-models.  While the [[Mercury Comet|S-22 Comet]] and [[Mercury Meteor|S-33 Meteor]] consisted primarily of exterior trim, badging, bucket seats, and floor-mounted shifters, the S-55 (based on the Monterey) offered the same interior features along with a higher-performance powertrain.  

==First generation (1962–1963)==
[[File:Mercury Monterey S55 Marauder (1963).jpg|thumb|1963 Mercury Monterey S-55 Marauder two-door (aftermarket wheels)]]
For 1962, the Mercury S-55 was introduced alongside the Mercury Monterey.  A performance-oriented variant, the S-55 offered an interior with bucket seats and a floor-mounted shifter.  As with the Ford Galaxie 500XL, the S-55 was produced in two-door hardtop and convertible bodystyles.  The S-55 was powered by the two largest engines available in the Monterey, a 390 cubic-inch V8 (300 or 330 hp) or a 406 cubic-inch V8 (385hp or 405hp).  The triple-carbureted version of the 406 was a special-order engine, tested at over 95&amp;nbsp;mph in the quarter mile according to [[Road &amp; Track]] in a road test.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mercurystuff.com/articles/1962-S-55-roadtest/1962-S-55-roadtest.html&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1963, the S-55 model line was expanded, with its availability expanded from two-door tor four-door body styles.  In addition to the previous notchback roofline, buyers now were able to choose a two additional rooflines for sedans, including the "Breezeway" (including a reverse-slant retractable rear window) and "Marauder" (fastback sedan).  As with other Ford Motor Company vehicles, the S-55 saw its 406 V8 replaced by a 410hp 427 cubic-inch V8; the 425hp 427 (largely a racing engine) was a special-order option.  

For the 1964 model year, the S-22, S-33, and S-55 were discontinued.  In its full-size line, performance-oriented sedans remained as the 390 and 427 engines, Marauder fastback roofline, and bucket seats and console interior trim became options for the Monterey, Montclair, and even the luxury-oriented Park Lane product lines. 

==Second generation (1966–1967)==
[[File:1966 Mercury S-55 Convertible.jpg|thumb|1966 Mercury S-55 Convertible]]

For the 1966 model year, the S-55 made its return as a stand-alone model (becoming the only S model to make a return).   As in 1962, the model lineup consisted solely of two-door hardtops and convertibles.  Again based on the Monterey, the S-55 featured a bucket-seat interior with a floor-mounted shifter and a higher-performance powertrain.  Styling accents include unique body side-striping, deluxe wheel covers and the distinctive S-55 emblem on rear quarter panel and 428 V-8 emblem on the front fender sides.    

In place of the 390 and 427 V8 engines, the 1966 S-55 was powered by a single engine.  A 345hp &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;Super Marauder&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; 428 cubic-inch V8 was paired to a 4-speed manual transmission or 3-speed [[Cruise-O-Matic|&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;Merc-O-Matic"]] automatic transmission. This was the same engine that powered the [[Ford Galaxie|Ford Galaxie 500 7-Litre]] of the same year.

For 1967, poor sales of the S-55 demoted the model to become the "S-55 Sports Package".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1967%20Mercury/album_001/1967%20Mercury-15.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1967 Mercury/album_001|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mercury full-size line saw a major exterior update, changing its flat-fendered sides to a more rounded shape.  During the model year, the S-55 Sports Package would be dropped; the division would concentrate its two-door efforts on the smaller [[Mercury Cougar]] and more luxurious [[Mercury Marquis]].  In various forms, the Cougar and Marquis would become the two most successful nameplates ever sold by the Mercury brand. &lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1967 1966 Mercury S-55.jpg|left|thumb|1967 Mercury S-55|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Monday, 10 August 2009|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;

The '''Hirohata Merc''' is a 1950s [[custom car]], often called "the most famous custom of the classic era".&lt;ref name="Tim Bernsau"&gt;{{cite web | last=Bernsau | first=Tim | title=Favorite 50 Rods &amp; Customs| work=Rod &amp; Custom | date=2003-12-01 | url=http://www.hotrod.com/articles/0312rc-favorite-50-rods-and-customs/ | access-date=2018-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Rod &amp; Custom'', 8/89, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; Setting a style and an attitude, it had a "momentous effect" on custom car builders,&lt;ref&gt;DeWitt, John.

The front wheels are fitted with traditional sombrero ('47-'51 Cadillac) hubcaps.&lt;ref name="Jalopy Journal"/&gt;

Skirts were added, fitting flush.&lt;ref name="Jalopy Journal"/&gt; Three '51 Ford grilles were used to custom-fabricate one, and the bumper was fitted with [[Dagmar bumpers|dagmars]].&lt;ref name="Barris.com"/&gt;

Barris used a vee-butted windshield,&lt;ref name="Barris.com"/&gt; a very common customizers' trick in that era, rather than a one-piece windshield, which was available on the '53 Merc.&lt;!--Did it fit? On GM products, it did.--&gt; He added [[Appleton spotlight]]s,&lt;ref name="Jalopy Journal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barris.com"/&gt; [[Frenching (automobile)|frenched]] the headlights (which were fitted with '52 Ford rings),&lt;ref name="Jalopy Journal"/&gt; and added '52 [[Lincoln Capri]] taillights.&lt;ref&gt;They are identical to those used on D'Agostino's Merc. ''Street Rodder'', 1/85, pp.52-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The exhaust pipes were routed out through the rear bumper, beneath the taillights,&lt;ref name="Jalopy Journal"/&gt; and a pair of radio antennae were frenched into the rear quarter panels.&lt;ref name="Jalopy Journal"/&gt;

The Hirohata Merc was painted in two shades of green, a total of thirty coats,&lt;ref name="Jalopy Journal"/&gt; which were applied by Junior Conway.&lt;ref&gt;DeWitt, p.72.&lt;/ref&gt; The interior was upholstered with tuck-and-rolled naugahyde. The dash, seats, and headliner were white with dark green inserts, matching the exterior lower body color (below the Buick spears).&lt;ref name="Jalopy Journal"/&gt;

==Later changes==
Hirohata later replaced the original [[Ford flathead engine#255|Mercury flathead engine]] with a transplanted [[Cadillac V8 engine#OHV|Cadillac]] engine, creating the nickname "Mercillac"&lt;ref&gt;DeWitt, p.69&lt;/ref&gt; ("merk-ill-ack"), in the fashion of [[Hot rod|rodders]] of the period, who in the same way created Fordillacs and [[Studillac]]s.

In 1955, the Merc made an appearance in the film [[Running Wild (1955 film)|''Running Wild'']], for which it was painted gold over the original ice green.&lt;ref&gt;''Rod &amp; Custom'' Magazine, 8/89, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hirohata sold the Merc,&lt;ref name="Jalopy Journal"/&gt; and the car changed hands several times. It was eventually purchased by Jim McNiel for $500 in 1959;&lt;ref&gt;Bernsau, Tim, editor. "Favorite 50 Rods &amp; Customs" (written 1 December 2003), at [http://www.hotrod.com/articles/0312rc-favorite-50-rods-and-customs/ ''Hot Rod'' Magazine online] (retrieved 14 May 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; McNiel used it as a daily driver for years, then placed it into storage.&lt;ref name="Jalopy Journal"/&gt; Ultimately, McNiel restored the Merc to her original configuration.&lt;ref name="Jalopy Journal"/&gt; The paint was done by Hershel "Junior" Conway at Junior's House of Color.

The '''Mercury Milan''' is a [[mid-size car]] that was marketed by the [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] division of [[Ford Motor Company]].  Named after [[Milan]], an Italian city, the Milan was sold across the 2006 to 2011 model years across a single generation.  The smaller of two model lines developed to replace the [[Mercury Sable]], indirectly succeeding the [[Mercury Mystique]] as the smallest Mercury sedan.

Unveiled at the 2005 [[Chicago Auto Show]], the Milan was the first new Mercury sedan nameplate introduced since 1995 and would become the final nameplate introduced by the division.  Coinciding with the 2010 closure of Mercury, the Milan ended sales after a shortened 2011 model year; the final vehicle was produced on December 17, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/index.php/negocios/3028|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311183553/http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/index.php/negocios/3028|archivedate=2012-03-11|url-status=dead|accessdate=2010-11-19}} El Financiero (November 18, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Milan was sold in the United States (including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands), Mexico, and the Middle East.

Throughout its production, the Milan was produced alongside the [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]] at [[Hermosillo Stamping &amp; Assembly]] in [[Hermosillo|Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico]].

== Model overview ==
As the entry-level Mercury sedan, the Milan was slotted below the full-size [[Mercury Montego]] and [[Mercury Grand Marquis]].  The Mercury counterpart of the [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]] and [[Lincoln MKZ]] (introduced as the Lincoln Zephyr), the Milan was developed as the smaller of two sedans intended to replace the Sable (the larger being the Montego).  In contrast to the Sable, the Milan was produced solely as a four-door sedan, marking the first time since 1940 that Mercury did not offer a station wagon.

=== Chassis ===
The Mercury Milan was built upon the [[Ford CD3 platform]]; a variant of the [[Mazda G platform#GG|Mazda GG platform]], it is used by the first-generations of the Ford Fusion, Lincoln Zephyr/MKZ, [[Ford Edge]] and [[Lincoln MKX]].  Using a steel unibody chassis, the CD3 platform is equipped with front-wheel drive as standard.  In 2007, all-wheel drive became an option for versions with V6 engines.  In front, the chassis uses a [[Short long arms suspension|short-long arm]] (SLA) [[double wishbone]] front suspension and an independent multi-link twist blade rear suspension with front and rear [[stabilizer bar]]s.

==== Powertrain ====
During its production, the Mercury Milan shared its powertrain with the Ford Fusion.  From 2006 to 2009, a 160&amp;nbsp;hp 2.3L inline-4 was standard, replaced by a 175&amp;nbsp;hp 2.5L inline-4 for 2010.  A 221&amp;nbsp;hp 3.0L V6 was optional, with output increased to 240&amp;nbsp;hp in 2010.  The Milan did not receive a counterpart of the Ford Fusion Sport, powered by a 3.5L V6.

The four-cylinder engine was equipped with a five-speed manual transmission as standard (the first manual-transmission Mercury sedan since the 2000 Mystique), with a five-speed automatic as an option.  Through its entire production, the V6 was offered solely with a 6-speed automatic transmission (shared with the Fusion and Montego).  For 2010, the four-cylinder engines were updated with 6-speed manual and 6-speed automatic transmissions; the 6-speed automatic on V6 engines was equipped for manually-controlled shifting ("Select Shift").

=== Body ===
As with the larger Montego and Grand Marquis, the Mercury Milan shares a common roofline with its Ford counterpart.  To distinguish the Milan from the Fusion, the model line was fitted with model-specific front and rear fascias.  Along with a waterfall-style grille (derived from the Monterey and Montego), the Milan was fitted with projector headlamps, LED taillamps (extending into the trunklid), and a bumper-mounted license plate (trunklid-mounted on the Fusion).  Dependent on trim level, the Milan was fitted with imitation matte-silver trim or imitation wood trim (similar to the Montego).

For 2007, the Milan underwent several minor revisions.  Externally, Mercury added "MILAN" badging to the front doors.  During the model year, a revision of interior panels led to an improvement in side-impact protection (along with an improvement in safety ratings from the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]).  As an option, a DVD-based navigation system became an option along with a console-mounted [[MP3]] auxiliary jack (as a running change).

Unveiled at the [[LA Auto Show#2008|2008 Los Angeles Auto Show]], the Milan underwent a major mid-cycle update for the 2010 model year (alongside the Fusion and MKZ).   While the rear fascia saw only a minor revision to the taillamps, major revisions were made to the front fascia, including an enlarged grille, and reshaped headlamps and front bumper.  The interior underwent a revision, including a redesigned dashboard.  While not the first hybrid offered by Mercury, the 2010 Milan Hybrid marked the first Mercury hybrid offered as a sedan.  &lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Trim ===
During its production, the Mercury Milan was sold in six different trim levels, dependent on drivetrain configuration selected by the owner.  The base trim levels were ''I4'' and ''V6'', with the top trim (in line with the Montego and Mercury SUVs), ''I4 Premier'' and ''V6 Premier''; ''V6 AWD'' or ''V6 Premier AWD''.

For 2009, a VOGA special-edition option package was introduced, which included model-specific white leather seats and exclusive chrome wheels.

===Safety===
Tests on the 2010 Mercury Milan were conducted by NCAP (New Car Assessment Program).&lt;ref name="HbCars"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hybridcars.com/vehicle/ford-fusion-hybrid.html|title=Ford Fusion Hybrid|accessdate=2009-06-06|publisher=Hybrid Cars}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mercury XM-800''' is a [[concept car]] created by [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] and first introduced at the 1954 [[Chicago Auto Show]].&lt;ref name="Supercars"&gt;{{cite web|title=1954 Mercury Monterey XM-800 - Review |url= https://www.supercars.net/blog/1954-mercury-monterey-xm-800/ |website=Supercars.net |date=19 April 2016 |accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In newspaper publicity at its 1954 debut, in Chicago and elsewhere, it was presented with its full name, Mercury Monterey MX-800.&lt;ref&gt;“Mercury’s New Monterey.” Chicago Tribune, 21 February 1954. March 13-21, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;“Mercury Sends Experimental MX-800 to Show.” Chicago Tribune, 14 March 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;“1st Showing in Chicago…The New Mercury Monterey XM-800.” (Chicago Auto Show Display Ad) Chicago Tribune, 14 March 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;”Experimental Cars by Ford.” Rochester Democrat &amp; Chronicle, 14 March 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;”The New Mercury Monterey MX-800.” Philadelphia Inquirer, 19 March 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;”Advanced Design.” Greenfiled (MA) Recorder-Gazette, 16 April 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; The XM, or experimental Mercury, "push car" (meaning that it was not drivable) went the 1954 US auto show circuit season.&lt;ref name="Supercars"/&gt; Although it was promoted by Ford as an "advanced design, engineered to go into volume production,” the XM 800 never passed the concept phase.

==Background==
The show car was designed by [[John Najjar]]. He was also responsible for the 1955 [[Lincoln Futura]] show car and the mid-engine [[Ford Mustang I]] experimental sports car of 1962. Much of the car's appearance and styling cues were later used on the [[Lincoln Premiere]], [[Lincoln Capri]], [[Mercury Montclair]], [[1955 Ford|Ford Crown Victoria]], and other Ford and Mercury products during the mid-1950s.

The concept model was built by Creative Industries of Detroit on a modified Mercury frame with a 1954 Mercury {{convert|312|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine with dual exhausts.&lt;ref name="conceptcarz"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vaughan |first=Daniel |title=1954 Mercury Monterey XM-800 Concept |url= https://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z7469/Mercury-Monterey-XM-800-Concept.aspx |website=Conceptcarz.com |date=March 2011 |accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features a low fiberglass body with much of its trim was also made out of chrome plated fiberglass and an interior with four bucket seats.&lt;ref name="Cartype"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mercury XM-800: 1954 |url= http://cartype.com/pages/3195/mercury_xm-800__1954 |website=Cartype.com |accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1957 Ford donated the XM 800 to the [[University of Michigan]]'s Automotive Engineering Lab for use in training "future" automotive engineers.&lt;ref name="Carscoops"&gt;{{cite web|title=1954 Mercury XM 800 Concept for sale on eBay |url= http://www.carscoops.com/2008/04/1954-mercury-xm-800-concept-for-sale-on.html |website=Carscoops.com |date=4 April 2008 |accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A March 1957 article in the campus's student newspaper gives details of the then-recent donation, stating that the vehicle "was styled by William Schmidt of Mercury."&lt;ref&gt;Schelkopf, Ronald. “Dream Automobile: Experimental Automobile Used by Engineers.” The Michigan Daily (U. of Michigan), 12 March 1957, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; After the automotive school closed, the show car was auctioned to a private individual who stored in a barn, but never returned.&lt;ref name="conceptcarz"/&gt; It was sold again and stored for almost 30 years before being sold on 2008.&lt;ref name="Carscoops"/&gt;

The '''Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II''' is a [[muscle car]] that was produced by [[Mercury (division)|Mercury]] in early 1969.  The Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II was a special, more aerodynamic version of the [[Mercury Cyclone]].  It was produced specifically to make Mercury even more competitive in [[NASCAR]] stock car racing, and was sold to the public only because [[homologation]] rules required a minimum number of cars (500 in 1969) be produced and made available for sale to the public. All production examples were constructed during the first few weeks of 1969.

==Production==
The Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II was built in only two trim packages:  The Cale Yarborough Special - a white car with red interior and exterior trim, and the Dan Gurney Special - a white car with blue interior and trim.
[[File:Merury Cyclone Spoiller II Cale.jpg|thumb|Cale Yarborough Spoiler II]]
A largely equivalent vehicle was also produced under the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] marque as the [[Ford Torino Talladega]].

The 1969 Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II was based on the Mercury Cyclone "Sportsroof" (Ford's trade name for a [[fastback]]) 2-door hardtop. To make the car more aerodynamic at high speeds, a sleeker front section was added. Regular production Mercury Cyclones had a then-fashionable inset grille and headlights, which fared poorly in the wind tunnel. The Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II had this nose replaced with one that extended the car's length by about six inches, with a flush-mounted grille from a Ford Cobra, identical to the grill used on the [[Ford Torino Talladega]] giving it a much more aerodynamic front end. The close-fitting bumper was actually a rear bumper from a 1969 Ford Fairlane that had been cut, narrowed, V'ed in the center, and filled on the ends to create a crude air dam, further improving the aerodynamics of the car at high speeds. In a well kept, secret design move, the rocker panels were reshaped and rolled to allow Mercury teams to run their racing cars about an inch closer to the ground while staying within NASCAR rules; this also greatly enhanced the top speed of the car by lowering its center of gravity, and further reducing its wind resistance.  All production (homologation) models of the Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II were equipped with a 351 Windsor engine, automatic on the column, and front bench seat.

==Racing==
Racing versions of the car were initially fitted with the Ford FE 427 side oiler engine that had been Ford's main racing engine since 1963.  Later in the season, the [[Boss 429]] engine was used by many of the teams, after it had finally been declared "officially homologated" by NASCAR president, Bill France. The Boss 429 engine was homologated in the 1969 [[Ford Mustang|Ford Mustang Boss 429]]. In a very unusual move, Ford homologated the engine separately from the car in which it was to race.  Many experts think this may have been done in order to get the bodywork of the Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II officially homologated at the beginning of the 1969 race season, as the Boss 429 was not yet in production in sufficient numbers to homologate it.

A prototype of the Cyclone Spoiler II had exposed headlights where the front nose resembled the one based on the [[Datsun 240Z]]. 

The Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II was very successful on the racing circuit: winning 8 Grand National races during the 1969 and 1970 NASCAR seasons - matching the total number of wins recorded by the 1970 [[Plymouth Superbird]].

One important footnote:  1969 was Ford's last year of factory involvement, and/or support, in racing of any kind for several years.  Following Congressional hearings in which they were questioned about the R&amp;D costs of racing vs. improving fuel economy and safety, Ford completely abandoned all of their racing programs, starting with the 1970 season.  Subsequently, most of the NASCAR and ARCA race teams, running Mercurys, continued to run their 1969 Mercury Cyclone Spoiler IIs in 1970 without any factory support, when it became apparent that their Spoiler IIs were aerodynamically superior to the 1970 Mercurys that Ford intended to be their replacement.  After the 1970 season, NASCAR effectively banned the [[Aero Warriors|"aero cars"]], by restricting all five of the limited aero "production" cars to having to compete with engines no larger than 305 cubic inches of displacement (vs. the 426, 427, &amp; 429 inches that the other cars could run), and the competitive history of the Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II (and its fellow aerowarrior rivals) was essentially over.

==Collectability==
Today, a Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II is a very collectible car.  It was a special purpose built vehicle (some have even called it a "showroom race car") with a very strong racing history, that achieved great success during the Aero Wars.  Those examples that still exist today, do so in very limited numbers. For some reason, their values have not risen nearly as high as the [[Mopar]] "aero cars", in spite of their rarity and their great track successes during the pinnacle of stock car racing (the aero wars years).  Some experts have assumed that this was due to the sheer outrageousness of the Dodge Charger Daytona and the Plymouth Superbird, with their huge rear wings; as the MOPAR winged cars' prices have eclipsed the far more subtle bodywork of the Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II.  Regardless, most experts consider the Mercury Cyclone Spoiler IIs (and the Ford Torino Talladegas) to be very undervalued by comparison; but, in 1969 (and over the two years of the aerowars) Mercury's Cyclone Spoiler IIs and Ford's Talladegas owned the high banks of NASCAR and ARCA.

==Rumours==
Until very recently (2010), very little had been written and documented about these rare cars; however, there is now a website that is dedicated to the Talladega and Spoiler cars produced by Ford and Mercury during 1969 as they fired powerful shots during the aerowars. Also, according to rumor from many sources (a sample of which also appears on the Talladega/Spoiler Registry, and is quoted here), Ford's Mercury Division may not have actually built 500 Spoiler IIs.

'''"NASCAR mandated that at least 500 of these hand built extended nose cars had to be manufactured. According to some rumors Mercury built only 351 out of a reported 503 units. How could they have done this? As the story goes they built 351 extended “D” nosed cars; parked them in the front and on the edges of a parking lot; took 152 regular “W” nosed Cyclone Spoilers and parked them in the middle of all the Spoiler IIs in the parking lot. When NASCAR counted the cars they just never looked closely enough at the cars in the rear! However, it must be known that the Marti Report states that 503 Spoiler IIs were manufactured."'''

The legend goes:  When NASCAR indicated they would be coming to count cars, Mercury was way behind in production.  As a last-ditch, "What do we do now?" solution, someone mandated that 152 regular ("W" nose Mercury Cyclones) be painted up in Spoiler colors and trim.  If you examine the handful of Mercury Spoilers (the "W" nose models), you will find that they represent quite a cross section of engine and interior options.  Some are automatics, some are stick shifts, some are big blocks, some are small blocks, some have front bench seats, and some have front bucket seats. There are less thena dozen known Big Block Cyclones left. The lowest known example is vin# 9xxxxx49176 a 390 Improved Performance "S" code car that is also believed to be the only Factory A/C car. This gives a great deal of credibility to this particular rumor.

The '''Mercury Grand Marquis''' is an automobile that was sold by the [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] division of [[Ford Motor Company]] from 1975 to 2011. From 1975 to 1982, it was the premium model of the [[Mercury Marquis]] line of [[Full-size car|full-size sedans]], becoming a standalone model line in 1983.  For 2003 and 2004, it was sold alongside the revival of the [[Mercury Marauder]].

From 1979 to its 2011 discontinuation, the Grand Marquis shared the rear-wheel drive [[Ford Panther platform|Panther platform]] with the [[Lincoln Town Car]] and the Ford (LTD) Crown Victoria.  For 31 years, the Grand Marquis and Crown Victoria were functionally identical twins, built together on the same assembly line in Canada with only minor trim styling separating them.  Produced across three generations, the Grand Marquis was offered nearly exclusively as a four-door sedan; a two-door sedan was marketed from 1975 to 1986.  From 1983 to 1991, the model line included the [[Woodie (car body style)|wood-trimmed]] [[Mercury Colony Park]] station wagon.   

During its production, the Grand Marquis was manufactured at two facilities alongside the (LTD) Crown Victoria and Mercury Marquis: the [[St. Louis Assembly Plant]] in [[Hazelwood, Missouri]] (1979-1985) and the [[St. Thomas Assembly|St. Thomas Assembly Plant]] in [[Southwold, Ontario]], [[Canada]] (1986-2011).  While the closure of Mercury was announced during 2010, Mercury produced a limited run of 2011 vehicles.  On January 4, 2011, the final Grand Marquis rolled off the assembly line, becoming the final Mercury vehicle ever produced.&lt;ref name="autoweek.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20110104/CARNEWS/110109982|title=Mercury rolls into history with build of final Grand Marquis|last=Abdel-Razzaq|first=Lauren|last2=Phillips|first2=David|date=January 3, 2011|publisher=AutoWeek|accessdate=January 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002212120/http://www.autoweek.com/article/20110104/CARNEWS/110109982|archive-date=October 2, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 1967 model year, Mercury debuted the Marquis model line, introducing it as the Mercury counterpart of the [[Ford LTD (Americas)|Ford LTD]].  From 1967 to 1968, the Marquis was a two-door hardtop version of the Mercury Monterey. For 1969, Mercury reconfigured its full-size model range.  While the Marquis was expanded to a full model range, the Montclair and Park Lane were discontinued, with the Marquis adopting the Brougham trim of the Park Lane; the Colony Park station wagon was integrated into the Monterey line.  Replacing the S-55, the Marauder was revived as a fastback variant of the Marquis, lasting through 1970.      

For 1974, the Grand Marquis nameplate made its first appearance, introduced as an interior trim package of the Marquis Brougham.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1974%20Mercury/1974_Lincoln-Mercury_Brochure/1974%20Lincoln-Mercury-08.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1974 Mercury/1974_Lincoln-Mercury_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=June 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1974%20Mercury/1974_Lincoln-Mercury_Brochure/1974%20Lincoln-Mercury-09.html|title=Directory Index: Mercury/1974 Mercury/1974_Lincoln-Mercury_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=June 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to a wood-trim steering wheel, the interior was fitted with leather-and-velour split-bench seats.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For 1975, Mercury discontinued the Monterey (a Mercury nameplate since 1950), with the Marquis becoming the sole full-size Mercury product line.  To expand its full-size model range upward, the Grand Marquis became the highest-trim Marquis, slotted above the Brougham.&lt;ref name="Odin"&gt;Odin, L.C. ''A concise guide to the Ford and Mercury full-size automobile production 1969-1978''. Belvedere Publishing, 2016. ASIN: B01HE91Y4K.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bridging the price and content gap between the Marquis Brougham and the Lincoln Continental, the Grand Marquis gave Mercury an opportunity to compete against the [[Buick Electra 225]], [[Oldsmobile 98|Oldsmobile Ninety Eight]], and [[Chrysler New Yorker#1974-1978|Chrysler New Yorker Brougham]].  As with the Marquis Brougham, the Grand Marquis was equipped with the 460 V8; 4-wheel disc brakes were offered as an option. For 1976, in the interest of fuel economy, a 400 cubic-inch V8 became standard through 1977, with a 351 cubic-inch V8 becoming standard for 1978, when the 460 was deleted from Ford and Mercury vehicles altogether.   For this generation, four-door models were thin-pillar sedans, with frameless door glass but a thin fixed B pillar between the doors.  Coupes retained the hardtop body from pre-1975 cars but had fixed rear windows.   

For the 1979 model year, as Ford and Mercury downsized their full-size model lines, the Grand Marquis made its return, gaining interior space over its 1978 predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1979%20Mercury/1979%20Mercury%20Marquis%20Brochure/image2.html|title=1979 Mercury Marquis Brochure|last=Ristic-Petrovic|first=Dusan|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=June 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For 1980, Ford introduced the [[Ford LTD Crown Victoria|LTD Crown Victoria]] as the first direct counterpart of the Grand Marquis.&lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

}}For 1979, Mercury downsized its full-size model line for the first time, with the Grand Marquis making its return as the premium model of the Mercury Marquis model range.  Seventeen inches shorter and nearly 1000 pounds lighter (dependent on powertrain) than its 1978 predecessor.  While its exterior footprint closely matched the Cougar (Montego) intermediate sedan, the 1979 Grand Marquis saw gains in interior and luggage space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1979%20Mercury/1979%20Mercury%20Marquis%20Brochure/image2.html|title=1979 Mercury Marquis Brochure|last=Ristic-Petrovic|first=Dusan|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=June 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1980s, all three Ford divisions underwent a substantial revision of their full-size and mid-size model ranges.  Within Mercury, for 1983, the Fox mid-size platform was repackaged as the Marquis, with an all-new Cougar produced solely as a two-door coupe (the Zephyr was discontinued, replaced by the front-wheel drive Topaz).  The Grand Marquis was left as the sole full-size Mercury; for the first time since 1951, the division produced a single sedan nameplate (alongside the Colony Park station wagon).

During its production, the first-generation Grand Marquis was marketed against the [[Buick Electra]], [[Oldsmobile 98]], and [[Chrysler New Yorker]] (and [[Chrysler Fifth Avenue|Fifth Avenue]]) both in size and price; by 1991, it would be the final vehicle in its segment produced with a rear-wheel drive layout and a V8 engine.

=== Chassis specification ===
The first-generation Grand Marquis was built on the rear-wheel drive [[Ford Panther platform]].  While Ford and Mercury sedans had shared common chassis underpinnings since 1961, the Panther chassis marked the first time the two model lines shared a common wheelbase (114.3 inches, downsized from 124 inches).

Although reduced in size, the Grand Marquis would retain the basic suspension design of its predecessor, with a [[Beam axle|live rear axle]] suspension and [[Double wishbone suspension|double wishbone]] [[Independent suspension|independent front suspension]], with coil springs at all four wheels.  In 1985, gas-charged shock absorbers were standardized for the model line, with load-leveling rear air suspension introduced as an option.&lt;ref name="Box Panther History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandmarq.net/tiggie/History.htm|title=The Complete "Box" Panther History|accessdate=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Grand Marquis was fitted with front vented disc brakes and rear drum brakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1979%20Mercury/1979%20Mercury%20Marquis%20Brochure/image9.html|title=1979 Mercury Marquis Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1986, 15-inch wheels made their return as standard equipment (after having been an option since 1979).&lt;ref name="Box Panther History" /&gt;

==== Powertrain ====
As the Grand Marquis became a distinct model line for 1983, its powertrain underwent several revisions.  The standard 4.2L V8 was discontinued, with a 130 hp fuel-injected 4.9L V8 (rounded up to 5.0L by Ford) becoming the sole engine offering.  Shared with the Lincoln Town Car and LTD Crown Victoria, in 1986, the 5.0L V8 adopted multi-port fuel injection with a cast-aluminum upper intake manifold, increasing output to 150 hp.&lt;ref name="Box Panther History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1986/1889000/mercury_grand_marquis_4-door.html|title=Detailed specs review of 1986 Mercury Grand Marquis 4-Door offered since October 1985 for North America U.S.|website=www.automobile-catalog.com|accessdate=July 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As an option, a 180 hp 5.8L V8 made its return for the Grand Marquis{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}; shared with Ford police/fleet cars, the 5.8L V8 was the final carbureted engine sold in North America by Ford at the time of its 1991 discontinuation.

Both the 5.0L and 5.8L V8 engines were paired with the four-speed [[Ford AOD transmission|AOD]] overdrive automatic transmission.

=== Body ===
The first-generation Grand Marquis was offered by Mercury solely as a sedan, in two-door and four-door configurations.  For 1983 only, the Grand Marquis was offered as a station wagon (effectively a Colony Park without woodgrain trim); from 1984 onward, all full-size Mercury wagons were Colony Parks.  While styled nearly identical to the LTD Crown Victoria, the first-generation Grand Marquis was three inches longer than its Ford counterpart; alongside the doors and front and rear windows, only the bumpers are externally shared between the two model lines.

After the 1987 model year, the two-door Grand Marquis was discontinued; only 4,904 were produced.&lt;ref name="Box Panther Production Numbers2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandmarq.net/tiggie/Box%20Panther%20Production%20Numbers.htm|title=Box Panther Production Numbers|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Exterior ====
In contrast to the stainless-steel band surrounding the B-pillars of the LTD Crown Victoria, the Grand Marquis was offered with multiple vinyl roof configurations, sharing the B-pillar "coach lamps" of the Lincoln Town Car&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Mercury/1984_Mercury/1984%20Mercury%20Grand%20Marquis%20Brochure/image7.html|title=1984 Mercury Grand Marquis Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Alongside the standard half-length vinyl roof, a full-length roof was offered; the LS offered an additional option of a "formal roof", configured with a "[[Frenching (automobile)|frenched]]" rear window.  The Grand Marquis was styled with a different rear fascia, using full-width taillamps (separated by the license plate).

During its production, the first-generation Grand Marquis underwent minor changes.  For 1982, simulated vents were removed from the front fenders.  For 1983, as the Grand Marquis became a distinct model line, the grille and taillamps were redesigned.&lt;ref name="Box Panther History" /&gt;  For 1985, to lower production costs, the external "Electronic Fuel Injection" and "Automatic Overdrive" emblems were deleted (both had become standard features); for 1986, a CHMSL ([[Automotive lighting#Centre high mount stop lamp (CHMSL)|center brake light]]) was introduced.&lt;ref name="Box Panther History" /&gt;

For 1988, the Grand Marquis underwent a mid-cycle revision, with restyled front and rear fascias, better integrating the bumpers into the bodywork.  To save weight, steel bumpers were replaced by aluminum.&lt;ref name="Box Panther History" /&gt;&lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Interior ====
From 1979 to 1991, the Grand Marquis sedan was offered solely as a six-passenger sedan with a [[Bench seat|front bench seat]].  While largely similar to its Ford counterpart, the dashboard of the Grand Marquis was trimmed with brushed stainless steel; in place of the horizontal speedometer, the Grand Marquis was fitted with two square pods for the fuel gauge, warning lights, and speedometer.

In 1985, the dashboard underwent several revisions.  Alongside the adoption of a [[ISO 7736|single-DIN radio]] unit (phased in across all Ford vehicles), the 8-track cassette player and CB radio options were discontinued; control of the horn shifted from the turn signal stalk to the steering wheel.&lt;ref name="Box Panther History" /&gt;

As part of the 1988 revision, the interior was updated with all-new seats (distinguished by taller head restraints), an updated dashboard (with more wood trim and revised gauges).  The Grand Marquis LS received options including a JBL Audio 6-speaker AM/FM/Cassette stereo system (with a power antenna) and a heated windshield called "[[Instaclear]]".

For 1990, the interior underwent a second major revision.  To comply with passive-restraint regulations, the Grand Marquis was given a driver-side airbag; the rear outboard seats received 3-point seatbelts.&lt;ref name="Liquid's Model Year Changes2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://moldyrabbit.com/liquid/changes.html|title=Liquid's Model Year Changes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501031416/http://moldyrabbit.com/liquid/changes.html#98|archive-date=May 1, 2007|access-date=December 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coinciding with the addition of the airbag, a new steering column consolidated the turn signal and windshield wiper controls onto a single stalk; tilt steering became standard.&lt;ref name="Box Panther History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Liquid's Model Year Changes2" /&gt;  The dashboard was completely redesigned, adopted the horizontal speedometer used by Ford (using a silver background); for the first time, a temperature gauge was included alongside the fuel gauge.&lt;ref name="Liquid's Model Year Changes2" /&gt;

=== Trim ===
From 1979 to 1982, the Grand Marquis returned as sub-model of the Mercury Marquis model line.  Marketed as the flagship Mercury nameplate, the Grand Marquis competed against the [[Buick Electra]], [[Oldsmobile 98]] and [[Chrysler New Yorker]] (and [[Chrysler Fifth Avenue|New Yorker Fifth Avenue]]).  For 1983, the Grand Marquis was expanded to an unnamed standard trim and the top-trim LS.  The former effectively replaced the Marquis Brougham (the Brougham nameplate was adopted by the mid-size Marquis) and the latter was a trim designation adopted across the Mercury model line during the 1980s.

As part of the 1988 model update, the standard-trim Grand Marquis became the GS (in line with the Topaz and Sable).  The badging of the model line underwent a revision, as the script lettering used since its 1975 introduction was replaced by block-style lettering (in the style of the Sable, Topaz, and Tracer); the Lincoln-style hood ornament was replaced by a version with the Mercury "flying M" badge", which were added to the trunklid and wheels.

Unveiled on November 28, 1990, for the 1992 [[model year]], both [[Ford Panther platform|Ford and Mercury Panther-platform cars]] underwent their most extensive changes since their introduction for 1979. While the chassis was retained, the body was all-new from the ground up. After thirteen years on the market, the full-size sedans from Mercury and Ford were struggling against far more modern competition. Additionally, as unintentional consequence of years of [[badge engineering]], the Grand Marquis and its LTD Crown Victoria counterpart were left as virtual identical twins. In a significant break from precedent, the Grand Marquis and Ford Crown Victoria (no longer an LTD model) were allowed completely different bodies; the only visually shared body parts were the front doors and the windshield. Development began in early 1987, with a design approval in 1988, January 14, 1991 start of production, and March 21, 1991 introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=d0LnCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=en53+1987+ford#v=onepage&amp;q=en53%201987%20ford&amp;f=false |title = The Perpetual Enterprise Machine: Seven Keys to Corporate Renewal Through Successful Product and Process Development|isbn = 9780195080520|last1 = Holloway|first1 = Charles A.|last2 = Bowen|first2 = Professor H.

In line with the rest of Ford Motor Company vehicles sold in North America, aerodynamics and fuel economy played a large role in the design of the new Grand Marquis. Unlike the Crown Victoria, which followed the design themes of the Ford Taurus, the Grand Marquis would combine contemporary design with traditional styling features seen in full-size sedans such as full-width taillights, a formal roofline, and a chrome waterfall grille. In various forms, the chrome waterfall grille became a signature styling feature across the Mercury product line from the late 1990s onward.

As part of the redesign, Ford sought a new type of buyer for its full-size Mercury sedan; instead of the older buyers who traditionally bought them, the 1992 Grand Marquis was marketed to younger buyers in need of a larger car than a Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable.&lt;ref name="PM-April 1991"/&gt; As such, the opera lamps and padded vinyl top were discontinued (the latter becoming a dealer-installed option), and the imitation wire wheel covers were replaced by aluminum alloy wheels. Revisions to the suspension and steering were made to improve both ride and handling.&lt;ref name="PM-April 1991"/&gt; To improve stopping, four-wheel disc brakes replaced the rear drum brakes, with optional [[anti-lock brakes|ABS]]; traction control was available as an option.

As with the 1988-1991 models, the Grand Marquis was available in base-trim GS and deluxe-trim LS models. LS models are distinguished by front cornering lamps. From 1992 onward, the Grand Marquis was produced solely as a four-door sedan, as the Colony Park station wagon was discontinued. Ford's [[Keyless Entry System]] became optional on lower trim packages, and standard on upper trim packages.

*'''1992:''' Second-generation Grand Marquis introduced at the North American International Auto Show on January 11, 1991 after the November 28, 1990 unveiling. It launched on March 21, 1991 as an early 1992 model.&lt;ref name="PM-April 1991"&gt;{{cite journal| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0eQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=1992%20mercury%20grand%20marquis%20specs&amp;pg=PA127 |journal=Popular Mechanics |title=Ford Revitalizes Big Car Lineup |date=April 1991 |first=Rick |last=Titus |volume=168 |issue=4 |page=127 |accessdate=January 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; All models come with driver's-side airbag standard with an optional passenger-side airbag.
*'''1993:''' Dual airbags become standard equipment on all models. Radios are redesigned with a new control layout.
*'''1994:''' Increased side door impact protection. A/C refrigerant changed from R-12 to R-134a. 
*'''1995:''' Mid-cycle redesign. Exterior trim features increased use of body-color trim and less chrome. On the front, a larger, rounder grille is better integrated to the body, while all lights on the front are changed to clear lenses. The license plate is now centered in between the taillamps. On the trunklid, the ''Mercury'' and ''Grand Marquis'' lettering is italicized and reduced in size. Inside, much of the interior receives an update, with new seats, door panels, and the entire dashboard is redesigned with attention paid to ergonomics. Switching locations with the climate controls, a [[ISO 7736|Double-DIN radio]] featured large buttons and knobs; on models without automatic climate controls, rotary knobs replaced sliding controls. The power seat controls, if specified, were now located on the door panels along with enlarged buttons for the power windows and door locks. The outdated horizontal speedometer was replaced by instrument cluster used in the Crown Victoria (adding a voltmeter and oil-pressure gauge); a digital instrument panel with trip computer was still an option.
* '''1996:''' No major changes. Inside, the Ford "brick" airbag wheel in use since 1990 was replaced with a new design shared with many Ford and Lincoln-Mercury cars, integrating the horn into a smaller steering wheel hub.
* '''1997:''' Last year for the second-generation Grand Marquis. The Mercury emblems are removed from the C-pillars. Following the discontinuation of the [[Chevrolet Caprice]] and [[Buick Roadmaster]] by General Motors, 1997 Grand Marquis sales would rise over 20% in comparison to 1996.

===Powertrain===
[[File:1995-1997 Mercury Grand Marquis -- 06-20-2011.jpg|thumb|1995–97 Mercury Grand Marquis (with dealer-installed vinyl roof)]]

While the Panther platform was carried over from 1991, an all-new engine would be used for the 1992 Grand Marquis. The replacement for the OHV 5.0&amp;nbsp;L and 5.8&amp;nbsp;L Windsor V8s, the 4.6&amp;nbsp;L SOHC [[Ford Modular engine|Modular V8 engine]] was the first (and as of 2014, the only) overhead-cam V8 to appear in an American-market full-size sedan. Producing 190&amp;nbsp;hp, it was more powerful and more fuel-efficient than either of its predecessors. An optional handling package, including a heavy-duty suspension, 3.27 rear-axle (instead of 2.73), and a dual-exhaust system that raised engine output to 210&amp;nbsp;hp was an option. It was largely the counterpart to the Ford Crown Victoria Touring Sedan.

All models of the Grand Marquis were coupled to a 4-speed automatic transmission. For 1993, the hydraulically controlled AOD transmission was replaced by the electronically controlled AOD-E transmission.&lt;ref name="Liquid's Model Year Changes2" /&gt; In 1995, the AOD-E was replaced the heavier-duty [[Ford AOD transmission#4R70W|4R70W transmission]];&lt;ref name="Liquid's Model Year Changes2" /&gt; it was shared with the Lincoln Mark VIII and Town Car.

=== Production ===
While the redesigned 1992 Grand Marquis/Crown Victoria would prove more fuel efficient than their predecessors, a loophole in [[CAFE]] regulations allowed Ford Motor Company to sell both full-size cars and improve the average economy of all of its cars. CAFE regulations require vehicles with fewer than 75% domestic parts content to be counted as part of an automaker's imported fleet rather than a domestic one. During the 1991 retooling for production of 1992 models at its St. Thomas, Ontario facility, Ford switched a number of its parts suppliers from Canada and the United States to suppliers outside North America, bringing the domestic parts content of the Grand Marquis and Crown Victoria below 75%.&lt;ref name="US ITC 1991"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_E4e1AAAAIAAJ | quote=1992 mercury grand marquis. | title=Rules of origin issues related to NAFTA and the North American automotive industry: report to the Committee on Ways and Means, U.S. House of Representatives, on investigation no. 332-314 under section 332 of the Tariff Act of 1930 | publisher=U.S. International Trade Commission | year=1991 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_E4e1AAAAIAAJ/page/n58 47]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the Grand Marquis was now part of a fleet consisting primarily of the far more fuel-efficient [[Ford Festiva]] rather than other V8-engined cars such as the Cougar and Ford Mustang.

After 1996, General Motors ended production of its B-platform sedans, discontinuing the Buick Roadmaster and Chevrolet Caprice; without its closest direct competitors, Ford and Lincoln-Mercury were left with a highly profitable market niche essentially to themselves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/28/automobiles/behind-wheel-mercury-grand-marquis-rear-drive-but-refusing-retire-case-modern.html?pagewanted=all|title=BEHIND THE WHEEL/Mercury Grand Marquis; Rear Drive but Refusing to Retire: A Case of Modern Maturity|author=Leonard M. Apcar|date=September 28, 1997|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;; however, several competitors began to introduce competitive vehicles in the segment.  Replacing the outdated [[Chrysler Imperial#1990–1993|Imperial]] and [[Chrysler Fifth Avenue#1990–1993: The Final Fifth Avenues|Fifth Avenue]], the 1994 [[Chrysler New Yorker#1994–1997|Chrysler New Yorker]] (bench seat) and [[Chrysler LHS|LHS]] (bucket seats) were the first Chrysler sedans to match the interior dimensions of the Grand Marquis since the 1970s.  For 1995, the [[Toyota Avalon]] was the first Japanese-brand sedan sold with six-passenger seating (although assembled in the United States); an extended-wheelbase version of the Camry, the Avalon was considered a full-size sedan on the basis of its interior space.

The third-generation Grand Marquis went on sale in late 1997 for the 1998 model year with an evolutionary update to the exterior and interior.  While the 1992 Crown Victoria was better received in the marketplace than the new-for-1991 Chevrolet Caprice, its exterior design (inspired by the [[Ford Taurus (first generation)|Ford Taurus]]) was not as popularly accepted as the Grand Marquis. The love-or-hate styling factor was bolstered by the fact that the Grand Marquis outsold the Crown Victoria in 1994 and 1997, despite the Vic's police and fleet sales advantage. Ford took note and kept the Grand Marquis' design language in place for 1998 while bringing much of it to the Crown Victoria to pivot away from 1992-1997 "Aero" look.    

To streamline production, Ford and Mercury returned to a shared rear roofline between the two model lines, using the formal rear styling of the Grand Marquis; the configuration would remain in use through the end of production in 2011.    

With General Motors' full-size B-body vehicles discontinued in 1996 to focus on more profitable SUVs and trucks, the third gen Grand Marquis mostly competed against its Ford Crown Victoria counterpart and remained successful, selling over 100,000 units per year.        

=== Chassis specification ===

The third-generation Grand Marquis retained the Panther chassis from its predecessors, lengthened in wheelbase to 114.7 inches.  To upgrade handling stability, the three-link rear axle (in use on large Fords since 1965) was replaced by a four-link rear axle with a [[Watt's linkage]], though a [[Beam axle|solid rear axle]] was retained.&lt;ref name="Liquid's Model Year Changes2" /&gt;  To improve braking, the four-wheel disc brakes were given dual-piston calipers for the front rotors, requiring the use of 16-inch wheels.&lt;ref name="Liquid's Model Year Changes2" /&gt;  For 2002, ABS became standard.&lt;ref name="Liquid's Model Year Changes2" /&gt;  The traction control (which remained an option) was revised to work at any speed (rather than only low speeds).  

==== Powertrain ====
The third-generation Grand Marquis retained the same powertrain as the 1995-1997 Grand Marquis, with a 4.6L Modular V8 and a 4-speed 4R70W automatic transmission.  In a minor revision, several underhood components were relocated, with the power steering reservoir was attached onto the engine and the coolant overflow reservoir was relocated onto the radiator (both were located on a fender).&lt;ref name="Liquid's Model Year Changes2" /&gt;  In another change, the engine was converted to [[Distributor#Direct and distributorless ignition|coil-on-plug ignition]] along with fail-safe cooling using a dual-speed electric fan.&lt;ref name="Liquid's Model Year Changes2" /&gt;

For 1998, the standard-equipment V8 (with single exhaust) was increased in output to 200 hp (from 190).  The handling suspension package continued in production, paired with the dual-exhaust version of the 4.6L V8, producing 215 hp.  For 2001, the engines were retuned to 220 and 235 hp, respectively.

A 2.73 rear-axle ratio was paired with single-exhaust engines; as part of the handling package, a numerically higher rear-axle ratio was used.  For 2000 and early 2001, a 3.55 rear axle was used; other versions used a 3.27 rear axle.

=== Body design ===

While bearing a strong resemblance to the previous generation, the 1998 Grand Marquis shared only the roof stamping and doors from its 1997 predecessor.  Designers revised the front and rear bumpers, squaring off their design.  The exterior trim was largely simplified, deleting the chrome trim above the headlamps.  The rear fascia is similar to the Crown Victoria but instead uses a red lens panel between the tail lights.  The grille was restyled slightly as a larger version of the 1995-1997 design.    

The interior was carried over from the 1995 update, with a two-spoke steering wheel replacing the previous four-spoke design.  The chrome trim was deleted from the column-mounted gear shifter and the turn signal lever.&lt;ref name="Liquid's Model Year Changes2" /&gt;  For 2001, the Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis adopted radios with an integrated clock function (used by other Ford vehicles since the early 1980s), with the separate digital clock deleted.&lt;ref name="Liquid's Model Year Changes2" /&gt;  &lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

For 2003, the Grand Marquis saw an extensive styling update and the Ford Panther chassis was redesigned for the first time since its introduction for 1979.  During the 2000s, Mercury would introduce two additional full-size sedans: the 2003-2004 [[Mercury Marauder]] and the 2005-2007 [[Mercury Montego]] (rebranded the 2008-2009 [[Mercury Sable]]).  In addition, the Grand Marquis largely replaced the Ford Crown Victoria in the retail market since the CV was removed from retail sale for the 2008 model year. This was reflected in the fourth generation Grand Marquis' styling shifting over to the more generic look of the third gen Crown Victoria, combining elements of both vehicles into one model that would serve both customer bases.

In 2010, the Grand Marquis marked 35 years of production, overtaking the Cougar as the longest-produced nameplate sold by the Mercury brand. In September 2010, after a short production run, the final versions for retail sale were produced. Slated to end production in December 2010, the production of fleet models was extended due to a parts shortage at the St. Thomas, Ontario factory. On January 4, 2011, the last Grand Marquis was produced in St. Thomas; it was the very last Mercury produced by Ford.

=== Chassis ===
While styling changes to the 2003 Grand Marquis were evolutionary, the changes to the Panther platform were far more extensive. To improve chassis rigidity, an all-new frame was introduced with [[Vehicle frame#Boxed|fully boxed]] and [[Hydroforming|hydroformed]] frame rails. In an effort to improve handling, the front and rear [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] were redesigned along with the brakes. A quiet EBD brake booster with a mechanical panic assist system was added. The new suspension changes required changing wheel designs to those with a high positive offset. [[Rack and pinion#Steering|Rack and pinion steering]] replaced the old [[recirculating ball]] system in an effort to increase steering precision and reduce costs.
In standard versions of the Grand Marquis, the rear-axle ratio was 2.73:1; in LSE and versions with the handling suspension, a 3.27:1 rear-axle ratio was used. The handling package was standard equipment on LS-trim export models.

For 2008, the Handling and Performance Package as well as the 5-passenger front bucket-seat option were both discontinued; both were similar to the Crown Victoria's LX Premium Sport and Handling Package. These were the only post-1992 Grand Marquis variants produced for North America to be equipped with dual exhaust.

For the 2003 model year, the Grand Marquis retained the version of the Modular V8 introduced in 2001. Single-exhaust versions produced 220&amp;nbsp;hp, while the dual-exhaust version raised output to 235&amp;nbsp;hp. During the redesign, a number of changes were made to the engine. The oil pan was enlarged 20% to six quarts and an engine knock sensor was made standard. Other changes included an intake manifold with aluminum water crossover and an electronic returnless fuel system. The new engine was distinguished by a redesigned engine cover, featuring a chrome "V8" emblem; the oil filler cap was moved to the passenger-side valve cover and the power steering fluid reservoir was moved off of the engine block onto the radiator shroud.
For 2006, revisions to engine tuning added 4&amp;nbsp;hp to both versions of the Modular V8, for a total of 224 and 239&amp;nbsp;hp, respectively. In 2007, the engine was given [[Flexible-fuel vehicles in the United States|flex-fuel capability]] ([[E85 in the United States|E85]]). After the 2007 model year, the 239&amp;nbsp;hp version of the Grand Marquis was sold exclusively for GCC export.

All versions of the Grand Marquis were sold with variants of the AOD 4-speed overdrive automatic transmission. From 2003 to 2005, the [[Ford AOD transmission#4R70W|4R70W]] was used. In 2006, it was replaced by the [[Ford AOD transmission#4R75E|4R75E]] shared with the Ford truck lineup.&lt;ref name="Liquid's Model Year Changes2" /&gt;

=== Exterior ===
As part of the redesign, Lincoln-Mercury stylists were tasked with giving the Grand Marquis a more contemporary look, bringing it in line with other Mercury-division vehicles. While largely evolutionary, a number of changes modernized the exterior. In a change similar to the 2003 Town Car redesign, the heavily rounded bumpers seen on the Grand Marquis since 1992 gave way to a squared-off lower look. The trunk and taillight trim was simplified with more contemporary badging. In the front, to improve cooling, a larger grille introduced the Grand Marquis to the Mercury waterfall-style grille trim. Grand Marquis LS Limited Editions were equipped with a hood ornament, seen for the first time since 1991; the option also marked the return of factory-produced two-tone paint. To ease production, the Grand Marquis adopted body-color trim for the B-pillars, similar to the Crown Victoria.

In 2005, for a single year, the radio antenna became externally mounted, to the rear fender. After years of declining sales, chrome wire wheel covers were optional from the factory for the last time. For 2006, the Grand Marquis was given a mid-cycle exterior update, in what would be the last styling update for the Panther vehicles. The trapezoidal grille seen since 1995 was replaced by a rectangular one with a waterfall pattern similar to the Montego; the headlight clusters no longer extended to the sides of the grille, in a fashion similar to the 1988-1991 Grand Marquis. A redesign of the lower bumper allowed the addition of foglights as an option for the first time. In the rear, the trunk trim was changed from red to gray.

=== Interior ===
While not as extensive as changes to the exterior or chassis, Mercury made a number of changes to update the interior of the Grand Marquis in its 2003 redesign. Updated door panels and redesigned switchgear improved interior ergonmics, while the dashboard from 1995 remained in place. A dual media (cassette/CD) player made standard along with a valet key.&lt;ref name="Liquid's Model Year Changes2" /&gt; In the interest of safety, and to keep up with other Ford Motor Company vehicles, a shoulder belt was added for the rear middle passenger and side airbags were introduced as an option.&lt;ref name="Liquid's Model Year Changes2" /&gt;

In 2005, due to several mechanical modifications, several changes are made.&lt;ref name="Liquid's Model Year Changes2" /&gt; The steering column is replaced with a non-locking design; a flat-top steering wheel replaces the round-top version used since 1998. A fully electronic throttle moves the [[cruise control]] function into the main engine computer. For the front seats, occupant weight sensors were added, which allowed the front passenger airbag to be disabled. An Audiophile 6-disc in-dash CD changer became available as an option on LS-trim models.

For 2006, another major change was made as the instrument panel on all Panther-platform cars was redesigned; the optional digital instrument panel was discontinued, as was the use of an analog odometer. While the oil pressure and voltage gauges were removed, a notable addition was a [[tachometer]]; the Grand Marquis was one of the very last Ford vehicles sold without one. Similar to other Ford vehicles, the new instrument panel features a Driver Information Center (trip computer), consolidating many functions previously seen in the overhead console in between the speedometer and tachometer. In 2007, an auto-dimming rearview mirror was added as an option, along with a full-size spare tire (making its return). In 2009, due to federal regulations, side airbags became standard equipment along with recessed window switches.

=== Trim ===
As part of the redesign, Mercury would change the Grand Marquis trim lineup for 2003. In place of the traditional two-model line, the Grand Marquis was expanded to five. In addition to the base-trim GS, there was now ''GS Convenience'', ''LS Premium'', ''LS Ultimate'', and ''LSE''. Introduced at the Chicago Auto Show in February 2001, and in showrooms by May, the LSE was designated as the LS Premium with a heavy-duty rear suspension, shorter rear-axle ratio, and a 239-hp dual-exhaust engine; it offered 5-passenger seating with leather, dual power bucket seats, with a center console and floor shifter. The 2003 LSE was short-lived, as its production ended in December 2002; it made a brief return for 2005.

From 2003 to 2005 a ''Limited Edition'' version of the LS model was sold. This included an appearance package with chromed mirrors, body colored door handles, and a two-tone leather interior. Limited Edition models also came with side airbags standard. They included a Mercury badge [[hood ornament]], making its return for the first time since 1991.

For 2007 LS models, a ''Palm Beach'' trim option was available; it consisted primarily of special upholstery and badging. For 2009, following the introduction of a "No-Stock" marketing guideline by Lincoln-Mercury, the Grand Marquis trim line underwent a revision. Aside from long-wheelbase GCC export models, the GS was dropped, while the LS was split into two series: ''LS Fleet'' and ''LS Retail''. The former was available exclusively for fleet purchase in the United States while the latter was available only by dealer special order to minimize unsold inventory of cars. Moreover, incentives as high as $4000 per vehicle were added to remove previous stock from dealer lots. As Ford had announced the discontinuation of the Mercury brand in the summer of 2010, all 2011 examples are ''Mercury Grand Marquis LS Ultimate Editions.''

==Discontinuation==
On June 2, 2010, Ford announced that it would end production of all Mercury vehicles by the end of 2010 as it discontinued the brand after 72 years. As a result of an unplanned delay in parts shipments, the final Grand Marquis was produced on January 4, 2011 at 7:46 am.&lt;ref name="autoweek.com"/&gt; The [[St. Thomas Assembly]] plant in Ontario, Canada closed in September 2011, bringing an end to the production of the [[Ford Crown Victoria]] and Lincoln Town Car.

In continuous production for 36 years, the Grand Marquis was the longest-produced Mercury. In total, nearly 2.7 million were produced, making it the best-selling vehicle sold by the brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/images/10031/flm_facts.pdf |title=Mercury History |publisher=Ford Motor Company |accessdate=February 13, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821150354/http://media.ford.com/images/10031/flm_facts.pdf |archivedate=August 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Ford Motor Company models in North America, only the Ford Econoline, Ford Mustang, Ford Thunderbird, Ford F-Series, and Lincoln Continental nameplates have been produced longer. The [[Ford Panther platform|Panther platform]] served as the basis for Grand Marquis design for 32 years. Nearly unmatched by other automakers for longevity, the external appearance of the Grand Marquis remained largely unchanged for the last 19 years of its production life (along with its engine, the 2011 model shared a number of body panels with its 1992 counterpart).

==Export markets==
During its production, the Grand Marquis was sold throughout North America, although it was not always badged as a Mercury. Outside of North America, exports were concentrated on the Middle Eastern market, where its large size and V8 power were attributes still sought by buyers towards the end of production.

===Canada===
After 1999, [[Ford Motor Company of Canada|Ford of Canada]] discontinued sales of the Ford Crown Victoria outside of commercial fleets and law enforcement, concentrating civilian sales in Canada on the Mercury Grand Marquis. Following the 2004 model year, the Mercury brand was phased out in Canada, though Ford of Canada would market the Grand Marquis through its Ford dealerships. Sales continued through the end of production in 2011, as it was replaced by the redesigned Ford Taurus introduced for 2010.

===Mexico===
Ford de Mexico would market the Mercury Grand Marquis under the Ford brand twice. In 1982, the Grand Marquis was introduced as the replacement for the Ford LTD Crown Victoria and wagons, but it was always sold in Mexico as a Ford model. The Mexican Grand Marquis wagon was produced and sold for the mexican market as the Ford Grand Marquis Country Squire; it was sold through the 1984 model year. As Mexico banned the sale of vehicles with 8-cylinder engines{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}, the Grand Marquis was replaced by a Ford-badged version of the Mercury Cougar. For 1992, Ford de Mexico reintroduced the Grand Marquis, marketing it as the flagship of the Ford model line. From 1992 to 1994 it was manufactured in Mexico.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}, after which it was imported from St. Thomas, Ontario, Canada. Wearing both Ford and Mercury badging, the Grand Marquis adapted a Ford Blue Oval on the trunklid after 1998.

Although the Ford Grand Marquis was considered a sales success in Mexico and developed a reputation for luxury and prestige as the most expensive domestic nameplate available for sale, as in the United States, sales began to decline as the model aged. For the 2005 model year, Ford de Mexico replaced the Grand Marquis with the Ford Five Hundred, sold through 2007.

===Middle East (GCC)===
[[File:GCC Marquis.jpg|thumb|alt=Middle Eastern 2003 Grand Marquis LS, equipped with the Export Handling Package featuring '03–'05 LSE wheels|GCC-spec 2003 Grand Marquis LS]]
The Grand Marquis and its [[Ford Crown Victoria]] counterpart were marketed in [[Kuwait]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], two members of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] (GCC). The ''GCC-Spec'' vehicles initially offered a lower price, reliability, and relative simplicity (compared to German and Japanese luxury sedans), but the GCC-spec Mercury Grand Marquis began to lose market share in the 2000s towards updated competitors (such as the Holden-produced [[Chevrolet Caprice#Middle East|Chevrolet Caprice]] and [[Dodge Charger (LX)|Dodge Charger]]).

====Modification====
[[File:Grand Marquis GCC Seats.jpg|thumb|Rear interior, showing 40/20/40 Lincoln Town Car front seats]]
[[File:GCC Grand Marquis Mirror Warning.jpg|thumb|[[Arabic language|Arabic]]-language "[[Objects in mirror are closer than they appear]]" warning]]

Produced alongside North American examples in St. Thomas, Ontario, GCC-Spec versions of the Mercury Grand Marquis included several mechanical and trim modifications.

All were fitted with the High Ambient Temperature and Speed Package, heavy-duty battery, and an auxiliary transmission fluid cooler. Prior to 2002, export vehicles included a catalytic converter delete option. All standard-wheelbase examples were fitted with true dual exhaust.

To upgrade handling, the Grand Marquis was available with an Export Handling Package as an option. The counterpart to the Handling and Performance Package sold in the United States, the Export Handling Package consisted of rear air suspension (with stiffer springs), a larger front stabilizer bar and a heavy-duty rear stabilizer bar. In contrast to the U.S., the GCC-spec option retained the stock rear axle ratio. Standard on the LS trim level, the package was available for any standard-wheelbase GCC-spec Grand Marquis. Following 2003, the model was identified by a trunklid spoiler (shared with the Mercury Marauder).

From 1998, the GCC-spec Mercury Grand Marquis was fitted with the 40/20/40 split front seats of the Lincoln Town Car (in place of a 50/50 split bench). To accommodate for the Middle Eastern climate, cloth seats are standard equipment, with leather upholstery as an option. In addition, the language of warning labels are in [[Arabic]].

====Trim variation====
[[File:GSL Badge.jpg|thumb|C-pillar badging on a 2009 Grand Marquis GSL]]
Middle Eastern versions of the Grand Marquis are equipped with slightly different options and features than their [[North America]]n counterparts. Prior to 2009, six different trim levels were available: 
*GS
*GS Convenience
*GSL
*LS (LSE limited to mid-2001 to mid-2003 and 2005 [[model year]])
*LS Premium
*LS Ultimate

In 2009, the LS models were only available with a column shifter and 40/20/40 [[Lincoln Town Car]] seats, available in luxury cloth or leather trim. The GSL is a long-wheelbase model offering {{convert|152|mm|in}} of extra leg room for rear passengers. It is equipped like an LS model, with standard features such as an 8-way power driver's seat (2 way manual passenger seat), side airbags, leather-wrapped steering wheel, automatically dimming rearview mirror, electronic climate control, power-adjustable pedals, premium sound system with CD and cassette, 17-inch wheels with 235/55WR17 Goodyear Eagle RS-A tires, heated door mirrors, fog lights and special "GSL" badging. The once-optional gauge cluster is standard, with controls located on the centre of the dashboard, between the headunit and climate controls. In [[North America]], this model was only available to fleet customers as a commercial (taxi) version of the [[Ford Crown Victoria]].

For 2009, the Grand Marquis was only available in two different trim levels: GSL and LS, both of which were near identical in terms of features and options. The LS was a Fleet model, which was heavily de-contented, losing once-standard features such as an overhead console with compass and a power passenger seat. The Export Handling Package was dropped, eliminating features such as the [[Mercury Marauder]] spoiler and rear air suspension.

For 2010, the GS model reappeared in the line up, and several features (such as the Mercury Marauder spoiler) became available as standalone options. The Export Handling Package was made standard along with a power passenger seat. In Kuwait, the LS model (M7F) was not available to the general public in 2010, as they are heavily sold to fleet buyers, such as the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Health and state-owned [[Kuwait Oil Company]], where they are given to employees as fringe benefits.

For 2011, the long wheelbase GSL was replaced by the GS, and the LS model was made available again to the general public in Kuwait. The LS Ultimate Edition remains a Fleet model and differed slightly from the GS, equipped with leather seats, electronic automatic temperature control (EATC), and an automatically dimming rear-view mirror. Lumbar support was no longer available.

Adopting its nameplate from a marque of [[Ford Motor Company of Canada|Ford Canada]] during the 1940s and 1950s, the Monarch was marketed as the Mercury counterpart of the [[Ford Granada (North America)|Ford Granada]] in North America. Slotted between the Comet (replaced by the Zephyr for 1978) and the Montego (renamed the Cougar for 1977), a single generation of the Monarch was produced. 

Originally developed to replace the Comet, the Monarch was remarketed in response to the 1973 fuel crisis as Ford sought to introduce premium-content compact vehicles.  Sharing its chassis underpinnings with the Comet/Maverick, the Monarch and Granada marked the final evolution of the 1960–1965 Ford Falcon platform architecture.  

Following the 1980 model year, the Monarch was discontinued, replaced by Cougar sedans and station wagons from 1981 and 1982.  For 1983, the Cougar reverted to a coupe configuration, with other body designs adopting the Marquis nameplate (replaced by the Mercury Sable in 1986).      

Alongside the Granada, Ford assembled the Monarch at [[Mahwah Assembly]] ([[Mahwah, New Jersey]]) and [[Wayne Stamping &amp; Assembly]] ([[Wayne, Michigan]]).  In total, 575,567 Monarchs were produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmv-registry.com/21869.html |title=Production &amp; Registry Totals |work=The Granada-Monarch-Versailles Registry |accessdate=2008-05-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530224826/http://www.gmv-registry.com/21869.html |archivedate=2009-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Developed as an extensively updated Mercury Comet for the 1975 model year, the Mercury Monarch originated as external circumstances outside of Ford Motor Company forced major changes in consumer buying habits. The 1973 fuel crisis would lead to buyers valuing luxury over performance, with fuel economy becoming a key attribute. As Ford predicted the compact segment would grow in sales, the Comet/Maverick would remain in production. For 1975, Ford introduced the restyled Maverick as the Ford Granada; the restyled Comet became Mercury Monarch.

Although General Motors introduced the [[Buick Apollo|Buick Apollo (later Skylark)]] and [[Oldsmobile Omega]] in 1973, the Granada/Monarch would be one of a few vehicles that would break a long-standing tradition within American auto manufacturers of associating size with luxury. To differentiate the Granada/Monarch from the Maverick/Comet, Ford offered the new-generation vehicles with a number of comfort and convenience features in a compact-segment car.

== Overview ==
=== Chassis ===
As with the Ford Granada, the Mercury Monarch shared its unibody chassis with its Ford Maverick/Mercury Comet predecessors.  Based heavily on the first-generation Ford Falcon from 1960, the design utilized coil spring front suspension with a leaf-sprung live rear axle; due to its Falcon origins, the Monarch was also loosely mechanically related to the first-generation Ford Mustang and Mercury Cougar.

The base engine was a [[Ford straight-six engine|{{convert|200|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] inline six-cylinder engine, with a {{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-6|inline six]] optional. [[V8 engine|V8]] power came from one of two options: the {{convert|302|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} or {{convert|351|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford Windsor engine|Windsor]] engines.

=== Body ===
Although originally developed to become the Mercury Comet, the Mercury Monarch was differentiated from the Comet produced alongside it in a number of ways.  Using the [[Mercedes-Benz W114|Mercedes-Benz 280]] as a benchmark for its styling and interior packaging,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web
  | title=Road and Track - Aug 1974 first paragraph | url= http://www.lincolnversailles.com/Granada/RT_FG2.htm
  | accessdate = 2011-03-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Monarch abandoned the [[Coke bottle styling]] of the Comet for straighter-edged body panels.  In the front, the Monarch adapted much of the styling of the Marquis (with single exposed headlights).  While the roofline of the four-door model was heavily influenced by Mercedes-Benz, the two-door was given its own roofline with vertical [[opera window|opera windows]]. The rear featured horizontal wrap-around taillamps with amber reflectors and a color-keyed decorative trim panel with a fuel filler door.

In 1978, the Monarch underwent an exterior facelift; the headlamps were converted from round to rectangular, with the turn signals moved under the headlamps. The taillamps were revised to all red lenses and the center trim panel was changed to a new design with an argent finish on base models and matching red reflector on top trim levels. 

On the inside, in contrast from other Lincoln-Mercury cars, the Monarch was equipped with front bucket seats.  While a feature associated with sporty cars at the time, the individual seats (from the [[Ford Granada (Europe)|European Ford Granada]]) were chosen for their support and range of adjustment.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;http://www.lincolnversailles.com/Granada/RT_FG5.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to European cars, the wood-trimmed dashboard of the Monarch was equipped with three instruments: a speedometer, fuel gauge, and a clock.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;http://www.lincolnversailles.com/Granada/RT_FG5.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Trim ===
At its launch, the Monarch was available in two trim levels: base and Ghia.  For 1977, the two-door coupe was produced in an S (Sports Coupe) trim.  For 1978 and 1979, the ESS (European Sports Sedan) trim was available, distinguished by blacked-out exterior trim.

====Grand Monarch Ghia====
[[File:1975 Mercury Monarch GHIA, Dutch licence registration 43-FV-BH.JPG|thumb|right|1975 Mercury Grand Monarch Ghia]]
The '''Mercury Grand Monarch Ghia''' was offered from 1975 to 1976, marketed as the highest-trim version of the Monarch.  Adopting many features shared with the larger Marquis and [[Mercury Grand Marquis|Grand Marquis]], the Grand Monarch Ghia offered a sophisticated central hydraulic power system and four-wheel disc brakes not used on the standard Monarch or Granada.  According to the May 1976 edition of ''[[Car and Driver]]'', three out of five of Ford top executives, including [[Henry Ford II]], used the Mercury Grand Monarch Ghia as their personal car.

Other standard Grand Monarch Ghia features included:

* [[Leather]] trim
* [[Vinyl roof]]
* [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] [[clock]]
* Leather-wrapped [[steering wheel]]
* [[Power steering]]
* Dual map lights
* Illuminated visor vanity mirror (passenger side)
* 14-inch [[Alloy wheels|cast-aluminum spoke wheels]]
* [[Ignition system#Electronic ignition|Solid-state ignition]]
* [[Whitewall]] [[Radial tire|steel-belted radial tires]]
* Reclining [[bucket seats]] with matching map pockets
* Plusher carpeting and soundproofing

[[File:1977 Lincoln Versailles sedan (17533947738).jpg|thumb|1977 Lincoln Versailles (successor to Grand Monarch Ghia)]]
For 1977, the Grand Monarch Ghia was withdrawn and repackaged as the [[Lincoln Versailles]]. Intended as a response to the [[Cadillac Seville]], the Versailles adopted much of the content of the Grand Monarch Ghia with a slightly restyled exterior. Among one of the most controversial examples of [[Rebadging|badge engineering]] in the American automotive industry, the Lincoln Versailles was withdrawn during the 1980 model year.

The '''Mercury Marauder''' is an automobile nameplate that was used by three distinct full-size cars produced by the [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] division of [[Ford Motor Company]]. Deriving its name from the most powerful engines available to the Mercury line, the Marauder was marketed as the highest-performance version of the full-size product range.

During its first production run, the Mercury Marauder was a trim option on standard Mercury coupes; the equivalent of the [[Ford Galaxie|Ford Galaxie 500 and 500/XL]], the Marauder was given a "fastback" rear roofline.  For 1966, the Marauder was replaced by the similar [[Mercury S-55]]; remaining the counterpart of the 500XL, the S-55 transitioned the Marauder from a trim option to a distinct model.  

For its second production run, the Mercury Marauder returned for 1969 as a fastback version of the [[Mercury Marquis]].&lt;ref name="Odin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Odin |first=L.C. |title=A concise guide to the Ford and Mercury full-size automobile production 1969-1978 |publisher=Belvedere Publishing |year=2016 |asin=B01HE91Y4K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed to bridge the gap between the Mercury Cougar and Continental Mark III, the Mercury Marauder was repackaged as a [[personal luxury car]]. After the 1970 model year, the Mercury Marauder was discontinued.  

For the 2003 model year, the Mercury Marauder nameplate was revived as a high-performance variant of the full-size [[Mercury Grand Marquis|Grand Marquis]].  After lower than expected sales, the Marauder was discontinued at the end of the 2004 model year.  As it was the final nameplate introduced on the Panther platform architecture, the Mercury Marauder remains the final rear-wheel drive sedan introduced by Ford Motor Company in North America (as of the 2020 model year).

== Origin of name ==
The Marauder name made its first appearance in 1958 as Ford introduced a [[Ford MEL engine|new family of V8 engines]] for its Mercury, Edsel, and Lincoln brands. Exclusive to Mercury was a {{convert|383|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine.  Dubbed ''Marauder'', it produced {{convert|330|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} with an optional 4-barrel carburetor. In that tune, the engine was available in the Montclair and Colony Park.  Shared with Lincoln, a {{convert|360|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|430|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 was available as an option. Exclusive to Mercury, a ''Super Marauder'' triple two-barrel carburetor became the first mass-produced engine sold in the United States with an advertised {{convert|400|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} output&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eT7LT69STO0C&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=Super+Marauder+boasted+the+highest+advertised+horsepower+rating+in+1958+400 |title=Ultimate American V-8 Engine Data Book |last=Sessler |first=Peter C. |publisher=Motorbooks |year=2010 |isbn=9780760336816 |edition=Second |page=139 |accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the option was available on all Mercury vehicles.     

For 1959, the Super Marauder option was discontinued; the 430 remained, although retuned with slightly lower engine output.  For 1960, 383 Marauders became optional in all Mercury vehicles, including the Monterey, Park Lane, and Commuter.

For the 1961 model year, the 383 and 430 big-block engines were phased out of the Mercury division, as the product cycle of Edsel-based vehicles ended and Ford sought to bring Mercury closer to the Ford brand.  In response, Mercury shifted the use of the Marauder name on smaller [[Ford FE engine|Ford FE V8 engine]]s.

}}

The Mercury Marauder nameplate made its debut as a trim package of each of the four Mercury full-size series, including the [[Mercury Monterey|Monterey]], [[Mercury Montclair|Montclair]], [[Mercury S-55|S-55]] (1963 only), and [[Mercury Park Lane|Park Lane]] in the Spring of 1963. For the first time for a mid-year introduction, the Marauder was introduced as a "1963½" model (as was an entire line of new, "sports" models from Ford in many of the existing series).  All 1963½ Marauders were two-door hardtops.    

In sharp contrast to the distinctive reverse-slant "Breezeway" roofline option, the Marauder hardtop coupe was styled with a sloping [[notchback]] rear roofline; matching the same roofline that was introduced at the same time on the contemporary Galaxies.  This roofline was optimized to make the large sedan more competitive for [[stock car racing]].  Along with the "sportier" roofline, the Marauder trim package included bucket seats and central console, similar to its Ford counterpart.     

[[File:1965 Mercury Montclair Marauder hardtop sedan (7708089266).jpg|thumb|left|1965 Mercury Montclair Marauder 4-door hardtop]]

For 1964, the availability of Mercury Marauder expanded to four-door hardtops; along with two-doors, four-door hardtops also included a fastback roofline.  The blocky "Breezeway" models continued as before. 

Shared with the rest of the Mercury sedan line, the Mercury Marauder was powered by Ford "FE-Series" V8 engines, shared with the big Fords and the Thunderbird.  A 390 cubic-inch Marauder V8 was standard, with a 427 cubic-inch Super Marauder V8 replacing a 406 V8 in 1964.  Along with 3-speed and 4-speed manual transmissions, a 3-speed "Multi-Drive Merc-O-Matic" automatic transmission was offered.  

For 1965, Mercury advertising emphasized the car's luxury and close relationship with [[Lincoln Automobile|Lincoln]].  This meant deemphasizing performance and sporty styling.  This followed a general trend toward more luxury with the introduction of the [[Ford LTD (Americas)|Ford Galaxie 500 LTD]], [[Chevrolet Caprice|Chevrolet Impala Caprice]], and [[Plymouth VIP|Plymouth Fury VIP]].  Nevertheless Mercury continued to offer the Marauder option in all three series (Park Lane, Montclair, and Monterey) for both the hardtop coupe and hardtop sedan; however it wasn't heavily advertised (and not even mentioned in dealer brochures).  Marauders got a tiny emblem (with flag) on the "C" pillar to distinguish them from other models. All full size Mercury hardtop coupes got the same "slantback" roofline as in the big Ford, which was basically a more sharply-angled version of the 1964 Marauder roofline.  Four-door hardtops got a new formal "limousine" styled notchback roofline that was shared with Ford's Galaxie hardtop sedans.  Mercury continued to advertise the big-block FE-series V8s as "Marauder" engines.  

For the 1966 model year, as Mercury shifted away from full-size performance vehicles, the Marauder was replaced by a repackaged S-55; the move also consolidated the options of three model lines into a distinct nameplate.

For the 1969 model year, Mercury returned the Marauder nameplate to its product line.&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;  In addition to replacing the S-55, the Marauder was repackaged as a [[personal luxury car]], effectively giving Mercury a competitor against the General Motors E-Body coupes ([[Buick Riviera]] and [[Oldsmobile Toronado]]).  Sharing the roofline of the [[Ford Galaxie#1969–1974|Ford XL and Ford Galaxie 500 SportsRoof]]&lt;ref name= Odin /&gt;, the Marauder shared its front sheetmetal and its interior trim with the Mercury Marquis.  The Marauder was based on the 121-inch wheelbase chassis used by full-size Ford vehicles (and the Mercury Colony Park station wagon).    

Similar to other 1960s vehicles with fastback rooflines, its rear window was "tunneled", with large rear C-pillars.  In the rear quarter panels, non-functional louvered side air intakes were added as a styling element.

By the end of the 1960s, demand for high-performance full-size cars had largely disappeared.  In total, Mercury would sell about 15,000 examples for 1969, and barely a third of that for 1970; in comparison to the Marauder, Mercury would sell nearly 173,000 Cougars at the same time.  Within the Lincoln-Mercury Division, the far more expensive [[Lincoln Continental Mark III|Continental Mark III]] outsold the Marauder more than two-to-one from 1969 to 1970.

=== Mercury Marauder X-100  ===
To offer a higher-performance version of the Marauder, Mercury introduced the Marauder X-100.  While nearly all features of the X-100 were cosmetic, the Marauder X-100 offered a choice of twin comfort lounge seats, bench seat or bucket seats with a floor console housing a U-shaped [[automatic transmission]] shift handle.  The X-100 also featured Kelsey-Hayes road wheels along with rear [[fender skirts]].&lt;ref name="Odin" /&gt;

For 2003, Mercury revived the Marauder nameplate after a 33-year hiatus, becoming a performance-oriented version of the Grand Marquis four-door sedan.  Offering upgraded chassis, suspension, and powertrain components over its Grand Marquis counterpart, the Marauder was similar in concept to both its 1960s namesake (and the 1990s [[Chevrolet Impala#Seventh generation (1994–1996)|Chevrolet Impala SS]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Truett|first=Richard|date=5 November 2001|title=Mercury follows Impala formula for Marauder|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20011105/SEO/111050752/mercury-follows-impala-formula-for-marauder|journal=Automotive News|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  

For the first time since 1960, Mercury offered a full-size vehicle without a Ford counterpart.  The 2003 Marauder launched a near-complete replacement of the Mercury model line&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 29, 2003|title=Mercury Marauder sales fall short of goals|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20030129/REG/301290713/mercury-marauder-sales-fall-short-of-goals|journal=Automotive News|accessdate=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;; while the Grand Marquis and Mountaineer SUV remained in production, from 2004 to 2006, the division introduced the [[Mercury Monterey (minivan)|Monterey]] minivan (2004),  [[Mercury Mariner|Mariner]] SUV (2005), [[Mercury Montego|Montego]] sedan (2005) and [[Mercury Milan|Milan]] sedans (2006); the latter two replaced the Sable.      

After the end of the 2004 model year, the Marauder was discontinued with no direct Mercury or Ford replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Amy|date=March 22, 2004|title=Mercury kills Marauder|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20040322/SUB/403220787/mercury-kills-marauder|journal=Automotive News|accessdate=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially predicted for sales of 18,000 vehicles per year&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;, the revived Marauder sold slowly, with only 11,052 sold over its two-year production (compared to nearly 180,000 Grand Marquis sold in the same time).  In a key marketing success, the Marauder attracted younger buyers into Lincoln-Mercury showrooms; the average age of its buyer (51) was 18 years younger than that of the Grand Marquis (69).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;     

=== Development ===
At the 2002 [[Chicago Auto Show#2002|Chicago Auto Show]], Ford introduced the Mercury Marauder as a [[concept car]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=10953 |date=February 6, 2002 |title=Mercury Marauder returns to Chicago as a convertible concept |publisher=Ford Media |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121007235813/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=10953 |archivedate=October 7, 2012 |accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Serving as a preview of the production vehicle, the concept car was a two-door convertible with a five-passenger interior.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jalopnik.com/5837099/topless-mercury-marauder-concept-car-on-ebay/|title=Topless Mercury Marauder concept car on Ebay|last=Joslin|first=Tom|date=September 3, 2011|work=Jalopnik.com|accessdate=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting life as a 1999 Ford Crown Victoria LX, the concept car was powered by a supercharged 4.6L V8 (producing 335 hp).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

The first full-sized convertible produced by Ford since the 1972 Ford LTD convertible and the first full-sized two-door sedan (by Ford) since 1987, the Marauder convertible was strictly intended as a concept car, although development into a production vehicle was under consideration, related to consumer demand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Chassis ===
The 2003–2004 Marauder utilized the [[Ford Panther platform|Panther platform]].  Along with sharing heavier-duty brake and suspension components with the [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]], the Marauder adopted many of the chassis upgrades introduced as part of the 2003 update of the Panther platform; rack-and-pinion steering replaced the long-running recirculating ball design previously used by the Grand Marquis.  

In place of the supercharged V8 from the concept vehicle, the 2003 Marauder was fitted with a 302 hp 4.6L DOHC V8&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jalopnik.com/this-couple-is-selling-a-never-registered-2003-mercury-1797702796|title=This Couple Is Selling A Mint-Condition 2003 Mercury Marauder With 62 Miles|last=Tracy|first=David|date=14 August 2017|work=Jalopnik|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;; paired with a 4-speed [[Ford AOD transmission#4R70W|4R70W]] automatic ([[Ford AOD transmission#4R75E|4R75W]] for 2004), the engine was shared with the [[Ford Mustang Mach 1#Mach 1 reborn|Mustang Mach 1]] and [[Lincoln Aviator]].  The Marauder shared its limited-slip differential (and 3.55:1 rear-axle ratio) with the Crown Victoria Police Interceptor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jalopnik.com/why-the-mercury-marauder-is-a-future-classic-925162402|title=Why The Mercury Marauder Is A Future Classic|last=George|first=Patrick|date=26 July 2013|work=Jalopnik|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, along with its aluminum driveshaft.

=== Body ===
In line with mid-1990s Chevrolet Impala SS, the 2003 Marauder was given a monochromatic appearance, with a wide majority of cars sold in black.  In contrast to the Grand Marquis, the only chrome on the Marauder is its window trim, wheels, and Mercury emblems on the grille and trunklid.  

On the exterior, the Marauder shares most of its trim with the Grand Marquis; much of the rear and side trim is shared with the Crown Victoria LX Sport.  Both bumpers are unique to the Marauder; the rear features the model name embossed on the bumper and is modified further to accommodate the larger Megs chrome tailpipe tips.  The front bumper was redesigned with a central air intake added to improve engine ventilation; round [[Cibié]] [[fog lamp]]s were added below the headlights.  The headlight and corner light lenses (from the Grand Marquis) had their non-reflective surfaces blacked out and the grille was painted black with a body-color surround. The taillight and reverse light lenses (from the Crown Victoria LX Sport) were dark-tinted to the minimum of DOT standards. Unique to the Marauder, the 18-inch five-spoke wheels have center caps with a revival of a 1960s Mercury emblem (a silhouette of the Roman god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]).

The interior of the Marauder resembled the configuration of the 2002 concept convertible, adopting a five-seat layout with a center console-mounted transmission shifter (shared with the Crown Victoria LX Sport and Grand Marquis LSE).  Leather seating was standard, with (simulated) satin aluminum trim replacing wood trim.  Unique to the Marauder, the instrument panel was redesigned, with aluminum-finish gauges, a 140-mph speedometer; unique among Panther platform vehicles (at the time), the Marauder was fitted with a tachometer, requiring the relocation of the voltmeter and oil pressure gauges (forward of the shifter).  &lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

The '''Mercury M series''' is a series of [[pickup truck|pickup trucks]] that was marketed by the [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] division of [[Ford Motor Company]]. Produced from 1946 to 1968, the Mercury M series was sold primarily in Canada, as a [[Rebadging|rebadged]] version of the [[Ford F series]].    

== Background ==
In 1946, [[Ford Motor Company of Canada|Ford of Canada]] split its Ford and Lincoln/Mercury divisions into separate sales networks. Alongside the creation of the Monarch and Meteor sub-brands, Ford of Canada introduced trucks to the Mercury division. At the time, few rural communities offered both the Ford and Lincoln-Mercury dealership networks, miniminizing model overlap and allowing for greater coverage for potential truck buyers. To differentiate Ford and Mercury trucks, Mercury added a brand-specific grille and slightly different exterior and interior trim.           

== Nomenclature ==
In 1948, following the introduction of the Ford F series, Mercury adopted the use of the "M" prefix, for Mercury. From 1948 to 1950, nominal tonnage ratings were replaced by a series designation in which the numbers indicate the GVWR when equipped with tires of appropriate capacity. Each code number is arrived at by dividing the GVWR of the series by 100. Thus an F-47 (M-47) indicates a GVWR of 4700&amp;nbsp;lbs., F-135 (M-135) indicates 13500&amp;nbsp;lbs., etc.

In 1951–52, Ford of Canada got back in step with Ford USA with F-1 (M-1), F-2 (M-2) etc.

== Pickup trucks ==
[[File:'49 Mercury M-Series (Auto classique Salaberry-De-Valleyfield '11).JPG|thumb|left|1949 Mercury M series]]
[[File:1966 Mercury M-150 Pickup.jpg|thumb|1966 Mercury M-100|left]]

From 1948 to 1968, the Mercury M series followed the development of its Ford F-series counterparts, differing largely in exterior trim.  

For 1961 to 1966, Mercury trucks had a gear/lightning bolt symbol on their horn button and no other interior Mercury nameplates. 

For 1967 and 1968, trucks used Ford interior trim only, such as the horn button, dash cluster bezel and radio block-off plate.{{-}}

==Other Mercury trucks==

[[File:1964 Mercury Econoline pickup truck.jpg|alt=|thumb|1964 Mercury Econoline EM-100 pickup]]
Alongside the M-Series pickup trucks, Mercury dealerships in Canada rebadged other versions of the Ford truck range.    

Along with an M-series counterpart of medium-duty F-series trucks (F-500 and above), Mercury sold its own versions of the [[Ford B-Series|Ford B-series]] bus chassis and [[Ford C-series]] tilt-cab truck.  In a similar fashion, the [[Ford E-Series|Ford Econoline]] van and pickup truck was sold as a Mercury from 1961 to 1967.    

While not specifically sold as a Mercury, the 1957–1959 [[Ford Ranchero]] was rebadged and sold by the Meteor division in Canada (through the Lincoln-Mercury dealership network)  

== Discontinuation ==
[[File:68 MERCURY M100 RARE.jpg|thumb|left|1968 Mercury M100, final year of production]]
When the [[Canada–United States Automotive Products Agreement|Auto-Pact]] was signed in 1965, opening the border to tariff-free movement of vehicles produced on both sides of the border, Mercury truck production was split between the Oakville, Ontario, plant and the San Jose, California, plant. This enabled Oakville to ramp up production to supply the eastern US and Canada with Ford trucks. No Mercury trucks were sold in the US.
 
Ford wound down production of the Mercury trucks in the late spring of 1968; documented Mercury trucks have been found built as late as May 15, 1968. Employees of Ford in this time period have reported leftover Mercury M series being converted to Ford trucks. However, no paperwork or confirmation has yet surfaced regarding the final disposition of these, nor of an official end date to production.

Following the discontinuation of the Mercury M-series pickup, the M-series tilt-cab version of the C series survived until 1972.  After its discontinuation, the next Mercury light truck would be the 1993 [[Mercury Villager]] minivan.
