}}{{This article is about|the 1962-1988 Gladiator|the 2020 Gladiator model based on the [[Jeep Wrangler (JL)|fourth-generation Jeep Wrangler]]|Jeep Gladiator (JT)}}
The '''[[Jeep]] Gladiator''', '''Jeep Pickup''' or '''J-series''' is a series of full-size [[pickup truck]]s based on the large [[Jeep SJ]] ([[Jeep Wagoneer (SJ)|Wagoneer]]) platform, which was built and sold under numerous marques from 1962 to 1988. The Jeep Gladiator / Pickup design is noteworthy for remaining in production for more than 26 years on a single [[automobile platform]] generation. The Gladiator was the basis of the first post-war U.S. Army trucks designed to be civilian vehicles and adapted to military use. Numerous versions of the Jeep pickup were built in other markets, including Mexico by [[Vehículos Automotores Mexicanos]].

The Gladiator nameplate was revived on a midsize pickup truck based on the fourth-generation [[Jeep Wrangler (JL)]]. It was unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show on November 28, 2018.

==Gladiator 1962-1971==
[[File:1964 Jeep Pick-Up (14296525169).jpg|thumb|left|1964 short wheelbase Jeep Gladiator Townside]]
[[File:Jeep Gladiator J300 (2406095893).jpg|thumb|left|Long-wheelbase J300 with a hardtop on the bed]]
Introduced in 1962 for the 1963 [[model year]], the Gladiator was a conventional body on frame pickup design that shared its basic frame architecture and front end with the Jeep Wagoneer four-wheel-drive station wagon.&lt;ref name="allpargladiator"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/trucks/jeep/gladiator.html |title=1963-1987 Jeep Gladiator and J-Series Pickups |publisher=allpar.com/trucks |accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gladiators were available in [[Rear-wheel drive|RWD]] and [[Four-wheel drive|4WD]], with optional dual rear wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.txfsja.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=11 |title=Jeep Dually Tech &amp; Specs |author=Elliot |date=22 April 2009 |publisher=Jeep Dually Registry |accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A remarkable innovation was the available [[independent suspension|independent front suspension]] instead of a solid front axle on the 4WD half-ton Gladiator trucks. It was a simple IFS design with a Dana 44 center section, that proved troublesome, didn’t sell well, and the option was deleted in 1965.&lt;ref name=BackGlance&gt;[http://www.fourwheeler.com/features/1502-1963-jeep-wagoneer-custom-backward-glances/ 1963 Jeep Wagoneer Custom – Backward Glances]&lt;/ref&gt; Most likely very few were produced with this option.&lt;ref name="allpargladiator"/&gt;

Gladiator trucks were available as: Cab and Chassis; Wrecker; Stake Bed; and [[chassis]]-mounted campers with extended wheelbases. The load bed options were Townside, Thriftside (a "step-side"), and Stake Bed, with up to {{convert|8600|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} G.V.W. and almost two-ton payload capacity.&lt;ref name="allpargladiator"/&gt;

A new [[overhead camshaft|overhead cam]] [[Jeep Tornado engine]] {{convert|230|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[straight-six]] producing {{convert|140|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} was standard. It was the first production overhead cam engine in an American light truck or SUV and one of the first OHC engines offered by an American manufacturer.&lt;ref name=BackGlance/&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Further innovations for four-wheel-drive pickups included optional automatic transmission (an industry first), as well as power brakes, power steering, and just like early post-war Jeeps a [[power take-off]] for numerous accessories that included snow plows and push plates.&lt;ref name="allpargladiator"/&gt;

In early 1963, [[Willys|Willys Motors]] changed its name to [[Kaiser Jeep|Kaiser Jeep Corporation]].

During 1965 the {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine]] became available. It produced {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|340|lb.ft|N·m|0}} of torque at 2600&amp;nbsp;rpm. The standard Tornado engine was replaced by American Motors' {{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} OHV [[Straight-6|inline six]].

In 1967 all (RWD) two-wheel drive versions, except for the J-100 panel delivery, were dropped due to poor sales.&lt;ref name="allpargladiator"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeeptech.com/models/jpu.htm Full Size Jeeps - J-Series Pickups — JeepTech]&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1968, the flared-fender Thriftside models were dropped while a new camper option was added for the J-3600.&lt;ref name="allpargladiator"/&gt; From 1968 to 1971 Jeep pickups offered the [[Buick]] {{convert|350|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}  {{convert|230|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#350|Dauntless]] V8 as an optional engine.

[[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]] (AMC) purchased the Kaiser Jeep operations in 1970 when Kaiser Industries decided to leave the automobile business. The Jeep trucks moved to all AMC engines to improve performance and standardize production and servicing. The Buick engine was replaced by the {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} or {{convert|401|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|AMC V8]]s.

In 1970, the Gladiator's front grille was changed to the same design as the Jeep Wagoneer SUV. This was the truck's first styling change since its introduction. An AMC badge was also added on the grille.

==Jeep pickup 1971-1988==
[[File:Jeep J-10 pick-up blue f md.jpg|thumb|Jeep J10 pickup]]
[[File:Wellington Free Ambulance Jeep - Flickr - 111 Emergency (1).jpg|thumb|J20-based Ambulance built like a chassis-camper (New Zealand)]]

The Gladiator name was dropped after 1971, after which the line was known simply as the Jeep pickup, or J-series. The pickups were designated as J2000 and J4000 models (the 3000 series was dropped in 1971) until 1973, then as J10 and J20 models from 1974 to 1988.

Engines:

From 1971 to 1972 Jeep pickups offered the AMC {{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|210|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} V8 as an optional engine.

The AMC {{convert|258|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} I6 engine was introduced in 1972 and offered through 1988. The engine produced {{convert|112|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|210|lb.ft|N·m|0|abbr=on}} of torque.

The [[AMC V8 engine#360|AMC 360]] cu in (5.9L) was offered in 1971 and through 1988. Producing in early versions {{convert|175|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|245|lb.ft|N·m|0|abbr=on}} of torque. Later 360s produced {{convert|195|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|295|lb.ft|N·m|0|abbr=on}} of torque.

The model designations were simplified for 1974, with the J-2000 and the J-4000, which designate wheelbase, being swapped out for the J-10 and J-20, designating payload capacity. Larger brakes were made standard and the turning radius reduced. The Quadra-Trac system was now available with all engines.&lt;ref name="allpargladiator"/&gt;

The AMC {{convert|401|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} was offered from 1974 through 1978. These engines are known for their toughness and excellent power output. The 401 produced {{convert|225|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|320|lb.ft|N·m|0|abbr=on}} of torque.

For 1977, Jeep J-10 pickups included [[Dana Holding Corporation|Dana]]'s manual four-wheel-drive system, a more powerful {{convert|258|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} six-cylinder engine, and heavier axle tubes, while power front disc brakes became standard equipment and the considerably greater GWV capacity J-20s included AMC's {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5OEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=Jeep+J-20 |page=73 |title=Over-the-counter pickups |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=December 1976 |volume=73 |issue=6 |accessdate=16 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|401|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine was optional, as well as full-time [[Quadra-Trac]] and both automatic and manual transmissions.

1983 saw the new full-time four-wheel drive system, Selec-Trac, replace Quadra-Trac.

From 1981 to 1985 a rebodied version of the J-10 was built and sold as the [[Jeep CJ#CJ-10|Jeep CJ-10]], featuring a CJ-like nose and cab, as well as a very boxy redesigned rear truck-bed, somewhat resembling that of a Land-Rover.

[[Chrysler]] bought out AMC in 1987. The full-size Jeep Pickup line was not only an aging model, but also competed directly with the broader range of [[Dodge]] trucks. Chrysler discontinued the full-size Jeep trucks, but continued to build the luxurious and highly profitable [[Jeep Wagoneer (SJ)|Grand Wagoneer]], which shared the chassis with the large pickups.

After the Chrysler buyout, the compact [[Jeep Comanche]] pickup (based on the [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)]] platform) received only minor changes and its production continued until 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/06/business/company-news-chrysler-to-end-production-of-jeep-comanche.html |title=Chrysler to end production of Jeep Comanche |date=6 June 1992 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military versions==
[[File:Jeep M725, military ambulance.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. military M725 ambulance]]
{{main|Kaiser Jeep M715}}

Military versions of the civilian Jeep pickup included the [[Kaiser Jeep M715|M715]] and M725, built from 1967 to 1969. They were built under contract for nations in addition to the United States. The idea was to reduce costs by starting from a civilian truck and sharing parts with normal production-line truck, like the later “[[Commercial Utility Cargo Vehicle]]” (CUCV) for the military as a 5/4 ton tactical vehicle.&lt;ref name="allpargladiator"/&gt;

[[File:Klargöringsbil 9711 med amsläpkärra.jpg|thumb|right|''Klargöringsbil 9711'' of The Swedish Air Force]]

The [[Swedish Air Force]] acquired 450 Gladiator vehicles in the early 1980s. They were given the local designations ''Klargöringsbil 9711'' and ''Klargöringsbil 9712'', with the latter variant being equipped with a hardtop. The vehicles were modified to be used by aircraft groundcrew for mobile flight line operations in the Swedish [[Bas 90]] system, and could carry trailers with equipment and tow aircraft. It is often informally referred to as "The Dallas Jeep".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=105&amp;artikel=6588160|title=Ny version av övning från kalla kriget|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.femorefortet.se/Kalla-FV.htm|title=Femörefortet - Kalla krigets svenska försvar|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trim packages==
[[File:Honchotruck.JPG|thumb|right|Jeep J10 Honcho]]
From 1975, Jeep tried making their pickups more "car-like" and appealing to consumers, starting with the Pioneer package, featuring a fancier interior, woodgrain interior and exterior trim, chromed front bumpers, window moldings, and wheel covers, dual horns, and other “car” features.&lt;ref name="allpargladiator"/&gt;

From 1976-1983 the "Honcho" [[trim package]] was offered on the J10 pickup. It consisted of bold striping and decals, and was offered with factory extras such as the [[Levi's]] interior or a [[roll cage|roll bar]]. The content of the Honcho package varied from year to year, but "always included the wide-track look of the Cherokee Chief."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zTsAbTJB5RIC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=Jeep+Honcho+package+varied+always+included+wide-track+Cherokee+Chief |page=171 |last=Allen |first=Jim |title=Jeep |year=2004 |publisher=MBI Publishing |isbn=978-0-7603-1979-6 |accessdate=16 January 2014|authorlink=Jim Allen (4x4 writer)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Honcho was one in a series of special decal packages offered for J-Series trucks in the mid to late 1970s, which included the 1977–1979 Golden Eagle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.angelfire.com/nb2/jeeppickups/Golden%20Eagle%2011.jpg |title=The new Jeep J-10 Golden Eagle (image) |publisher=The Jeep Pickups Page |accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1978 "10-4" version which offered an optional [[Citizens' Band radio]] along with the decals. The Honcho package was only available on the sportside (stepside) and short bed trucks. Between 1980 and 1983, only 1,264 of the sportside versions were produced.

Decal packages were available for many of Jeep's vehicles in the 1970s, including a package  for the [[Jeep Cherokee (SJ)|Jeep Cherokee]] called the Cherokee Chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.adclassix.com/images80cherokee.jpg |title=Jeep Cherokee Chief (advertisement) |publisher=adclassix.com |accessdate=16 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Golden Eagle package was also available for both the CJ and the Cherokee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.phoenixgraphix.com/amc/7780ge.jpg |title=Jeep CJ Golden Eagle (picture) |publisher=phoenixgraphix.com |accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1980 (1981 model year) Laredo package was perhaps the most luxurious one, including leather bucket seats, and leather-wrapped steering wheel, chrome interior trim, and a state-of-the-art Alpine sound system. &lt;ref name="allpargladiator"/&gt;

== Jeep truck concepts ==
Jeep has shown numerous [[Concept car|concept]] pickup trucks, and officials at the automaker have "expressed interest in putting such a vehicle into production."&lt;ref name="mt-peterson"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wot.motortrend.com/jeeps-future-does-it-include-a-small-pickup-truck-9022.html |title=Jeep’s Future: Does It Include a Small Pickup Truck? |first=Andrew |last=Peterson |date=21 June  2010 |publisher=Motor Trend |accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003 small pickup truck===
A production-ready version of a Jeep Scrambler pickup was shown in 2003 at the North American Dealers Association, but was pulled after a few hours. According to ''Motor Trend'', there might be a "production Jeep pickup truck in the works".&lt;ref name="mt-peterson"/&gt;

===2005 Jeep Gladiator===
[[File:Picturegladiator 203.jpg|thumb|right|Jeep Gladiator at the 2005 [[Chicago Auto Show]]]]

In late-2004 a new '''Jeep Gladiator''' [[Concept car|concept]] was introduced. While not officially intended to be sold, it was used as a demonstration "that a Jeep pickup was in the dark recesses of DaimlerChrysler's brain trust.&lt;ref name="2005concept"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YXow9otLiI8C&amp;pg=PA147&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=2005+Gladiator+vehicle+demonstrated+that+a+Jeep+pickup+was+in+the+dark+recesses+of+DaimlerChrysler's+brain+trust |title=The Joy of Jeep |page=147 |first=Tom |last=Morr |first2=Ken |last2=Brubaker |publisher=MBI Publishing |isbn=978-0-7603-3061-6 |year=2007 |accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gladiator concept features an open-air [[canvas]] roof, fold-down [[windshield]], removable doors, and has an expandable truck bed. The Gladiator has a 2.8-liter, [[Straight-4|4-cylinder]] common-rail turbo [[diesel engine]] that provides {{convert|165|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|295|lb.ft|N·m|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The truck has a 6-speed [[manual transmission]]. Ground clearance is {{convert|13.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, with a [[break-over angle]] of 23.2°, an [[approach angle]] of 47.6° and departure angle of 38.0°. Front and rear tires are {{convert|34|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} and are mounted on 18x8-inch wheels. The Jeep Gladiator has a {{convert|1500|lb|kg|0|adj=on}} [[Cargo|payload]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://trucks.about.com/od/conceptcars/ss/jeep_gladiator.htm |title=Jeep Gladiator Concept |publisher=trucks about com |accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "midgate" made the concept Gladiator truck closer to an imitation of the [[Chevrolet Avalanche]], "than an attempt to revive its namesake's glory."&lt;ref name="2005concept"/&gt;

The 2005 Gladiator Concept was also a preview of the all-new 2007 [[Jeep Wrangler (JK)]] and [[Jeep Wrangler (JK)]] Unlimited, and featured nearly identical exterior and interior styling to the production model of the 2007-2017 [[Jeep Wrangler (JK)]].

===2012 Jeep J12===
In March, Jeep announced a revealing of a new concept at the Easter Jeep Safari in Moab, Utah. The J-12 is based on a modified Wrangler Unlimited chassis with a {{convert|18|in|mm|0|adj=on}} frame extension allowing the use of a {{convert|6|ft|mm|0|adj=on}} load bed.&lt;ref name="caranddriver"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/jeep-shows-off-six-concepts-headed-for-2012-moab-easter-jeep-safari/ |title=Jeep Mighty FC and J-12 Pickups Among Six Concepts Revealed for 2012 Moab Easter Safari |date=27 March 2012 |first=Alexander |last=Stoklosa |publisher=Car and Driver |accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The styling resembles the classic 1960s-era Jeep Gladiator truck and features "old-school" 16-inch smooth steel wheels with 36-inch tires, as well as a full bench seat in the cab.&lt;ref name="caranddriver"/&gt;

=== 2016 Jeep Crew Chief 715 ===
At the 2016 Jeep Safari in Moab, Utah, Jeep revealed seven new concepts including a '''Crew Chief 715''' pickup with four-doors and a 5-foot cargo bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Priddle |first=Alisa |title=2016 Easter Jeep Safari Concepts |url= http://www.motortrend.com/news/2016-easter-jeep-safari-concepts/ |publisher=Motor Trend |date=10 March 2016 |accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design was inspired by the [[Kaiser Jeep M715]] military vehicle from the late 1960s that was based on the regular civilian production Jeep Gladiator pickup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sutton |first=Mike |title=Jeep Crew Chief 715 Concept Dissected |url= https://www.caranddriver.com/features/jeep-crew-chief-715-concept-dissected-feature |date=May 2016 |publisher=Car and Driver |accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jeep Crew Chief concept rides on 20-inch [[beadlock]] wheels, and 40-inch military tires, but is mostly based on a Wrangler Unlimited stretched to a {{convert|139|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brubaker |first=Ken |title=Jeep Crew Chief 715 Exposed At Moab EJS 2016 - Day 3: Exclusive Photos, Video, Opinions |url= http://www.fourwheeler.com/moab-experience/2016/1603-jeep-crew-chief-715-exposed-at-moab-ejs-2016-day-3-exclusive-photos-video-opinions/ |publisher=Four Wheeler |date=22 March 2016 |accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jeep Comanche''' (designated '''MJ''') is a [[pickup truck]] variant of the [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Cherokee]] [[compact SUV]] (1984–2001)&lt;ref name="pm10-85"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-QDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Jeep+Comanche+introduction |first=Daniel Charles |last=Ross |title=Detroit Listening Post |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=October 1985 |volume=161 |issue=10 |page=42 |accessdate=August 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; manufactured and marketed by [[Jeep]] for model years 1986-1992 in [[Rear wheel drive|rear wheel]] (RWD) and [[four-wheel drive]] (4WD) models as well as two cargo bed lengths: six-foot (1.83 metres) and seven-foot (2.13 metres).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/trucks/jeep/comanche.html |title=The Jeep Comanche (1986-1992) |work=Allpar |accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
During the mid-1980s, according to AMC chairman W. Paul Tippett Jr. "People are finding trucks a reasonable and sophisticated alternative to cars."&lt;ref name="haul"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,923832-1,00.html |journal=Time |date=December 17, 1984 |title=Pickups Make a Haul |first=Alexander L. |last=Taylor III |first2=Paul A. |last2=Witteman |first3=Meg |last3=Grant |accessdate=August 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To satisfy the demand and to compete with Japanese competitors, both AMC and Chrysler were preparing compact pickups for the 1986 and 1987 model years (respectively).&lt;ref name="haul"/&gt; Also at this time the financial health of AMC was poor and the automaker was in need of cash as it was preparing a new line of midsize sedans (the [[Eagle Premier]]) scheduled to be produced at a factory being built in Canada ([[Brampton Assembly]]), but the best thing the company had going for it was its popular line of Jeeps and introducing a compact Jeep pickup truck in the fall of 1985 was expected to help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957751,00.html |journal=Time |date=June 3, 1985 |title=Autos: Expensive, Old and Inefficient |accessdate=August 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jeep Comanche was introduced in mid-August 1985, at a lavish event staged at the ballroom of the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino (currently [[Bally's Las Vegas]]) for AMC's over 1,500 North American dealers.&lt;ref name="beijing"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://archive.org/details/beijingjeepcases00mann | url-access=registration |title=Beijing Jeep: a case study of Western business in China |first=Jim |last=Mann |pages=[https://archive.org/details/beijingjeepcases00mann/page/n14 13]–15 |publisher=Westview Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-8133-3327-4 |accessdate=August 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American Motors included Chinese officials as part of the negotiations establishing Beijing Jeep (now [[Beijing Benz]]). The goal was to produce and sell Comanches in China through this [[joint venture]].&lt;ref name="beijing"/&gt;

The new trucks were unveiled by [[Jose Dedeurwaerder]], an engineer and international business executive with 23 years of experience with [[Renault]], who had just been appointed as AMC's new president.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/27/business/business-people-chairman-of-amc-to-join-textile-concern.html&lt;/ref&gt; The base price of the two-wheel drive model was $7,049 (adjusted only for inflation equal to US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|7049|1985}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), making it the lowest priced Jeep model for the 1986 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D05p17q4cSYC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=Jeep+Comanche+introduction |title=The Story of Jeep |first=Patrick R. |last=Foster |page=198 |publisher=KP Books |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-87349-735-0|accessdate=August 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
American Motors' Jeep designers based the Comanche MJ body, styling, engineering, and drivetrain on the [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|XJ Cherokee]], which had been introduced for the 1984 model year.&lt;ref name="pm10-85"/&gt; The Comanche had a somewhat more conventional body-on-frame design behind the cab and a removable cargo box, but retained the unibody construction of the Cherokee in the front half of the vehicle.  In the United States where the Comanche and [[Dodge Rampage]] were sold they are both considered pickup trucks.  By contrast, in other markets the Volkswagen Rabbit Pickup was called the [[Volkswagen Caddy]] and considered a [[Coupé utility|coupe utility]], not a truck because the cargo bed is an integral part of the body structure and not removable. However this is not the legal definition of truck in the United States where the Comanche, Rampage and Rabbit were all sold.

Two cargo bed lengths were used; one for the seven-foot long-bed model, which appeared first in 1986, and a second, shorter version for the six-foot cargo bed, which debuted for the 1987 model year.  Unlike other pickups of the time that used C-channel frames, the Comanche's frame design (called a "Uniframe" by Jeep) under the cargo bed was fully boxed, with a large X structure centered over the rear axle.  For strength, the rails were over eight inches deep (top to bottom), much deeper than conventional midsize truck frames (1983 Jeep J-10 full-size truck frame is 6.75 inches at the deepest point). This structure was pioneered by AMC for the 1971 "[[AMC Hornet#Cowboy|Cowboy]]" compact pickup prototype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://vintagetruckmagazine.com/1971-amc-jeep-cowboy/ |title=1971 AMC Jeep Cowboy—What Might Have Been |date=October 5, 2015 |first=Rich |last=Truesdell |work=Vintage Truck Magazine  |accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1986 to 1987, the Jeep Comanche [[grille]] had ten slots in a similar configuration to the 1984-1987 Cherokee XJ, while from 1988 to 1992, this configuration changed to eight slots to match with the SUV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bureau of National Affairs |title=The United States patents quarterly |chapter=AM General Corp v. DaimlerChrysler |page=1015 |publisher=Associated Industry Publications |year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new "4x4" badge, similar to those found on the Cherokee and Wagoneer models, was affixed to the upper rear of the cargo box on all the four-wheel drive models.&lt;ref name="standardcatalog"/&gt;

After the Chrysler buyout of American Motors for $1.5 billion on March 9, 1987, designed to capture "the highly profitable Jeep vehicles ... and 1,400 additional dealers",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holusha|first=John|title=Chrysler is Buying American Motors; Cost is $1.5&amp;nbsp;billion|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/10/business/chrysler-is-buying-american-motors-cost-is-1.5-billion.html |newspaper=The New York Times
|date=March 10, 1987 |accessdate=August 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Jeep Comanche, like the similar Cherokee, received only minor changes. These were primarily to improve reliability and parts interchangeability with other Chrysler-built vehicles.

==Suspension==
[[File:Jeep Comanche Pioneer white MD r.jpg|thumb|right|Jeep Comanche Pioneer]]
[[File:Jeep Comanche Chief.jpg|thumb|Jeep Comanche Chief with aftermarket modifications]]

The Comanche used the XJ Cherokee's "Quadralink" front suspension, with coil springs and upper/lower control arms on a solid axle. It was argued that the coil springs allowed for greater ride comfort and axle articulation during off-road excursions. A track bar ([[Panhard rod]]) is used to keep the axle centered under the truck. Modified versions of this same basic suspension system were later used on the 1993-2004 [[Jeep Grand Cherokee|Grand Cherokee]], 1997 and newer [[Jeep Wrangler#TJ (1997–2006)|TJ Wrangler]]s and 1994 and newer [[Dodge Ram]]s.

For the rear suspension, the truck used leaf springs that are considerably longer than the Cherokee's, which give Comanches good load-carrying capacity without creating a hard ride. The standard rear axle was the same [[Dana 35]] used in the Cherokee, except that the Comanche mounted the leaf springs underneath the axle, as do most other trucks, and the Cherokee mounted them on top of the axle. There was also a heavy duty Metric Ton package for the long-bed models. The package included heavier-duty leaf springs and wheels, larger tires, and upgraded the rear axle to a [[Dana 44]], which increased the stock payload ([[cargo]]) capacity from {{convert|1400|to|2205|lb|kg}}, well above that of any other mid-size truck. The Metric Ton Comanche's payload rating was higher than that of many full-size pickups.

==Drivetrain==
The inaugural 1986 model year Comanches could be equipped with one of three engines: AMC's [[AMC straight-4 engine|2.5&amp;nbsp;L four-cylinder]] as standard, with [[General Motors]]' [[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#LR2|2.8&amp;nbsp;L V6]] or [[Renault]]'s 2.1&amp;nbsp;L I4 [[turbo]] [[Diesel engine|diesel]] available as options.&lt;ref name="pm10-85"/&gt; In base trim the four-cylinder engine was backed by a four-speed manual transmission, with either a five-speed manual or three-speed [[TorqueFlite]] A904 automatic built by [[Chrysler]] as an option. The [[V6 engine]] was available with either the five-speed manual or the automatic, while the turbodiesel was only available with the five-speed.

The V6 was the same engine used in the competing [[Chevrolet S-10]], and equipped with a two-barrel [[Rochester Products Division|Rochester]] [[carburetor]] instead of the four-cylinder's electronic throttle-body [[fuel injection]] system the optional six-cylinder was slightly less powerful than the standard four. The V6 thus offered little performance advantage over the base engine while penalizing the owner with poorer fuel economy. In the truck's second year on the market the V6 was replaced by [[AMC Straight 6 engine#4.0|AMC's new fuel-injected 4.0&amp;nbsp;L straight-six]] that developed {{convert|173|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|220|lb.ft|N.m|0|abbr=on}}: 50% more power and 47% more torque than the previous V6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=New Fuel-Injected Engine Adds Power to Jeep Models |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |date=October 21, 1986 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jWoeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3WkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=jeep%20comanche&amp;pg=2538%2C1254657 |page=5F |accessdate=August 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new six-cylinder was also more fuel-efficient. The performance of the base 2.5&amp;nbsp;L engine was also improved with a new air intake, raising peak output to 121 hp and 141 lb⋅ft. The slow-selling turbodiesel option was dropped during the model year.

Concurrent with introduction of the new straight-six a new four-speed automatic built by [[Aisin Seiki|Aisin-Warner]] replaced the former Chrysler three-speed. The [[Toyota A transmission#A340E (30-40LE)|30-40LE]] featured electronic controls with a switch on the dashboard allowing the driver to choose between two performance modes: "Power", in which the transmission downshifts more quickly and upshifts at higher rpm during hard acceleration, and "Comfort", in which the upshifts are made at lower engine speeds to conserve fuel and reduce engine noise and vibration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Dunne |first=Jim |date=October 1986 |title=Power to the people |page=72 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=z-MDAAAAMBAJ |magazine=Popular Mechanics |volume=163 |issue=10 |location=New York City |publisher=The Hearst Corporation |access-date=January 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 output of the 4.0&amp;nbsp;L engine was improved slightly to 177 hp and 224 lb⋅ft. 

Chrysler purchased AMC in 1987, and by the 1991 model year adapted their own engine control electronics to replace the original [[Renix]] systems used with the 2.5&amp;nbsp;L and 4.0&amp;nbsp;L engines. Power and torque in both engines improved as a result, with the four-cylinder having an additional 9 hp and 8 lb⋅ft and the six-cylinder improving by 1 lb⋅ft and 13 hp. The 4.0&amp;nbsp;L was badged "High Output" thereafter. As a result of the power improvements the Aisin-Warner automatic transmission's output shaft was changed from 21 splines to 23, and the "Power-Comfort" switch was deleted. The four-cylinder was no longer available with the automatic in 1991 and 1992.

During the production life of the Comanche six different transmissions were offered, manufactured by [[Aisin]], [[Chrysler]], and [[Peugeot]]. Chrysler provided the aforementioned TorqueFlite 904 three-speed automatic in 1986 models. In addition to the aforementioned 30-40LE four-speed automatic Aisin also provided the AX-4 (four-speed), AX-5 and AX-15 (five-speed overdrive) manual transmissions. The AX-15 was phased in midway through the 1989 model year to replace the Peugeot BA10/5 five-speed that had been used behind the 4.0&amp;nbsp;L engine from its introduction in 1987.

Comanches were available in either two or four-wheel-drive, with solid axles front and rear (two-wheel-drive Comanches used a simple beam axle with otherwise the same front suspension as four-wheel-drive models). [[Transfer case]]s were built by [[New Venture Gear|New Process Gear]], and the Comanche was available with either part-time "Command-Trac" or full-time "Selec-Trac" systems. In 1986 Command-Trac transfer cases were model NP207 and Selec-Trac were NP228, both with a 2.61:1 low gear ratios. In 1987 the NP207 was replaced with the NP231 and NP228 was replaced with the NP242, both with 2.72:1 low gears. These remained the same through the rest of the Comanche's production.

==Phaseout and aborted name revival==
The decision to phase out the Jeep Comanche "came from a combination of two factors— low sales and Chrysler's attempts to make the Jeep brand fit into the Chrysler hierarchy of [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]], [[Dodge]], and [[Chrysler (brand)|Chrysler]] models" with Jeep housing SUVs and Dodge making trucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Jeep Color History |first=Steve |last=Statham |page=[https://archive.org/details/jeepcolorhistory00stev/page/71 71] |url=https://archive.org/details/jeepcolorhistory00stev |url-access=registration |publisher=MBI Publishing |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7603-0636-9 |accessdate=August 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As sales dropped, the Comanche was planned for discontinuation. In 1990, the National Council of Jeep-Eagle [[Car dealership|dealers]] asked Chrysler to discontinue the Comanche, and allow them to sell a version of the [[Dodge Dakota]] pickup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Baker's job is to keep Jeep 'King of the Hill' |newspaper=Toledo Blade |date= July 2, 1990 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7UlPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KgMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=&amp;pg=6334%2C698952 |first=Tahree |last=Lane |page=20 |accessdate=August 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company decided to cease production of the Comanche on June 12, 1992, after only a few thousand more trucks rolled off the [[Toledo, Ohio]], assembly line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chrysler to end production of Jeep Comanche |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 6, 1992 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0DC1F30F935A35755C0A964958260 |accessdate=August 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 190,446 Comanches were made during its production run.&lt;ref name=hemmings&gt;{{cite web|last=Kurt|first=Ernst|title=Lost Cars of the 1980s – Jeep Comanche Pickup|url=http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2013/12/23/lost-cars-of-the-1980s-jeep-comanche-pickup/?refer=news|work=Hemmings Daily|publisher=[[Hemmings Motor News]]|accessdate=December 25, 2013|date=December 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the discontinuation of the Comanche, the [[Dodge Ramcharger]] would be dropped outside of [[Mexico]] shortly afterwards as part of Chrysler's plans to have Dodge sell pickup trucks and Jeep sell SUVs. Despite that, Dodge would later re-enter the SUV field with the [[Dodge Durango]] in 1998 at the height of the initial SUV boom and at one point would offer three SUVs or crossovers (Durango, [[Dodge Journey|Journey]] and [[Dodge Nitro|Nitro]], the latter being a [[Rebadging|rebadged]] version of the [[Jeep Liberty (KK)]]) while Jeep didn't offer any pickup trucks. Dodge itself would stop offering pickup trucks in 2011 when the [[Ram Trucks]] brand was spun-off from Dodge, taking the [[Ram Pickup|Dodge Ram]] and Dakota with it.

Jeep re-entered the pickup truck market in early 2019 with the [[Jeep Wrangler (JL)|Wrangler]]-based [[Jeep Gladiator (JT)|Jeep Gladiator]]. Jeep actually considered reviving the Comanche name alongside [[Jeep Gladiator (SJ)|Gladiator]] and most commonly [[Jeep CJ#CJ-8 (Scrambler)File:Jeep Gladiator Concept.JPG|Scrambler]], as well as simply using a new name, before deciding on Gladiator, feeling it fits that truck the best; [[Native American name controversy|sensitivity]] to the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (specifically the [[Comanche]] tribe) and much less brand recognition compared to Jeep's decades-long use of "[[Cherokee]]" for the Jeep Cherokee and [[Jeep Grand Cherokee|Grand Cherokee]] also likely played factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NS_s-Zyeks|title=A Closer Look - 2018 LA Auto Show - 2020 Jeep® Gladiator|first=|last=Jeep|publisher=|accessdate=December 9, 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Gladiator will serve as a 27-year later replacement for the Comanche.

The '''Jeep Compass''' is a four-door [[compact SUV|compact]]&lt;ref&gt;http://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=17952&amp;mid=786&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/jeep/compass&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/2017-jeep-compass-first-drive-review/ | title=The 2017 Jeep Compass is compact, yet totally competent for outdoor exploration| date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[crossover SUV]] introduced for the 2007 [[model year]], and is now in its second generation. The first generation Compass and [[Jeep Patriot|Patriot]], its rebadged variant, were among [[Jeep]]'s first crossover SUVs. The second-generation Compass debuted in September 2016 in [[Brazil]] and at the [[Los Angeles International Auto Show#2016|Los Angeles International Auto Show]] in November 2016, sharing a modified platform with the [[Jeep Renegade (BU)|Renegade]].

==Concept==
Four years prior to the introduction of the production Jeep Compass, a [[concept car|concept vehicle]] with the same name had its world premiere in [[Detroit]] at the [[North American International Auto Show#2002|2002 North American International Auto Show]]. It featured a two-door body, [[all-wheel drive]] and a 3.7-liter [[V6 engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/1183/Jeep-Compass.html |title=Jeep Compass concept vehicle |publisher=www.ultimatecarpage.com |accessdate=25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3.7&amp;nbsp;L Power-Tech [[V6 engine]] from the [[Jeep Liberty]] did not make it into the all-new Compass for 2007, though the production model Compass kept the concept car's styling cues and some of its features. The production model Compass also had four doors instead of the two doors on the concept car.

[[File:2008 Jeep Compass (MK MY08) Limited 2.4 wagon (2015-11-11) 02.jpg|thumbnail|left|Jeep Compass Limited (Australia; pre-facelift)]]
Jeep debuted the production version of the Compass at the [[North American International Auto Show#2006|2006 North American International Auto Show]] in January. The first Compass was assembled on May 30, 2006, in [[Belvidere, Illinois]], where the [[Dodge Neon]] was produced.

The Compass did not carry the "Trail Rated" badge found on other SUVs in the Jeep family for the 2007-2010 model years, but received the "Trail Rated" badge for the 2011 model year. This indicates that the Compass targets first-time Jeep buyers and those who drive primarily on paved roads.

The Compass and Patriot are both based on the [[DaimlerChrysler]]/[[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]] [[Mitsubishi GS platform|GS platform]]. These vehicles are differentiated by their styling and marketing: The Patriot is a traditionally styled 4-door Jeep [[station wagon|wagon]], while the Compass has a softer [[hatchback]] look, similar to the [[Dodge Caliber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jeep will reportedly build two car-based vehicles |publisher=AutoWeek |url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20050613/FREE/506130722 |date=13 June 2005 |first=Rick |last=Kranz |accessdate=23 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014220854/http://www.autoweek.com/article/20050613/free/506130722 |archive-date=14 October 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facelift===
For 2011, Jeep redesigned the Compass to more closely resemble the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee|Grand Cherokee]], while keeping its own identity. The 2011 Jeep Compass also receives a revised suspension for better handling, a revised interior with more standard equipment, and more option packages including a [[Freedom Drive II]] Off-Road Package which includes a continuously variable transmission fitted with a low-range setting, all-terrain tires inside 17-inch aluminum wheels, skid plates, a four-wheel-drive system, and an increase ground clearance of a full inch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.automoblog.net/2010/12/14/jeep-resets-compass-on-new-course-in-2011/ |title=Jeep Resets Compass on New Course in 2011 |publisher=Automoblog.net |date=14 December 2010 |first=Chris |last=Nagy |accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special edition Compass model commemorated Jeep’s 70th anniversary in 2011, and included various upgrades, special interiors, badges, wheels, and was available in only three exterior colors: Bronze Star, Bright Silver, and Black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.topspeed.com/cars/jeep/2011-jeep-compass-70th-anniversary-edition-ar103208.html |title=2011 Jeep Compass 70th Anniversary Edition |author=Kirby |date=1 November 2011 |publisher=www.topspeed.com |accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Powertrain===
The Compass uses a {{convert|172|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 2.4&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Chrysler World engine#2.4|World]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] gasoline engine. The 2.0&amp;nbsp;L [[Chrysler World engine#2.0|World]] engine is available on the 4X2 Sport model with {{convert|158|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. A 2.0&amp;nbsp;L l-R4 TDi {{convert|103|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}} [[Volkswagen]]-designed [[diesel engine]] was available for the [[Europe]]an and [[Australia]]n markets, replaced in 2011 by the 2.2&amp;nbsp;L [[Mercedes-Benz OM651]].

The Compass also features two electronically controlled [[four-wheel drive]] systems. [[Freedom Drive I]] and [[Freedom Drive II]], Freedom Drive I is a full-time four-wheel drive system with locking capabilities; Freedom Drive II is based on Freedom Drive I but by using the vehicle's CVT transmission it is capable of a 19:1 gear reduction simulating a low-range usually found in vehicles with dedicated transfer cases.

The base model version has [[front wheel drive]] (FWD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCraw |first=Jim |title=The First Front-Wheel-Drive Jeep |newspaper=The New York Times |date=12 April 2006 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/12/automobiles/autospecial/12glance-jeep-patriot.html |accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trail Rated version of the Compass has passed the same testing of off-road ability as other Jeep vehicles in terms of traction, ground clearance, maneuverability, articulation, and water fording.

===Models===

[[File:Jeep Compass Limited interior.jpg|thumb|right|Interior]]
The three basic models of Compass are '''Sport''', '''Latitude''', and '''Limited'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jeep-india.com/compass.html|title=Explore The New Jeep® Compass - Jeep India|website=www.jeep-india.com|access-date=2019-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sport''' serves as the base model. It includes features such as seventeen-inch [[alloy wheels]], an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD player and four speakers, a heater, cloth seating surfaces, and manual, roll-up windows and manual door locks. Features such as power windows and door locks, a seven-speaker [[Boston Acoustics]] premium sound system with a 368-watt external amplifier, and air conditioning are options. The 2014-2016 Jeep Compass Sport and Sport SE, The Electronic Vehicle Information Center (EVIC) does not come as standard equipment. An EVIC gives the user information such as gas mileage, number of miles to empty, service intervals, tire pressure, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/auto/latest-auto-news/story/jeep-compass-sport-plus-sale-starts-new-variant-priced-at-rs-15-99-lakh-1494271-2019-04-04|title=Jeep Compass Sport Plus sale starts, new variant priced at Rs 15.99 lakh|last=DelhiApril 4|first=Varun Singh New|last2=April 4|first2=2019UPDATED|website=India Today|language=en|access-date=2019-11-04|last3=Ist|first3=2019 20:22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Latitude''' is the midrange model. It added features onto the Sport, such as air conditioning, [[keyless entry]], a security system, and power windows and door locks. The EVIC comes as an optional component with the security and cargo convenience package. This option comes with alarm, tonneau cover, tire pressure monitoring display, garage door opener, and electronic vehicle information center. The model became available in 2011.

The '''Limited''' is the top-of-the-line model. It added features such as leather-trimmed seats, had an available sunroof, and [[remote starter]].

A '''70th Anniversary Edition''' was based on the Sport model. It added air conditioning, unique leather-trimmed seats, unique alloy wheels, a sunroof, side-impact airbags, a seven-speaker Boston Acoustics premium sound system with a 368-watt external amplifier, power windows and door locks, keyless entry, and a security alarm. This special edition model was only offered in 2011 to celebrate Jeep's 70th anniversary. All Jeep models for 2011 only offered a 70th Anniversary Edition model (Compass, Patriot, Wrangler, Wrangler Unlimited, Liberty, and the Grand Cherokee).

An '''Altitude Edition''' model was made available in 2012. It was based upon the Latitude model, and added black-painted alloy wheels, leather-trimmed seats, a sunroof, and a Boston Acoustics premium sound system with a 368-watt external amplifier. The Altitude package was available on the Jeep Grand Cherokee only at first, but then was available on the Compass, Patriot, Wrangler, and Wrangler Unlimited as well. All models except the Jeep Grand Cherokee dropped this model (the Grand Cherokee model continued to offer this model for the 2013 model year). The Altitude name was chosen in a contest to name a Grand Cherokee concept car. Because of the Altitude's popularity, Jeep decided to offer it on all models except for the Jeep Liberty.

The Jeep Patriot and first generation Jeep Compass were phased out during the 2016 model year, replaced by a single new redesigned Compass SUV that FiatChrysler would debut in late 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = It's Official: Jeep Wrangler Pickup Is Coming in 2017|url = http://blog.caranddriver.com/its-official-jeep-wrangler-pickup-is-coming-in-2017/|website = blog.caranddriver.com|access-date = 2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Jeep confirms pickup; new SUV to be Patriot or Compass|url = http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/detroit-auto-show/2016/01/11/jeep-confirms-pickup-new-suv-patriot-compass/78648152/|website = Detroit News|access-date = 2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety===
The Compass was safety tested by Euro NCAP in 2012 and earned only a two star rating.&lt;ref name=compass2012/&gt;

The second-generation of Jeep Compass debuted on September 27, 2016 in [[Brazil]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcapress.com.br/en/jeep/verRelease/1896.do|title=Jeep Compass: a new direction for the SUV segment |publisher=[[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles|FCA Press]]|date=26 September 2016 |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[Los Angeles International Auto Show#2016|Los Angeles International Auto Show]] in November 2016, replacing the [[Jeep Patriot]] and first generation Compass. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.netcarshow.com/jeep/2017-compass/ |title=Jeep Compass (2017) - pictures, information &amp; specs |publisher=Netcarshow.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production for North American-market Compass models was moved to [[Toluca, Mexico]], while [[Jeep Cherokee (KL)]] production will move from [[Toledo, Ohio]] to [[Belvidere, Illinois]], where the first-generation Compass and [[Jeep Patriot]] were both assembled. 

Using a stretched version of the same platform as the [[Jeep Renegade (BU)|Renegade]],&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = 2017 Jeep Compass
  | publisher = Autoblog 
  | author = 
  | date = 
  | url = http://www.autoblog.com/buy/2017-Jeep-Compass/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Compass is available in four distinct trim levels: the base '''Sport''', the mid-level '''Latitude''', the luxurious '''Limited''', and the off road-capable '''Trailhawk'''. All trim levels are available with either [[front-wheel drive]] or [[four-wheel drive]], with the exception of the Trailhawk, which is only available in a 4WD configuration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jeep-india.com/compass-trailhawk.html|title=Explore the New Jeep® Compass TrailHawk - Jeep India|website=www.jeep-india.com|access-date=2019-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the Compass comes equipped with a 2.4L [[World Gasoline Engine#Tigershark|Tigershark]] four-cylinder engine or a 1.4L '''MultiAir''' four-cylinder engine. More than 65 percent of the upper body structure and frame is made of [[High-strength low-alloy steel|high-strength steel]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.trucks.com/2016/11/17/2016-la-auto-show-2017-jeep-compass/ 2016 LA Auto Show: 2017 Jeep Compass Promises Improved Ride and Performance]. ''trucks.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Styling of the second-generation Compass is inspired by two of its larger siblings, the [[Jeep Cherokee (KL)]] and [[Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK2)]]. Styling elements taken from the Grand Cherokee include headlamps integrated into the front grille and a narrow front grille with a black finish, while the Cherokee lends some of its rear end styling elements, basic interior design, and 2.4L '''Tigershark''' Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) gasoline engine and [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]]-sourced nine-speed 948TE automatic transmission to the overall design of the Compass.

Available features include FCA's UConnect 4C 8.4 and 8.4N touch-screen infotainment systems, a [[Beats Electronics|Beats]] Premium Audio System with a 506-watt digital amplifier, eighteen-inch aluminum alloy wheels, Jeep's Command-View panoramic sunroof, [[LED]] front headlamps, Forward Collision Warning, a ParkView rear-view backup camera system, front and rear parking sensors, Blind Spot Information System (BLIS), and Jeep's [[Selec-Terrain]] full-time four-wheel-drive system (standard on the Trailhawk model).

=== India-spec model ===
The Jeep Compass was unveiled in India on 12 April 2017 and assembled in the [[Fiat India|FCA India]] Pune plant since 1 July 2017&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=18314&amp;mid=&amp;searchresult First indian Jeep Compass in production]&lt;/ref&gt;. Apart from manufacturing to the Indian market, Jeep also exports the Indian-made Compass to many right-hand drive markets such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Brunei, Japan, Indonesia and Thailand.

The '''Jeep CJ''' models are both a series and a range of small, open-bodied [[off-road vehicle]]s and compact [[pickup truck]]s, built and sold by several successive incarnations of the [[Jeep]] [[automobile manufacturer|automobile marque]] from 1945 to 1986. The 1945 Willys Jeep was the world's first mass-produced civilian [[four-wheel drive]] car.

In 1944, [[Willys|Willys-Overland]], one of the two main manufacturers of the [[Willys MB|World War II military Jeep]], built the first prototypes for a commercial version – the CJ, short for "civilian Jeep".&lt;ref name=CollectLib&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zTsAbTJB5RIC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=cj+jeep+stood+for+Civilian |pages=49–51 |title=Jeep Collector's Library |first=Jim |last=Allen |publisher=MBI Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-7603-1979-6 |accessdate=22 May 2014 |authorlink=Jim Allen (4x4 writer) |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140708051243/http://books.google.com/books?id=zTsAbTJB5RIC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=cj+jeep+stood+for+Civilian |archive-date=8 July 2014 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, all CJ Jeeps consistently had a separate body and frame, rigid [[solid axle|live axles]] with leaf springs both front and rear, a tapering nose design with flared fenders, and a fold-flat windshield, and could be driven without doors. Also, with few exceptions, they had part-time [[Jeep four-wheel-drive systems|four-wheel drive systems]], with the choice of high and low gearing, and open bodies with removable hard or soft tops.

After remaining in production through a range of model numbers, and several corporate parents, the Jeep CJ line was officially ended in 1986. More than 1.5 million CJ Jeeps were built, having continued the same basic body style for 45 years since the Jeep first appeared.&lt;ref name=NYTimes85&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/28/business/amc-to-end-jeep-cj-models.html |title=A.M.C. to End Jeep CJ Models |newspaper=The New York Times |date=28 November 1985 |accessdate=13 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314104411/https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/28/business/amc-to-end-jeep-cj-models.html |archive-date=14 March 2018 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widely regarded as "America's workhorse", the CJs have been described as "probably the most successful utility vehicle ever made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ackerson |first=Robert |title=Jeep CJ 1945-1986 |year=2005 |publisher=Veloce Publishing |isbn=9781904788966}}&lt;/ref&gt; American Motors VP Joseph Cappy said the end of "CJ production will signal an end of a very important era in Jeep history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.hemmings.com/blog/2011/02/18/class-of-86-jeep-cj-7-and-cj-8/ |title=Class of '86 – Jeep CJ-7 and CJ-8 |work=Hemmings Daily |first=Daniel |last=Strohl |date=18 February 2011 |accessdate=13 February 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180113203036/https://www.hemmings.com/blog/2011/02/18/class-of-86-jeep-cj-7-and-cj-8/ |archive-date=13 January 2018 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jeep CJ-7 was replaced in 1986 by the similar-looking [[Jeep Wrangler]]. The Jeep CJ-8 and CJ-10s were succeeded by the [[Jeep Comanche]] pickup.

The similar model, the [[Jeep DJ|DJ]] "Dispatcher" was introduced in 1956 as a two-wheel drive version with open, fabric, or a closed steel body in both left- and right-hand drives for hotel, resort, police, and later [[United States Postal Service]] markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Flory, Jr. |first=J.

By 1944, the Allies were confident the war would be won, and wartime production looked to be winding down.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} This allowed Willys to consider designing a Jeep for the postwar civilian market. Documentation is scarce, but in early 1944, Willys seemed to have found time to start drawing up plans, and one or two prototypes dubbed CJ(-1), for "Civilian Jeep", were running by May of that year. The first CJ(s) had apparently been created by quick modification of the regular military MB, adding a tailgate, lower gearing, a [[Drawbar (haulage)|drawbar]], and a civilian-style canvas top. The first CJ served as a quick proof-of-concept test, and when a further design evolution materialized, probably became the CJ-1 by default.&lt;ref name="OldestCJ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fourwheeler.com/features/1507-the-oldest-restored-civilian-jeep/ |title=The Oldest Restored Civilian Jeep |last=Allen |first=Jim |date=27 July 2015 |website=FourWheeler.com |publisher=Extreme Ventures |authorlink=Jim Allen (4x4 writer) |access-date=13 February 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180222165444/http://www.fourwheeler.com/features/1507-the-oldest-restored-civilian-jeep/ |archive-date=22 February 2018 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were manufactured until the CJ-2s appeared, and they were the first Jeeps built from the ground up for civilian use.

No CJ-1s built have survived, and how many were made is unknown.&lt;ref name="thecj2apage1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thecj2apage.com/story.html |title=The CJ2A Story |publisher=Thecj2apage.com |accessdate=13 February 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171005221831/https://www.thecj2apage.com/story.html |archive-date=5 October 2017 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although at least 40 were built, the '''Willys-Overland CJ-2''' was not really available at retail.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} The CJ-2s, also known as "AgriJeeps"{{By whom|date=June 2019}}, were the second-generation prototypes for the first production civilian Jeep, and were used solely for testing purposes. Although their design was directly based on the military [[Willys MB]], using the same [[Willys Go Devil engine]] — they were not only stripped of all military features, particularly the blackout lighting, but also the CJ-2s had many significant differences in body features and construction versus the military Jeep.&lt;ref name="OldestCJ"/&gt; They had tailgates, power take-offs, engine governors ($28.65),&lt;ref name="Gunnell 1993"/&gt; column-shift T90 [[manual transmission]]s, 5.38 gears, 2.43:1 low-range transfer cases, and driver's-side tool indentations. Rear wheelwells were redesigned so that seats could be enlarged, improved, and moved rearward, and new, more weathertight top designs were tried. A canvas half-top with roll-down doors was one of several top designs tried before production.&lt;ref name="OldestCJ"/&gt; The CJ-2 Go-Devil L-head engine was largely the same as the wartime Jeep, but used a different carburetor and ignition system.

{{citation needed span|text=The CJ-2s were built in two main batches, but even within the two groups, each was a little different, as they evolved and were modified for various types of work. For instance a number of experimental combinations of powertrain components were tested. Earlier models were dubbed “pilot models” because they still had so many differences from the production Jeeps. They were painted olive-drab, and had brass “JEEP” badges on the windshield base, the hood sides, and the rear. Some CJ-2s also had an "AgriJeep" plaque fixed to the dash.|date=June 2019}} Later models were stamped "JEEP" and were painted in a few civilian colors that translated into the familiar "WILLYS" stamping and the colors that appeared on the first production CJ-2A Jeeps built from 1945.&lt;ref name="OldestCJ"/&gt; The spare tire was mounted forward of the passenger-side rear wheel on the earlier models and aft of the rear wheel on later ones. The CJ-2s were likely distributed to "agricultural stations" for evaluation purposes.

Of the 40–45 CJ-2s built, serial numbers CJ2-03, CJ2-04, CJ2-06 (X30), CJ2-09 (X33), CJ2-11, CJ2-12, CJ2-14, CJ2-26, CJ2-32 (X56), CJ2-37 (X61), CJ2-38, and CJ2-39 have survived, although some in very rough condition.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} CJ-2-06 and CJ2-09 have been restored.&lt;ref name="OldestCJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thecj2apage1"/&gt;

The lessons learned with the CJ-2 led to the development of the first full-production CJ, the 1945-1949 '''Willys-Overland CJ-2A''', or '''Universal Jeep'''. A trademark for "AGRIJEEP" was granted in December 1944, but was not used.&lt;ref name="OldestCJ"/&gt; The CJ-2A looked very much like a civilianized MB with a tailgate and side-mounted spare wheel. A distinct difference between the MB and the CJ-2A lay in the grilles of the two vehicles. Where the MB had recessed headlights and nine-slot grilles, the CJ-2A had larger, slightly bulging headlights, flush-mounted in a seven-slot grille. While still powered by the reliable L-134 Go-Devil engine, the CJ-2A replaced the MB's T-84 transmission with a beefier T-90 three-speed.

Production of the CJ-2A started on 17 July 1945, sharing production time with the MB – roughly 9000 more MBs were produced through September 1945.&lt;ref name=CJ2Ahistory&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecj2apage.com/history.html|title=The CJ2A Page -- History of the CJ2A|author=|date=|website=www.thecj2apage.com|access-date=2018-05-06|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190524173858/https://www.thecj2apage.com/history.html|archive-date=2019-05-24|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the early CJ-2As were produced using remaining stock of the military jeep components such as engine blocks, and in a few cases, modified frames. Up to serial no. 13453, the MB-style full floating rear axle was fitted. Once they were used up, the CJ got a stronger Dana / Spicer model 41.&lt;ref name=CJ2Ahistory/&gt; Sometimes the use of MB parts was due to strikes at suppliers, such as Autolite. Since Willys produced few parts in-house and relied heavily on suppliers, it was vulnerable to strikes. Unfortunately for Willys, strikes were common after the war, and this likely contributed to low production totals in 1945 and early 1946.

Since the CJ-2A was primarily intended for farming, ranching, and industrial applications, stock CJ-2As only came with a driver seat and driver side mirror, and a wide variety of options was available, such as: front passenger seat, rear seat, center rear-view mirror, canvas top, front power take-off (PTO), rear PTO, belt pulley drive, capstan winch, governor, rear hydraulic lift, snow plow, welder, generator,&lt;ref name="gunnell"/&gt; mower, disc, front bumper weight, heavy-duty springs, dual vacuum windshield wipers (stock CJ-2As were equipped with a manual wiper on the passenger side and a vacuum wiper on the driver side), dual taillights (stock CJ-2As had a taillight on the driver side and a reflector on the passenger side), hot-climate radiator, driveshaft guards, heater, side steps, and radiator brush guard.

The CJ-2As were produced in lively color combinations that in some ways symbolized the hope and promise of postwar America. From 1945 to mid-1946, CJ-2As were only available in two color combinations: Pasture Green with Autumn Yellow wheels and Harvest Tan with Sunset Red wheels. Additional color combinations added in mid-1946 were: Princeton Black with Harvard Red or Sunset Red wheels, Michigan Yellow with Pasture Green, Sunset Red or Americar Black wheels, Normandy Blue with Autumn Yellow or Sunset Red wheels, and Harvard Red with Autumn Yellow or Americar Black wheels. The Pasture Green and Harvest Tan combinations were dropped later in 1946. The Harvard Red combinations were dropped in 1947 and replaced with Picket Gray with Harvard Red wheels, and Luzon Red with Universal Beige wheels. In 1948, these color combinations were also added: Emerald Green with Universal Beige wheels, Potomac Gray with Harvard Red or American Black wheels. For 1949, the Picket Gray, Michigan Yellow, and Normandy Blue combinations were dropped. Olive drab was also available for export models.

On early CJ-2As, the front seats were covered in olive-drab vinyl. Around mid-1947, Slate Gray vinyl became available for certain color combinations. Later, Barcelona Red was added to the mix.

A total of 214,760 CJ-2As were produced. Because of the use of military production parts on the earliest CJ-2As, and the many changes made during its early production, restorers and collectors refer to CJ-2As up to around serial no. 34,530 as "Very Early Civilian" and from mid-1946 to about mid-1947 as "Early Civilian". Only minor changes were made after the mid-1947 models.&lt;ref name=CJ2Ahistory/&gt;

The '''Willys-Overland CJ-3A''' was introduced in 1949, and was in production until 1953, when replaced by the CJ-3B. It was powered by Willys' {{convert|60|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} L-134 Go-Devil four-cylinder engine, with a T-90 transmission and [[Dana Holding Corporation|Dana]] 18 transfer case, a [[Dana 30#Dana25|Dana 25]] front axle and Dana 41 or 44 rear axle. It featured a one-piece windshield with a vent, and wipers at the bottom. The CJ-3A had beefed-up suspension (10 leaf) to accommodate the various agricultural implements that were being built for the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.film.queensu.ca/CJ3B/Siblings/CJ3AOrigins.html |last=Cary |first=Reed |title=The CJ-3A Universal Jeep |date=4 March 2001 |accessdate=27 April 2013 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626210611/http://www.film.queensu.ca/cj3b/Siblings/CJ3AOrigins.html |archivedate=26 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another difference was a shorter rear wheelwell (the wheelwell from the top front edge to the rear of the body is {{convert|32|in|mm|abbr=on}} on the 3A compared to {{convert|34|in|mm|abbr=on}} on the 2A) and moving the driver's seat rearward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cj3a.info/cj3a/cj3a.htm|title=The CJ-3A|first=Bob|last=Westerman|date=|website=www.cj3a.info|access-date=29 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006213747/http://www.cj3a.info/cj3a/cj3a.htm|archive-date=6 October 2008|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1951, a Farm Jeep and a Jeep Tractor version were offered; the latter was very bare-bones, for field use only, and featured a [[power takeoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cj3a.info/cj3a/farmjeep/fj.html|title=CJ-3A Farm Jeep and Jeep Tractor|first=Bob|last=Westerman|date=|website=www.cj3a.info|access-date=2017-12-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226130255/http://www.cj3a.info/cj3a/farmjeep/fj.html|archive-date=2017-12-26|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, 131,843 CJ-3As were produced before the series ended in 1953. About 550 of the CJ3-As were assembled by [[Mitsubishi]] as the J1/J2 in late 1952 and early 1953, exclusively for the Japanese police and forestry agency.&lt;ref name="Trucks18-72"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ozeki |first=Kazuo |title = &lt;rb&gt;日本のトラック・バス 1918~1972&lt;/rb&gt; |trans-title=Japanese Trucks and Buses 1918-1972 |publisher=Miki Press |year=2007 |page=131 |location=Tokyo |language= Japanese |isbn=978-4-89522-494-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CJ-3A-derived military jeep was the [[Willys M38|Willys MC (or M38)]], and it began complementing the Ford and Willys [[Willys MB|World War II jeeps]] starting in 1949.

The '''Willys CJ-3B''' replaced the [[#CJ-3A|CJ-3A]] in 1953, the same year Willys-Overland was bought by [[Kaiser Motors]]. The Kaiser parent company removed "Overland" from the Willys Motors subcompany name. The CJ-3B introduced a higher grille and hood to clear the new Willys Hurricane engine.

The CJ-3B was turned into the M606 military jeep (mostly used for export, through 1968) by equipping it with commercially available heavy-duty options, such as larger tires and springs, and by adding black-out lighting, [[olive drab]] paint, and a trailer hitch. Shipments of the M606 militarized version of the Jeep CJ-3B, exported for military aid under the [[Mutual Defense Assistance Act#Mutual Assistance Program|Mutual Defense Assistance Program]], accounted for a substantial percentage of the limited CJ-3B production in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Redmond/&gt;

=== International licenses and derivatives ===
The CJ-3B design was also licensed to a number of international manufacturers, which produced a civilian and military variants long after 1968, including [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]] of [[Japan]] and [[Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Limited|Mahindra]] of [[India]]. Mitsubishi's version was built from 1953 until 1998, while Mahindra continued to produce vehicles based on the Willys CJ-3B until October 1, 2010. The CJ-3B was also built by Türk Willys Overland.

The Jeep was introduced to the Japanese market as the '''Jeep J3''' in July 1953 after Willys agreed to allow Mitsubishi to market the car, competing with the [[Nissan Patrol#First generation (4W60; 1951–1960)|Nissan Patrol]] and the [[Toyota Land Cruiser#J20, J30 (1955–1960)|Toyota Land Cruiser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Edsall |first1=Larry |title=Field Guide: Through the generations with Toyota's Land Cruiser |url=https://journal.classiccars.com/2018/09/22/field-guide-through-the-generations-with-toyotas-land-cruiser/ |website=The Classic Cars.com Journal |accessdate=7 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107010409/https://journal.classiccars.com/2018/09/22/field-guide-through-the-generations-with-toyotas-land-cruiser/ |archive-date=7 November 2018 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was not in reference to "CJ3", but rather denoted the fact that 53 "J1"s (CJ-3A with 6-volt electrics) were built for the Japanese [[Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Japan)|regional forest office]] and around 500 "J2"s (CJ-3A with 12-volt electrics) were built for the [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force|National Safety Forces]].&lt;ref name="Trucks18-72"/&gt; Mitsubishi continued knock-down production of vehicles derived from the CJ-3B design until August 1998, when tighter emissions and safety standards finally made the Jeep obsolete.

The Japanese GSDF refers to them as [[Mitsubishi Type 73 Light Truck|Type 73 Light Truck]].

[[File:Mitsubishi Jeep J-37 003.JPG|thumb|left|Mitsubishi Jeep Delivery Wagon J37]]
The original J3 was a basic, doorless, and roofless version, with steering on the left, rather than the right, despite Japan having left-side traffic. The first right-hand drive versions did not appear until nearly eight years later (J3R/J11R). The original J3 and its derivatives were equipped with the {{convert|2199|cc|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[IOE engine|F-head]] "Hurricane" (called JH4 by Mitsubishi, for '''J'''apanese '''H'''urricane '''4'''-cylinder) inline four-cylinder, originally producing {{convert|70|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 4,000&amp;nbsp;rpm.&lt;ref name="Ozeki1"&gt;Ozeki, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 a slightly longer wheelbase '''J10''' which could seat six was added, and in 1956 the '''J11''' appeared, a two-door "delivery wagon" with a full metal body. This was considerably longer, at {{convert|433|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} versus {{convert|339|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} for the J3.

Local production of the JH4 engine commenced in 1955. A locally developed diesel version ([[Mitsubishi KE engine|KE31]]) was introduced for the JC3 in 1958, originally with {{convert|56|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 3,500&amp;nbsp;rpm but with {{convert|61|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 3,600&amp;nbsp;rpm a few years&lt;!-- How many? --&gt; later.&lt;ref name="Ozeki1"/&gt; Later versions used 4DR5 and 4DR6 (J23 turbo) 2.7&amp;nbsp;liter overhead-valve diesel engines. The final military version J24A produced 135PS from an improved 4DR5 engine with front-mounted air-to-air intercooler. 

By 1962, the output of the gasoline JH4 engine had crept up to {{convert|76|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. By the time of the introduction of the longer '''J20''' in 1960, a six-seater like the J10, but with a differently configurated (more permanent) front windshield, as well as available metal doors, Mitsubishi had also added small diagonal skirts to the leading edge of the Jeep's front fenders. This remained the last change to the sheetmetal up front until the end of Mitsubishi Jeep production in 1998.

Later models include 2-L, short-wheelbase, soft-top '''J58''' ('''J54''' with a diesel engine), and the '''J38''' gasoline wagon on the longest wheelbase.&lt;ref name=Catvol25&gt;{{cite book |ref=JAMA25 |title= 自動車ガイドブック |trans-title=Japanese Motor Vehicles Guide Book |language= Japanese |volume=25 |date=1978-10-10 |publisher =Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association |pages=206–207 |id=0053-780025-3400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last iteration of the Japanese Jeeps was the J53 with diesel turbo engine.

The '''Willys CJ-5''' (after 1964 '''Jeep CJ-5''') was influenced by new corporate owner, Kaiser, and the [[Korean War]] [[Willys M38A1|M38A1]] Jeep. It was intended to replace the CJ-3B, but that model continued in production. The CJ-5 repeated this pattern, continuing in production for three decades while three newer models appeared. "The CJ-5 has the distinct honor of being a vehicle that was hard to kill off... equaling the longest production run of note." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.jpmagazine.com/featuredvehicles/154_0707_history_of_jeep_cj5_jeep_autopsy/ |last=Tellem |first=Tori |title=History of the CJ-5 - Jeep Autopsy: CJ-5 One Of The "Unstoppables" |journal=JP Magazine |date=June 2007 |accessdate=27 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621071512/http://www.jpmagazine.com/featuredvehicles/154_0707_history_of_jeep_cj5_jeep_autopsy/ |archive-date=21 June 2013 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:'67 Kaiser Jeep (Auto classique VAQ St-Lambert '12).jpg|thumb|left|Willys M38A1]] 
From 1961 to 1965, optional for the CJ-5 and CJ-6 was the British-made [[Perkins Engines|Perkins]] {{convert|192|cuin|L|2|abbr=on}} Diesel I4 with {{convert|62|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 3,000&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|143|lb/ft|0|abbr=on}} at 1350&amp;nbsp;rpm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baeta.org/opie/engine.htm#P |title=Engine Specs - Jeep Engines |publisher=Baeta.org |accessdate=2011-11-20 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116163924/http://www.baeta.org/opie/engine.htm#P |archivedate=2011-11-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Kaiser bought license to produce the [[Buick]] {{convert|225|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V6 [[Buick V6 engine#Dauntless|Dauntless]] engine, to offer the new {{convert|155|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} option on the CJ-5 and CJ-6, countering complaints that the 75&amp;nbsp;hp [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] Willys Hurricane engine was underpowered. Power steering was an $81 option.&lt;ref name="gunnell"/&gt; The V6 engine proved so popular, by 1968, some 75% of CJ-5s were sold with it.&lt;ref name=Cranswick/&gt;

[[File:Jeep-A-Trench on a CJ-5 rr.jpg|thumb|left|CJ-5 with the "Jeep-A-Trench" accessory]]
Kaiser Jeep was sold to [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]] (AMC) in 1970, and the Buick engine was retired after the 1971 model year. (GM's [[Buick]] division repurchased the engine tooling in the early 1970s which served as the powerplant in several GM vehicles.) The "Trac-Lok" [[limited-slip differential]] replaced the "Powr-Lok" in 1971, and PTOs were no longer available after that year.&lt;ref name=transfer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeep-cj.com/forums/f105/transfer-cases-12108/#post97071|title=Transfer Cases - Jeep-CJ Forums|author=|date=|website=www.jeep-cj.com|access-date=2017-12-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230225819/http://www.jeep-cj.com/forums/f105/transfer-cases-12108/#post97071|archive-date=2017-12-30|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMC began marketing the Jeep less as a universal utility vehicle, and more as a sporty one, notably increasing its performance and features.

&lt;big&gt;'''1972 Revamp'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The 1972 model year brought significant changes to the CJ-5. American Motors began fitting their own engines, which also required changes to both body and chassis. The base Willys 4-cylinder was replaced by AMC's Torque Command straight-6 engines, giving the entry-level CJ-5 the power of the previously optional Buick V6. Standard became the {{convert|232|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}, and optional the {{convert|258|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}, which was standard in California. Both engines used a one-barrel Carter YF carburetor. Also in 1972, [[AMC V8 engine#304|AMC's {{convert|304|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8]] engine became available, which upgraded the [[power-to-weight ratio]] to a level comparable to a V8 muscle-car. Other drive-train changes included a new front axle - a full-floating, open-knuckle [[Dana 30]], which was both 25&amp;nbsp;lbs lighter and reduced the turning circle by 6&amp;nbsp;ft.

To accommodate the new engines, the wheelbase was stretched by {{convert|3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, and the fenders and hood were stretched by {{convert|5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, pushing the firewall two inches closer to the rear.&lt;ref name=Cranswick&gt;{{cite book |last=Cranswick |first=Marc |date=2011 |title=The Cars of American Motors: An Illustrated History |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=r9j7MWLE_jMC&amp;pg=PA241&amp;lpg=PA241&amp;dq=1972+cj-5+nose&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tUrD5PeDip&amp;sig=LbSTN4Sggq3bTVzuzxFl3cgocqw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwichfjsg7LYAhWGmLQKHXwfBPg4ChDoAQhfMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=1972%20cj-5%20nose&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=McFarland |page=241 |isbn=9780786485703 |author-link= |access-date=2017-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230231136/https://books.google.nl/books?id=r9j7MWLE_jMC&amp;pg=PA241&amp;lpg=PA241&amp;dq=1972+cj-5+nose&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tUrD5PeDip&amp;sig=LbSTN4Sggq3bTVzuzxFl3cgocqw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwichfjsg7LYAhWGmLQKHXwfBPg4ChDoAQhfMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=1972%20cj-5%20nose&amp;f=false |archive-date=2017-12-30 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kaiserwillys.com/about_willys_jeep_cj5_history_specs|title=About Willys Vehicles - CJ-5, 6|author=|date=|website=www.kaiserwillys.com|access-date=2017-12-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230230454/https://www.kaiserwillys.com/about_willys_jeep_cj5_history_specs|archive-date=2017-12-30|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new box-frame was fitted, featuring six cross-members for more rigidity.&lt;ref name=CJhistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classic-car-history.com/cj-jeep-history.htm|title=CJ Jeep History|first=Mark|last=Trotta|date=|website=www.classic-car-history.com|access-date=2017-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230114906/http://www.classic-car-history.com/cj-jeep-history.htm|archive-date=2017-12-30|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a larger fuel tank was mounted, moved from under the driver's seat to under the rear, between the frame rails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeepfan.com/tech/spotters-guide-to-the-72-75-amc-cj-5/|title=Identifying a Jeep, An In-depth Spotters Guide to the 72-75 AMC Jeep CJ-5 - jeepfan.com|author=|date=|website=www.jeepfan.com|access-date=2017-12-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230172559/http://www.jeepfan.com/tech/spotters-guide-to-the-72-75-amc-cj-5/|archive-date=2017-12-30|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dealer-installed radio became available in 1973, air conditioning became available via dealership in 1975. Electronic, breakerless distributors replaced breaker-point Delco distributors for the full engine line-up, and a catalytic converter was added to models equipped with the 304 V8.&lt;ref name=Collectp91&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zTsAbTJB5RIC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=cj+jeep+stood+for+Civilian |pages=91–92 |title=Jeep Collector's Library |first=Jim |last=Allen |publisher=MBI Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-7603-1979-6 |accessdate=22 May 2014 |authorlink=Jim Allen (4x4 writer) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708051243/http://books.google.com/books?id=zTsAbTJB5RIC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=cj+jeep+stood+for+Civilian |archive-date=8 July 2014 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, for the 1976 model year, the tub and frame were modified from earlier versions. The frame went from a partially open channel/boxed frame with riveted crossmembers, to majoritively boxed with welded crossmembers, and from parallel rails to widening fore to aft to benefit stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.jeep-cj.com/forums/f102/cj5-1972-1975-a-12408/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230172121/https://www.jeep-cj.com/forums/f102/cj5-1972-1975-a-12408/ |archive-date=2017-12-30 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the body tub became more rounded. The windshield frame and windshield angle were also changed, meaning that tops from 1955 to 1975 will not fit a 1976-1983 CJ-5 and vice versa. The rear axle was also changed in 1976 from a [[Dana 44]] to an AMC-manufactured [[AMC 20|model 20]] that had a larger-diameter ring gear, but used a two-piece axleshaft/hub assembly instead of the one-piece design used in the Dana.

For 1977, the frame was modified again to a completely boxed unit. Power disc brakes and the "Golden Eagle" package (which included a tachometer and clock) were new options,&lt;ref name="gunnell"/&gt; as well as air conditioning.&lt;ref name=Collectp91/&gt;

In 1979, the standard engine became the {{convert|258|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} I6 that now featured a Carter BBD two-barrel [[carburetor]].

From 1980 to 1983, the CJ-5 came standard with a "Hurricane"-branded version of the [[General Motors|GM]] [[GM Iron Duke engine#Hurricane|Iron Duke]] I4 with an SR4 close-ratio, four-speed manual transmission. The {{convert|258|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} AMC straight-6 engine remained available as an option, but the transmission was changed from the Tremec T-150 three-speed to a Tremec T-176 close-ratio four-speed. The Dana 30 front axle was retained, but the locking hubs were changed to a five-bolt retaining pattern versus the older six-bolt.

The demise of the AMC CJ5 model has been attributed to a December 1980 ''60 Minutes'' segment where the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS) staged a demonstration to illustrate that the CJ5 was apt to roll over "in routine road circumstances at relatively low speeds." Years later, it was revealed the testers only managed to achieve eight rollovers out of 435 runs through a corner. The IIHS requested the testers implement "vehicle loading" (hanging weights in the vehicle's corners inside the body, where they were not apparent to the camera) to generate worst-case conditions for stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://walterolson.com/articles/crashtests.html|title="It Didn't Start With Dateline NBC" (National Review 6/21/93)|first=Walter|last=Olson|website=walterolson.com|accessdate=5 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512134539/http://walterolson.com/articles/crashtests.html|archive-date=12 May 2017|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also extended above the front seats of a CJ-5, which is where the main sleeper was located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cj5camper.com/|title=Rare Jeep Camper - 1969 CJ5 Jeep Camper History, Photos and Information|author=|date=|website=www.cj5camper.com|access-date=2013-12-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228021503/http://www.cj5camper.com/|archive-date=2013-12-28|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DiyRV&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doityourselfrv.com/1969-cj5-jeep-camper/|title=The 1969 CJ5 Jeep Camper Could Be The Rarest RV Ever|author=|date=|website=www.doityourselfrv.com|access-date=2017-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229231848/http://www.doityourselfrv.com/1969-cj5-jeep-camper/|archive-date=2017-12-29|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.street2mud.com/albums/album02/JeepCJ5Camper_5.jpg |title=New 'Jeep' camper (brochure) |page=5 |publisher= |accessdate=27 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227142931/http://www.street2mud.com/albums/album02/JeepCJ5Camper_5.jpg |archive-date=27 February 2012 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.street2mud.com/albums/album02/JeepCJ5Camper_6.jpg |title=New 'Jeep' camper (brochure) |page=6 |publisher= |accessdate=27 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227142952/http://www.street2mud.com/albums/album02/JeepCJ5Camper_6.jpg |archive-date=27 February 2012 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.street2mud.com/albums/album02/JeepCJ5Camper_7.jpg |title=New 'Jeep' camper (brochure) |page=7 |publisher= |accessdate=27 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227142956/http://www.street2mud.com/albums/album02/JeepCJ5Camper_7.jpg |archive-date=27 February 2012 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.street2mud.com/albums/album02/JeepCJ5Camper_8.jpg |title=New 'Jeep' camper (brochure) |page=8 |publisher= |accessdate=27 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227143000/http://www.street2mud.com/albums/album02/JeepCJ5Camper_8.jpg |archive-date=27 February 2012 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; When AMC bought Kaiser-Jeep in 1970, they ended the Jeep camper option.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, a unique variant of the CJ5/CJ6 was produced in limited numbers. In 1965, when the CJ was given the all-new Buick V6, Jeep saw the need for something similar in Australia. So, they began to fit Falcon 6-cylinder engines to them at their Rocklea factory in Queensland. The Jeep was fitted with an engine, pedal box, and clutch/brake system corresponding to the equivalent Falcon at the time; a 1965 CJ5 would be fitted with 1965 Falcon engine/clutch components. Combat 6 jeeps were also fitted with Australian Borg Warner differentials, and Borg Warner-brand gearboxes. Very little documentation about these Jeeps remains, and often the only way to conclusively identify them is by owner history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.film.queensu.ca/cj3b/world/australia.html |title=Jeeps in Australia |publisher=The CJ3B Page |date=21 February 2012 |accessdate=24 August 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716221723/http://www.film.queensu.ca/cj3b/World/Australia.html |archivedate=16 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
[[File:1963 Willys Jeep Universal.jpg|thumb|1963 Brazilian-built CJ-5]]

While most foreign assemblers focused on the CJ-3B, Brazil received the CJ-5, instead. After having closed their market to imported cars in 1954, assembly of the "Willys Jeep Universal" (as it was known in Brazil) from CKD kits began in 1957.&lt;ref name="JIB"/&gt; By 1958, production relied on locally sourced components, with the vehicles equipped with a {{convert|90|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 2.6&amp;nbsp;liter I6 engine (also used by Willys do Brasil for passenger cars). The Universals came with a three-speed manual transmission. The Brazilian-built vehicles are easily recognized by their squared-off rear wheel openings. In 1961, a long-wheelbase version, similar to the [[#CJ6|CJ-6]], was added to the line.

On 9 October 1967, [[Ford do Brasil]] bought the Brazilian Willys subsidiary and took over the production of the CJ-5, the [[Willys Jeep Station Wagon]]-based "[[Ford Rural|Rural]]", and its pick-up truck version. Ford kept the line with no modifications except for some Ford badges on the sides and on the tailgate.&lt;ref name="JIB"/&gt; In 1976, Ford equipped the CJ-5 and the Rural with the locally built version of the 2.3-L OHC four-cylinder engine used in the Ford Pinto (also used in the Brazilian [[Ford Maverick (Americas)|Maverick]]) and a four-speed manual transmission. This engine produced {{convert|91|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} ([[Horsepower#Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE]]) at 5000&amp;nbsp;rpm.&lt;ref name="WC81"&gt;{{cite book|title=World Cars 1981 |publisher=The Automobile Club of Italy/Herald Books |editor-last=Lösch |editor-first=Annamaria |page=259 |year=1981 |isbn=9780910714136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, the engine was modified to run on [[ethanol]] ([[Neat ethanol fuel|E100]]); this option lasted until 1983, when Ford ended the production of the CJ-5 in Brazil.&lt;ref name="JIB"/&gt;

The '''CJ-6''' was a stretched version of the CJ-5 with a {{convert|20|in|mm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} longer-wheelbase (101&amp;nbsp;in, 1955-1971 / 103.5&amp;nbsp;in, 1972–1981).&lt;ref name=JKCwb/&gt; The extended chassis allowed a variety of configurations, including adding a second row of seats. Introduced in 1953 as the M170 military version, the civilian CJ-6 made its debut in 1955 as a 1956 model. Never very popular in the United States, most CJ-6 models were sold to [[Sweden]] and South America. It was also assembled in South Africa, by [[Volkswagen]]'s local subsidiary.&lt;ref name=SAM1076&gt;{{cite journal | ref = SAM1076 | journal = SA Motor | title = News Models | page = 71 | editor-last = Howard | editor-first = Tony | publisher = Scott Publications | location = Cape Town, South Africa | date = October 1976 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Forest Service]] put a number of CJ-6 Jeeps into use. American sales ended after 1975, with the introduction of the CJ-7. Just 50,172 had been made when the series went out of production completely in 1981.&lt;ref name=JeepOffRoad/&gt; Just as in the CJ-5, the V6 and V8 engine choices appeared in 1965 and 1972.

The M170 military version shared many of the features of the [[Willys M38A1|M38A1]] (Military CJ-5), but had the passenger-door opening extended back to the rear wheel well. Most were used as front-line field ambulances, able to carry four litters. A few were also used as radio units.

The Brazilian Willys factory developed a version of the CJ-5 very similar to the CJ-6, offered with either two or four doors. Called the "Willys Jeep 101", it shared the chassis of the local Rural, a redesigned [[Willys Jeep Station Wagon]]. Like the Brazilian-made CJ5s, the 101 has square rear-wheel openings.&lt;ref name="JIB"/&gt; This version was introduced in 1961, but was not retained after Ford's takeover in the fall of 1967.

The '''Jeep CJ-7''' featured a wheelbase 10 inches longer than that of the [[#CJ-5|CJ-5]], with its curved side entry cutouts partially squared up to accommodate hinged doors. The other main difference between CJ-5 and CJ-7 was to the chassis, which consisted of two parallel longitudinal main c-section rails. To help improve vehicle handling and stability, the rear section of the chassis stepped out to allow the springs and shock absorbers to be mounted closer to the outside of the body. It was introduced for the 1976 model year, with 379,299 built during 11 years of production.&lt;ref name=JeepOffRoad/&gt;

Transmission options included the standard part-time two-speed transfer case, automatic, and an optional new automatic [[all-wheel drive]] system called [[Jeep four-wheel-drive systems#Quadra-Trac|Quadra-Trac]]. Other features included an optional molded hardtop, and steel doors. The CJ-7 was also available in Renegade and Laredo models. Distinguished by their different body decals, the Laredo model featured highback leather bucket seats, a tilting steering wheel, and a chrome package that included the bumpers, front grill cover, and side mirrors. An optional Trak-Lok rear differential was available, too. Axle ratio was typically 2.73, with 3.13 as an option (standard in high-altitude regions).

The reports of the CJ-7 were different in each type of engine: the {{convert|145|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Diesel engine|diesel]] was mated to the 4.10 ratio axle (in both Renegade and Laredo), while the 258 cubic-inch straight six and 150 cubic-inch four-cylinder used 3.73 and AMC V8 304-powered models (produced 1976-1981, which became part of the Golden Eagle version) used the 3.55 ratio axles.

A diesel-powered version was made in the Ohio factory for export only. The engines were provided by General Motors, the owners of Isuzu Motor Cars. Production of this diesel version was between 1980 and 1982. This model had the Isuzu C240 engine, T176 transmission, and Dana 300 transfer case, although reports of some being produced with the Dana 20 exist. Typically, they had 4.1-ratio, narrow-track axles.

From 1976 to 1980, the CJ-7 came equipped with a Dana 20 transfer case, Dana 30 front axle (27- or 31-spline), and a 29-spline AMC 20 rear axle, while later years, Laredo packages added tachometer, chrome bumpers, tow hooks, and interior upgrades including leather seats and clock. In 1980, the Laredo was first fitted with an AMC 20 rear axle until mid-1986, when it was equipped with a Dana 44, and all 1980 and newer CJ-7s came with the Dana 300 transfer case.

The Canadian Army took delivery of 195 militarized versions of the CJ-7 in 1985. These were put into service as a stop-gap measure between the retirement of the M38A1 and the introduction of the [[Volkswagen Iltis|Bombardier Iltis]]. They were codified by the Canadian Forces with the Equipment Configuration Code number 121526.

The CJ-7 continues to be used in the sport of mud racing, with either the stock body or a fiberglass replica. CJ-7 has been successfully and widely used as a favorite for rock crawling, through simple and complex modification. These last Jeeps produced were also highlighted with a factory dash plaque that read, "Last of a Great Breed - This collectors-edition CJ ends an era that began with the legendary Jeep of World War II".

During its 11 years, the CJ-7 had various common trim packages:
*1976-1986 '''Renegade''' (2.4D L6-2.5-4.2-5.0 AMC 304 V8)
*1976-1980 '''Golden Eagle''' (5.0 AMC 304 V8)

Jeep also produced two special edition CJ-7 packages:

The Jamboree is in the same production rarity class as the 1971 CJ-5 Renegade-II. It is the most heavily optioned CJ ever built; it was the Rubicon of its day.

The Jeep Scrambler ''' CJ-8 ''' was a long-wheelbase version of the [[Jeep CJ-7|CJ-7]], introduced in 1981 and manufactured through 1986. It featured a {{convert|103.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} wheelbase&lt;ref name=JKCwb&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.morris4x4center.com/jeep-knowledge-center/cat/knowledge-base/post/jeep-vehicle-wheelbase-chart.htm|title=Jeep Vehicle Wheelbase Chart|author=|date=|website=morris4x4center.com|access-date=2017-12-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215000528/https://www.morris4x4center.com/jeep-knowledge-center/cat/knowledge-base/post/jeep-vehicle-wheelbase-chart.htm|archive-date=2017-12-15|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a removable half cab, creating a small pick-up style box instead of using a separate pickup bed. CJ-8s used the traditional transfer case with manual front [[locking hubs]] to engage the four-wheel drive. Most had either a four- or five-speed manual transmission, but a three-speed automatic transmission was an option.

The term "Scrambler" comes from an appearance package with which many CJ-8s were equipped, which included tape graphics and special wheels. Former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] owned a Scrambler "CJ-8" and used it on his California ranch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://raysjeeps.net/president-reagan/ |title=President Reagan |work=Ray's Jeeps |year=2005 |accessdate=6 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220093717/http://raysjeeps.net/president-reagan/ |archive-date=20 February 2016 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A full-length steel hardtop CJ-8 was made for the Alaskan Postal Service, using right-hand drive and automatic transmissions. Instead of the rear tailgate, the steel hardtop used a hinged barn-door opening to the back. Only 230 were produced and sold in the U.S. It was also widely sold in Venezuela and Australia as the CJ8 Overlander, with small differences, including full-length rear windows on the Overlander.&lt;ref&gt;Jeep Overlander CJ-8 Specifications and Dimensions. Jeep Australia press release, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Steel hardtops used on these postal Scramblers and Overlanders were known as "World Cab" tops.&lt;ref&gt;CJ10 technical manual&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jeep CJ-10 was a CJ-bodied [[pickup truck]] based on a heavily modified [[Jeep J-Series|Jeep J10]] pickup truck.&lt;ref name="CJ-10"/&gt; Produced from 1981 to 1985, it was sold and designed for export markets, [[Australia]] in particular.&lt;ref name="CJ-10"/&gt; They featured rectangular headlights mounted in the fenders and a ten-slot grille, where all other CJ Jeeps had a seven-slot grille. The CJ-10 could have either a hard or soft top. The truck could be equipped to handle either a {{convert|5900|lb|kg|abbr=on}} or {{convert|6700|lb|kg|abbr=on}} [[Gross vehicle weight rating|GVW]]. Three engines were offered; a {{convert|198|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} six-cylinder [[Nissan]]-built diesel engine, a {{convert|151|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} four-cylinder AMC-built engine, or a {{convert|258|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} six-cylinder AMC-built engine. The driveline was largely from the larger J series pickups, consisting of either a four-speed [[Tremec]] T177 manual transmission or a three-speed [[TorqueFlite]] A727 automatic transmission, a [[AMC and Jeep transmissions#New Process/New Venture|New Process 208]] transfer case, a semi-floating [[Dana 44]] front differential, and either a semi-floating Dana 44 or [[Dana 60]] rear differential, depending on GVW rating.&lt;ref name="CJ-10"/&gt; Importation of the CJ-10 into Australia ended in 1985 with the drop of the [[Australian dollar#Value of the Australian dollar|Australian dollar's value]], causing the vehicle to be significantly more costly than its competitors.&lt;ref name="CJ-10"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allen |first=Jim |title=The Elusive Jeep CJ-10 |url=http://www.fourwheeler.com/featuredvehicles/129_1210_the_elusive_jeep_cj_10/ |journal=Four Wheeler |date=October 2012 |accessdate=5 April 2013 |authorlink=Jim Allen (4x4 writer) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203135826/http://www.fourwheeler.com/featuredvehicles/129_1210_the_elusive_jeep_cj_10/ |archive-date=3 February 2013 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jeep Forward Control''' is a [[truck]] that was produced by [[Kaiser Jeep|Willys Motors]], later named Kaiser Jeep, from 1956 to 1965. It was also assembled in other international markets. The layout featured a [[cab over]] (forward control) design. 

The Forward Control models were primarily marketed as work vehicles for corporate, municipal, military, as well as civilian use. Regular pickup box beds were standard, but customers were offered a large number of "Jeep approved" specialized bodies from outside suppliers. These ranged from simple flatbeds to complete [[tow truck]]s, [[dump truck]]s, and [[fire truck]]s. The vehicles were also manufactured under license in India and Spain.

== Design ==
Willys produced utility vehicles that remained almost unchanged since 1947. As the marketplace grew more competitive in the 1950s, management developed a new range of modern cab and body trucks. Independent designer that was contracted by Willys since the 1940s, [[Brooks Stevens]], used styling cues from full-size cab-over-engine trucks for this new futuristic-looking space-efficient vehicle with the center grille panel made to imitate the classic seven-slot Jeep design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster |first=Patrick |title=The Story of Jeep|year=2004 |publisher=Krause Publications |isbn=9780873497350 |page=101 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpdUEVGU2toC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=Brooks+Stevens+Jeep+forward+control |accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unconventional forward control layout and "helicopter look" of the cab was too unusual for mainstream buyers during that era, but they were successful in specialty markets that included airport service vehicles, tow trucks, and railroad crew trucks that could ride the rails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster |first=Patrick R. |title=Jeep: The History of America's Greatest Vehicle |year=2014 |publisher=Motorbooks |isbn=9780760345856 |page=68 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EwWpAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=Jeep+Forward+Control+helicopter+look+too+unusual+for+mainstream |accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous versions of the Forward Control Jeeps were manufactured for general and specialized applications with 1957 being the top production with almost 10,000 vehicles built that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adamson |first=Glenn |author2=Milwaukee Art Museum |title=Industrial strength design: how Brooks Stevens shaped your world |year=2003 |publisher=Milwaukee Art Museum |isbn=9780262012072 |page=115 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7M5TAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Jeep.+A+wide+variety+of+these+cab-over-engine+vehicles+were+produced+1957+almost+ten+thousand |accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Engineering was based on existing [[Jeep CJ|CJ-5]]. Power came from the [[Willys Hurricane engine|Hurricane]] F-head and L-head 4-cylinder engines. The updates in 1958 on both the FC-150 and 170 versions had attained a goal established by Willys engineers to design a versatile commercial vehicle in which the ratio of the vehicle's [[curb weight]] to its [[payload]] was 1 to 1.&lt;ref name="SAE-1958"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jeep Forward Control|journal=The SAE Journal |date=1958 |volume=66 |page=93 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=80FKAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Jeep+FC+150+and+170,+have+attained+a+goal+established+a+number+of+years+ago+by+Willys+engineers:+a+versatile+commercial+vehicle+in+which+the+ratio+of+curb+weight+of+the+vehicle+to+pay+load+is+1+to+1.+This+is+believed+to+be+the+lowest+ratio+in+the+U.+S.+truck+industry+today+for+a+standard+light-duty+commercial+vehicle |publisher=Society of Automotive Engineers |accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[SAE International|Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE), this was regarded as the lowest ratio offered by domestic manufacturers at that time within the standard light-duty commercial vehicle segment.&lt;ref name="SAE-1958"/&gt; The FC layout offered advantages including a short turning radius and large cargo bed size given the compact overall length.

Proposals included a "Forward Control Commuter" design that may have been among the earliest [[minivan]]-type vehicles. Three operational [[concept car]]s were built by [[:de:Stuttgarter Karosseriewerk Reutter|Reutter]] in [[Stuttgart]], West Germany. [[Brooks Stevens]] was also involved in the transformation of this truck platform into a passenger vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefcconnection.com/the_commuter.htm The Commuter], retrieved on August 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== FC-150 ==
[[File:Willys FC150 Truck 1963.jpg|thumb|FC-150 in Sweden]]

Introduced in 1956, FC-150 models were based on the CJ-5 with its {{convert|81|in|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} wheelbase, but featuring a {{convert|78|in|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} long cargo box. This was a record-breaking six-foot length (with the tailgate up) load bed on a vehicle whose total {{convert|147.5|in|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} length was two inches shorter than the diminutive two-seat [[Nash Metropolitan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New Forward Control design |journal=The Saturday Evening Post |date=November 1956 |volume=229 |page=39 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3foeAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=FC+150+Forward+Control+design+puts+a+record-breaking+74%22+pickup+box+on+an+81%22+wheelbase |accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="How1957"&gt;{{cite web|author=Auto editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1957-1965 Jeep |url= https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1957-1965-jeep1.htm |website=HowStuffWorks |date=21 August 2007 |accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rugged design and go-anywhere capability included a claim that the FC could climb grades of up to 60% and reviews by ''[[Mechanix Illustrated]]'' highlighted the vehicle's toughness and surefootedness. &lt;ref name="How1957"/&gt;

In 1958, the FC-150 received a new, wider chassis. Its track was widened from {{convert|48|in|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} to {{convert|57|in|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}. A 1958 FC-150 concept featured an {{convert|83.5|in|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} wheelbase, a widened track (which made production), and the new T-98 4-speed manual transmission. This model had a gross weight of {{convert|5000|lb|kg|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}.&lt;ref name="thefcconnection.com"&gt;[http://www.thefcconnection.com/willys_engineering_design_concepts.htm 1958 Product Engineering Design Concepts]&lt;/ref&gt;

Introduced in 1957, FC-170 models had a {{convert|103|in|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} wheelbase with a {{convert|108|in|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} bed. This was achieved by the forward-control layout. A 1958 concept version of the FC-170 featured a {{convert|108|in|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} wheelbase. This was required to accommodate a new {{convert|272|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine (based on the [[Ford Y-block engine|Ford Y-block]]) with a new transfer case. A new 3-speed automatic transmission (based on the Ford [[Cruise-O-Matic]]) was only available with the inline-6 due to possible driveshaft angle issues. A T-98 4-speed manual was available with both engines. This model had a gross weight of {{convert|7000|lb|kg|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}.&lt;ref name="thefcconnection.com"/&gt;

== FC-170 DRW ==

This is a {{convert|1|ST|t|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} dual-wheeled rear axle (dually) model with a {{convert|120|in|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} load bed. These models have gross weights of {{convert|8000|lb|kg|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} or {{convert|9000|lb|kg|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}.

== FC-180 ==

The FC-180 was shown in concept form on paper in a 1957 Willys company brochure titled "1958 Projects - Product Engineering". It was essentially a lengthened FC-170 DRW (wheelbase increased from 103 in to 123.5 in). Features included a 150 in flatbed, the {{convert|226|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} "Super Hurricane" inline-6 or the {{convert|272|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 as available engines, and the T-98 4-speed manual or 3-speed automatic as available transmissions. This model had a gross weight of {{convert|10000|lb|kg|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}.&lt;ref name="thefcconnection.com"/&gt;

== FC-190 ==

The FC-190 was also shown in concept form in 1957. It featured a {{convert|150|in|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} wheelbase, a {{convert|202|in|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} flat bed and tandem dually axles. The T-98 manual transmission was standard with the automatic as an option. No six-cylinder option was offered; standard was the {{convert|272|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8. The FC-190 would use components from the FC-170 and FC-180 to keep costs down. This model had a gross weight of {{convert|16000|lb|kg|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}.&lt;ref name="thefcconnection.com"/&gt;

== Production ==

The FC Jeeps were exhibited to Jeep [[Car dealership|dealers]] in a closed-circuit telecast on November 29, 1956, and were on display for the public at the December 1956 National Automobile Show in [[New York City]]. The FC-150 went on sale at dealer showrooms on December 12, 1956. The initial response to the four-wheel drive FC Jeeps was favorable. Their best sales year came in 1957, when 9,738 trucks were sold. After the introduction of the FC-170 in 1957, FC-150 sales dropped to 1,546 units in 1959, before rebounding to 4,925 in 1960. 

Brooks Stevens made a rendering around 1960 for a possible facelift for the FC-series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Strohl |first=Daniel |title=Wide-Trac, en Espanol?|url= https://www.hemmings.com/blog/2011/08/22/wide-trac-en-espanol/ |publisher=Hemmings |date=22 August 2011 |accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FC models did not become the big sellers that Willys had hoped. Total production in nine years was just over 30,000 units. The FC line was discontinued in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carlislemediasite.com/content.asp?ArticleID=48 Dieffenbach, Mike.

== Military variants ==
Four dedicated military variants of the FC-170 were manufactured for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, under a 1964 contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Willys Forward Control Military Trucks |url= http://olive-drab.com/idphoto/id_photos_willys_fc.php |website=Olive Drab |accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History &amp; General Information |url= http://www.thefcconnection.com/history_&amp;_general_information.htm |website=The FC Connection |accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production is estimated to have been between 400 and 700 units, mostly the M677 four-door pickups.&lt;ref name=AllenFC/&gt; A 1963 analysis done by Jeep, concluded that the militarized FC-170s compared favorably to the aging [[Dodge M37]], at least for ''behind'' the front-line service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thefcconnection.com/Military%20History%20&amp;%20Info/Military%20History%20&amp;%20Info/Comparison%20Study...%20%20FC170%20Cerlist%20Pickup%20vs.%20M37.pdf Comparison Study... FC170 Cerlist Pickup vs. M37.pdf], Kaiser Jeep Corporation, 1 May 1963&lt;/ref&gt; The XM-676 prototype had a 50% larger cargo cube, could carry 12 troops in the back instead of eight in the M-37, had a 700-pound greater load rating, and yielded more than twice the mileage, but Jeep was likely more focused on landing the contract for the [[Kaiser Jeep M715|M-715 trucks]] that replaced the M-37.&lt;ref name=AllenFC/&gt;

The official operator's and service manuals were written and published by Kaiser Jeep – not by the army. The general government description of the vehicles was ''''Jeep' Truck, Diesel engine, 7000-pound GVW, 4x4''', with the variants named: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title='Jeep' Truck, Diesel engine, 7000-pound GVW, 4x4 &lt;small&gt;(SM-1020)&lt;/small&gt; |url=http://thefcconnection.com/Military%20History%20&amp;%20Info/Military%20History%20&amp;%20Info/Jeep%20M677%20Service%20manual%20.pdf |location=[[Toledo, Ohio]] |publisher=[[Kaiser Jeep]] Corporation |page=1 |date=May 1964 |work=Service Manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''M676 Truck, Cargo Pickup''' — a modified version of the commercial FC-170 pickup
* '''M677 Truck, Cargo Pickup w/4 Dr. Cab''' — a four-door crew-cab pickup with a canopy over the bed
* '''M678 Truck, Carry All''' — a van-body FC-170 with windows, and three cabin doors,  and
* '''M679 Truck, Ambulance''' — a van-body FC-170 with two cabin doors and no further sidewindows, fitted as an ambulance

There were notable mechanical differences with the civilian market vehicles. First of all, the [[Marines|Marine Corps]] variants of the FC-170s were powered by a different engine – a Cerlist {{convert|85|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} three-cylinder {{convert|170|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} two-stroke diesel. The engine was mated with a three-speed T-90A transmission and a model 18 transfer case. Other changes included a reinforced frame, 24-volt electrical system, as well as limited-slip Spicer 44 front and Spicer 53 rear axles.&lt;ref name=AllenFC&gt;{{cite web|last=Allen |first=Jim |title=Forward Control 101: The M-Series |url= http://www.fourwheeler.com/features/1611-forward-control-101-the-m-series/ |website=Four Wheeler |date=28 November 2016 |accessdate=2 March 2018 |authorlink=Jim Allen (4x4 writer)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foreign market models==
&lt;!-- FAIR USE of Jeep FC-160 CowlAndChassis.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jeep FC-160 CowlAndChassis.jpg for rationale --&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Jeep FC-160 CowlAndChassis.jpg|thumb|right|c.1970s domestic market in India cowl &amp; chassis FC-160]] --&gt;

Numerous versions of FC models (most not available in the domestic market) were manufactured in many other nations under collaboration agreements with successive owners of Jeep: [[Willys|Willys-Overland]], [[Kaiser Jeep]], and [[American Motors Corporation]] (AMC).

=== India ===
[[File:Mahindra FJ-470 (or 460) mini bus in Madurai.jpg|thumb|Mahindra FJ-470 or 460 with a mini bus body]]

[[Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Limited]] in Bombay ([[Mumbai]]), India began its vehicle business in 1947 by assembling [[complete knock down]] (CKD) Jeeps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mahindra.com/Heritage/History.htmll Official Mahindra history], retrieved on October 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It started FC-150 production in [[India]] in 1965 and later expanded the model range for the [[domestic market]] to include the FC-170, as well as its own intermediate sized FC-160.

The FC-160 (and later FJ-160) uses a {{convert|93|in|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} wheelbase. The pick-up box was by Mahindra and other bodies were available. The "[[Cowling|cowl]] and [[chassis]] only" FC-160 model was popular during the 1970 s for conversion into [[Minibus|mini-buses]], [[ambulance]]s, and other vehicles. Most have the basic front face of the FC. Manufacture of the Mahindra FC-160 pickup truck ended in the summer of 1999.

The FC-260 Diesel light truck was introduced in 1975. Currently, Mahindra's four-wheel drive FJ-460 (introduced in 1983) and two-wheel drive FJ-470 van or mini-bus vehicles retain the grille arrangement of the original Forward Control. These vehicles can accommodate from 11 to 15 passengers plus the driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://jeepfc.www5.50megs.com/fc160/fc-160.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070701084304/http://jeepfc.www5.50megs.com/fc160/fc-160.htm | title = Forward Control 160? | archivedate = 2007-07-01 | work = The Jeep Forward Control Page | last = Hornberger | first = Daniel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|es:Jeep-Viasa SV-430}}

In the 1960s, Kaiser-Willys licensed [[Vehículos Industriales y Agrícolas, S.A|Vehículos Industriales y Agrícolas]] (VIASA) of Zaragoza in Aragon to build Jeeps in [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4TIikXGZdcEC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=The+third+company,+VIASA+made+jeeps+under+licence+from+American+Motors |title=The Multinational Motor Industry |first=George |last=Maxcy |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2013 |isbn= 9780415657662 |accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1970, the "SV" line of commercial trucks were built using the Commando 4x4 Jeep chassis, just like the FC models in the United States.&lt;ref name="LosJeeps"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://cj3b.info/World/Spain.html |title=Los Jeeps: Made in Spain |first=Derek |last=Redmond |publisher=The CJ3B Page |date=12 February 2009 |accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] models were unlike any Jeeps produced anywhere else and featured indigenously developed body designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpdUEVGU2toC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=In+Spain,+Vehiculos+Industriales+Y+Agricolas+(V.I.A.S.A.)+built+unique |page=15 |title=The Story of Jeep |first=Patrick R. |last=Foster |publisher=Krause Publications |year=2004 |isbn=9780873497350 |edition=Second |accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SV line included the Campeador (one-ton pickup), Duplex (double cab pickup), Furgon (one-ton van), and the Toledo (9-seat luxury passenger van).&lt;ref name="LosJeeps"/&gt; Two engines were available: the [[Willys Hurricane engine|Super Hurricane]] in-line six petrol and a [[List of Perkins engines|Perkins]] 4-cylinder [[Diesel engine|diesel]].&lt;ref name="LosJeeps"/&gt;

During the late 1970s, VIASA was absorbed by [[Ebro trucks]], a division of Motor Ibérica. Production of the full SV line continued until 1985, which also included versions for the Spanish army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cossard |first=Hubert |title=Viasa et Ebro Jeep SV 1970-1985 |url= http://www.cherokee-fr.com/~jeepfamily/Europe/Espagne/SV/EbroSV.htm| website=www.cherokee-fr.com |date=30 September 2010 |language=fr |accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nissan took complete control of Ebro in 1987 and the company was named Nissan Motor Ibérica.

== Wide-track concept ==

Kaiser contracted [[Crown Coach Corporation]], a bus manufacturer, to build a "Wide-Trac" forward control [[concept car]] that combines elements of the original Jeep FC trucks, the VIASA SV pickup, and Brooks Stevens' 1960 proposed facelift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Strohl |first=Daniel |title=Kaiser’s Crown (-built Jeep) |url= https://www.hemmings.com/blog/index.php/2011/06/28/kaisers-crown-built-jeep/ |publisher=Hemmings |date=28 June 2011 |accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jeep Patriot''' (MK74) is a front-engine five-door [[compact SUV|compact]] [[crossover SUV]] manufactured and marketed by [[Jeep]], having debuted with the [[Jeep Compass]] in April 2006 at the [[New York Auto Show#2007|New York Auto Show]] for the 2007 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor-last=Fritz |editor-first=Dariene |title=Jeep 4x4 Capability – Patriot |journal=Automotive Engineering International |date=2007|volume=115 |issue=5 |pages=34–36 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=V1xKAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=2007+Jeep+Patriot |publisher=SAE International |accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both cars, as well as [[Dodge Caliber]] shared the [[Mitsubishi GS platform|GS platform]], differentiated by their styling and marketing, with the Patriot exclusively offering a four-wheel drive system, marketed as Freedom Drive II.

The Patriot was manufactured at [[Chrysler]]'s [[Belvidere, Illinois]] assembly plant alongside the Compass.&lt;ref name="worldcarfans.com"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/10612215415/all-new-2007-jeep-patriot-production-launched |title=All-new 2007 Jeep Patriot Production Launched |date=21 December 2006 |publisher=worldcarfans.com |accessdate=24 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201151249/http://www.worldcarfans.com/10612215415/all-new-2007-jeep-patriot-production-launched |archivedate=1 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the model was still selling well even as it was essentially unchanged as it entered its 11th model year, production ended with the 2017 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wendler |first=Andrew |title=Jeep Patriot Reviews |url= https://www.caranddriver.com/jeep/patriot |publisher=Car and Driver |accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Jeep Patriot black rr.jpg|thumb|right|Pre-facelift Jeep Patriot Limited (Europe)]]
[[File:Jeep Patriot interior.jpg|thumb|right|Interior]]
In the U.S. the Patriot uses either the 2.0&amp;nbsp;L or 2.4&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Chrysler World engine|World]]'' gasoline [[Straight-4|I4]] engine. Both front-wheel drive and [[four-wheel drive]] are available. The Patriot features two four-wheel drive systems both of which are electronically controlled. The basic four-wheel drive system is called [[Freedom Drive I]]. This system is a full-time front-wheel-drive based 4WD/AWD system that is front-wheel-drive when it has traction, but can automatically put up to 50% power to the rear wheels, the ECC (Electronically controlled clutch located on the rear differential)can be locked in 50–50 below a certain speed. This "locking" isn't a true lock and just requests the ECC be locked more than in the regular AWD mode.  The ECC clutch is pulsed during turns to avoid the system from binding the drivetrain. The other system, called [[Freedom Drive II]], is based on Freedom Drive I, but by using the vehicle's [[continuously variable transmission|CVT]] transmission it is capable of a 19:1 gear reduction simulating a low range usually found in vehicles with dedicated transfer cases.  This 19:1 "crawl" ratio is achieved with a much lower (numerically higher) rear differential gear compared to non Freedom Drive II vehicles.  The 2.4&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Global Engine Manufacturing Alliance|GEMA]]'' [[straight-4|I4]] is an option for the 4X2 model Patriot.

For Europe and Australia, a 2.0&amp;nbsp;L (1968 cc; 120 cid; 140ps) [[Volkswagen]]-manufactured [[diesel engine]] is fitted along with a 6-speed manual gearbox. All EU cars are fitted as standard with four wheel drive and a version of the Freedom Drive System that tuned differently from the U.S. versions, but with similar capability to FDII with brake traction control and three switchable electronic stability control and traction control settings for on or off-road use.

The Patriot won 2007 Green 4x4 Award and the 2008 4x4 of the Year in the UK.

The Patriot uses a [[continuously variable transmission]] equipped with a [[Jeep four wheel drive systems#Freedom Drive|four wheel drive system]], marketed as Freedom Drive II, capable of holding the lowest ratio the CVT can reach, in lieu of a traditional two-speed transfer case. The Patriot carries Jeep's "Trail Rated" badging.

==Electric version==
At the 2009 [[North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]], the Jeep Patriot was added to Chrysler's [[Envi (automobile)|ENVI]] lineup. As with the previously announced Jeep Wrangler EV, the Jeep Patriot EV is an [[Range-extended vehicle|extended-range electric vehicle]] (EREV, also called a [[plug-in hybrid vehicle]]),  capable of traveling {{convert|40|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} solely on battery power and up to {{convert|400|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} on a single tank of gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://jalopnik.com/5128342/jeep-patriot-ev-a-conceptual-electric-missile-from-chrysler |title=Jeep Patriot EV: A Conceptual Electric Missile From Chrysler |first=Matt |last=Hardigree |publisher=Jalopnik |date=10 January 2009 |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Chrysler's new partner [[Fiat SpA]] disbanded the ENVI division in November 2009, and removed the three ENVI models from its 5-year plan for Chrysler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-BusinessofGreen/idUSTRE5A605N20091107 |title=Chrysler dismantles electric car plans under Fiat |first=Kevin |last=Kroliki |date=6 November 2009 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been no announced plans to continue with the electric version.

==2011 facelift==
[[File:2013 Jeep Patriot Sport (14260842071).jpg|thumb|left|2011 facelift]]
[[File:Jeep Patriot 2.2 CRD Limited (Facelift) – Heckansicht, 26. Juni 2011, Düsseldorf.jpg|thumb|right|2011 facelift]]
The Patriot received minor interior and exterior upgrades for 2011. The front fog lamps were shrunken and relocated, and the "Patriot" lettering on the rear bumper was removed and replaced with a more traditional rear bumper. Three trims were offered in the US: Sport, Latitude, and Limited (which replaced the earlier Latitude X). In Canada, North Edition replaced the Latitude trim with slightly different equipment.

In the EU, four trims were offered: Sport, Sport Plus, Limited, and an Overland version. In the EU market, the 2.0&amp;nbsp;L Volkswagen PD Diesel Engine was replaced by a 2.2&amp;nbsp;L Mercedes-Benz Twin-Cam Common Rail Diesel engine delivering {{convert|163|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

For 2011, a 70th Anniversary Edition model was offered to commemorate the Jeep history. It was based on the Sport model with special olive or beige interior colors, unique alloy wheels, a nine-speaker [[Boston Acoustics]] premium sound system with [[subwoofer]] and fold-down lift gate speakers, [[Sirius XM Radio]], a leather-wrapped [[steering wheel]], [[leather]] [[seats]], heated front seats, and other features. This model was available from May to October 2011.

For 2012 only, an Altitude Edition model, based on the Sport model, was offered. It featured a black leather upholstery, special black-finished alloy wheels, a nine-speaker sound system, Sirius XM Radio, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, heated front seats, and black-painted exterior accents. This model started production in May 2012, and was only available for a few months.

For the 2013 model year, a Freedom Edition model, based on the Sport model, was offered to commemorate Jeep's commitment to the [[U.S. Army]] and [[military]], as well to commemorate all of the [[soldiers]] who have served. It has a special [[star]] hood [[decal]], power leather seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, Sirius XM Radio, and dark-finished alloy wheels.  This model features Commando Green Metallic exterior paint that is not available on other 2013 Jeep Patriots.

The Jeep Patriot underwent many changes in trims or models for the 2014 model year; however, 2014 was the first model year that Freedom Drive 1 Patriots came with a Hyundai 6-speed automatic transmission instead of the CVT.

==Discontinuation==
2017 was the last year for the Patriot, but production was discontinued in December 2016 (with the remainder of the fleet marketed as "2017" and sold until stock depletion).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = It’s Official: Jeep Wrangler Pickup Is Coming in 2017|url = http://blog.caranddriver.com/its-official-jeep-wrangler-pickup-is-coming-in-2017/|website = blog.caranddriver.com|access-date = 2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Jeep confirms pickup; new SUV to be Patriot or Compass|url = http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/detroit-auto-show/2016/01/11/jeep-confirms-pickup-new-suv-patriot-compass/78648152/|website = Detroit News|access-date = 2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Patriot and first-generation Jeep Compass were replaced by second-generation Compass.

Two models were available, the FJ-3 and the longer FJ-3A. It came standard with the familiar Borg-Warner T-90 three-speed manual transmission. A Borg-Warner automatic was offered as an option.
Right-hand-drive FJ-3s were made for the U. S. Postal Service. Most of these had horizontal grille slats in contrast to the seven vertical slats found on standard models.

An FJ-6 model (based on the CJ-6) was introduced in 1965 for postal use, which was ultimately replaced by the FJ-8 &amp; FJ-9 introduced in 1975.

The  '''Jeep DJ''' (also known as the '''Dispatcher''') was a [[2WD|two-wheel-drive]] variant of the [[4WD|four-wheel drive]] [[Jeep CJ|CJ]] series. Production started in 1955 by [[Willys Motors|Willys]], which was renamed [[Kaiser Jeep]] in 1963. In 1970, [[American Motors]] (AMC) purchased Kaiser’s money-losing Jeep operations and established [[AM General]], a [[wholly owned subsidiary]] that built the DJ through 1983. 

==DJ-3A==
The DJ-3A was introduced in 1955. It used the body style of the older [[Jeep CJ#CJ-3A|CJ-3A]], along with the [[Willys Go Devil engine|L-134]] engine. Unlike the CJ-3A, it came with either a [[Manual transmission#Column-mounted shifter|column shift]] or floor shift three-speed Borg-Warner T-96 manual transmission. It was offered with many different body options including a soft top, hard top, or even a full van body. One model was a postal delivery vehicle with the driver's position on the right side for mail box delivery&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nNwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=af4kT9LXBIiKgwfB_Iy1Dw&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Jeep For Mail Carriers Mounts Steering Wheel on Right Side."] ''Popular Mechanics'', March 1954, p. 154, bottom of page.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1959, Willys introduced the '''Jeep Gala''' to the export markets and uses desiring the nimble size and open bodywork, but no need for four wheel-drive.&lt;ref name="statham57"&gt;{{cite book |page=[https://archive.org/details/jeepcolorhistory00stev/page/57 57] |url=https://archive.org/details/jeepcolorhistory00stev |url-access=registration |quote=jeep gala. |title=Jeep Color History |first=Steve |last=Statham |publisher=MBI Publishing |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7603-0636-9 |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model gained popularity as a "fun car" at [[resort]]s in [[Hawaii]], [[Mexico]], and islands in the [[Caribbean]] area. It was finished in pink, green, or blue and trimmed with matching white striped fabric, as well as with [[Fringe (trim)|fringe]] on its top.&lt;ref name="statham57"/&gt;

In fall of 1959, a similar model called the '''Jeep Surrey''' was introduced in the US market. The primary target market were resort hotels and vacation centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=102 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpdUEVGU2toC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=Jeep+Surrey |title=The Story of Jeep |first=Patrick R. |last=Foster |publisher=Krause Publications|year=2004 |isbn= 978-0-87349-735-0 |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also served as a low-cost rental vehicle for their guests. The Surrey came with a standard striped fabric top, as well as a matching fabric cover for what was advertised as a "[[Continental tire]] mount."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AnQiAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=jeep+surrey+Continental+tire |title=Pink Jeep (advertisement) |journal=The New Yorker |year=1959 |volume=35 |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DJ-5 and DJ-6==
The DJ-3A was replaced by the [[right hand drive]] DJ-5 '''Dispatcher 100''' in 1965. It was based on the [[Jeep CJ#CJ-5|CJ-5]] and used the [[Willys Hurricane engine|Hurricane]] and [[Buick V6 engine#Dauntless|Dauntless]] engines. A {{convert|20|in|0|adj=on}} longer [[wheelbase]] '''DJ-6''' model was built from 1965 to 1973 alongside the [[Jeep CJ#CJ-6|CJ-6]].

==DJ-5A through DJ-5M==
The DJ-5A was introduced in 1967, beginning the lettering system indicating changes within the series.

The DJ-5A (Kaiser Co.) used a standard CJ front end, with a four-cylinder [[Chevrolet Nova]] {{convert|153|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine and two-speed [[Powerglide]] automatic transmission, with a T-handle shifter located on the floor next to the driver's seat.  The main body was a single unit, resembling the earlier Jeep when equipped with the metal Extreme Cold Weather Enclosure hard top.  

The models used by the United States Post Office had right-hand drive (without power steering), and were built in a lighter, less durable design than the standard Jeep.  These changes included the use of C-channel frame rails (as opposed to the box rails of the CJ-5) and, while the hood was the same dimensions as (and interchangeable with) the CJ, it did not have the reinforced design of the original. Also, the standard configuration had only a driver's seat and a letter tray installed. This decreased curb weight, combined with different leaf springs than other models, allowed carrying more cargo weight behind the driver.

The metal side doors were also designed to slide open and closed, and could be locked open while driving.  They were supported by ball bearings, which ran in a channel just under the rain gutter, and a plastic retainer ran in a small channel along the body.  A worn, damaged or lost retainer would allow the door to swing outward, fail to engage the rubber stop on the rear bumper, and slide all of the way off of the channel (and the vehicle). A single, hinged rear door gave access from floor to the bottom of the hard top, and was the width of the open area between the wheel wells. 

There were no cutouts in the body for the rear wheels, which made tire changes more difficult, as even when the frame was jacked well off the ground, the axle did not fall enough for the tire to clear the body.  The DJ-5A used standard 15-inch passenger car tires, with no provision for carrying a spare.  While the front bumper was of the standard CJ design (though thinner and lighter than the original), the rear bumper was a unique design, a single stamped part which ran the full width of the vehicle.  At each end was a rubber stopper for the sliding doors.  The 10-gallon fuel tank was under the rear body, just ahead of the bumper.

In 1971, a unique five-slot grille without turn signals that was used only on postal Jeeps was introduced. The 1971 model actually has the grille extend past the front of the hood edge. This allowed more room for the [[AMC Straight-6 engine]] and radiator. Like the DJ-5A, while resembling the CJ series, these were built as a completely enclosed, [[rear-wheel drive]] vehicle, with sliding side doors (which could be opened while driving), and a swinging rear door. Most models only had the driver's seat and a mail tray where the second seat would normally be located. One improvement over earlier Jeeps was mounting the rear springs outside of the frame rails, thus providing greater stability for the vehicle with its top-heavy enclosed cargo area, especially at highway speeds. Most models were also equipped with a [[limited slip differential]] and a heavy-duty steering gearbox.  Other improvements include a vent in the roof and cut-outs around the rear tires.

AM General used a variety of powerplants during production. DJ production was ended in 1984 with the DJ-5M, which used the {{convert|150|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC straight-4 engine]].

==DJ-5E Electruck==
American Motors experimented with [[electric vehicle]]s and starting in 1974 mass-produced the DJ-5E, a rear-wheel drive electric delivery van, also known as the '''Electruck'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Department of the Interior and related agencies appropriations for 1979|year=1978|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Joq2AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=DJ-5E+Electruck&amp;dq=DJ-5E+Electruck|author1=Committee on Appropriations |author2=House of Representatives |author3=Ninety-fifth Congress |author4=second session |accessdate=26 December 2010|page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Similar in appearance and in most of its dimensions, the DJ-5E was powered by a set of two 27-volt lead-acid batteries with a 54-volt {{convert|30|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} compound wound DC motor with electronic regulation made by [[Gould Electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Automobile club d'Italia|title = World Cars 1977|publisher=Herald Books|year=1977|isbn= 978-0-910714-09-9 |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Postal Service purchased 352 vehicles for the use in cities with serious air pollution.&lt;ref name="hyde"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hyde |first=Charles K. |title=Storied Independent Automakers: Nash, Hudson, and American Motors|publisher=Wayne State University Press |year=2009 |page=222 |isbn=978-0-8143-3446-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PerGbKxOPZYC&amp;pg=PA222&amp;dq=DJ-5E+Electruck|accessdate=26 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Electruck was capable of cruising at {{convert|33|mph|abbr=on}} with a range of {{convert|29|mi|km|abbr=on}} with 20% of its battery power still remaining in reserve.&lt;ref name="hyde"/&gt;

The '''Jeep Commander''' XK and XH (export diesel) is a [[mid-size SUV]] that was manufactured from 2005 to 2010 by the [[Jeep]] division of the American manufacturer [[Chrysler]].

==Concept car==
Jeep exhibited a [[concept car]] named Commander during the 1999 [[auto show]] circuit. The concept featured an experimental [[direct methanol fuel cell]] that produced electricity to charge a [[nickel–metal hydride battery]] pack. Full-time four-wheel drive was by a severe duty electric motor on each axle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1999 Jeep Commander Concept Car |url= http://testdrivejunkie.com/1999-jeep-commander-concept-car/ |website=testdrivejunkie.com |accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suspension could be raised {{convert|4|in|mm|0}} for traversing off-road purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1999 Jeep Commander - Concepts |url= http://www.carstyling.ru/en/car/1999_jeep_commander/ |website=www.carstyling.ru |accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall styling influenced the development of the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK)|third-generation Grand Cherokee]] that was at that time six years away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster |first=Patrick |title=The Story of Jeep|date=2004|publisher=Krause Publications |isbn=9780873497350 |page=274 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpdUEVGU2toC&amp;pg=PA274&amp;dq=1999+Jeep+Commander+a+proposed+fuel-cell |accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nunez"/&gt; The concept car had the same height as production Grand Cherokees, but was about {{convert|8|in|mm|0}} wider. This allowed for an interior featuring an extra wide [[Center console (automobile)|center console]] in the front and three bucket seats in the second row. The Commander concept had no relation to the production SUV.&lt;ref name="Nunez"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nunez |first=Alex |title=Family Resemblance: Jeeps old &amp; new |url= https://www.autoblog.com/2006/11/23/family-resemblance-jeep-concepts-and-the-grand-cherokee/ |website=Autoblog |date=23 November 2006 |accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
The production version of the Jeep Commander (XK and the diesel-powered XH export version) debuted at the 2005 [[New York International Auto Show|New York Auto Show]] as a five- or seven-passenger counterpart to the third generation [[Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK)|Jeep Grand Cherokee]]. It was developed to target consumers who wanted a three-rows-of-seats SUV, but designed to be only two inches longer than the existing Grand Cherokee with its two-rows of seats as well as to be assembled on the same production line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2006-2010 Jeep Commander |url= https://www.allpar.com/model/jeep/commander.html |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It shared its [[unibody]] construction, independent [[Short long arms suspension|short/long arm]] front suspension and its [[multilink suspension|5-link]] [[live axle|live]] rear axle with the Grand Cherokee on which it was based. It featured an upright windshield and squared-off sides. Its stepped roof was disguised by the roof rack; a design similar to the [[GMC Envoy|GMC Envoy XL]] and [[Chevrolet TrailBlazer|Chevrolet TrailBlazer EXT]]. This allowed the second and third-row seats to be mounted higher than the first-row seats.

The optional ''Command View'' sunroof package  included a power front sunroof and two smaller sunroofs over the second row seats. The Commander also had an optional entertainment package which included a DVD player, {{convert|9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} TV, and [[backup camera]]. In Europe and certain other markets like Chile, South Africa, and South Korea, the Commander offered a [[V6 engine|V6]] [[Diesel engine]].

===Off-Road Capabilities===
The Commander was offered with three different four-wheel drive systems: [[Quadra-Trac I]], [[Quadra-Trac II]], and [[Quadra-Drive II]]. Quadra-Trac I was available on models equipped with the 3.7&amp;nbsp;L engine; it is a full-time system that requires no driver input. Quadra-Trac II was available on models equipped with a [[V8 engine|V8]] engine; it is a full-time system as well but adds a low range as well as a neutral position for towing. Quadra-Drive II expands on Quadra-Trac II by adding electronic [[limited slip differential]]s to the front and rear axles. When equipped with Quadra-Drive II, [[skid plate]]s for the fuel tank, front suspension, and transfer case were also added.

==Discontinuation==
The Jeep Commander was discontinued after the 2010 model year. Chrysler announced that the 2011 [[Dodge Durango]] would be its successor; which is produced alongside its platform mate the 2011 [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] at [[Jefferson North Assembly]] in [[Detroit, Michigan]]. Shortly after production ended, Chrysler CEO [[Sergio Marchionne]] said of the Commander, "That vehicle was unfit for human consumption. We sold some. But I don't know why people bought them."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.leftlanenews.com/marchionne-jeep-commander-was-unfit-for-human-consumption.html Marchionne: Jeep Commander was "unfit for human consumption"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[Jeep]] released a three-row concept vehicle based on the [[Jeep Cherokee (KL)]] platform for the Chinese market, called the '''[[Jeep]] Yuntu''', utilizing a plug-in gasoline/electric hybrid power train. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.motortrend.com/news/jeep-yuntu-concept-for-china-looks-to-the-future/&lt;/ref&gt;

A three-row version of the [[Jeep Cherokee (KL)]] with slightly altered styling was released exclusively for the Chinese market named the [[Jeep Grand Commander]]. While similar in size to the original Commander, the Grand Commander will offer four-cylinder power. It will not be sold in any other markets. &lt;ref&gt;https://auto.ndtv.com/news/jeep-launches-grand-commander-at-beijing-motor-show-1844466&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeep is currently planning a successor to the Commander for the North American market, which may be named the [[Jeep Wagoneer (SJ)|Jeep Grand Wagoneer]]. Based on the [[Ram 1500]] platform, the all-new vehicle will be built in [[Warren, Michigan]] and will share production with a possible [[Dodge Ramcharger]] successor as well. The all-new vehicle, which was first shown to [[Jeep]] dealerships at a dealership meeting in 2017, is due for release in 2019. &lt;ref&gt;https://5thgenrams.com/inside-ram-1500-dt-based-wagoneer-grand-wagoneer/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jeep SJ|SJ]] series '''Jeep Cherokee''' is a full-size [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]] that was produced from 1974 through 1983 by [[Jeep]]. It was based on the [[Jeep Wagoneer (SJ)|Wagoneer]] that was originally designed by [[Brooks Stevens]] in 1963.

== Development ==
The Cherokee was a redesigned reintroduction of a two-door body style, with a single fixed rear side window with an optional flip-out section. Previously, a two-door version had been available in the Jeep Wagoneer line from 1963 to 1967, although this had the same [[Pillar (car)|pillar]] and window configuration as the four-door Wagoneer.

The Cherokee was marketed as the "sporty" two-door variant of Jeep's [[station wagon]]. The term "Sport Utility Vehicle" appears for the first time in the 1974 Cherokee sales brochure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen |first=Jim |title=Jeep: Collector's Library |publisher=Motorbooks, MBI Publishing | date=2003 |page=168 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4ywrhvzRCsEC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=term+Sport+Utility+appears+for+the+first+time+1974 |isbn= 978-0-7603-1486-9 |authorlink=Jim Allen (4x4 writer)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180103154658/https://www.autopaper.com/images/2214/98959-02.jpg '74 Jeep brochure picture – Cherokee page (archived)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161219202409/http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/jeep/74jeep.html '74 Jeep Cherokee brochure – front (archived)]&lt;/ref&gt; A four-door was not added to the lineup until 1977. 

The initial, 1974 Cherokees were only available in the standard "narrow track" configuration as base models (Model 16), or top-of-the-line S models (Model 17).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Unofficial First-Year Cherokee Registry |url=http://www.ifsja.org/forums/vb/showthread.php?t=150372 |accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Later, the [[Car model#Trim levels|trim level]]s of the Cherokee included the S (Sport; 1974—), Chief (1976–1983), Golden Eagle (1978–1979), Golden Hawk, and Laredo (1980–1983).&lt;ref name=CCTOyears&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.classiccarstodayonline.com/2015/06/15/a-look-back-at-the-1963-1991-jeep-wagoneer-a-guide-to-year-to-year-changes-2/ |title=A look back at the 1963 – 1991 Jeep Wagoneer: a guide to year-to-year changes |access-date=2018-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708213534/http://www.classiccarstodayonline.com/2015/06/15/a-look-back-at-the-1963-1991-jeep-wagoneer-a-guide-to-year-to-year-changes-2/ |archive-date=2017-07-08 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Golden Eagle and Golden Hawk were graphics packages; the Laredo was more of an upholstery package. For the final year only, in 1983 a new “Pioneer” package was standard on the four-door and optional on the two-door. Cherokee Chief and Laredo packages were still available, but only on widewheel two-door models.&lt;ref name=CCTOyears/&gt;

== Performance ==
Engine choices consisted of [[AMC Straight-6 engine|AMC I6]] or [[AMC V8 engine|V8]] powerplants. When it was equipped with the net {{convert|215|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|401|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine]], it would outrun other 4x4s in its class, and, with 3.07:1 highway gearing, could reach speeds in excess of {{convert|100|mph|0|adj=off}} (early models had 120&amp;nbsp;mph speedometers). A range of AMC engines were offered: the {{convert|110|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|258|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} inline six-cylinder, a {{convert|175|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with two-barrel [[carburetor]], a {{convert|195|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} four-barrel 360, the {{convert|401|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, and even  a Zeitgeist/Peugeot turbo diesel, albeit very rare. The durable 401 had a forged crankshaft and forged connecting rods, in addition to the high nickel content block of the other AMC V8s. The 401 was discontinued at the end of 1978. After [[takeover|acquiring]] AMC in 1987, [[Chrysler]] kept the {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 in production until 1991 for the [[Jeep Wagoneer (SJ)|Jeep Grand Wagoneer]].

The SJ Cherokee - along with the Wagoneer and J-Truck - continues to hold the record for the largest engine ever offered in a Jeep, with the 401's displacement surpassing that of even the SRT-8 [[Grand Cherokee]]'s {{convert|392|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler Hemi Engine|Hemi]].

==Mechanicals==
A T-18/T-18a four-speed manual gearbox was standard for all years, while through 1979 the [[General Motors]]' [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] TH400, more commonly fitted to 3/4- and 1-ton trucks rather than SUVs, was optional. For comparison, GM’s own SUV, the [[Chevy Blazer]], used the TH350 automatic. After 1979, the TH400 was replaced by the [[Chrysler]] [[TorqueFlite]] 727.

A gear-driven [[AMC and Jeep transmissions#Dana 20|Dana 20 transfer case]] with 2.03:1 low range was standard with the manual gearbox (which had a much lower first gear of 6.3:1), while the TH400 automatics received the permanent four-wheel-drive [[Jeep four-wheel-drive systems|QuadraTrac]] system. The chain-driven, aluminum QuadraTrac was advanced at the time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} It included a vacuum-operated center differential lock. The [[transfer case]] was offset, allowing it to sit just above the frame to avoid obstacles, and the chain itself is larger than nearly any other.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} A test by ''Petersen's Complete Book of Four-Wheel Drive'' reported that the Cherokee was the only vehicle unable to be [[dynamometer|dynoed]] because the transfer case would not allow the rear wheels to spin, unlike the other full-time four-wheel-drive vehicles being tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1975 |page=98 |title=Petersen's Complete Book of Four-Wheel Drive |publisher=Petersen Publishing |isbn= 9780822700999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the off-road test, the same held true. This transfer case was also employed successfully in Baja races, for example by [[Roger Mears]] in the [[Baja 1000]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} A 2.57:1 low range was optional on QuadraTrac.

In 1976, the Cherokee Chief package was introduced. Aside from trim changes, this model received larger fenders and wider axles, allowing larger tires to be fitted to further improve off-road ability. Four-door models were not available with "wide-track" axles. The Golden Eagle package was introduced in 1979. It was the same as the Chief but had denim interior upholstery, gold painted steel wheels and distinctive exterior trim that included a large gold eagle decal on the hood. In 1980 the high end Laredo package was introduced.

[[Dana 44]] axles were used both in the front and the rear at least through 1979. Brake hardware was mostly General Motors equipment (sourced from the straight axle 1/2 ton 4x4 light duty truck and SUV line including the six lug rims), with disc brakes up front (optional on earlier models) and drum brakes in the rear.

All Cherokees had semi-elliptical leaf springs in the front and rear.

== International markets ==
The Cherokee was marketed in left and right hand drive countries (such as the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Australia]]). Main production of the Cherokee was in [[Toledo, Ohio]].

===Australia===
The SJ Cherokees were assembled in [[Brisbane]], Australia from 1981. The initial units were fully built imports that needed to be partly disassembled for right-hand-drive. Later Jeep Australia began full assembly of the SUV and J20 trucks from [[knock-down kit]]s.&lt;ref name="Australia4wd1"/&gt; Problems with spare parts, quality control, the limited capacity of the assembly plant (a maximum of 60 Cherokee/J20 vehicles per month), and lack of dealer support (many were multi-franchise stores so Jeeps were not their focus) were disadvantages to maintaining market share.&lt;ref name="Australia4wd1"/&gt;

Australian tariff regulations defined "real" 4x4 vehicles as having a separate frame and chassis construction and had a 25% duty and no quota restrictions, while vehicles with an integral chassis were classified as "cars" and subject to both an import quantity restriction and a 57.5% tax.&lt;ref name="Australia4wd1"/&gt; This meant that assembly of the SJ models continued even after the modern, [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|unibody XJ compact model]] had been introduced by AMC. All Cherokee assembly was discontinued in Australia by 1985, three years after the SJ had been replaced in the [[United States|U.S.]] by the XJ.

===Argentina===
In [[Argentina]], the Cherokee was manufactured by [[Industrias Kaiser Argentina]], who renamed the SUV the Jeep Gladiator.{{cn|I can find no evidence of anything but pickups and possibly panel vans being manufactured by IKA|date=February 2020}} It was offered with a single type of engine, the locally built [[Jeep Tornado engine|Tornado inline-six]], and was equipped with 3-speed manual transmission. Later Jeeps received an updated and more powerful version of this engine with seven main bearings, called the "Torino."

== Awards ==
In February 1974, the Jeep Cherokee was the first vehicle to earn ''Four Wheeler'' Magazine's "Achievement Award" that later became the annual "Four Wheeler of the Year" recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Perronne |first=Craig |title=40 Years Of Old Photos 4x4 Trucks &amp; Desert Racing 1960s-1990s - A Stroll Through the Images of the Past |publisher=Four Wheeler Magazine |date=June 2002 |url= http://www.fourwheeler.com/featuredvehicles/129_0206_40_year_old_photos_4x4_trucks_desert_racing/index.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101127062213/http://www.fourwheeler.com/featuredvehicles/129_0206_40_year_old_photos_4x4_trucks_desert_racing/index.html |archivedate=27 November 2010 |accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jeep Wagoneer''' is a [[Luxury vehicle|luxury]] 4x4 sold and produced for [[Jeep]] by several [[Automotive industry|automakers]] from 1962 to 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://photos.imageevent.com/mmm_mag/1966to1969superwagoneerregistry/UK%201969%20Jeep%20Super%20Wagoneer%20Classic%20American.pdf |last=Truesdell |first=Richard |title=Move Over, Range Rover |date=31 August 2004 |accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marketed as a [[station wagon]], the pioneering design created the luxury 4X4 niche and became known in time as a "[[sport utility vehicle]]" (SUV). The [[Four-wheel drive|4WD]] Wagoneer stayed in production for 29 model-years (1963–1991) with almost unchanged body-structure, making it the third longest-produced single generation car in U.S. automotive history.&lt;ref name="GrandWagoneerinR&amp;T"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Grand Wagoneer |journal=Road &amp; Track |year=1992 |volume=43 |page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was introduced in November 1962 for the 1963 model year as a successor to the [[Willys Jeep Station Wagon]] that had been built since 1946. Although sharing a pickup truck chassis (like its predecessor), the Wagoneer had a sophisticated station wagon body design, that was more carlike than any other 4x4 on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewin |first=Tony |last2=Borroff |first2=Ryan |title=How to Design Cars Like a Pro: A Comprehensive Guide to Car Design from the Top Professionals |publisher=MotorBooks/MBI Publishing |year=2003 |page=191 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GThBf3VpqsYC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;dq=Jeep+Wagoneer+created+a+whole+new+category |isbn=978-0-7603-1641-2 |accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with offerings from [[General Motors|GM]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[International Harvester]], and [[Land Rover]] — which were producing utilitarian work-oriented vehicles with spartan truck-like interiors — the Wagoneer's luxury set it apart. Together with the [[Jeep Gladiator|Gladiator Truck]], the revolutionary Wagoneer [[Jeep SJ|SJ platform]] sported an advanced [[overhead camshaft|overhead cam]] [[Jeep Tornado engine|straight-six engine]], and offered features unheard of at the time in any other mainstream 4WD vehicle, such as [[Independent suspension|independent front suspension]],&lt;ref name="BackwardGlances"/&gt; power steering, automatic transmission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/SUVs/jeep/wagoneer.html |title=The Icon: Jeep Wagoneer |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fourwheeler.com/features/0801-4wd-1963-jeep-wagoneer/ |first= Patrick |last=Foster r|title=1963 Jeep Wagoneer - Landmark Vehicle |date=1 January 2008 |publisher=Four Wheeler |accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a factory radio and optional air-conditioning.&lt;ref name=62brochure/&gt;

The Wagoneer made its debut seven years before Land Rover launched its [[Range Rover]] in Great Britain, 18 years before the 4-door, and 24 years before that upscale marque appeared in the US. It was replaced by the smaller [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]].

==Kaiser years==
With competition from the [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|"big three"]] automakers advancing on Jeep's four-wheel-drive market, Willys management decided that a new and more advanced vehicle was needed. Conceived in the early 1960s while [[Willys|Willys-Overland Motors]] was owned by [[Kaiser Jeep|Kaiser Jeep Corporation]], the Wagoneer replaced the original [[Willys Jeep Station Wagon]], originally introduced in July 1946 and in production until the 1964 model year.

Like its long-lived predecessor, the new 1963 Wagoneer took shape under industrial designer [[Brooks Stevens]], while Willys' engineering staff handled the technical development. To appeal more to a mainstream public, the Wagoneer got a relatively low stance and car-like manners. The skirt-friendly entry height was accomplished with a married transfer-case and a thoughtful design that tucked the running gear up tight. Careful suspension tuning gave it a good ride, but because it was still a truck at heart, it could haul and tow as needed.&lt;ref name="BackwardGlances"/&gt; Development took three years and cost around [[United States dollar|US$]]20 million.&lt;ref name=Just4x4mag&gt;{{cite web|url= http://home.off-road.com/~ozifsja/tech/history/hist_wag.htm |title=History of the Wagoneer (source: Just 4x4s Magazine) |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100127094750/http://home.off-road.com/~ozifsja/tech/history/hist_wag.htm |archivedate=27 January 2010 |accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCTOyears"/&gt;

===1963-1964===
[[File:1964 Jeep Grand Wagoneer (12670036305).jpg|thumb|Some early Wagoneers featured a tall, narrow front grille]]
The original Wagoneer was a full-size body-on-frame vehicle which shared its architecture with the [[Jeep Gladiator (SJ)|Jeep Gladiator]] [[pickup truck]]. At first, it offered many body types, suspension, and drivetrain options. Available as both two- or four-door wagons, the two-door could be had as a "[[Sedan Delivery|Panel Delivery]]" model with windowless sides behind the doors and double "barn doors" in the rear instead of the usual tailgate and roll-down rear window.

Early Wagoneers were powered by Willys' new "[[Jeep Tornado engine|Tornado]]" [[SOHC]] {{convert|230|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} six-cylinder engine, which had debuted in 1962 as an option for Jeep's previous Station Wagons. The engine developed {{convert|140|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and was noted for being quite fuel-efficient for its day. Both a 3-speed manual and automatic transmission were offered, each available with either 2WD rear-wheel-drive, or part-time four-wheel-drive without center differential, but with manually [[locking hubs|locking front hubs]].&lt;ref name="CCTOyears"/&gt; The [[Warn Industries|Warn]] hubs were utilized to engage or disengage the front wheels, to switch the drive-train between two-wheel or four-wheel drive mode.

Like on the original Willys Wagon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Donnelly |first=Jim |title=Willys' Wagon - 1962 Ruggedly designed, the 1962 Willys wagon was an exercise in simplicity |url= https://www.hemmings.com/magazine/hcc/2009/08/Willys--Wagon---1962/1858078.html |journal=Hemmings Classic Car |date=August 2009 |accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Arch |title=Jeep: The Unstoppable Legend|type= |year=1994 |publisher=Publications International |isbn= 0-7853-0870-9|lccn=94-66811 |chapter=Chapter Four – Postwar Plans for Willys: 1945-52 |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; independent front suspension instead of a rigid front axle was again offered to give the Wagoneer a more car-like ride and handling.&lt;ref name="BackwardGlances"/&gt; The original Wagoneer featured independent front suspension (IFS) as standard on the rear-wheel drive models and was optional on the four-wheel drive,&lt;ref name=62brochure/&gt; for either $135 &lt;ref name="BackwardGlances"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fourwheeler.com/features/1502-1963-jeep-wagoneer-custom-backward-glances/ |title=1963 Jeep Wagoneer Custom - Backward Glances |first=Jim |last=Allen |date=9 January 2015 |publisher=Four Wheeler |accessdate=15 May 2015|authorlink=Jim Allen (4x4 writer)}}&lt;/ref&gt; or $160.&lt;ref name=MotorTrend1963/&gt;&lt;ref name="CCTOyears"/&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Instead of the Wagon's "Planadyne" design, the Wagoneer's IFS used [[swing axle]]s and [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bar springs]], but they combined with short upper A-arms, tied into the torsion bars at their inner pivot points, such that the swing axles served as the lower control arms in a kind of [[double wishbone suspension]] design &lt;ref name="CCTOyears"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Jeep/1962_Jeep/1962_Jeep_Wagoneer_Brochure/1962%20Jeep%20Wagoneer-05.html |title=1962 Jeep Wagoneer brochure |page=5 |work=oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the axles are located fore and aft by control links.&lt;ref name=MotorTrend1963&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.motortrend.com/classic/roadtests/6303_willys_jeep_wagoneer_test/ |title=First Test: Willys Jeep Wagoneer - The Jeep Becomes A Gentleman: New Turnpike Engine and Country Club Look -- Same Old Backroad Dependability |first=Jim |last=Wright |date=March 1963 |journal=Motor Trend |accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the four-wheel-drives, the IFS replaced the standard Dana 27AF axle with a single, center-pivot front axle that allowed the Dana 27 differential to swing with the curb-side half.&lt;ref name=IFSdetail&gt;{{cite web|url= http://apicalnetworks.com/host/cars/jeep/fsj_ifs/wagoneer_ifs_1.jpg |title=Detail of the independent front suspension axle on a Jeep Wagoneer 4x4 |publisher=apicalnetworks.com |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140810215052/http://apicalnetworks.com/host/cars/jeep/fsj_ifs/wagoneer_ifs_1.jpg |archivedate=10 August 2014 |accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, all Wagoneers had 11-inch drum-brakes all-around; seat belts were optional, and the 4WD came with a standard compass.&lt;ref name=62brochure/&gt;&lt;ref name=62BrocSpecs/&gt; Front and rear [[power take-off]]s were available for heavy-duty utility applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Jeep/1962_Jeep/1962_Jeep_Wagoneer_Brochure/1962%20Jeep%20Wagoneer-07.html |title=1962 Jeep Wagoneer brochure |page=7 |work=oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after introduction of the Wagoneer, in early 1963, Willys Motors changed its name to [[Kaiser Jeep|"Kaiser Jeep Corporation"]].

1964 introduced factory-optional [[air conditioning]], as well as a lower-compression {{convert|133|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} Tornado engine, to remedy cooling problems and "pinging" at altitude the original had sometimes suffered. While it made less power, it returned greater economy, but this lower-compression version was phased out within a year.&lt;ref name="CCTOyears"/&gt;

===1965-1966===
As of 1965 all models came with a new standard safety package that included front and rear seat belts, a padded dash and high impact windshield, and a dual braking system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Jeep/1965%20Jeep/1965%20Jeep%20Full%20Line%20Brochure%20(R2)/image3.html|title=1965 Jeep full-line brochure |page=3 |accessdate=13 February 2018|publisher=oldcarbrochures.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late-year 1965 Wagoneers and [[Jeep Gladiator|Gladiator]] pickup trucks were available with the {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine]], which proved to be a popular option. Additionally, the Tornado engine was replaced by American Motors' {{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} OHV [[Straight-6|inline six]]. According to the automotive press this engine was smooth, powerful, reliable and easily maintained,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} but most likely it was cheaper.&lt;ref name="BackwardGlances"/&gt;

Although the independent front suspension was positively reviewed,&lt;ref name=MotorTrend1963/&gt; the option was not popular and was dropped from production, at least for the 4WD models, in 1965.&lt;ref name="BackwardGlances"/&gt;

====Super Wagoneer====
[[File:Superwagint.jpg|right|thumb|Super Wagoneer interior]]

The 1966 model year also saw the introduction of the more luxurious Super Wagoneer, identified by a new more modern looking full-width grille.&lt;ref name="CCTOyears"/&gt; Initially sporting a higher-performance {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} version of the AMC V8, fitted with a four-barrel carburetor. With comfort and convenience features not standard or even available on other vehicles of its type at the time - e.g. push-button radio, seven-position tilt steering wheel, ceiling courtesy lights, air conditioning, power tailgate, power brakes, power steering, and console-shifted [[Turbo-Hydramatic#Super Turbine 400 / THM400 / 3L80 / 3L80HD|TH400]] [[automatic transmission]] – the Super Wagoneer is now widely regarded as the precursor of today's luxury SUVs.

Production of the Super Wagoneer ended in 1969, and in total it is believed that 3,989 Super Wagoneers were produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://photos.imageevent.com/mmm_mag/1966to1969superwagoneerregistry/UK%201969%20Jeep%20Super%20Wagoneer%20Classic%20American.pdf |last=Truesdell |first=Richard |title=Move Over, Range Rover |date=31 August 2004 |accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1967-1971===
[[File:1976 Jeep SJ Wagoneer (21822043902).jpg|thumb|1967 or 1968 Wagoneer with 350 cubic inch V8 badge]]

Between 1967 and 1969, all rear-wheel drive only models, which the four-wheel drives had outsold from the beginning, were discontinued, and from then on all Wagoneers and Cherokees had solid axles and leaf-springs, both front and rear.&lt;ref name="CCTOyears"/&gt; At the end of 1968, the slow-selling two-door versions were also discontinued.

For 1968 through 1971, Wagoneers were powered by [[Buick]]’s {{convert|350|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|230|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#350|Dauntless]] V8. The Dauntless made less horsepower than the previous AMC V8 (230 hp vs. 250), but more [[torque]] at lower [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] ({{convert|350|ftlbf|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 2400 rpm versus {{convert|340|ftlbf|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 2600).

After the 1971 model year, Wagoneers were exclusively AMC powered.

In early 1970 AMC acquired Kaiser Jeep Corporation and began refining and upgrading the range. American Motors improved manufacturing efficiency and lowered costs by incorporating shared components such as engines. Reducing [[Noise, Vibration, and Harshness|noise, vibration, and harshness]] improved the Wagoneer driving experience. Visually, a big change was made during the 1970 model year, by replacing the metal grill with a new plastic grill with an egg crate pattern instead of vertical bars.&lt;ref name="CCTOyears"/&gt;

The 1971 model year included a special "X-coded" model finished in "golden lime" with unique wood-grain side panels, numerous convenience features and power assists, that was priced $1,000 more than the deluxe "custom" model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen |first=Jim |title =Jeep: Collector's Library |publisher=MBI Publishing |year=2004 |page=155 |isbn=978-0-7603-1979-6 |authorlink=Jim Allen (4x4 writer)}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1971, the outsourced Buick 350 was replaced by the {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|AMC V8]], and later the {{convert|401|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} was made available.

===1972-1983===
The innovative [[Quadra-Trac]] full-time four-wheel-drive system, which broadened the appeal of Jeep products to people who wanted four-wheel-drive traction without the inconvenience of a manual-shift [[transfer case]] and manual [[locking hubs]], was introduced in 1973.

In 1974 AMC redesigned the [[Greenhouse (car)|greenhouse]] of the defunct two-door Wagoneer, with much wider [[Pillar (car)|D-pillars]] and single, long rear side-windows, and reintroduced it as the [[Jeep Cherokee (SJ)|Cherokee]]. This replaced the [[Jeepster Commando]], whose sales had not met expectations despite an extensive 1972 revamp. The Cherokee appealed to a younger market than the Wagoneer, which was regarded as a family SUV.

Also in 1974, front disc brakes were introduced as standard equipment. While the new Cherokees still had 4-wheel drum brakes standard, front discs could be had as an option.&lt;ref name="CCTOyears"/&gt;

From 1976 all Wagoneer and Cherokee models received beefed up frames with stronger cross-members and boxed side rail construction.&lt;ref name="CCTOyears"/&gt;

After the introduction of the Cherokee, AMC began to move the Wagoneer upmarket, and that brought high demand from a new market segment. Midway through 1978 the "Limited" was introduced, more luxuriously equipped than the earlier Super Wagoneer, offering Quadra-Trac, power disk brakes, air conditioning, power-adjustable bucket seats, power door locks, power windows, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, leather upholstery, plush carpeting, AM/FM/CB radio, leather-wrapped steering wheel, roof rack, forged aluminum wheels, and "wood grain" trim on the body sides.&lt;ref name=Just4x4mag/&gt; The two-barrel, {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine]] was standard with a four-barrel, {{convert|401|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} available at extra cost. Even though the US$10,500 [[suggested retail price]] was in luxury [[Cadillac]] territory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PV1uzCfmJDgC&amp;lM |title=American Cars, 1973–1980: Every Model, Year by Year |first=J. Kelly |last=Flory, Jr. |year=2012 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786443529}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Limited's high-level specification attracted buyers and sales were strong with a total of 28,871 Wagoneers produced in 1978, and 27,437 in 1979.

On other SJ models there were few styling changes until 1979, when all Wagoneer, Cherokee and J Series pickup models received a substantial styling update with one piece aluminium bumpers and a new one-piece chrome plastic grille with a protruding middle section shaped somewhat like a pig's nose, horizontal slats and square headlights.&lt;ref name=Just4x4mag/&gt; This front end look that has become known as the "pig nose grill" would stay with Wagoneer models through 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://jalopnik.com/the-fascinatingly-cheap-way-jeep-restyled-the-jeep-wago-1826931827 |title=The Fascinatingly Cheap Way Jeep Restyled The Jeep Wagoneer For Nearly Three Decades |first=David |last=Tracy |website=Jalopnik |accessdate=16 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCTOyears"&gt;{{cite web |author=Sean |url=http://www.classiccarstodayonline.com/2015/06/15/a-look-back-at-the-1963-1991-jeep-wagoneer-a-guide-to-year-to-year-changes-2/ |title=A look back at the 1963 - 1991 Jeep Wagoneer: A guide to year-to-year changes |publisher=classiccarstodayonline.com |accessdate=13 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708213534/http://www.classiccarstodayonline.com/2015/06/15/a-look-back-at-the-1963-1991-jeep-wagoneer-a-guide-to-year-to-year-changes-2/ |archive-date=8 July 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the V8s the primary choice among Wagoneer buyers, the {{convert|258|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} six-cylinder engine was dropped in the 1970s, only to return as an option when Jeep sales – particularly of the high-volume Cherokee – were hit by the [[1979 energy crisis]]. (The Wagoneer continued to sell relatively well after production dropped to 10,481 in 1980, but increased to 13,741 in 1981, 18,709 in 1982, and 18,478 in 1983.) When reintroduced, the engine came with a [[manual transmission]] as standard equipment, but in 1983, automatic transmissions with [[Jeep four-wheel-drive systems|“Selec-Trac”]] four-wheel drive became standard. With this combination, the Wagoneer achieved [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] fuel-consumption estimates of {{convert|18|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} city and {{convert|25|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} highway – outstanding for a full-size SUV.&lt;ref name="auto.howstuffworks.com"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1963-1992-jeep-wagoneer-and-grand-wagoneer6.htm |title=1980-1989 Jeep Wagoneer |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |date=29 August 2007 |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed the company to advertise good fuel mileage, although the more powerful 360 V8 remained popular with certain buyers despite its greater thirst for fuel.

In 1981, the Wagoneer line was expanded to three models. The Custom Wagoneer was the basic model, yet it included a four-speed transmission, free-wheeling hubs, power steering and power front disc brakes, as well as passenger area carpeting. A new Brougham model added an upgraded interior trim that included woodgrain for the instrument cluster and horn cover, floor mats, power tailgate window, as well as the "convenience" and "light" packages. The Brougham's exterior included a thin side body scuff moulding with a narrow woodgrain insert, roof rack, as well as bright door and quarter window frames, and a lower tailgate moulding. The Wagoneer Limited was the top-of-the-line with standard Quadra-Trac, automatic transmission, air conditioning, tinted glass, power windows and door locks, cruise control, AM/FM stereo radio, extra quiet insulation, power six-way driver and passenger bucket seats with center armrest, upgraded door panels, leather-wrapped steering wheel, extra thick carpeting, and retractable cargo cover.

The basic "Custom" model was eliminated for 1983, and a new [[Selec-Trac]] system became standard equipment. A dash-mounted control allowed the driver to change between two- wheel and four-wheel drive. The switch activated a vacuum-activated spline clutch that was built into the transfer case that engaged the front axle assembly. A shift lever mounted on the side of the transmission hump allowed the driver to shift between four-high and four-low with the vehicle moving, although the transmission had to be shifted to neutral and the vehicle had to be moving at less than 5 miles per hour to accomplish this.

===1984: Grand Wagoneer===
[[File:Jeep Grand Wagoneer white Raeford-r.jpg|thumb|1984 to 1991 Grand Wagoneer tail-lights no longer wrapped around the rear corners, but used the type from the SJ-body Cherokee – narrow and vertical on the tailgate panel only]]

For 1984, AMC replaced the SJ-body Cherokee with the all-new, compact and more fuel-efficient [[Monocoque|unibody]] [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)]], and introduced an upscale version of the (XJ) known as the Wagoneer. The compact XJ Wagoneer was available in two trim levels: the "Wagoneer" and the "Wagoneer Limited". AMC originally intended for these vehicles to replace the SJ-body Wagoneer models but high demand prompted the company to keep the old SJ-body Wagoneer in production alongside them despite the fact the design, largely unchanged since 1962, was becoming increasingly antiquated.

The SJ-body Wagoneer line saw consolidation in 1984 with the end of the "Brougham" model, while the "Limited" was renamed the "Grand Wagoneer" to free up the "Wagoneer Limited" nameplate for the compact XJ Wagoneer. In mid-1984, AMC introduced a less expensive version called the Wagoneer "Custom", without the [[Woodie (car body style)|simulated woodgrain]] exterior. The Custom had steel wheels with hubcaps, standard equipment was pared down, and it had part-time four-wheel drive. Despite its lower price (US$15,995, about $3,000 less than the "Grand"), sales were poor, and it was dropped after 1984.&lt;br&gt;
Thus, at the end of 1984, production reached 20,019 with just one fully equipped version available. The Grand Wagoneer remained "the gold standard of the SUV market" and from 1985 it would continue in one version using the old SJ-body until the end of the Grand Wagoneer production under Chrysler.&lt;ref name="auto.howstuffworks.com"/&gt;

[[File:Jeep Grand Wagoneer snow blade int2.jpg|thumb|right|Grand Wagoneer interior]]

For the Mexican market, the Grand Wagoneer was built and distributed by [[Vehiculos Automotores Mexicanos]] , and was offered with the 282 CI engine.

An improved handling package was introduced in 1985 that incorporated a revised front sway bar, gas filled shock absorbers, and lower friction rear springs. A total of 17,814 Grand Wagoneers were built for 1985.

Starting in the 1986 model year, the Grand Wagoneer received a new four part front grille and a stand-up hood ornament. An updated audio system became a standard feature and a power sunroof installed by American Sunroof Corporation, became a factory option. However, the most significant change was the installation of a fully revamped interior including a new dashpad, new instrumentation, new door panel design, shorter nap cut-pile carpeting, new leather and corduroy seat cover designs and front seats that now featured adjustable headrests. Changes were made to the instrument panel that now featured square gauges, and contained an improved climate control system. The metal glove box door was also replaced with a plastic door featuring a woodgrain overlay. A new two-spoke steering wheel also included new stalks for the lights and wiper and washer controls on the column. The Selec-Trac driveline gained a new Trac-Lok limited slip differential to send power to the wheel with the best traction. There were 17,254 Grand Wagoneers built in 1986.
[[File:Jeep Wagoneer in Persia.JPG|thumb|Jeep Wagoneer (Ahoo), [[Iran]], Persian assembled]]

The last model year developed under AMC, 1987, was also the 25th anniversary of the Wagoneer design. Standard equipment included the {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine and self-sealing Michelin "Tru Seal" P235/75R 15 radial tires. The sound system included a new AM/FM electronically tuned stereo with Dolby cassette and four Jensen speakers. The exterior featured revised woodgrained sides in "marine teak" with new nameplates and V8 badges. On the inside were new tan or cordovan trims that replaced the honey and garnet colors, while the interior assist pulls on the door panels were removed. A combined 14,265 units were built by AMC and Chrysler for 1987.

Standard equipment for late Grand Wagoneers included:
* 15″ Michelin all-season whitewall radial tires
* 15″ alloy wheels
* AM/FM stereo with cassette player
* Four AccuSound by Jensen premium speakers
* Air conditioning and heater with manual controls
* Dual front power bucket seats
* Leather-wrapped two spoke steering wheel
* Leather and velour seating surfaces
* Digital quartz dashboard clock
* Full-size glove box
* Roof rack with roof rails
* Chrome front grille with hood ornament
* Front fog driving lamps
* Power windows and power door locks
* Adjustable tilt steering column
* Dual-note high-low-pitch horn
* Power rear hatch window
* Rear window defroster 
* Tinted windows 
* Faux wood body side vinyl wood appliques
* Cargo cover
* Overhead console with compass and thermometer (1989-1991)
* keyless entry (1989-1991)
* Rear window wiper/washer (1989-1991)

Optional equipment included:
* Towing package
* power Sunroof/moonroof

===1987-1991===
[[Chrysler]] bought out American Motors Corporation on 2 March 1987. At the time AMC was already working on designing a replacement for the antiquated SJ platform. Chrysler had other priorities, and although the [[Jeep Gladiator (SJ)|Jeep J-Series]] pickups that shared the SJ platform and directly competed with Chrysler's [[Dodge Ram]] pickups were discontinued in 1988, Chrysler left the Grand Wagoneer largely untouched over its first few years overseeing Jeep production, and even continued to build the model with the carbureted AMC V8 instead of its own (arguably, more modern) fuel-injected V8. Year-to-year changes were minimal. At the time of Chrysler's purchase, customer demand for the Grand Wagoneer continued to be steady, and it was a very profitable model generating approximately five to six thousand dollars on each unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dunne |first=Jim |title=What will Chrysler Do With All Those Chips? |journal=Popular Mechanics |volume=164 |issue=10 |page=54 |date=October 1987 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zOMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=What+Those+Chips+AMC+Wagoneer |accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1989–1991 model years are considered the "best of the breed" due to a number of upgrades. These include upgraded wood siding and modernized aluminum alloy wheels that lost their gold colored inlays in favor of gunmetal grey metallic. Chrysler also introduced an electrocoat primer for better rust proofing and all exterior colors were now applied in a two-stage base-clearcoat system. In 1988, Jeep's first full year under Chrysler, 14,117 Grand Wagoneers were produced.

Many improvements were made for the 1989–1991 model year series, including a quality replacement for the earlier, leak-prone air conditioning compressor, the addition of the visually identifiable rear wiper/washer assembly, as well as a general improvement in fit and finish. An interior overhead console, taken from Chrysler's popular [[Chrysler S platform|minivans]], was also added. This functional console featured much brighter map lights, an outside temperature sensor and compass, a storage compartment for sunglasses and an infrared remote-controlled key-less entry system.

The last three model years also featured several new exterior paint colors and the tan interior color was replaced with a lighter color that Jeep called "sand". The "new" exterior colors included the rare hunter green metallic that was only available in the 1991 model year and is the paint color of the 1991 Grand Wagoneer in the Chrysler museum, as well as the color of the very last Grand Wagoneer ever made.

The Wagoneer enjoyed one of the longest production runs of any Jeep product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Statham |first=Steve |title=Jeep|year=2001 |publisher=MotorBooks International |isbn=978-0-7603-1006-9 |page=76|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1FJh_s1U2vsC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=Wagoneer+one+of+the+longest+production |accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its combined fuel economy of only 11 miles per gallon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/noframes/6318.shtml |title=Fuel Economy of the 1989 Jeep Grand Wagoneer 4WD |website=www.fueleconomy.gov |accessdate=16 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; its powerful 5.9 liter V8 engine and high towing capacity, and the fact that unlike most competitive full-size SUVs of the era it had four doors, made the Grand Wagoneer popular among its many repeat buyers through the 1960s, 70s and 80s. By 1991, it was the longest running domestically produced vehicle (29 years) on the same [[automobile platform|platform]].&lt;ref name="GrandWagoneerinR&amp;T"/&gt;

As a result of the [[1990 oil price shock]] gasoline prices in the United States rose 11 percent in less than a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://consumerenergyalliance.org/2018/07/gas-prices-and-geopolitics/ |title=Looking Back at Gas Prices and Geopolitics Effects on Energy |first=Emily |last=Haggstrom |date=23 July 2018 |accessdate=16 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sales of the gas guzzling Grand Wagoneer plummeted from over 10,000 units in 1989 to 6,449 in 1990. Slow sales continued during the [[Gulf War]] and only 1560 Grand Wagoneers were produced in the 1991 model year. In addition to its dismal fuel economy, the antiquated SJ platform would have required extensive re-engineering to comply with new [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards]] that would apply to all light trucks and sport utility vehicles sold in the United States by the mid 1990s. As a result, on 27 February 1991 Chrysler announced that it was ending production of the Grand Wagoneer, leaving the Jeep line without a full-size SUV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/27/business/company-news-chrysler-ends-grand-wagoneer.html |title=Company News: Chrysler Ends Grand Wagoneer |first=Paul C. |last=Judge |date=27 February 1991 |via=NYTimes.com |accessdate=16 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buyers of 1991 Grand Wagoneers sold after that date had the option of having a gold "Final Edition Jeep Grand Wagoneer" badge on the dashboard.&lt;ref name="allen166"/&gt;

The last SJ Grand Wagoneer produced rolled out of Chrysler's [[Toledo North Assembly Plant#Toledo South|Toledo Assembly Plant]] on 21 June 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Museum gets last Grand Wagoneer |newspaper=Toledo Blade |page=32 |date=24 July 1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Christenson |first=Wayne |title=The Last Wagoneer |journal=Four Wheeler |pages=62–66 |date=December 1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ford |first=Vikki |title=The Last Grand Wagoneer Marks the End of an Era |journal=Journal of the National Automotive Museum |pages=1–2 |date=November 1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1993: Grand Wagoneer (ZJ)===
[[File:1993 Jeep Grand Wagoneer Black Cherry front.jpg|thumb|right|1993 Jeep Grand Wagoneer (ZJ)]]

The Jeep Grand Wagoneer nameplate made a brief one year reappearance as the top-of-the-line model of the new [[Jeep Grand Cherokee (ZJ)|Jeep ZJ]] platform debuted for the Grand Cherokee for the 1993 model year. It featured a long list of standard equipment including the [[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 5.2 L V8|Magnum 5.2 L V8 engine]] and unique leather interior as well as the Grand Wagoneer's traditional exterior woodgrain applique. The model was dropped for 1994, leaving the Grand Cherokee Limited as the top-of-the-line Jeep.

The Wagoneer was occasionally used in [[rallying]], mainly in the [[United States]]. Wagoneers placed first and second in the first-ever running of the [[Sno*Drift]] rally in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sno-drift.org/History/history/1973-1978.htm |title=Sno*Drift Results Through the Years: 1973–1978 |publisher=sno-drift.org |accessdate=23 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924103033/http://www.sno-drift.org/History/history/1973-1978.htm |archivedate=24 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Grand Wagoneer also competed in the 9,000-mile 1988 Trans-Amazon Rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-11-27/features/8802200327_1_vultures-recalls-mile |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |title=The Road Through Hell...is Paved With Auto Parts And Human Sanity As Two Midwesterners Learned In The Transamazon Marathon Rally |date=27 November 1988 |first=Cheryl |last=Jensen |first2=Christopher |last2=Jensen |accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival==
Chrysler Group CEO [[Sergio Marchionne]] announced at the January 2011 [[North American International Auto Show]] held in Detroit, that the Grand Wagoneer name was to be revived for an "upper-scale" seven-seat SUV, which he said would be introduced in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wernle|first=Bradford |title=Jeep to dust off Grand Wagoneer name for 7-seat SUV |journal=Automotive News |date=10 January 2011 |url= http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110110/OEM04/110119929/1115 |accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, the Jeep product planning team took a research trip to Wagonmaster, a company dedicated to restoring and reselling classic Grand Wagoneers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bowman |first=Zach |title=Jeep team takes a field trip to Wagonmaster; researching next Grand Wagoneer? |url= http://www.autoblog.com/2013/02/01/jeep-team-takes-a-field-trip-to-wagonmaster-researching-next-gr/ |publisher=Autoblog|date=1 February 2013 |accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 September 2013, Chrysler announced that they would delay production until 2015 to allow the [[Dodge Durango]] to find an audience, but at the same time would use the Grand Wagoneer concept as a basis for a full-size luxury SUV that would compete against the [[Cadillac Escalade]] and [[Lincoln Navigator]], whose redesigns went on sale in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Larry P. |last=Vellequette |url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20130902/OEM04/309029956/jeep-plans-baby-wrangler-big-suv#axzz2fZRGB5F7 |title=Jeep plans baby Wrangler, big SUV |journal=Automotive News |date=2 September 2013 |accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, Chrysler's "Five-Year Plan" was unveiled, which included the intention to release a [[flagship]] vehicle called the Grand Wagoneer that would share a platform with the Durango and Grand Cherokee by the 2018 model year. Originally planned to replace the Durango, the Grand Wagoneer would be sold alongside it and the Grand Cherokee. The new vehicle was to be built at Chrysler's [[Jefferson North Assembly Plant]] (JNAP), where the Durango and Grand Cherokee were being produced, and would fill the niche of the [[Jeep Commander]], which ceased production in 2010 due to low demand.

On 9 June 2015, Fiat Chrysler announced that it would unveil a new version of the full sized Grand Wagoneer at its dealers convention on 25 August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2015/06/08/jeep-grand-wagoneer-august-dealer-meeting/?icid=autoblog|trend|new-jeep-grand-wagoner "Jeep will show new Grand Wagoneer to dealers this summer"] from Autoblog (8 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015, however, Fiat announced that the production of the upcoming Grand Cherokee replacement would be delayed into 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.cbsnews.com/news/will-chryslers-revived-wagoneer-be-a-new-woody | title=Will Chrysler's revived Wagoneer be a new Woody? |first=Jonathan |last=Berr | date=3 September 2015 | publisher=CBS | accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is scheduled to be built at [[Warren Truck Assembly]] while the next generation Ram 1500 is to be built at [[Sterling Heights Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/chrysler/2016/04/26/fca-move-ram-sterling-heights-jeep-mexico/83537800/ |title=FCA to move Ram to Sterling Heights, Jeep to Mexico|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 October 2016, Jeep released teaser photos of the Grand Wagoneer, which indicated that it would be based on the [[Dodge Durango#Third generation (2011–present)|third generation Durango]] and introduced as a 2019 model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.caranddriver.com/2019-jeep-grand-wagoneer-spied-its-grand-all-right/ "2019 Jeep Grand Wagoneer Spied: Its Grand Alright"] from ''Car and Driver'' (20 October 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was delayed again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a15098149/the-2021-jeep-wagoneer-and-grand-wagoneer-are-cars-worth-waiting-for-feature |title=2021 Jeep Wagoneer/Grand Wagoneer: Fancy-Pants SUVs on the Next-Gen Ram Chassis |first=Jeff |last=Sabatini |date=27 March 2017 |website=Car and Driver |accessdate=16 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; But on December 5, 2019, spy shots surfaced of FCA testing a Jeep Wagoneer using a RAM 1500 body on frame SUV; it is not known if there will be a Grand Wagoneer (which would rival the Suburban and Expedition MAX) to accompany it at this point. FCA is expected to debut this full size version in early 2020 as a 2021 model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/12/new-jeep-wagoneer-caught-hungry-for-2021-chevrolet-tahoe-gmc-yukon/ "New Jeep Wagoneer Caught Hungry For 2021 Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Yukon"] from GM Authority (December 5, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jeep Liberty''', or '''Jeep Cherokee''' (KJ/KK) outside North America, was a [[compact SUV]] that was produced by [[Jeep]] for the model years 2002–2012 for US consumers. Introduced as a replacement for the [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Cherokee (XJ)]], the Liberty was priced between the Wrangler and Grand Cherokee. It was the smallest of the 4-door Jeep SUVs until the car based 4-door [[Jeep Compass|Compass]] and [[Jeep Patriot|Patriot]] arrived for 2007. Like the XJ Cherokee, the Liberty featured [[unibody]]-construction. It was assembled at the [[Toledo North Assembly Plant]] in the United States, as well as in other countries including Egypt and Venezuela. The Liberty ceased production on August 16, 2012. The next generation restored the previous nameplate of [[Jeep Cherokee (KL)|Jeep Cherokee]] that was always used outside of North America.

The Liberty also marked a few firsts for Jeep. It was the first Jeep vehicle to use [[rack and pinion]] steering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/jeep/liberty.html |title=Jeep Liberty Steering |publisher=Allpar.com |date=2005-05-15 |accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's also the first Jeep to use the two then-new ''[[Chrysler PowerTech engine|PowerTech]]'' engines; the {{convert|150|hp}} 2.4 [[Liter|L]] [[straight-4]], which was discontinued in 2006, and the {{convert|210|hp}} 3.7 L [[V6]], as well as a short-lived 2.8 L VM Motori turbo diesel (2005-2006 only).&lt;ref&gt;Swan, Tony, ''[https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a18201384/jeep-liberty-sport-4x4-diesel-short-take-road-test/ Jeep Liberty Sport 4x4 Diesel]'', Car and Driver, 1 Sept 2005, retrieved 25 April 2019: Renowned for its loud diesel 'clatter', and available only with automatic transmission, the 2.8L diesel was dropped in 2006 because of stringent new 2007 emissions regulations.&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberty was the first Jeep vehicle to use an [[independent front suspension]] since the 1963-1965 [[Jeep Wagoneer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://wagoneers.com/FSJ/rigs/63_ifs_rice/ALL.html|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080724022927/http://wagoneers.com/FSJ/rigs/63_ifs_rice/ALL.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-07-24|title=Bruce Rice's 1963 IFS Wagoneer 4x4|publisher=wagoneers.com|date=2007-12-24|accessdate=2010-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Three trim levels were initially offered; the top end ''Limited'', a more rugged looking ''Renegade'' and the base ''Sport''. All were made available with either [[Rear wheel drive|2WD]] or [[Four wheel drive|4WD]]. In 2005, all Liberties received a minor facelift. The 2005, 2006 ''Renegade'' and 2005 ''Rocky Mountain Edition'' Liberties received an exclusive flat hood and taller grille. In 2007, the ''Renegade'' trim level was replaced with the ''Latitude'' which appeared to focus more on an urban appearance and lost the ''Renegade'' trim's unique hood and grill. While the Liberty was nominated for the North American Truck of the Year award for 2002, complaints about Liberty styling and reliability persisted, in addition to safety recalls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=DeMuro |first=Doug |title=Was the Jeep Liberty the Worst Redesign Ever? |url= https://www.autotrader.com/car-news/was-jeep-liberty-worst-redesign-ever-259956 |publisher=Autotrader |date=December 2016 |accessdate=15 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mays |first1=Kelsey |title=Chrysler, Dodge, Ram, Jeep Recalls: What Owners Should Do |url=https://www.cars.com/articles/chrysler-dodge-ram-jeep-recalls-what-owners-should-do-1420680933813/ |website=Cars.com |date=27 July 2015 |accessdate=15 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wood |first=David A. |title=Ohio Woman Dies In Fiery Jeep Liberty Rear-End Crash |url= https://www.carcomplaints.com/news/2017/ohio-woman-dies-in-fiery-jeep-liberty-rear-end-crash.shtml |website=CarComplaints.com |date=11 October 2017 |accessdate=15 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Recall 18V278000 |url= https://repairpal.com/recall/18V278000 |website=RepairPal.com |accessdate=16 October 2019 |date=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cramer |first=Rob |title=Jeep Vs Land Rover: 10 Best And 10 Worst Off-Road Vehicles |url= https://www.hotcars.com/jeep-vs-the-land-rover-best-and-weakest-off-road-vehicles/ |website=hotcars.com |date=15 December 2018 |accessdate=15 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jeep Liberty received a complete redesign for the 2008 model year with a more boxy and off-road look, like that of the 2007 [[Dodge Nitro]], the latter of which lasted until its final production in December 2011. The 2008 Liberty debuted at the 2007 [[New York International Auto Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.automobilemag.com/auto_shows/2007_new_york/0703_2008_jeep_liberty/photo_01.html |title=2008 Jeep Liberty Front Corner Photo |publisher=Automobilemag.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the smaller [[Jeep Patriot|Patriot]] and [[Jeep Compass|Compass]] [[crossover SUV]]s now available to cater to economy conscious buyers, the four-cylinder engine was dropped from the Liberty's offerings. The iron-block, aluminum-head [[V6 engine|V6]] was the only engine available for 2008. Towing capacity was {{convert|5000|lb|0}}. Jeep discontinued the Liberty [[Common rail diesel|CRD]] for the American market because it could not meet tougher 2007 emissions standards for diesel engines. Transmission choices were both carry-overs: a six-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] or a four-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]. Standard equipment included electronic stability control with roll mitigation, [[traction control system|traction control]], and [[anti-lock brakes]] with brake assist. Jeep offered a rare 2WD version on the "Jet" model. New Features included standard side airbags. Optional features are rain-sensing wipers, [[Sirius Satellite Radio]], [[Bluetooth]], a [[navigation system]], and the [[MyGig]] entertainment system complete with a 30[[Gigabyte|GB]] [[hard drive]].

The '''Jeep Grand Cherokee''' is a range of mid-size SUVs produced by the American manufacturer [[Jeep]]. While some other SUVs were manufactured with [[body-on-frame]] construction, the Jeep Grand Cherokee has always used a [[unibody]] chassis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/jeep/grand-cherokee/|title=Jeep Grand Cherokee Review|accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The Grand Cherokee's origins date back to 1983 when [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]] (AMC) was designing a successor to the smaller [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage.mac.com/christopher.z/hobby/93-Jeep2design.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729043433/http://homepage.mac.com/christopher.z/hobby/93-Jeep2design.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 July 2010 |title=The development of the Jeep Grand Cherokee design |accessdate=2 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three outside (non-AMC) designers—[[Larry Shinoda]], Alain Clenet, and [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]—were also under contract with AMC to create and build a clay model of the Cherokee XJ replacement, then known as the "XJC" project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Rothenberg |first=Al |title= Design Debate—Who's the father of the Jeep Grand Cherokee? |journal=Ward's AutoWorld |date=1 March 1998 |url= http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_design_debate_whos/index.html |accessdate=8 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the basic design for the Cherokee's replacement was well under way by AMC's in-house designers and the 1989 '''Jeep Concept 1''' [[show car]] foretold the basic design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ajeepthing.com/jeep-concept1.html |title= 1991 Jeep Concept 1 (Note: shown first in 1989) |publisher= ajeepthing.com |year= 2006 |accessdate= 8 March 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131112031446/http://www.ajeepthing.com/jeep-concept1.html |archivedate= 12 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As AMC began development of the next Jeep in 1985, management created a business process that is now known as [[product lifecycle management]] (PLM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Commentary: Making PLM and ERP work together |url= http://archive.onwindows.com/Articles/Making-PLM-and-ERP-work-together/5071/Default.aspx |date= 12 July 2010 |first=Oleg |last= Shilovitsky |work=onwindows.com |accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[François Castaing]], Vice President for Product Engineering and Development, the smallest U.S. automaker was looking for a way to speed up its product development process to compete better against its larger competitors.&lt;ref name="coe.org"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.coe.org/coldfusion/newsnet/may03/technology.cfm |first=Sidney |last=Hill, Jr. |title=How To Be A Trendsetter: Dassault and IBM PLM Customers Swap Tales From The PLM Front |date=May 2003 |publisher=COE news net |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090213042744/http://www.coe.org/coldfusion/newsnet/may03/technology.cfm |archivedate= 13 February 2009 |accessdate= 2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The XJC's development was aided by [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) software systems making the engineers more productive. Meanwhile, new communication systems allowed potential conflicts to be resolved faster, thus reducing costly engineering changes, because all drawings and documents were in a central database.&lt;ref name="coe.org"/&gt; The system was so effective that after [[Chrysler]] purchased AMC in 1987, it expanded the system throughout its enterprise, thus connecting everyone involved in designing and building products.&lt;ref name="coe.org"/&gt;

The Grand Cherokee thus became the first Chrysler-badged Jeep product. Development work for the new Jeep model continued and Chrysler's employees (after the 1987 buyout of AMC) were eager for a late-1980s release date; however, CEO [[Lee Iacocca]] was pushing for redesigned [[Chrysler minivan (AS)|Chrysler minivans]], thus delaying the Grand Cherokee's release until late 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster |first=Patrick R. |title=The Story of Jeep |year=2004 |publisher=Krause Publications |isbn=978-0-87349-735-0 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=D05p17q4cSYC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=Jeep+Grand+Cherokee+delayed+because+of+minivans |page=221 |accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an [[Ford Explorer|Explorer]] competitor. Unlike the Explorer, the Grand Cherokee utilized [[Unit body|monocoque]] (unibody) construction, whereas the Explorer was a derivative of the [[Ford Ranger|Ranger pickup]] with a separate [[body-on-frame]].

The Grand Cherokee debuted in grand fashion at the 1992 [[North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]. The vehicle that was driven was a Poppy Red Clear Coat 1993 Grand Cherokee ZJ Laredo with a quartz cloth interior and high-back [[bucket seats]]. Then Chrysler president [[Bob Lutz (businessman)|Robert Lutz]] drove Detroit mayor, [[Coleman Young]], from the [[Jefferson North Assembly Plant]] on North Jefferson Avenue via a [[police escort]] to [[Cobo Hall]], up the steps of Cobo Hall and through a plate glass window to show off the new vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1992 Jeep Grand Cherokee Introduction |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXnTwBOGk1I |work=King Rose Archives |accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sales of the 1993 [[model year]] Grand Cherokee began in April 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aQhTq18vi7AC&amp;pg=PA296&amp;dq=April+2003+Jeep+Grand+Cherokee+introduced |last=Hyde |first=Charles K. |title=Riding the Roller Coaster: a history of the Chrysler Corporation|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8143-3091-3 |page=296 |accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production of the Grand Cherokee started shortly afterward in the purpose-built [[Jefferson North Assembly]] in Detroit, Michigan. European Grand Cherokees are manufactured in Austria by [[Magna Steyr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=National Academy of Engineering.

Upon its introduction, it was the first USA-manufactured automobile using HFC-134a refrigerant in place of HCFC-12 for the HVAC system.

The original Grand Cherokee was launched in 1992 as a 1993 model year vehicle in the luxury SUV segment. The "ZJ" models, manufactured from 1992 to 1998, originally came in three trim levels: base (also known as SE), Laredo, and Limited, subsequent trims were added, included Orvis (MY 95–98), TSI (MY97–98). The base model included features such as full instrumentation, cloth interior, and a standard five-speed [[manual transmission]], while gaining the moniker "SE" name for the 1994 model year. Power windows and locks were not standard equipment on the base trim. The minimal price tag differential resulted in low consumer demand, and as a result, the low-line model was eventually discontinued. Additional standard features included a driver-side air bag and four-wheel anti-lock braking system (ABS). The Laredo was the mid-scale model with standard features that included [[power window]]s, [[power door locks]], cruise control, and a leather wrapped steering wheel. Exterior features included medium-grey plastic paneling on the lower body and five-spoke alloy wheels. The Limited was the premium model, featuring body color lower body paneling, and gold exterior accents. The Limited also boasted standard features such as [[leather]] seating, heated mirrors, front power seats, a [[keyless entry system]], wood grain interior appliqué, lace style alloy wheels, a driver information center with compass, digitized climate control, and electrochromic rearview mirror, and Jensen brand stereo with multi-band equalizer. By 1996 the option list grew to include heated seats. Standard was the 4.0, with the 5.2 V8 (and 5.9 in 1998) being optional, as with other models. Package groups with the various trim levels included: fog lamps, skid plates, as well as convenience, lighting, luxury, power, security, and trailer towing packages.

When it was first introduced in April 1992 as an early 1993 model year vehicle, the Grand Cherokee only had one powertrain choice: the 4.0 L [[American Motors|AMC]]-derived [[AMC straight-6 engine#4.0|straight-six engine]] that made 190 horsepower. This became the "volume" engine for the Grand Cherokee. Transmission choices included a four-speed [[automatic transmission]] (early production ZJs used the AW4 – the A500SE (later 42RE) replaced the AW4 during the latter half of the 1993 model year) or an [[Aisin]] AX15 [[manual transmission]]. Low demand for the manual transmission resulted in its discontinuation after 1994, but European-market ZJs retained it when coupled to the diesel engine (which was unavailable in North America). The drive train choices included  [[rear-wheel drive]] or [[four-wheel-drive]]. In 1995, the engine dropped 5 horsepower to 185 due to new [[EPA]] regulations imposed on the 1996 model year.

In 1997, for the 1998 model year, a variant of the top-level Grand Cherokee Limited, the "5.9 Limited" was introduced. Jeep ads claimed it to be the "world's fastest sport utility vehicle", verified by third-party testing. The primary improvements in the 5.9 Limited version included a 245-horsepower 5.9L OHV V8 engine, heavy-duty 46RE automatic transmission, functional heat-extracting hood louvers, unique wide-slot body-colored grille with mesh inserts, special rocker moldings, low-restriction exhaust with three-inch chrome tip, a low-profile roof rack, and special 16" Ultra-Star wheels. The 5.9 Limited also received a 150 amp alternator and a 2-speed electric cooling fan. Other features include a standard 180-watt, 10-speaker Infinity Gold sound system with rear roof-mounted sound bar, standard sunroof, and an interior swaddled with unique "calf's nap" soft leather and faux wood trim. The 5.9 Limited was awarded "4x4 of the Year" for 1998 by ''[[Petersen's 4-Wheel &amp; Off-Road]]'' magazine. Production of this model was 14,286 units.

Export models produced at the plant in Graz, Austria, were given the vehicle designation of "ZG".

Launched in September 1998, the redesigned '''WJ''' 1999 Grand Cherokee shared just 127&amp;nbsp;parts with its predecessor (mostly fasteners). The European model was coded WG. The spare tire was relocated from the side of the cargo compartment to under the floor. (Like the 1998MY ZJ, the rear tailgate glass opened separately.) The two heavy [[pushrod engine|pushrod]] [[V8 engine]]s were replaced by Chrysler's then-new [[Chrysler PowerTech engine#4.6|PowerTech]]. The new V8 engine produced less [[torque]] than the old pushrods, but was lighter, offered better fuel economy, and provided similar on road performance figures (the 23-gallon fuel tank was replaced with one of a 20.5-gallon capacity). The [[straight-six engine]] was also updated. A redesign of the intake manifold added {{convert|10|hp}}. While other Jeep vehicles used the Mopar 5 x 4.5 bolt circle, this was the first Jeep following the 1987 Chrysler buyout to receive a wider bolt pattern:&amp;nbsp;– 5 x 5.

A notable feature available in this generation was the automatic four wheel drive option called ''[[Quadra-Drive]]'', which employed the [[New Venture Gear]] NV247 transfer case. This two-speed chain-driven transfer case uses a gerotor, a clutch pack coupled to a hydraulic pump, to transfer torque between the front and rear axles. The transfer case contains three modes, 4-All Time, Neutral, and 4-Lo. In 4-All Time, 100% of torque is sent to the rear axle in normal conditions. If the rear axle starts spinning at a higher rate than the front axle, hydraulic pressure builds up in the gerotor and causes the clutch pack to progressively transfer torque to the front axle until both axles return to the same speed. Neutral mode is intended for towing the vehicle. In 4-Lo, the front and rear axles are locked together through a 2.72 reduction gear ratio. The NV247 transfer case is mated to front and rear axles containing Jeep's Vari-Lok differentials. Vari-Lok differentials also use a gerotor to transfer torque between the wheels on either side of the axle.  The major advantage of Quadra-Drive was that the combined  transfer case and progressive locking differentials in each axle could automatically control traction between all four wheels. However, only the center differential could be permanently locked, and only in 4Lo.  The [[Quadra-Trac II]] system included the NV247 transfer case with the standard open front and rear differentials.

The ''[[Chrysler 45RFE transmission|45RFE]]'' and ''[[Chrysler 545RFE transmission|545RFE]]'' [[automatic transmission]] in the WJ was notable. It included three [[planetary gear]] sets rather than the two normally used in a four-speed automatic. This gave it six theoretical speeds, and it would have been the first six-speed transmission ever produced in volume, but it was programmed to only use five of these ratios. Four were used for upshifts, with a different second gear for downshifts. Although five of the six ratios were used, Chrysler decided to call it a "4-speed automatic". For MY 2001, the programming was changed to make use of all six ratios. Rather than have six forward gears, the transmission was programmed to act as a five-speed with the alternate second gear for downshifts. The rpm at {{convert|70|mi/h|km/h}} on a 545RFE is 2000 rpm, 200 rpm less than the 45RFE programming. 1999 and 2000 model year WJ owners can have their 45RFE transmission's programming flashed to enable the extra gear as both transmissions are physically the same. (Must purchase new PCM and ABS module and program them with a fake VIN to make this work.) The 42RE 4-speed automatic remained the transmission for the Inline 6 engine. It had slight changes from the previous model Grand Cherokee.

The interior was also completely redesigned. The redesign allowed for larger rear doors, and more space for rear passengers. Controls for various items like headlights, heated seats, and rear wiper were moved to more convenient locations. The electronic Vehicle Information center was moved from below the radio to above the windshield, and was standard on 2000-2004 models. Limited models included automatic dual-zone climate control. A 10 CD-Changer was also available with the Infinity Audio package.

In addition to Jeep's UniFrame construction, Daimler Chrysler partnered with Porsche to further strengthen the frame.{{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion.|date=April 2009}} This was done to reduce Noise Vibration Harshness (NVH). UniFrame is an unusual construction scheme, it incorporates all of the strength and durability of a body-on-frame construction into a unitized construction. By adding stiffness and rigidity to the structure, they enhanced the ride and strengthened the network of steel beams, rails and pillars (or "safety cage") that surround and protect occupants. More than 70 percent of the underbody is high-strength steel. All Jeep Grand Cherokees feature UniFrame construction.

The Grand Cherokee received a minor facelift for 2004 including round fog lamps, a lower front [[Fascia (car)|fascia]] and a new body-color matched inset grille design.

Export models produced at the plant in Graz, Austria, were given the vehicle designation of "WG".

The '''WK''' Grand Cherokee debuted in 2004 for the 2005 model year at the 2004 [[New York International Auto Show]] with available  [[Quadra-Drive II]] four-wheel drive, rear-seat [[DVD player]] and optional 5.7&amp;nbsp;L Hemi V8. The 3.7&amp;nbsp;L [[V6 engine]] replaced the 4.0&amp;nbsp;L [[Straight-6]]. A Mercedes Benz sourced 3.0 V6 Common Rail Diesel (CRD) was available outside of North America from launch.

Jeep replaced the XJ-era live-axle with leading-arms front suspension (found in the ZJ and WJ) with an independent double-wishbone setup like that which debuted in the 2002 [[Jeep Liberty|Liberty]]. Classed as a truck-based SUV, the WH/WK Grand Cherokee offers "crossover"  refinement, capability and NVH.

The 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee made its European debut at the Euro Camp Jeep in [[Ardèche]], France. This Jeep has gained 4 stars in the Euro Ncap crash safety tests conducted in 2005.

The Grand Cherokee received a minor facelift for 2008 with revised headlights and High Intensity Discharge (HID) Headlamps with auto leveling. The lower portion of the front bumper was still removable as it was from launch to increase the approach angle for off-road use. The 4.7&amp;nbsp;L was refined, now producing {{convert|305|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|334|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}.

The 2009 Jeep Grand Cherokee is available with an improved 5.7&amp;nbsp;L [[Hemi engine]] rated at {{convert|357|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|389|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. The engine uses [[variable valve timing]] to increase fuel economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeephorizons.com/news/09_grand_cherokee_090108.html|title=2009 Jeep Grand Cherokee Gets Powerful Boost from New HEMI Engine and More Premium Amenities |work= jeephorizons.com |accessdate=September 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth-generation Grand Cherokee retains its classic Jeep styling combined with a modern and sleek body style. The interior features leather trim and real wood accents, plus Bluetooth and uConnect electronics options. With the additional awards for the 2011 Grand Cherokee, the Jeep Grand Cherokee has won 30 awards for off-road capability, luxury, value, best-in-class, and safety, making it the most awarded SUV ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asrcreviews.org/nad-finds-chrysler-can-support-most-awarded-claim-for-jeep-grand-cherokee-with-certain-modifications/ |title=NAD Finds Chrysler Can Support ‘Most Awarded’ Claim For Jeep Grand Cherokee, With Certain Modifications }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the awards are: Top Safety Pick for 2011 from the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety|IIHS]], listed as a ''[[Consumers Digest]]'' Best Buy for 2011, Safest SUV in America by [[MSN]] Autos, and Truck of the Year for 2011 by ''[[The Detroit News]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Like previous generations, the WK2 Grand Cherokee chassis is a steel [[Vehicle frame#Types|unibody]]. Unlike previous generations, it features four-wheel [[independent suspension]] for better on-road handling. The WK2 and 2011 Durango use a Chrysler designed and engineered platform/chassis that Mercedes-Benz later used for the [[Mercedes-Benz]] [[Mercedes-Benz M-Class#Third generation (W166: 2011–present)|W166]] series. The Chrysler designed platform was part of the DaimerChrysler engineering projects that were to launch the WK2 Grand Cherokee with the Mercedes-Benz ML to follow. However, due to the subsequent sale and bankruptcy of Chrysler, the Grand Cherokee launch was delayed and the ML launched before the Grand Cherokee.

Four wheel drive systems include [[Quadra-Trac I]], [[Quadra-Trac II]], and [[Quadra-Drive II]]. Using [[Selec-Terrain]], the driver can select modes for Auto, Sport, Snow, Sand/Mud, and Rock.

Optional ''Quadra-Lift'' [[Height adjustable suspension|height adjustable]] [[air suspension]] can raise the vehicle's ground clearance up to {{convert|11.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/trucks/jeep/2011-cherokee.html |title=The 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee |publisher=Allpar.com |date=2010-05-25 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lift modes include Park, Aero, Normal Ride Height, Off-Road 1, and Off-Road 2.

Engine choices include the all new 3.6&amp;nbsp;L [[Chrysler Pentastar engine|Pentastar]] V6 and 5.7&amp;nbsp;L Hemi V8. The Hemi V8 retains the Multiple Displacement System (MDS) that shuts down four cylinders in low-power driving situations.

==Recalls==
===Fuel system integrity===
In 2010, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) launched an investigation into 1993–2004 model year Jeep Grand Cherokees which involves the fuel tanks of these SUVs. In moderate- to high-[[Kinetic energy|energy]] rear collisions, the fuel tank (located behind the rear axle) could be compromised structurally, resulting in fuel leakage and fire. The NHTSA claims that it has reports of 157 deaths resulting from fires caused by Grand Cherokees crashing. Also affected are 2002–2007 [[Jeep Liberty]] models and 1986–2001 [[Jeep Cherokee]] models, which totals about 5.1 million affected vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jensen|first=Chistopher|title=Consumer Advocacy Group Calls for a Recall of 5 Million Jeep Grand Cherokees |url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/consumer-advocacy-group-calls-for-a-recall-of-5-million-jeep-grand-cherokees/ |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=2 June 2013|date=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, 2013, [[Chrysler Corporation]] responded to the recall, agreeing to recall 2.7 million [[Jeeps]], though eliminating both the 1986–2001 [[Jeep Cherokee]] [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|XJ]] and 1999–2004 [[Jeep]] Grand Cherokee WJ from the recall. The recall will include 2.7 million 1993–1998 [[Jeep]] Grand Cherokee ZJ and 2002–2007 [[Jeep Liberty]] KJ vehicles.

Two weeks prior to this recall, [[Chrysler Corporation]] claimed that the affected [[Jeep]] vehicles were safe, citing the vehicles' rates of fatal rear-impact crashes involving fire as well as their compliance with then-current requirements of [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards|FMVSS]] standard No. 301&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FCA US Media - Chrysler Group LLC Responds to NHTSA Recall Letter |url=http://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=14371 |website=media.fcanorthamerica.com |accessdate=14 April 2019 |date=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Borris |first1=Frank |title=EA12-005RECALL REQUESTLETTER-ForFinal - ODI Jeep Recall Request |url=https://www.autosafety.org/sites/default/files/imce_staff_uploads/ODI%20Jeep%20Recall%20Request.pdf |website=Center for Auto Safety, Inc. |accessdate=14 April 2019 |page=4 |format=PDF |date=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;, though agreed to recall the affected vehicles later. To remedy the problem, [[Jeep]] [[dealerships]] will install a [[trailer hitch]] onto the rear [[Bumper (automobile)|bumpers]] of [[Jeep]] vehicles that will protect the [[fuel tank]] if the vehicle is involved in a rear impact. If an affected vehicle is not currently equipped with a [[trailer hitch]], one will be installed onto it, and older [[Jeep]] and non-factory [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] trailer hitches will be replaced with one from [[Chrysler Corporation]]. Despite the recall, the market for these [[Jeep]] vehicles has not suffered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Krisher|first=Tom|title=Chrysler Recalls 2.7 Million Older Jeep Grand Cherokee, Jeep Liberty Vehicles|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/18/chrysler-recalls-jeep-grand-cherokee-liberty-suvs_n_3461335.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=8 July 2013|author2=Durbin, Dee-Ann|date=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transfer case actuator===
In May 2013 there was a recall of WKs with the Quadra-Drive II and Quadra-Trac II systems. This followed cases of cars rolling away due the transfer case moving into neutral of its own accord, and the owner not having applied the parking brake. The recall revised the Final Drive Control Module (FDCM) software. However, following the recall there were widespread reports on enthusiast web sites &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeepforum.com/forum/f777/n23-recall-issue-no-4-low-1561787/index319.html |title=Jeepforum.com (for example)}}&lt;/ref&gt; of both the neutral and low ratio modes of the transfer case ceasing to function, and a survey showed that fewer than 10% of respondents had experienced no issues with the recall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeepforum.com/forum/f777/n23-recall-issue-no-4-low-survey-1873090/ |title=Jeepforum.com poll}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempting to resolve these issues, some dealers subsequently replaced the transfer case actuator, FDCM, and even the transfer case itself, often at customer expense and usually to no avail.

The cause of the roll-aways was faulty soldering in the transfer case actuator. It has been deduced that the revised software detects this by noting any deviation in resistance, and thereupon locks the transfer case in high ratio for safety; but that it is over-reacting to minor resistance variations from other causes. Originally Chrysler dealers claimed that the loss of neutral and low ratio following the recall was coincidence; then it claimed that the revised software was revealing pre-existing faults in the system, despite it occurring even with new parts.  Chrysler have also claimed that only a small fraction of cars have issues following the recall;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://truckyeah.jalopnik.com/jeep-owners-say-a-recall-ruined-their-4wd-chrysler-say-1573426014 |title=Truckyeah website}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most users never have occasion to use the low ratio and may never discover the fault.  Four years after this recall its issues remain unresolved.

===Transmission parking pawl===
In April 2016, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) ordered a recall of 2014 and 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokees and other cars that use an electronic gear shifter because it sometimes does not go into (or does not remain in) the park position, despite the operator's best intentions.  Consumers reported that they put the car in park and left the engine running, and then were surprised when the car rolled away under power.

An investigation by FCA US and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found some drivers have exited their vehicles without first selecting “PARK.” Such behavior may pose a safety risk if a vehicle’s engine is still running.
The Company is aware of 41 injuries that are potentially related. The vehicles involved in these events were inspected and no evidence of equipment failure was found. The vehicles also deliver warning chimes and alert messages if their driver-side doors are opened while their engines are still running and “PARK” is not engaged. However, investigation suggested these measures may be insufficient to deter some drivers from exiting their vehicles without selecting “PARK,” so FCA US will enhance the warnings and transmission-shift strategy on these vehicles. The enhancements will combine warnings with a transmission-shift strategy to automatically prevent a vehicle from moving, under certain circumstances, even if the driver fails to select “PARK.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=17455&amp;mid=431 |title=Statement: Shift Strategy |publisher=FCA US Media Website |date= |accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeep has now replaced the shifter with a conventional lever which stays in position for late 2016 models.

===Other recalls===
In July 2017, 2012-14 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUVs were recalled due to possible alternator failure. If the alternator fails, the vehicle may stall and/or if the alternator has a short circuit, a fire may occur. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=

The following is a list of [[Car model|vehicle models]] / [[Car platform|platforms]] sold under the [[Jeep]] brand, listed under their factory model designation code, and arranged in order of first appearance.

==[[Jeep CJ|CJ]]==
*'''[[Jeep CJ#CJ-2A|CJ-2A]]''' (1945–1949)
::The first '''C'''ivilian '''J'''eep put into production by [[Willys]], marketed as the "Universal Jeep". 212,402 units were produced.
*'''[[Jeep CJ#CJ-3A|CJ-3A]]''' (1949–1953)
::A refined CJ-2A, the CJ-3A featured a redesigned one-piece windshield with air vents below the glass. 131,843 units were produced. Derived from it was the first post-war military jeep: the M38.
*'''[[Jeep CJ#CJ-3B|CJ-3B]]''' (1953–1968)
::Essentially a CJ-3A fitted with a taller hood (the CJ-3B is also known as the "high-hood" Jeep) to accommodate the [[Willys Hurricane engine]]. 155,494 were built over its 15-year lifespan. Most later ones were M606 military jeeps shipped to South America.
*'''[[Jeep CJ#CJ-5|CJ-5]]''' (1955–1983)
::Introduced in late 1954 as a 1955 model, the CJ-5 was a civilian version of the [[M38A1]] military Jeep used in the [[Korean War]]. The most noticeable addition was the new rounded hood, designed specifically to accommodate the [[Willys Hurricane engine|Hurricane engine]]. 603,303 were built over nearly 30 years, making it the longest-lived and most popular "Universal".
*'''[[Jeep CJ#CJ-5A and CJ-6A|CJ-5A "Tuxedo Park"]]''' (1964–1967)
::The Tuxedo Park had been an option package on the CJ-5 from 1961 to 1963, and by 1964 it was given its own model designation code. It featured more standard equipment (from 1965 onward standard equipment included the [[Buick V6 engine#Dauntless|Dauntless V6 engine]] and bucket seats), but the Tuxedo Park never garnered a large customer base due to the higher base price. Only 7,394 CJ-5As were produced.
*'''[[Jeep CJ#CJ-6|CJ-6]]''' (1955–1975)
::Mechanically, the CJ-6 was nothing more than a CJ-5 with a 20 in. longer wheelbase. This addressed the most common customer complaint: lack of rear seat room. Despite ceding to consumer demand sales were modest, with only 50,172 units manufactured over 20 years.
*'''[[Jeep CJ#CJ-5A and CJ-6A|CJ-6A "Tuxedo Park"]]''' (1964–1967)
::Similar to the CJ-5A, the CJ-6A was a "Tuxedo Park" version of the CJ-6. Like the CJ-5A it was not popular, with only 459 units produced, making it the rarest CJ. 
*'''[[Jeep CJ#CJ-7|CJ-7]]''' (1976–1986)
::The CJ-7 was introduced in 1976 as a longer alternative to the CJ-5, as a compromise between the CJ-5 and CJ-6's wheelbase length. 379,299 were built. This was the first model to lack the "Universal Jeep" designation.
*'''[[Jeep CJ#CJ-8 .28Scrambler.29|CJ-8 "Scrambler"]]''' (1981–1985)
::Once again consumers complained of too little room in the CJ-7. Like the CJ-6 before it, the Scrambler was an extended version of a smaller CJ, in this case the more modern CJ-7.
*'''[[Jeep CJ#CJ-10|CJ-10]]''' (1981–1985)
::The Jeep CJ-10 was a CJ-bodied pickup truck based on a heavily modified Jeep J10 pickup truck. Produced from 1981 to 1985, it was sold and designed for export markets; Australia in particular.
*'''[[Jeep CJ#CJ-10A|CJ-10A]]''' (1984–1986)
::The Jeep CJ-10A was a CJ-10-based flightline aircraft tug. Produced in Mexico from 1984 to 1986.

==[[Willys Jeep Station Wagon|Willys Wagon]] and [[Willys Jeep Truck|Willys Pickup]]==
The Willys Wagon (1946–1965) and Willys Pickup (1947–1965) were full-size trucks featuring a wagon and pickup bodystyle respectively.

==[[Willys-Overland Jeepster|VJ]]==
*'''Willys Jeepster''' (1948–1950)
::The Willys Jeepster was a roadster designed to appeal to consumers who would not otherwise purchase a utilitarian CJ. Most of its parts were shared with the Jeep Wagon and Jeep Pickup. Unfortunately it proved to be unpopular, with its production life cut to only three years.

==[[Jeep DJ|DJ]]==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Dispatch]] --&gt;
*'''DJ-3A''' (1955–1964)
::The first of the '''D'''ispatcher '''J'''eeps, the DJ-3A was essentially a two wheel drive version of the CJ-3A, designed for lighter-duty work not requiring four wheel drive.
*'''DJ-5 "Dispatcher 100"''' (1965–1967)
::Like the DJ-3A, the DJ-5 was a two wheel drive version of the CJ-5.
*'''DJ-5A''' (1968–1970)
::The DJ-5A was an offshoot of the DJ-5 featuring a specialized hardtop body and [[right hand drive]] steering, designed for use as a mail truck. It was also powered by a [[Chevrolet Inline 6 engine#153|153&amp;nbsp;in³ Chevrolet four-cylinder engine]].
*'''DJ-5B''' (1970–1972)
::Nearly identical to the DJ-5A, the DJ-5B was differentiated by its powertrain: a [[AMC Straight-6 engine#232|232&amp;nbsp;in³ AMC six-cylinder engine]].
*'''DJ-5C''' (1973–1974)
::Nearly identical to the DJ-5B.
*'''DJ-5D''' (1975–1976)
::Nearly identical to the DJ-5B.
*'''DJ-5E "Electruck"''' (1976)
::A special electric version of the Dispatcher featuring an electric motor and battery pack in place of the original [[internal combustion engine]].
*'''DJ-5F''' (1977–1978)
::Nearly identical to the DJ-5B. The DJ-5F was also available with the [[AMC Straight-6 engine#258|AMC 258 engine]].
*'''DJ-5G''' (1979)
::Nearly identical to the DJ-5B. The DJ-5G was powered by a 2.0&amp;nbsp;L [[Volkswagen]]/[[Audi]] four-cylinder engine.
*'''DJ-5L''' (1982)
::Nearly identical to the DJ-5B. The DJ-5L was powered by the [[GM Iron Duke engine|Pontiac 2.5&amp;nbsp;L "''Iron Duke''" engine]].

==[[Jeep Forward Control|FC]]==
*'''FC-150''' (1956–1965)
::The '''F'''orward '''C'''ontrol trucks were essentially CJ-5s with a pickup bed and a flat-faced cab mounted on top of the engine. The FC-150 was mechanically nearly identical to the CJ-5.
*'''FC-170''' (1957–1965)
::The FC-150 was joined by a longer FC-170 model, equipped with the [[Willys Super Hurricane engine]].

==[[Jeep FJ|FJ]]==
The FJ (1961–1965) was a DJ-3A fitted with a van body with a redesigned steering and seating arrangement similar to the Forward Control trucks. The '''F'''leetvan '''J'''eeps were designed specifically for moving cargo. The '''FJ-3''' (easily distinguishable by ''horizontal'' grille slots) was offered specifically as a postal truck, while a longer '''FJ-3A''' was offered for other fleet purposes.

==[[Jeep SJ|SJ]]==
*'''Wagoneer''' (1963–1983)
::The Wagoneer was designed to replace the Jeep Wagon, which had been produced relatively unchanged since 1946. It was leaps and bounds more sophisticated than its predecessor and competitors, offering modern amenities and car-like attributes such as an [[Independent suspension|independent front suspension]] and a [[single overhead cam|SOHC engine]].
*'''J-series''' (1963–1988)
::The Wagoneer's SJ chassis was also designed for a pickup truck bed, replacing the Willys Jeep Pickup. Originally named Gladiator, the truck underwent several name changes. Originally the Gladiator models were distinguished by a three-digit model code signifying wheelbase and [[gross vehicle weight rating]]. For 1965 the model codes were changed to four digits. The Gladiator name was dropped for 1972. In 1974, the model codes were changed for the final time to a two-digit code signifying [[gross vehicle weight rating|GVWR]]. The sporty Honcho package was a popular option on half-ton J-10s.
*'''Super Wagoneer''' (1966–1969)
::The Super Wagoneer was a special luxury version of the Wagoneer, featuring amenities such as [[air conditioning]], an [[automatic transmission]] and a [[V8 engine|V8]] engine as standard equipment. All of this was years prior to the existence of the [[Range Rover]], considered by many to be the "original luxury SUV".
*'''Cherokee''' (1974–1983)
::The Cherokee was added to the Jeep lineup as a sporty two-door model in 1974. A four-door body was later added in 1977.
*'''Grand Wagoneer''' (1984–1991)
::The Wagoneer and Cherokee were replaced for 1984 by the smaller XJ Cherokee and Wagoneer. The SJ continued on as the Grand Wagoneer, the most opulent Jeep in the range.

==[[Jeepster Commando#C101|C101]]==
*'''Jeepster Commando''' (1966–1971)
::The Jeepster Commando was introduced in 1966 to appeal to consumers seeking a less utilitarian vehicle than the CJ. Based heavily upon the CJ-5, the Jeepster Commando was available in many body styles, including a convertible and pickup.

==[[Jeepster Commando#C104|C104]]==
*'''Commando''' (1972–1973)
::The C101 Jeepster Commando was redesigned in 1972 by [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] in order to accommodate AMC engines under its hood. The result was the new C104 Commando (Jeepster having been dropped from the name). The new front fascia, reminiscent of the [[Ford Bronco]], was very unpopular, and Commando was dropped after its second year.

==[[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|XJ]]==
*'''Cherokee''' (1984–2001)
::The most ambitious Jeep ever undertaken, the XJ (said to mean e'''X'''perimental '''J'''eep, although the veracity of this is not well substantiated) was revolutionary in design: it was the first SUV to use a bespoke [[unibody]] chassis for more car-like performance and design attributes. The "UniFrame" chassis made the XJ light and maneuverable, while the QuadraLink front suspension gave it excellent off-road ability. The XJ Cherokee increased Jeep sales to levels never seen before, and proved to be the single most popular Jeep of all time, with over 2.8 million units sold.
 
*'''Wagoneer Limited''' (1984–1990)
::The Wagoneer was offered alongside the Cherokee as a more luxurious model. Exterior changes were the only discernible differences, with a different grille and optional (plastic) wood panelling. Not to be confused with Grand Wagoneer SJ model.

==[[Jeep Comanche|MJ]]==
*'''Comanche''' (1986–1992)
::The Comanche was offered as a pickup version of the Cherokee. It is unique in that it is one of few unibody pickup trucks ever produced.

==[[Jeep Wrangler#YJ .281987.E2.80.931995.29|YJ]]==
*'''Wrangler''' (1987–1995) (No Wrangler produced in 1996 as they revamped the design for the new TJ's in 1997)
::The Wrangler, distinguished by its square headlamps, replaced the long-lived CJ. This model carried wider track axles and a stronger frame. It had more creature comforts and later on, had the benefit of the more efficient, fuel injected engines. The last model year of the YJ included galvanized bodies and larger U-joints.

==[[Jeep Grand Cherokee#First generation .28ZJ.3B 1993.E2.80.931998.29|ZJ]]==
*'''Grand Cherokee''' (1993–1998)
::Originally designed as the XJ's replacement, the ZJ was instead moved upmarket as the Grand Cherokee.
*'''Grand Wagoneer''' (1993)
::A top-of-the-line Grand Cherokee featuring more standard equipment, such as a [[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 5.2|5.2L Magnum V8]]. It was dropped after one year.

==[[Jeep Wrangler#TJ .281997.E2.80.932006.29|TJ]]==
*'''Wrangler''' (1997–2006)
::The YJ's replacement, the TJ, has been the most bold evolution of the "Universal" yet, with coil springs at all four wheels (it also returned to the circular headlights of the CJ). Halfway through the 2004 model year a long-wheelbase version of the TJ was released as the Wrangler Unlimited. The Wrangler Unlimited is unofficially referred to as the LJ to differentiate between the standard- and long-wheelbase models.

==[[Jeep Grand Cherokee#Second generation .28WJ.3B 1999.E2.80.932004.29|WJ]]==
*'''Grand Cherokee''' (1999–2004)
::An evolution of the ZJ. Its [[Chrysler PowerTech engine#4.7|4.7&amp;nbsp;L ''Powertech'' V8]] signalled a return to [[Single overhead cam|SOHC engines]]: it was the first in a new Jeep since the [[Kaiser]] ''Tornado'' engine was dropped from the lineup in 1965.

==[[Jeep Liberty#First generation KJ .282002.E2.80.932007.29|KJ]]==
*'''Liberty''' (2002–2007)
::The first new Jeep to feature an independent suspension since the 1963 Wagoneer, the Liberty (as it is known in [[North America]]; it goes by the name Cherokee in all other markets) replaced the XJ Cherokee in 2002. The Liberty comes with a 3.7 liter V6 engine, but was also available in the US in 2005–2006 with a 2.8L 4cylinder common rail diesel (CRD) engine.

==[[Jeep Grand Cherokee#Third generation .28WK.3B 2005.E2.80.932010.29|WK]]==
*'''Grand Cherokee''' (2005–2010)
::Using the WJ and KJ as a springboard, the most recent WK Grand Cherokee has a greater blend of car-like ride and handling with traditional offroad capability. Grand Cherokee has been completely redone for 2011.

==[[Jeep Commander (XK)|XK]]==
*'''Commander''' (2006–2010)
::With an exterior design reminiscent of the XJ, the Commander was the first seven-passenger Jeep, pushing the brand into market waters never before trodden. The Commander was discontinued due to the fact that the 2011 Dodge Durango is going to be Chrysler's 7 passenger SUV offering. It is rumored that the Commander may still be built overseas for certain markets.

==[[Jeep Wrangler#JK .282007.E2.80.93present.29|JK]]==
*'''Wrangler''' (2007–early 2018)
::The new JK Wrangler includes a 3-piece hardtop roof. 2007–2011 used [[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.8|Chrysler's 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 engine]]. For 2012+, the Wrangler uses Chrysler's 3.6L Pentastar V6.

==[[Jeep Wrangler#JK Wrangler Unlimited|JKU]]==
*'''4 Door Wrangler''' (2007–2018)
Designation of the 4 door body style JK Wrangler.
::

==[[Jeep Patriot|MK]]==
*'''Compass/Patriot''' (2007–2017)
::The product of a Chrysler to bring 4x4 and fuel economy into the crossover market.

==[[Jeep Compass|MP]]==
*'''Compass''' (2017–present)
::A completely redesigned compact crossover developed by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.

==[[Jeep Liberty#Second generation KK .282008.E2.80.932012.29|KK]]==
*'''Liberty''' (2008–2012)
::3.7 liters V6 210hp, some engines can run on E-85 fuel. Replaced the KJ.

==[[Jeep Grand Cherokee#Fourth generation .28WK2.3B 2011.E2.80.93present.29|WK2]]==
*'''Grand Cherokee''' (2011–present)
::3.6 Liter Pentastar V6, 5.7 Liter Hemi V8, 3.0 Liter EcoDiesel V6. 4x2 or 4x4 options. RWD platform. Replaced the WK.

==[[Jeep Cherokee (KL)|KL]]==
*'''Cherokee''' (2014–present)
::The new KL is the return of the Cherokee designation in a compact-wide body featuring a distinctive new front end and sporting a 2.4L Tigershark Inline 4, a 2.0L Hurricane turbo 4, or a 3.2L Pentastar V-6 mated with a 9-speed 948TE automatic transmission. The trailrated edition of the KL is referred to as the Cherokee Trailhawk.

      <text bytes="9425" xml:space="preserve">The '''Jeep J8''' is a [[list of military vehicles|military vehicle]] based on the [[Jeep]] [[Jeep Wrangler|Wrangler]] platform. It is also used in underground mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jeep J8 for underground coal mining |url=https://www.worldcoal.com/product-news/31072014/world-coal-jeep-j8-for-underground-coal-mining-coal1135b/ |website=World Coal |accessdate=11 January 2019 |language=en |date=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model was introduced at the [[DSEi|Defence Systems &amp; Equipment International (DSEi)]] trade show on September 13, 2007. The J8 is assembled in Egypt and in Israel. AIL markets the vehicle to sectors of the government as the [[AIL Storm#Storm III|AIL Storm III]].

Recently{{When|date=December 2014}}, the J8 has been submitted as a replacement for the [[Toyota Tacoma]], [[Toyota Hilux]], [[Mitsubishi Triton]] and [[HMMWV]] for US Special Forces.

== Design ==
[[File:Texas State Fair army vehicle.jpg|thumb|Jeep J8 at the State Fair of Texas 2008, Fair Park, Dallas]]
The J8 is equipped with larger brakes, axles and suspension components than the civilian version and has a payload capacity of {{convert|1339|kg|lb|0}}. The J8 also differs from the civilian model by utilizing rear [[leaf spring]]s. The Jeep J8 is powered by a [[VM Motori]] 2.8-litre four-cylinder [[Turbodiesel|turbo-diesel]] [[List of VM Motori engines#R 428 DOHC|engine]] that produces {{convert|145|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|460|N·m|lb.ft|0|abbr=on}} of torque, providing towing capability of up to {{convert|3500|kg|lb|0}}. The engine is mated to a five-speed automatic transmission.  The J8 also features a unique air-intake system with special filtration and a hood-mounted snorkel that enables the J8 to wade in water up to {{convert|762|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} deep and tackle sandstorm conditions for up to five hours.

Available as a two-door with an extended pickup bed for personnel or equipment transport, or a four-door multipurpose vehicle, it may be produced with numerous vehicle-body and seating configurations in either right-hand- or left-hand-drive.

While not designed for front-line combat operations, the Jeep J8 is fully [[Vehicle armour|armour]] capable (BRV 2009 VR7) and can be used for a variety of duties ranging from command vehicle, troop/cargo carrier, [[ambulance]] or communications vehicle.  Heavy-duty bumpers with tow eyes allow the Jeep J8 to be easily transported by [[fixed-wing aircraft|fixed wing aircraft]] or [[helicopter]].

The J8 was first planned for assembly at a Chrysler joint-venture facility in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeephorizons.com/news/j8_091307.html|title=New Military Version of Jeep Wrangler Unlimited|work= jeephorizons.com|accessdate=September 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2007/autos/0709/gallery.jeep_wrangler_history//index.html?cnn=yes|title=Back in the Army|work=[[CNN|CNN.com]]|accessdate=September 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 2, 2008, the production version of the Jeep J8 was unveiled at Euro Camp Jeep 2008, a customer event in [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeephorizons.com/news/j8_071008.html|title=Iconic Jeep J8 Offers Cargo and Towing For Humanitarian, Commercial and Military Uses|work= jeephorizons.com|accessdate=September 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 13, 2008, Chrysler LLC and [[Arab American Vehicles]] officially announced the manufacturing launch of the Jeep J8 at AAV's assembly plant in Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeephorizons.com/news/j8_111308.html|title=Jeep J8 Production Begins at Arab American Vehicles Company|work= jeephorizons.com|accessdate=November 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeep J8 is also assembled in Israel, by [[Automotive Industries Ltd]]. (AIL) of Nazareth. It is locally badged '''[[AIL Storm#Storm III|Storm 3]]''', and will be supplied as a command vehicle to the Israeli Defence Force (IDF). A pair of production J8s was tested by Israeli web magazine [http://www.jeepolog.com Jeepolog.com] journalists in April 2009. It was dubbed "probably best Jeep ever". A civilian version was apparently considered for the local Israeli market, but the idea was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeepolog.com/UserFiles/english_pages/jeep%20j8%20road%20test.htm|title=AIL Storm 3, AKA Jeep J8 - world exclusive road test|work= jeepolog.com|accessdate=April 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 a variant of the Storm 3 was introduced by AIL in Israel under the name '''Storm 3 Type R'''. According to Israeli Blog [http://www.jeepolog.com/UserFiles/english_pages/jeepolog_english_homepage.htm Jeepolog.com], this is a door-less, no windshield Jeep J8, running on 35" tires, and sporting metal tube fenders and roll-cage. It is intended for special forces use in the border patrol, pursuit, and deep strike missions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jeepolog.com/UserFiles/english_pages/jeep%20j8%20storm%203%20type%20R%20road%20test.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[American Expedition Vehicles]], a Montana-based Jeep aftermarket parts producer, has struck a deal with Chrysler to sell 120 J8 "component chassis" in the US. These chassis are sold fully assembled but without an engine or transmission. This allows the customer to install or have installed either a 2.8L VM [[Turbodiesel]] with 339&amp;nbsp;lb.-ft. of torque (460 N • m) or a 5.7-liter V-8 Chrysler HEMI. The vehicle can then be legally registered as a "component vehicle".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aev-conversions.com/vehicles/j8_milspec.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-11-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114225649/http://www.aev-conversions.com/vehicles/j8_milspec.php |archive-date=2010-11-14 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Underground Mining'''&lt;/big&gt;

A special version of the J8 was developed in 2009 by Jeep and VM Motori for the underground mining market.  This version is equipped with a version of the 2.8L VM Turbodiesel that is approved by MSHA and CANMET for use in underground mines.

The '''Jeep Cherokee''' (XJ) is a [[compact sport utility vehicle]] manufactured and marketed across a single generation by [[Jeep]] in the United States from 1983 to 2001 &amp;mdash; and globally through 2014. Available in three- or five-door, five passenger, front engine, rear- or four-wheel drive configurations, the XJ was manufactured in [[Toledo, Ohio]], USA; [[Beijing, China]]; Ferreyra, Argentina; [[Cairo, Egypt]]; and in [[Valencia, Venezuela]], with production reaching approximately 3 million between 1984 and 2001.&lt;ref name=JalopQuantum&gt;{{cite web |last=Tracy |first=David |title=It's Incredible How Big Of A Quantum Leap The Jeep Cherokee XJ Was Over Its SJ Predecessor |url=https://jalopnik.com/its-incredible-how-big-of-a-quantum-leap-the-jeep-chero-1826390951 |publisher=Jalopnik |accessdate=7 October 2019 |date=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharing the name of the original full-size [[Jeep Cherokee (SJ)|Cherokee SJ]] model, the 1984 XJ Cherokee was Jeep's first all-new vehicle design since the 1963 [[Jeep Wagoneer (SJ)|SJ ''Wagoneer'']], was the first American [[Off-road vehicle|off-roader]] built with fully integrated body-and-frame ([[unibody]]) design,&lt;ref name=Allpar&gt;{{cite web|title=Jeep Cherokee, the best of breed SUV: 1975-2001 |url= http://www.allpar.com/trucks/jeep/cherokee.html |website=Allpar |accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became the mechanical basis for the [[Jeep Comanche|MJ]]-series [[Jeep Comanche]] [[pickup truck]] (1985–1992).

Jeep marketed XJs as ''Sportwagons,'' leading them to become precursors to the modern [[sport utility vehicle]] (SUV) before the term came into wide usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=f-QDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=Jeep+Owners+say+that+the+downsized+Sportwagons |first=Michael |last=Lamm |title=PM owners report: Jeep Cherokee/Wagoneer |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=October 1984 |pages=64, 76, 80, 166 |volume=161 |issue=10 |accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zeMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=Jeep+Sportwagon |title=4x4 of the Year (Advertisement) |page=27 |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=April 1984 |volume=161 |issue=4 |accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The XJ spawned competitors as other automakers noticed the design cannibalizing sales from regular cars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bradsher |first=Keith |title=High and Mighty: SUVs&amp;nbsp;— the World's Most Dangerous Vehicles and How They Got That Way |publisher=PublicAffairs |year=2002 |isbn=978-1-58648-123-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/highmightysuvs00brad/page/41 41] |url=https://archive.org/details/highmightysuvs00brad/page/41 }}&lt;/ref&gt; supplanting the role of the station wagon and transforming the vehicle type "from truck to limousine in the eyes of countless suburban owners."&lt;ref name="Cumberford"/&gt;

==Background==
Designs of the compact-size XJ Cherokee date back to 1978 when a team of [[American Motors]] (AMC) and [[Renault]] engineers drew several sketches. Clay models were based on the then current full-size [[Jeep Cherokee (SJ)|SJ Cherokee]]. Early sketches of the XJ Cherokee had a [[Europe]]an influence, and most of the styling cues were done by AMC engineers under the direction of [[Richard A. Teague]], vice president of design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tate |first=Robert |title=Richard Teague: Automotive Renaissance Man |url=https://www.motorcities.org/story-of-the-week/2016/richard-teague-automotive-renaissance-man |publisher=MotorCities National Heritage Area Partnership |date=29 March 2016 |accessdate=7 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noticing that [[General Motors]] was developing a new two-door S-10-based Blazer, AMC decided to develop an entirely new four-door model in addition to a two-door version. American Motors' vice president of engineering, [[Roy Lunn]], designed what is known as the "Quadra-Link" suspension, that limited rollovers.&lt;ref&gt;Bradsher, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Renault's [[François Castaing]] developed the drivetrain using a much smaller engine than normally found in 4WD vehicles and reduced the weight of the new model.&lt;ref&gt;Bradsher, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; It "is noteworthy as the first nonmilitary 4x4 with unibody construction."&lt;ref name="Brubaker107"/&gt; The unconventional design enhanced XJ's durability and off-road capability that eventually won over most critics, even those models with the early underpowered GM engines.&lt;ref name="Brubaker107"/&gt; The XJ is described "as the first small crossover SUV in the U.S.," with "plenty of the Jeep toughness (and a straight-six engine) built in."&lt;ref name="kiplinger"/&gt; The design and market positioning of the XJ, along with the [[AMC Eagle]] essentially "foreshadowed the car-based crossover utility-vehicle fad."&lt;ref name="Brubaker107"/&gt;

''"The new XJ Jeep ... was 1,200 pounds lighter, 31 inches shorter, six inches narrower and four inches lower than the Cherokee SJ it replaced, and yet — thanks to [[monocoque|unibody construction]] — the XJ kept 90 percent of its predecessor’s interior volume."'' And, not only was fuel economy much improved, but ''"articulation is also better, as is ground clearance, as well as approach, departure and breakover angles. These, along with its smaller profile, make the XJ better both off-road and on."''&lt;ref name=JalopQuantum/&gt;

Although the XJ models had just been introduced, AMC quickly began development of its successor. To compete against its much larger rivals, the smallest U.S. automaker created a business process that is now known as "[[product lifecycle management]]" (PLM) to speed up its product development process.&lt;ref name="coe.org"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.coe.org/coldfusion/newsnet/may03/technology.cfm |first=Sidney |last=Hill, Jr. |title=How To Be A Trendsetter: Dassault and IBM PLM Customers Swap Tales From The PLM Front |date=May 2003 |publisher=COE newsnet|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090213042744/http://www.coe.org/coldfusion/newsnet/may03/technology.cfm |archivedate=13 February 2009 |accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Making PLM and ERP work together |url= http://archive.onwindows.com/Articles/Making-PLM-and-ERP-work-together/5071/Default.aspx |publisher=onwindows.com |date=12 July 2012 |accessdate=6 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150227185903/http://archive.onwindows.com/Articles/Making-PLM-and-ERP-work-together/5071/Default.aspx |archivedate=27 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1985, development and engineering was based on [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) software systems while new systems stored all drawings and documents in a central database.&lt;ref name="coe.org"/&gt; The pioneering PLM was so effective that after Chrysler purchased AMC in 1987, it expanded the system throughout its own enterprise.&lt;ref name="coe.org"/&gt;

British TV presenter and motoring expert [[Quentin Willson]] described the XJ Jeep as "a real 4x4 icon" and one of the "few truly great cars... which, despite being left behind by newer models, still offer fresh and urgent possibilities. Cars which become more relevant the older they get."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-110661842 |first=Quentin |last=Willson |title=Jeep and Cheerful; Cherokee Is a Real 4x4 Icon |date=30 November 2003 |newspaper=Sunday Mirror |via=Questia Online Library |url-access=subscription |accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The XJ Cherokee introduced for the 1984 [[model year]] was the first Jeep with a ladder-boxed chassis integrated into a single [[Monocoque#Modern monocoques|monocoque]] unit rather than the traditional separate [[body-on-frame]] construction. The design was rigid and sturdy with approximately 3200 welds in a completed body, "yet wonderfully lightweight, [the] Uniframe permitted outstanding performance even with AMC's new 2.5-liter/150-cubic-inch four-cylinder engine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zQHsCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=Jeep+Sportwagon+3200+welds |title=Robotics: An Introduction |page=219 |year=1986 |editor-first=Don |editor-last=McCloy |publisher=Springer |isbn=9789401097529 |accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YkZWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Rigid+sturdy+and+yet+wonderfully+lightweight,+Uniframe+permitted+outstanding+performance+even+with+AMC's+new+2.5-liter+four-cylinder |title=Jeep |journal=Automobile Quarterly |volume=39 |issue=3 |year=1999 |page=62 |accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both two- and four-door versions of the XJ Cherokee were offered throughout its lifetime, each having exactly the same track and wheelbase measurements. Two-door models, however, received longer doors and front seats that could fold forward to assist in rear passenger entry and exit. This was in addition to extended-length rear windows that did not open, although an optional rear vent window was available on some models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fakon |first1=Kori |title=Speakers for Jeep Wrangler Sound Bar |url=https://jeepequipment.com/speakers-for-jeep-wrangler-sound-bar/ |accessdate=8 December 2019 |work=JeepEquipment |date=19 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation on the Cherokee from 1983 to 1990 was the '''Jeep Wagoneer.''' These were unrelated to the similarly named full-sized [[Jeep Wagoneer (SJ)|Grand Wagoneer]] models that had carried the Wagoneer name before this point. The compact XJ Wagoneer was available in two trim levels: the "Wagoneer" and the "Wagoneer Limited". Both Wagoneers were distinguished from the Cherokee models from 1983 to 1985 by a slightly different grille and a smaller "Jeep" emblem offset to the driver's side. Starting in 1985, they changed to two vertically stacked low and high beam headights (a.k.a. "spider eyes") with front turn signals moved behind the grille. The Wagoneer Limited came with vinyl wood trim on the sides and leather seats embossed with "Limited".

This version was the first to be sold in [[Europe]]; it was launched in 1992 in some markets, 1993 for the [[United Kingdom]]. Early versions had the 4.0-liter/242-cubic-inch inline six-cylinder engine only; the 2.5-liter (150 CID) engine did not arrive in Europe until 1995. The XJ firewall was notched to accommodate the longer 4.0&amp;nbsp;L engine.

In mid-1985, a two-wheel-drive version of the Cherokee was added to the lineup. This marked the first time any Jeep product was offered with two-wheel drive since 1967, and was done in the hopes of attracting a few more buyers who did not need (or want to pay for) four-wheel drive. When the XJ Cherokee-based Comanche (MJ) truck was introduced, it was also available in two- and four-wheel drive. The new two-wheel-drive models shared the front suspension (from the track bar, control arms, ball joints) with four-wheel-drive models. Jeep simply used a single axle tube from hub to hub with no differential between, resulting in an inexpensive front suspension.

For 1996, partially to comply with new U.S. OBD-II exhaust and evaporative emissions regulations, the engine management system was upgraded to Chrysler's then-new "JTEC" PCM. This added the side benefits of improving reliability and easing diagnostics.

American Motors's compact XJ Cherokee was to be replaced by a new and larger model known as the ZJ (later named the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] when introduced in 1993) that was under development by AMC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rothenberg |first=Al |title=Design Debate&amp;nbsp;— Who's the father of the Jeep Grand Cherokee? |journal=Ward's AutoWorld |date=1 March 1998 |url= http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_design_debate_whos/index.html |accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the smaller model's continuing popularity caused Chrysler executives to rethink this decision, and while the ZJ models were introduced in 1993, the XJ models were retained until 2001. The Jeep XJ has remained a popular choice by off-roading enthusiasts due to its potent off-roading capability in stock form. Its popularity has resulted in strong ongoing aftermarket support in the form of a wide variety of products.&lt;ref name="PM-dream"&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/news/vintage-speed/buy-your-dream-car-for-less-than-6000-jeep-cherokee-xj#slide-8 |first=Ben |last=Stewart |title=Cheap Used Cars&amp;nbsp;— Best Cars for Less Than $6,000 (slide #8) |journal=Popular Mechanics |accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fleet markets===
In the early- to mid-1990s, the Jeep Cherokee started becoming popular for government and police use. The Cherokee AHB police package was introduced during the 1992 model year. In response, for 1996, Jeep released a special version of the XJ Cherokee SE for police and fleet use. It featured no interior rear door handles and a revised 190&amp;nbsp;hp high output version of the 4.0&amp;nbsp;L "Power-Tech" inline six-cylinder engine. The new HO engine replaced the older 177&amp;nbsp;hp version of the 4.0&amp;nbsp;L engine in all installations.

The Cherokee was also made in right hand drive format, initially for the [[United States Postal Service]]. As a spin-off, it allowed Jeep in later years to enter right hand drive markets — the Cherokee went on sale in both the United Kingdom and [[Ireland]] in 1993. It was also sold in [[Japan]], but due to the country's strict [[Motor-vehicle inspection (Japan)|''"Shaken"'' motor-vehicle inspection]] laws, many used Japanese-market Cherokees have found their way back to the U.S., for use by rural mail carriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoboutique.us/ |title=Factory Built Right Hand Drive / RHD JEEPs for Rural Letter Carrier and Postal Mail Carrier |publisher=Autoboutique.us |accessdate=6 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150708045114/http://www.autoboutique.us/ |archivedate=8 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rightdrivejeeps4postal.com/about.php |title=About US Drive Right |publisher=Rightdrivejeeps4postal.com |date= |accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rightdrivejeeps4postal.com/ |title=Right-Hand Drive Postal Jeeps and Subarus for Sale |publisher=Rightdrivejeeps4postal.com |date= |accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 13 years of production, (December 1996 production) February 1997 saw the Cherokee receive updated exterior and interior styling. Both the two- and four-door bodies remained in production, receiving a steel liftgate (replacing the fiberglass one used previously), restyled taillights, additional plastic molding along the doors, as well as a new front header panel that featured more aerodynamic styling. The spare tire remained mounted to the interior rear quarter panel on the drivers side in the trunk. A new, unique spare tire carrier was invented by Peter Gruich while working for Jeep Special Programs that utilized the trailer hitch bar and a unique pivot bracket and although it was the only external spare tire carrier to pass the full Jeep durability test, it was not offered for sale.

The interior was similarly updated with an all-new design and instrument panel featuring the first blow molded symmetrical instrument panel retainer structure. This instrument panel featured a unique cluster/airbag bracket invented by Peter Gruich that allowed the interchange of the two components in order for the vehicle to be sold in the right hand and left hand drive markets with both driver and passenger airbags. A stiffer unibody frame brought improvements to [[noise, vibration, and harshness]] (NVH) measurements. Also contributing to NVH improvements were new door seals that reduced wind noise at higher speeds.

In the middle of the 1999 model year, vehicles with the 4.0&amp;nbsp;L engine received a revised intake manifold. This was done to help counteract smaller exhaust porting on the latest casting of cylinder heads, which was done to meet more stringent emissions control laws. Both the four- and six-cylinder engines were offered through the 2000 model year, though only the straight-six was available in 2001. For the 2000 and 2001 model years, all six-cylinder XJs received a distributorless ignition system using coil-on-plug ignition replacing the "traditional" system previously used; coupled with better exhaust porting and the newer intake manifolds, this gave a minor increase in power over the previous models. Transmission, axle, and transfer case choices were carried over from the previous models.

However, major changes were underway with a new executive, [[Wolfgang Bernhard]], who was known as a "cost-slasher" [[nickname]]d "whirlwind", who came from Mercedes-Benz to turn around Chrysler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ostle |first=Dorothee |title=New COO is known as a problem solver |journal=Automotive News |date=November 27, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.autoobserver.com/2007/07/new-chrysler-wolfgang-bernhard-reportedly-to-return.html |last=Krebs |first=Michelle |title=New Chrysler: Wolfgang Bernhard Reportedly to Return |publisher=Edmunds Auto Observer |date=30 July 2007 |accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "One of the first moves Bernhard made when he came to Chrysler in 2000 was to help kill the Jeep Cherokee, an aging, somewhat bland SUV."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/brandnewday/archives/2007/05/chryslers_new_o.html |last=Kiley |first=David |title=Chrysler's New Owner Has Serious Marketing Work To Do |publisher=Business Week |date=May 23, 2008 |accessdate=6 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924151557/http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/brandnewday/archives/2007/05/chryslers_new_o.html |archivedate=24 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the (XJ) Cherokee line was replaced in 2002 by the [[Jeep Liberty (KJ)]], although it retained the "Cherokee" nameplate in most foreign markets.

The Cherokee (XJ) remains a popular vehicle among off-roading enthusiasts.&lt;ref name="PM-dream" /&gt; Its design has been noted as one of the greatest of all time.&lt;ref name="Cumberford"/&gt; ''Popular Mechanics'' listed the XJ as one of "the 25 greatest boxy cars of all time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/g891/the-box-rocks-10-cars-hip-to-be-square/?slide=4 |first=Ben |last=Stewart |title=The 25 Greatest Boxy cars of All Time (slide #4) |publisher=Popular Mechanics |accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When (XJ) Cherokee production ended in May 2001, the portion of the Toledo South Assembly Plant devoted to its production was torn down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toledoblade.com/Automotive/2006/06/25/Nation-s-longest-operating-auto-plant-faces-final-days.html|first=Julie |last=McKinnon |title=Nation s longest-operating auto plant faces final days |accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fleet markets===
By 1997, the XJ Cherokee was still popular in police and government fleets. As expected, production of the Cherokee Special Service Package continued for the 1997 model year into the 2001 model year. It still had the same features as the 1996 Cherokee Special Service Package, but the engine now produced {{convert|195|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. In 2001, when the XJ Cherokee ceased production and was replaced by the [[Jeep Liberty]], the Cherokee Special Service Package was discontinued. The Jeep Liberty never featured a special service package, however, police, and government agencies used the Liberty in their fleets.

NP242 has the following settings: 2HI, 4 full-time, 4 part-time, N, 4LO

===Axles===
The Jeep XJ utilizes front and rear solid (live) axles as opposed to independent front and rear axles. This configuration allows the XJ to have superior off-road capability and performance at the expense of some on-road comfort and driveability. Mid-1985 and later two-wheel drive models used the same basic suspension with a single tube connecting axle ends with no differential.

====Front axle====
*1984–1996: [[Dana 30]], high pinion, reverse cut, 27-spline axle shafts (1989&amp;nbsp;– 1995 : with ABS used 5-297x universal joints, non-ABS had 5-260x universal joints. NP228/229 "Selec-Trac" equipped XJ models were also produced with [[constant-velocity joint]]s instead of [[universal joint]]s.)
*1996–1999: Dana 30, high pinion, reverse cut, 297x/760 universal joint, 27-spline axle shafts
*2000–2001: Dana 30, low pinion, standard cut, 297x/760 universal joint, 27-spline axle shafts
*1985–2001: straight non-driven front axle for two-wheel drive only

====Rear axle====
*1984–1989: [[Dana 35]], non c-clip, with [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS) or non-ABS; dana 44 on some models
*1987–1991: [[Dana 44]], models w/tow package only, 30-spline axle shafts, non-ABS
*1990–1996: Dana 35, c-clip, ABS or non-ABS
*1997–2001: Dana 35, c-clip, ABS
*1991–1996: Chrysler 8.25", c-clip, non-ABS, 27-spline axle shafts
*Late 1996–2001: Chrysler 8.25", c-clip, non-ABS, 29-spline axle shafts

====Axle gear ratios====
Jeep XJs came in several standard gearing ratios:
*3.07:1, manual transmission, I6 engine.
*3.54:1, automatic transmission, I6 engine with [[Dana 44]] rear differential
*3.54:1, manual transmission, I4 engine with Dana 35 rear differential
*3.55:1, automatic transmission, I6, inline 6 engines; manual transmission, I4 engine
*3.73:1, automatic transmission, I6, tow package, UpCountry package, 2.5 VM diesel manual
*4.10:1, 2.5L I4 engine, GM V6 engine manual transmission
*4.56:1, automatic transmission, I4, offroad or tow package

===Suspension===
The Jeep XJ utilizes a coil spring with a separate shock absorber front suspension and a leaf spring with a separate shock absorber rear suspension.

====Front suspension====
The Quadra-Link front suspension design locates the axle with four leading control arms to control longitudinal movement and rotation about the lateral axis (drive and braking reaction), two above the axle and two below it. A [[panhard rod]], also referred to as a track bar, is used to locate the axle laterally. Two coil springs are seated on top of the axle housing as well as two gas-charged shock absorbers. The suspension used on vehicles with the optional UpCountry package provided one inch of lift over the standard suspension. A [[sway bar]] is utilized to reduce body roll in turns.

====Rear suspension====
The XJ uses a leaf spring rear suspension. Each leaf pack contains four leaf springs with a fixed eye at the front of the spring and a compression-style shackle at the rear of the spring. Two gas-charged shock absorbers are also used, along with a mild anti-sway/anti-roll bar. The suspension used on vehicles with the optional UpCountry package did not employ the rear anti-sway/anti-roll bar and provided one inch of lift over the standard suspension.

==XJ in Europe==
[[File:Jeep Cherokee front 20071031.jpg|right|thumb|European passenger version Cherokee XJ]]

The XJ was introduced to left-hand drive European markets in 1985, one year after its American debut. However, right-hand drive European markets only began to officially receive them (in RHD form) in 1993, although a small number of personal imports had been reaching the UK in left-hand drive form for a number of years before that. Models were offered in both markets until the XJ's discontinuation in 2001, at which point it was replaced by the [[Jeep Cherokee (KJ)]] which retained the Cherokee name for sale in Europe despite sharing little mechanical heritage with its predecessor.

A van version of the XJ was offered in addition to the standard passenger vehicles in some European markets. Available in both right- and left-hand-drive models, they were designed to comply with relaxed motor tax regulations in some EU member states governing vehicles intended for primarily commercial use. Both two- and four-door versions are known to have been sold, with the main differences from the standard models being metal panels in place of the rear side windows, no rear seats, and a completely flat cargo area. [[Two wheel drive|Two-]] and [[four-wheel-drive]] variants were available, powered by the [[VM Motori]] 2.5&amp;nbsp;L [[diesel engine]] mated to the Aisin AX-15 manual transmission. Photographs of this model can be found here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.supermotors.net/vehicles/registry/7625/53419 |title=2000 Jeep Cherokee XJ Commercial Vans pictures, videos, and sounds |publisher=SuperMotors.net |date= |accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BJ2021 was available with a 2.5 litre engine and a 4 speed manual gearbox for the 1985 model year up to 2005. For 1993, a 4 litre 6 cylinder version was available paired to a 5 speed manual gearbox.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cargister.com/1993-beijing-bj-4-0-2021-cherokee-190-spec|title=1993 Beijing BJ2021 4.0 specifications}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BJ7250 uses the same 2.5 litre engine as the BJ2021 but uses a 5 speed manual gearbox instead. 

The BJ2021 is 4290 millimetres in length, 1800 millimetres in width and 1620 millimetres in height as well as sitting on a 2580 millimetre wheelbase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cargister.com/1989-beijing-bj-2021-cherokee-101-spec|title=1989 Beijing BJ2021 2.5 specifications}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BJ7250, however is 90 millimetres shorter in length, 40 millimetres shorter in width and 10 millimetres taller in height and is 5 millimetres shorter in wheelbase&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://car.autohome.com.cn/photo/18182/14/2301059.html#pvareaid=2042264||title=Beijing BJ7250 dimensions picture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production under Mercedes-Benz continued in the partnership that was renamed [[Beijing-Benz|Beijing-Benz DaimlerChrysler Automotive]]. The most recent model with an updated grille, headlights, and other upgrades was known as the '''Jeep 2500'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/nov2007/gb2007112_737100.htm |last=Dunne |first=Timothy |title=Can Chrysler Rebound in China? |publisher=Business Week |date=2 November 2007|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was produced until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.indyjeepblog.com/index.php/jeep-2500-update-chinas-xj/ |author=John W. |title=Jeep 2500 Update -China’s XJ |publisher=indy jeep |date=25 February 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100301213621/http://www.indyjeepblog.com/index.php/2009/02/ |archivedate=1 March 2010 |accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable that AMC's original Cherokee design continued to be built and sold after being virtually unchanged for over twenty years.

The design of the [[China|Chinese]] market [[Jeep]]s was similar to that of the U.S.-market [[Jeep]]s, with the exception of a new front [[grille]] and [[headlamps]], as well as new [[tail lamp]]s. The interior also got a new [[steering wheel]] and [[center console (automobile)|center console]].

The '''BJ2500''', produced by [[Beijing Jeep]] was available with the 2.4&amp;nbsp;L [[Mitsubishi Sirius engine|4G64]] engine from Mitsubishi, 2.5&amp;nbsp;L and 2.7&amp;nbsp;L engines known as C498QA. Pricing ranged from 115,000 and 127,900 yuan (16,600 to 18,470 USD) for 2.5 litre models and was 128,000 yuan for the 2.7 litre model ($18,480 USD). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://car.autohome.com.cn/config/spec/1904.html#pvareaid=3454541|title=【北京JEEP 2005款 2700 2.7L 4X4参数配置表】价格单_Jeep_汽车之家|website=car.autohome.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 4.0&amp;nbsp;L and 4.7&amp;nbsp;L engines were known as C698QA1 and C8V93Q respectively, and both power the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee (WJ)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://car.autohome.com.cn/config/spec/902.html#pvareaid=3454541|title=【大切诺基 2004款 4000 舒适型参数配置表】价格单_Jeep_汽车之家|website=car.autohome.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 2009 [[BAW|Beijing Auto Works]] continued the production of the Chinese-market XJ Cherokee as the BAW Qishi 骑士 (Knight in Chinese). The Qishi uses a 2.0 L I4 and 2.2 L I4 known as the 4G20 and 4G22,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://car.autohome.com.cn/config/spec/6686.html#pvareaid=3454541|title=【骑士S12 2011款 2.0L 两驱舒适型参数配置表】价格单_北汽制造_汽车之家|website=car.autohome.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; both old Nissan units, and a 5-slot grille, along with 6 lug wheels. Production ended in 2014. All Chinese spec Jeeps had a 5 speed manual gearbox as standard.

The BJ212 platform was used to make the car. The SHZJ213 used the 2.4 litre BAW 492 engine paired to a 5 speed manual gearbox. Production ran from 1994 until 1997. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chinacarhistory.com/2017/10/18/the-shuanghuan-shzj213-is-not-a-jeep-cherokee-xj-but-not-totally-not/|title=The Shuanghuan SHZJ213 Is Not A Jeep Cherokee XJ But Not Totally Not|first=Author Tycho de|last=Feijter|date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cherokee name revival in the U.S.==
:''See also [[Jeep Cherokee (KL)]]''

On February 22, 2013, Chrysler released press photos of the new replacement for the Liberty, and also announced that the new model would bring back the Cherokee name. The new Cherokee is built on the [[Compact U.S. Wide platform|compact U.S. wide platform]], and features a nine-speed automatic, a choice of a 2.4&amp;nbsp;L Tigershark I4 with [[Fiat]]'s electro-hydraulic [[MultiAir 2]] variable valve timing and variable valve lift or a 3.2&amp;nbsp;L V6 based on the [[Pentastar]] 3.6&amp;nbsp;L V6, and front and four-wheel drive (the latter courtesy of Jeep's [[Selec-Terrain]] system).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Harley |first=Michael |title=2014 Jeep Cherokee flaunts its new contemporary curves |url= http://www.autoblog.com/2013/03/27/2014-jeep-cherokee-flaunts-its-new-contemporary-curves/ |date=27 March 2013|publisher=Autoblog.com |accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jeep Liberty]] was sold outside of North America as the Jeep Cherokee (KK), allowing the new Cherokee to be easily marketed globally. Jeep also believes the Cherokee name will attract previous Jeep owners, because of the name's heritage. The new Cherokee is built in Toledo, Ohio. As of mid 2017 the new Cherokee (KL) is produced in Belvidere, Illinois.

The '''Jeepster Commando''' is an automobile which was first produced by [[Kaiser Jeep]] in 1966 to compete with the [[International Scout]], [[Toyota Land Cruiser]] and [[Ford Bronco]].  Four different models were available: a [[pickup truck]], [[convertible (car)|convertible]], [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]] and [[Station wagon|wagon]].  The Kaiser line remained in production until about 1969, when [[American Motors Corporation]] (AMC) bought Kaiser in 1970.  After AMC's acquisition, the Jeepster Commando C101 (101" wheelbase) steadily grew in popularity.  In 1972, AMC shortened the vehicle's name to Commando C104, extended the wheelbase to 104", and changed the front-end design to accept the AMC I6 and V8 304ci, similar to the Ford Bronco.  The new configuration, formerly an AMC best seller, quickly caused the line to drop in popularity and was taken out of production in 1973; it was replaced with the full size [[Jeep Cherokee (SJ)|Cherokee]]. The Jeepster is an ancestor of the modern [[Jeep]] family produced by [[Chrysler]].

There are several Jeepster enthusiast clubs across the [[United States]].

[[Willys|Willys-Overland]], the original producers of the "Jeep" (originally manufactured for military use), also produced a "[[Willys-Overland Jeepster|Jeepster]]" from 1948 until about 1950. This vehicle led to the later Kaiser productions.

==C101==
The Jeepster was revived in 1966 as a 1967 model in the form of the '''Jeepster Commando''' ("C101"). The F-head ''[[Willys Hurricane engine|Hurricane]]'' [[inline-four engine|straight-4]] was used (a direct descendant of the original Go Devil engine) and [[four-wheel drive]] was finally added. This engine produced  {{convert|75|hp|0}} at 4000&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|114|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of [[torque]] at 2000&amp;nbsp;rpm. The {{convert|160|hp|0}} ''[[Buick V6 engine|Dauntless]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] was optional and preferred with its  {{convert|235|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. A total of 57,350 Kaiser-spec "C101" Jeepster Commandos were sold between 1966 and 1971.

Body styles of the Jeepster Commando included station wagon (with full-length metal hardtop), convertible, pickup, and roadster (with optional half- or full-length softtop). The deluxe station wagon included sliding rear windows and full interior trim—and available two-tone exterior.

The 1971  '''Hurst Jeepster''' built with modifications by [[Hurst Performance]] is possibly the scarcest model of all production Jeeps.&lt;ref name=hurstj&gt;[http://www.hemmings.com/mus/stories/2005/06/01/hmn_feature1.html Foster, Pat. "The Forgotten Hurst" ''Hemmings Muscle Machines'',  June 1, 2005] retrieved on August 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Standard equipment included a Champagne White exterior with red and blue stripes, a roof rack, a sports steering wheel, and Goodyear G70 x 15 raised white letter tires mounted on wider steel wheels. Hurst equipment included special exterior insignia, an 8,000-rpm  [[tachometer]] on the back of the hood scoop in the driver's line of sight, as well as a Hurst T-handle shifter on manual-transmission cars or a console-mounted Hurst Dual-Gate shifter with the optional automatic transmission.&lt;ref name=hurstj/&gt;

The Jeepster Commando came in three types: Revival Jeepster, Commando convertible, and an open body roadster with no top at all. The Revival Jeepster, named "Jeepster", as shown in hood side emblem an [[Vehicle Identification Number|VIN]] decode or ''Jeepster Convertible'' was the showcase vehicle of the fleet, offering deluxe interior appointments, powered convertible top, and a [[Continental tire]] kit (available only for this model). The Commando convertible offered the same body with just the basic finish and equipment.

[[File:Jeep Commando C-104.jpg|right|thumb|1972 Jeep Commando (C104)]]
The Jeepster name was removed after 1971, but the model remained in production for two more years as the '''Jeep Commando'''. In 1972, it received a "conventional" full-width grille (see picture). The Commando had one of three [[American Motors|AMC]] engines, the {{convert|232|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} or {{convert|258|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC Straight-6 engine#232|AMC Straight-6]] or the {{convert|304|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|AMC V8]]. A total of 20,223 AMC-spec "C104" Jeep Commandos were made in 1972 and 1973.

The '''Jeep Cherokee''' (KL) is a [[compact car|compact]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2018-jeep-cherokee-in-depth-model-review&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/jeep/cherokee&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jeep.com/2018/cherokee.html/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[crossover SUV]] manufactured and marketed by the [[Jeep]] subdivision of [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]]. Introduced for [[model year]] 2014 at the [[New York International Auto Show#2013|2013 New York International Auto Show]], sales began in November 2013.&lt;ref name="NY Daily news" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeep.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeep.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeep.com/en/2014/cherokee/|title=The All-New 2014 Jeep Cherokee|accessdate=March 7, 2013|work=[[Jeep]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112184312/http://www.jeep.com/en/2014/cherokee/|archive-date=November 12, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cherokee is the first Jeep vehicle to use the [[Fiat Compact platform|Fiat Compact/Compact Wide platform]], co-developed by Chrysler and Fiat.&lt;ref name="Autoblog" /&gt; The Jeep Cherokee is built at [[Belvidere Assembly Plant]] in [[Belvidere, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt;

The Cherokee was first previewed by Jeep in February 2013, shortly after the brand released three newly designed versions of its popular vehicles, the [[Jeep Compass]], [[Jeep Patriot]], and [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]]. Jeep announced that the all-new vehicle would be named the Cherokee, and also that the new vehicle would make its official debut at the [[New York International Auto Show#2013|New York International Auto Show]] in March 2013. The Cherokee's official debut was made on Wednesday, March 27, 2013.

Jeep adopted the Cherokee name worldwide. The [[North American]] market saw the Cherokee [[nameplate]] for the first time since the 2001 departure of the [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)]]. Other markets retained the Cherokee name with the introduction of the [[Jeep Liberty]] in the [[North American]] markets.

The all-new Cherokee's [[wheelbase]] is {{convert|106.3|in|mm|0}}, {{convert|1.1|in|mm}} longer than the 1993 [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]],  {{convert|5.1|in|mm}} longer than its predecessor, the Jeep Cherokee XJ, and {{convert|2.7|in|mm}} shorter than the original [[Jeep Cherokee (SJ)]].

==Four-wheel drive systems==
The Jeep Cherokee can be equipped with three different [[four-wheel drive|four-wheel drive systems]]: [[Active Drive I]], [[Active Drive II]], and [[Active Drive Lock]]. All of these systems come with Jeep's [[Selec-Terrain]] traction control system and rear-axle disconnect feature. The rear axle disconnect feature, a first for Compact SUV, disconnects the rear-axle when four-wheel drive is not needed. This lowers [[parasitic load|parasitic drivetrain load]]; which improves fuel efficiency.&lt;ref name="Autoblog" /&gt;

==Trim levels==
[[File:Jeep Cheerokee - wnętrze (MSP16).jpg|thumb|right|Interior]]
Upon introduction the Cherokee is available in four trim levels:

===Sport===
The '''Sport''' serves as the base model. It includes seventeen-inch steel wheels, the Uconnect 5.0 [[touch screen]] radio, six speakers, cloth seating surfaces, a 2.4L [[Tigershark engine|Tigershark]] I4 engine, nine-speed [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] [[automatic transmission]], and more. It comes in both 4x2 and 4x4. In 2015, the 3.2L [[Pentastar]] [[V6]] also became available on this model. Seventeen-inch alloy wheels are available as part of the Sport Appearance Package. The Sport was replaced with the Latitude starting in 2019.

===Latitude===
The '''Latitude''' adds [[alloy wheels]] and body-colored door handles and side view mirrors. It comes in both 4x2 and 4x4. In Canada, the model is dubbed North 4x2 or North 4x4. The "Latitude" comes with the 8.4" Uconnect and premium sound option as standard, whereas on the "North" it is an optional upgrade. There is an Altitude model that was introduced in spring 2014 that is based on the Latitude model and adds black [[alloy]] wheels and blacked-out accents. The Latitude model will be [[Jeep]]'s volume seller of the Cherokee line. The Latitude became the new base model Cherokee in 2019, replacing the Sport, and a new Latitude Plus trim was introduced to take the place of the old Latitude model.

===Trailhawk===
The '''Trailhawk''' adds dark-colored [[alloy wheels]], the Uconnect 8.4A [[touch screen]] radio with [[9-1-1]] emergency assistance, [[roadside assistance]], and support for [[Mobile app|apps]]. It comes in 4x4 model only, is Trail Rated®, and is a far more off-road capable model.  The Trailhawk includes recovery hooks for towing a stuck vehicle and a mechanical rear locker. Both Trailhawk L and Trailhawk Elite models became available starting in 2017, adding uplevel features to the base Trailhawk model.

===Limited===
The '''Limited''' serves as the top-of-the-line model, and adds bright-finished [[alloy wheels]], and [[leather]] seating surfaces. It comes in both 4x2 and 4x4. It also adds the U Connect ACCESS 8.4A touch-screen infotainment system, heated dual front seats, and Keyless Go with push-button and remote starter systems.

The '''Altitude Edition''' is based on the midlevel Latitude model, and adds features to the model such as gloss black eighteen-inch alloy wheels, a black lower front fascia accent, gloss black grille surrounds, gloss black roof rails, gloss black exterior badges, black window surround moldings, and an all-black leather interior. Also included is Chrysler's award-winning U Connect ACCESS 8.4A radio, with an A/M-F/M stereo, SIRIUS-XM Satellite Radio, an optional single-disc player (mounted in the center console), iPod and USB input jacks, a 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input jack, U Connect ACCESS W/ hands-free calling, 9-1-1 Assist, Wi-Fi connectivity for wireless internet access in the vehicle, wireless audio streaming, voice command, a full color touch-screen display, optional Garmin GPS navigation, and more. The model became available in 2015, and has a base price of $25,495.00 MSRP, up only $600.00 MSRP from the '''Latitude''' model it is based on, and is only available in Granite Crystal Metallic, Billet Silver Metallic, Bright White Clear Coat, or Brilliant Black Crystal Pearl Coat Metallic, all of which compliment the gloss black exterior accents.

All trim levels include the 2.4L Tigershark I4 engine, and all also offer the optional 3.2L Pentastar V6 engine, with either 4X2 or 4X4 available on Sport, Latitude, and Limited models, and the Trailhawk model having standard 4X4. The Active Drive II 4X4 system with off-road suspension is optional on all models other than the base Sport model, though the Trailhawk model has the Active Drive II 4X4 system with off-road suspension as standard equipment.  All models have a ZF-developed nine-speed automatic transmission, the first of its kind to be installed into a production vehicle.

Models equipped with factory towing feature 3.517:1 final drive ratio (V6) or 4.048:1 (I4) and can tow up to {{Convert|4500|lb|0|abbr=on}} (US market).  Models not equipped with factory towing have 3.251:1 (V6) or 3.734:1 (I4) and are limited to a {{Convert|2000|lb|0|abbr=on}} tow capacity (US market).

In January 2016, [[Jeep]] announced the Cherokee '''Overland''', which will now serve as the top-of-the-line, and most luxurious, Cherokee trim level in the United States. It will add these features in addition to the previously top-of-the-line Limited trim level:

-Exterior Color-Keyed Front and Rear Fascias with Chrome Accents
-Exterior Color-Keyed Front and Rear Wheel Wells 
-Eighteen-Inch (18") Fully-Polished Alloy Wheels
-U Connect ACCESS 8.4AN Infotainment System (A/M-F/M [[HD Radio]], [[SiriusXM]] [[Satellite Radio]], U Connect ACCESS Services and 9-1-1 Emergency Calling, Mobile App Support, ParkView Rear-View Backup Camera, Full Color Touch-Screen Display (8.4"), [[Garmin]]-Based GPS Navigation, iPod/USB Ports, 3.5-Millimeter Auxiliary Audio Input Jack, MicroSD Card Slot, and Bluetooth for Hands-Free Calling and A2DP Wireless Stereo Audio Streaming)

The '''Overland''' will offer either the 184-horsepower 2.4L [[Tigershark]] Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine, or the 271-horsepower 3.2L [[Pentastar]] V6 engine with Stop-and-Go Technology, as well as Two-Wheel-Drive or Four-Wheel-Drive (Four-Wheel-Drive with [[Jeep]]'s "Active-Drive II" transfer case). Exterior colors are Billet Silver Metallic, Light Brownstone Metallic, Bright White Clear Coat, Deep Cherry Red Metallic, and Brilliant Black Crystal Pearl Coat Metallic. Interior colors are either Black or Pearl. Two-Wheel-Drive models start at $34,695.00 MSRP, while Four-Wheel-Drive models start at $38,395.00 MSRP. The models will become available in Spring, 2016.

In addition, a '''75th Anniversary Edition''' model made its debut in January, 2016 to celebrate [[Jeep]]'s 75th Anniversary. Based on the Latitude trim level of the Cherokee, exclusive features include a Recon Green Metallic exterior paint color option, unique 75th Anniversary Edition exterior emblems, bronze-painted exterior accents, bronze-painted eighteen-inch (18") alloy wheels, premium cloth seating surfaces with "Ombre" mesh inserts and 75th Anniversary Edition embroidery, and bronze-accented interior trim. The U Connect ACCESS 8.4A infotainment system, as well as a full panoramic power moonroof are both standard on this model, as is deep-tinted glass and automatic front head and fog lamps. The trim level starts at $27,875.00 MSRP, and will be available in Spring, 2016

==Pricing and availability==

In June 2013, [[Jeep]] announced the pricing on the all-new Cherokee. The base Sport FWD model will start at $22,995 [[MSRP]]. The Latitude FWD model will start at $24,495 [[MSRP]]. The Trailhawk 4x4 model will start at $29,495, and the top-of-the-line Limited FWD model will start at $27,995 [[MSRP]].

The all-new Cherokee began production in the spring of 2013, but Jeep has pushed back the release date of the Cherokee to allow time for the development of the nine-speed [[automatic transmission]] by [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]]. The all-new Cherokee arrived at dealerships in mid-fall 2013.

In late summer 2013, Jeep announced that it would temporarily cease production of its all-new Cherokee due to a transmission [[software]] issue. A few thousand Cherokees had already been produced, and would remain at the [[factory]] until a fix could be issued. In October 2013, a software fix was issued to the Cherokee, resuming production of the vehicle, and shipped it to dealerships in the U.S. By November the sales have started well in both the US and Canada, with at least four weeks of stock depletion due to pre-order. Chrysler has stated on 11 December 2013 the Cherokee advertisement campaign with the tagline Built Free to be the most successful one since the introduction of the 2011 Dodge Charger.

The Cherokee was introduced in Europe in the spring of 2014. To meet the demands of European buyers the model was fitted with one or more diesel powertrains, most likely one or more versions of the FIAT Multijet engine with a displacement of 2.0L and 170 PS (125&amp;nbsp;kW; 168&amp;nbsp;hp).

The Cherokee underwent a refresh for model year 2019 and lost its split headlights.&lt;ref&gt;http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/updated-2018-jeep-cherokee-will-sport-very-different-styling&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powertrain==

The Cherokee features [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]]'s 2.4L Tigershark [[Inline-four engine|I4]] engine that produces a maximum output of {{convert|187|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|232|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque. It has a fuel economy of 31 [[miles per gallon]],&lt;ref name="Autoblog"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harley|first=Michael|title=2014 Jeep Cherokee flaunts its new contemporary curves|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2013/03/27/2014-jeep-cherokee-flaunts-its-new-contemporary-curves/|work=autoblog.com|publisher=[[Autoblog.com]]|accessdate=27 March 2013|date=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is 45% better than the Liberty/Cherokee it replaces,&lt;ref name="Jeep.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewdepaula/2013/02/26/2014-jeep-cherokee-polarizes-with-new-design/|title=Jeep Revives Cherokee For 2014 With Polarizing New Design|accessdate=February 27, 2013|work=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a driving range of {{convert|495|mi|km}}.

Optional for the Cherokee is [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]]'s new 3.2L [[Pentastar]] [[V6]] engine, It achieves 29 MPG and produces {{convert|275|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|324|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque. The Cherokee is [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]]'s first product to feature the all-new engine.

In select markets, [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles|FCA]] offers an all-new 2.2L [[Multijet]] II [[common rail|common rail direct injection]] [[turbodiesel]] with {{convert|185|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} or {{convert|200|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|440|Nm|abbr=on|0}} of torque, achieving fuel economy of 49.6 MPG&lt;sub&gt;imp&lt;/sub&gt; combined.

Cherokees for sale in the United States feature [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]]'s new nine-speed [[automatic transmission]], designed by [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] and manufactured by Chrysler. Cherokees for sale in Europe may feature a 6 speed manual transmission.&lt;ref name="allpar.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/SUVs/jeep/2014-cherokee.html |title=2014 Jeep Cherokee SUV: modern midsize SUV |publisher=Allpar.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only is the Cherokee the first [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]] vehicle to feature a nine-speed transmission, it is the first [[sport utility vehicle]] to feature a nine-speed transmission. The transmission yields approximately two additional miles per gallon with the V6 engine option compared to a six speed automatic.&lt;ref name="allpar.com"/&gt;

[[Front-wheel-drive]] and [[four-wheel-drive]] models are available, with [[Jeep]]'s [[Selec-Terrain]] system being available on the latter. These are named differently depending on the markets, with the FWD being slightly less expensive.

==Transmission issues==
The Cherokee was the first vehicle to market to use ZF's new 9 speed automatic transaxle. It features an unconventional design that reduces its size and increases fuel economy over more conventional transmissions, but increases its complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ZF 9-Speed Automatic Transmission for Chrysler cars: 9HP, 948TE, 928TE|url=http://www.allpar.com/mopar/transmissions/ZF9.html|website=Allpar|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial release of the Cherokee was delayed several weeks citing quality concerns with the transmission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lienert|first1=Anita|title=Shipping Starts on Delayed 2014 Jeep Cherokee|url=http://www.edmunds.com/car-news/shipping-starts-on-delayed-2014-jeep-cherokee.html|website=Edmunds.com|accessdate=29 April 2015|date=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and multiple reports of issues with shift quality and reliability surfaced shortly after launch. Both 2014 and 2015 Cherokees have a high number of consumer complaints on safecar.gov and carcomplaints.com compared to similar models of its class, with the vast majority of complaints being related to the transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Jeep Cherokee Problems and Complaints|url=http://www.carcomplaints.com/Jeep/Cherokee/2014/|website=carcomplaints.com|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Jeep Cherokee Complaints|url=http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/owners/SearchResults?prodType=V&amp;searchType=PROD&amp;targetCategory=A&amp;searchCriteria.model=CHEROKEE&amp;stats=1977408%2C1%2C1%2C77%2C1%2CCHEROKEE&amp;makeStats=&amp;jsonBaseURL=%2Fdownloads%2Ffolders%2F&amp;searchCriteria.model_yr=2015&amp;searchCriteria.make=JEEP&amp;searchCriteria.prod_ids=1977408|website=safecar.gov|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; FCA's chief quality officer was forced to leave shortly after a poor Consumer Reports review on the dependability of models including the Cherokee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vellequette|first1=Larry|title=Betts leaves Chrysler after another poor quality showing|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20141028/OEM02/141029851/betts-leaves-chrysler-after-another-poor-quality-showing|website=Automotive News|accessdate=29 April 2015|date=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so far Chrysler has released 3 software updates for the 2014-2015 Cherokee transmission. The company continues to assert that the problem is software related. However, Chrysler is repairing some Cherokee models' transmission "snap ring" to address durability concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Fixing the 9 Speeds Just a "Snap?"|url=http://allparnews.com/index.php/2015/04/is-fixing-the-9-speeds-just-a-snap-28459|website=Allpar|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple vehicles that use the same ZF model transmission, such as the [[Range Rover Evoque]], [[Honda Pilot]], [[Acura TLX]], [[Chrysler 200]], and even the similarly built [[Jeep Renegade (BU)|Jeep Renegade]] have had issues of varying severity as well. ZF, the transmission's designer, also insists that the issue is with software, and would not comment on any improvements being made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holy Shift: ZF 9-speed Automatic Problems Mount, Chrysler Releases Third Software Update for Jeep Cherokee|url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/holy-shift-zf-9-speed-automatic-problems-mount-chrysler-releases-third-software-update-for-jeep-cherokee/|website=Car &amp; Driver Blog|accessdate=29 April 2015|date=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of August 2016, ZF has issued a recall regarding the 9 speed automatic transmission affecting 505,000 vehicles.  ZF is quoted for suggesting the issues are related to a faulty control sensor could cause the transmission to randomly drop into neutral while driving.

These transmission issues delayed the release of the all-new 2014 [[Jeep]] Cherokee KL to consumers until late summer 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jeepproblems.com/trends/9-speed-transmission-problems/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software hack ==
In July 2015, [[FCA US LLC|FCA]] issued a [[product recall|recall]] of 1.4 million vehicles after a software glitch was discovered which would allow hackers to wirelessly hijack vehicles and electronically control vital functions.&lt;ref name="Hackers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hackers Remotely Kill a Jeep on the Highway—With Me in It|url= https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/ |accessdate = 2015-07-22|website=Wired |last=Greenberg|first=Andy|date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; IT security researchers [[Charlie Miller (security researcher)|Charlie Miller]] and [[Chris Valasek]] hacked a 2014 Jeep Cherokee and gained access to the car over the Internet, which allowed them to control the vehicle's radio, A/C, and windshield wipers, as well as the Cherokee's steering, brakes and [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]].&lt;ref name="Hackers" /&gt; Chrysler published a [[Patch (computing)|patch]] that car owners can download and install via a USB stick, or have a car dealer install for them.&lt;ref name="Hackers" /&gt;

The software glitch impacted the 2014-2015 [[Jeep]] Cherokee, as well as the 2015 [[Chrysler 200]], the 2015 [[Chrysler 300]], the 2015 [[Dodge Charger]], the 2015 [[Dodge Challenger]], the 2013-2014 SRT and [[Dodge Viper]], the 2014-2015 [[Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK2)]], and the 2013-2015 [[Ram Truck]] 1500'through 5500. All vehicles were equipped with either the U Connect 3C 8.4A (RA3) or the U Connect 3C 8.4AN (RA4) infotainment systems, which featured U Connect ACCESS, and used a [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] [[3G]] [[CDMA]] wireless connection in the vehicle to access services and apps. Vehicles equipped with the U Connect 2 3.0/3.0BT (RA1), the U Connect 3 5.0BT (RA2), and the U Connect 6.5A (RA4) were unaffected by the software glitch, as those radios did NOT feature a built-in wireless connection. Vehicles equipped with the older U Connect 3 8.4A (RE2) and the older U Connect 8.4N (RB5) infotainment systems were also unaffected for the same reason.

== Production relocation ==

In late 2015, [[FCA US LLC]] announced that it would move production of the [[Jeep]] Cherokee to their [[Belvidere Assembly]] facility, where the [[Jeep Compass]] and [[Jeep Patriot]], as well as the [[Dodge Dart (PF)]] were produced until 2016. The [[Belvidere Assembly]] facility would not have to be retooled in order to produce the Cherokee, and the production change would most likely take place after the Dart is discontinued following the 2017 [[model year]].  FCA announced on July 14, 2016 to invest $700M into the plant and add 700 jobs to the [[Toledo Complex|Toledo North]]. An announcement regarding the future of the South plant will be made at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbc24.com/news/local/fca-to-invest-700m-add-700-jobs-to-toledo-plant|title=FCA to invest $700M, add 700 jobs to Toledo plant - nbc24|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=NBC 24 Toledo|access-date=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Production in Toledo ended in spring 2017. 949,151 units were built between 2013 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/news/2017/04/last-toledo-cherokee-37092 |title=The last Toledo Cherokee |publisher=Allpar.com |date=2017-04-08 |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facelift==

The restyled 2019 [[Jeep]] Cherokee KL made its debut at the [[North American International Auto Show#2018|2018 North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] on January 16, 2018.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;https://www.jeep.com/2019/cherokee.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The front grille on the Cherokee has been moved down slightly to allow for larger front headlamps with [[LED]] daytime running lamps (DRL's), and the turn signals are now integrated into the front headlamps. All trim levels of the new Cherokee receive new wheel designs. The rear end of the 2019 Cherokee resembles the rear end of the second-generation [[Jeep Compass]], with similar [[LED]] rear tail lamps.

On the interior, the Cherokee has changed little from the pre-facelifted 2014-18 version. Some trim levels of the Cherokee receive new seat fabrics, and all trim levels receive improved interior materials (all trim levels receive new interior color schemes). The [[infotainment]] systems have also been upgraded to the fourth-generation U Connect 4 systems. The base system (U Connect 4 7.0) replaces the previous U Connect 3 5.0BT radio on base trim levels, and the U Connect 4C 8.4 systems replace the U Connect 3C systems, adding [[4G]] [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] [[Wi Fi]] connectivity, [[SiriusXM]] Guardian service for either six months when not equipped with GPS navigation, or one year when equipped with GPS navigation. All systems receive an improved [[User Interface]] (UI), and standard [[Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]] The larger U Connect 4C 8.4 systems integrate with the [[SiriusXM]] Guardian [[smartphone]] application for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]], as well as an application for [[smartwatches]] such as the [[Apple Watch]] and [[Android Wear]] devices, as well as integration with [[Amazon Alexa]] ([[Amazon Echo]]) devices, which was first introduced on the 2018 Cherokee Latitude Plus with the Tech Connect Package (the Latitude Plus with Tech Connect Package is no longer available for 2019, as its features have been integrated into the 2019 [[Jeep]] Cherokee lineup).

Engine choices for the 2019 Cherokee include the previously-available 180-horsepower 2.4L Multi-Air Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) and the 271-horsepower 3.2L [[Pentastar]] VVT [[V6]] gasoline-powered units, though the [[V6]] engine now comes as standard equipment on the upper trim levels of the Cherokee, where it was previously optional. However, a new engine, the 2.0L Hurricane Turbocharged Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine is now available on higher trim levels of the Cherokee, and produces 270 horsepower. All engines remain mated to a [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]]-manufactured [[948TE]] 9-speed automatic transmission, with a choice of either Front Wheel Drive (FWD) or Four Wheel Drive (4WD). All engines and transmissions receive improvements for improved reliability and fuel economy.

While only the uplevel Limited and Trailhawk trims were shown at its debut, the 2019 [[Jeep]] Cherokee will be available in Latitude, Latitude Plus, Limited, Trailhawk, Overland, and Trailhawk Elite trims. The all-new 2019 Cherokee went on sale at [[Jeep]] dealerships in the [[United States]] in early 2018 as an early 2019 [[model year]] vehicle.

Pricing for the new 2019 Jeep Cherokee, without options, is as follows:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

*  Latitude (Base Model, Replacing Sport) : $24,690 (FWD), $26,190 (4WD)
* Latitude Plus (Volume Model): $26,495 (FWD), $27,995 (4WD)
* Limited (Luxury Model): $30,375 (FWD), $33,620 (4WD)
* Trailhawk (Off-Road Capable Model): $33,320 (4WD)
* Overland (Top-of-the-Line Model): $36,275 (FWD), $37,775 (4WD)
* Trailhawk Elite (Top-of-the-Line and Off-Road Capable Model, Replacing Trailhawk "L"): $36,315 (4WD)

Production of the [[Jeep]] Cherokee was relocated from the [[Toledo Complex]] in [[Toledo, Ohio]] to the [[Belvidere Assembly Plant]] in [[Belvidere, Illinois]] that once produced the first-generation [[Jeep Compass]] MK and [[Jeep Patriot]], and the [[Dodge Dart (PF)]], in late 2017 in order to accommodate production of the all-new 2018 [[Jeep Wrangler (JL)]]. Both plants received an extensive retooling in order to produce their respective vehicles. The [[Belvidere Assembly Plant]] temporarily closed for retooling following production of the final 2017 [[Jeep Compass]] MK and [[Jeep Patriot]] in December 2016.

[[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]] has released a [[television commercial]] for the [[United States]] market restyled 2019 Cherokee, entitled "The World Comes With It",&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ispot.tv/ad/wcaE/jeep-spring-sales-event-world-comes-with-it-2019-cherokee&lt;/ref&gt; which also appears on the manufacturer's website for the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jeep.com/cherokee.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other markets==

The '''Jeep Wrangler''' is a series of compact and mid-size (Wrangler Unlimited and Wrangler 2-door JL) [[four-wheel drive]] [[off-road vehicle|off-road]] [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]]s, manufactured by [[Jeep]] since 1986, and currently in its fourth generation. The [[Jeep Wrangler (JL)|Wrangler JL]], the most recent generation, was unveiled in late 2017 and is produced at Jeep's [[Toledo Complex]].

The Wrangler is arguably an indirect progression from the [[Willys MB|World War II Jeep]], through the [[Jeep CJ|CJ (Civilian Jeeps)]] produced by [[Willys]], [[Kaiser-Jeep]] and [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]] (AMC) from the mid-1940s through 1980s. Although neither AMC nor Chrysler (after its purchase of AMC in 1987) have claimed that the Wrangler was a direct descendant of the original military model — both the CJ Jeeps and the conceptually consistent Wrangler, with their solid axles and open top, have been called the Jeep model as central to Jeep's brand identity as the rear-engined 911 is to Porsche.&lt;ref name=CurbClassic&gt;[http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-american/curbside-classic-kaiser-jeep-cj-5-transcendent-independent/ Curbside Classic: Kaiser Jeep CJ-5 – Transcendent Independent]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the [[Willys MB]] and the [[Jeep CJ|CJ Jeeps]] before it, all Wrangler models continue to use a separate body and frame, rigid [[solid axle|live axles]] both front and rear, a tapering nose design with flared fenders, a fold-flat windshield, and can be driven without doors. Also, with few exceptions, they have part-time [[Jeep four-wheel-drive systems|four-wheel drive systems]], with the choice of high and low gearing, and standard are open bodies with removable hard- or soft-tops. However, the Wrangler series was specifically redesigned to be safer and more comfortable on-road, to attract more daily drivers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4-the-love-of-jeeps.com/jeep-wrangler.html |title=Jeep Wrangler: The Real Thing or Compromise? |publisher=4-the-love-of-jeeps.com |date=1995-03-21 |accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; by upgrading its suspension, drivetrain, and interior, compared to the CJ line. The suspension on all Wranglers included [[Panhard rod|trackbars]] and [[anti-roll bar]]s, and, from the 1997 TJ onwards, front and rear coil springs instead of the previous leaf-springs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lee |first=Christian |title=High-Performance Jeep Wrangler TJ Builder's Guide |date=2007 |publisher=CarTech |isbn=9781932494266 |pages=74-75 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HlbCM7VEmroC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=Jeep+wrangler+coil+spring+suspension |accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2004 on, the Wrangler has been complemented with long-wheelbase versions, called Wrangler ''Unlimited'' (until the release of the JK generation). 2004-2006 models were longer versions with 2 doors. In 2004 only automatic transmission equipped “Unlimited” versions were sold. In 2005 both an automatic and manual 6-speed (NSG-370) were offered. Since 2007, the long-wheelbase Wranglers were four-door models, offering over {{convert|20|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} more room. By mid 2017 the four-door models represented three quarters of all new Wranglers on the market.&lt;ref name=2DrFail&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.autotrader.com/car-news/every-single-two-door-suv-has-failed-266841 |title=Every Single Two-Door SUV Has Failed |first=Doug |last=DeMuro |date=June 2017 |work=Autotrader |accessdate=2017-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Outwardly strongly resembling the [[Jeep CJ-7]], the first Wrangler, which was formally announced in February 1986 at the 1986 [[Chicago Auto Show]], was based on a new set of design parameters. "The product philosophy behind the two vehicles" [[François Castaing]] (AMC VP of Product Engineering) explained, "is completely different".&lt;ref&gt;"Jeep Wrangler" by Robert Ackerson pg.7-  Veloce Publishing; 1st edition (March 17, 2006){{ISBN|1904788971}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the 1987 Wrangler YJ continued to use a separate body and frame, with the same wheelbase as the CJ-7, and still [[solid axle]]s both front and rear, it was a significantly new design, that borrowed its suspension, drivetrain, and interior from the 1984 Cherokee (XJ) model.&lt;ref&gt;"The Story of The Jeep" –Patrick Foster : page 200-201: Krause Publ.; 2 edition, {{ISBN|087349735X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new car had a wider track, slightly less [[ride height|ground clearance]], more comfort and improved handling. The YJ still had [[leaf spring suspension]] similar to that of the CJ – however the springs were wider, and the first Wrangler sported [[Panhard rod|trackbar]] [[suspension link]]s and [[anti-roll bar]]s for improved handling and safety, making it less easy to flip by untrained or unwary drivers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.allpar.com/SUVs/wrangler/jeep-name.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wrangler debuted in 1986 as a new model after discontinuance of the famous Jeep CJ series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsilike.in/history-of-the-jeep-wrangler/#.WfF9r2iCzIU|title=History of the Jeep Wrangler|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revised in 1996, and completely redesigned in 2006. In addition to the model name ''Wrangler'', each model received a designation corresponding to its generation: YJ (1986–1995), TJ (1997–2006), TJU's (commonly known as LJs- 2004–2006 Unlimited models, or YJL, in the Egyptian owners manual.), JKU (2007–2017 Unlimited models) and JK (2007–2017), and the latest JL model, introduced for the 2018 model year. Foreign military versions of the Wrangler have carried the J8 designation which was initially dubbed TJL when first produced at Arab American Vehicle's Egyptian plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wrangler "TJL" diesel technical specifications |url=http://www.aav.com.eg/diesel_data.html|work=AAV|accessdate=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeep YJ models were manufactured between 1986 and 1995 at [[Brampton Assembly]], and subsequently at the [[Toledo South Assembly]] plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/26/business/company-news-chrysler-plans-to-close-plant.html |title=Company News; Chrysler Plans To Close Plant |newspaper=The New York Times |date=26 July 1990 |accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major difference in the 1987–1995 models were the rectangular headlights, which reverted to rounded ones in the TJ and then JK versions.  In 2006, Wrangler production was moved to [[Toledo Complex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Julie M. |last=McKinnon |url= http://www.toledoblade.com/Automotive/2007/02/11/Bumpy-at-first-assembly-smooths-out-for-Wrangler.html |title=Bumpy at first, assembly smooths out for Wrangler |newspaper=The Toledo Blade |date=11 February 2007 |accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-2006 Wranglers were set apart from their predecessors by the angle of the grille. In all previous models, the grille was flat and even with the front fenders. The newer Wrangler was constructed with a grille which angled out from the top, and then continued in a straight line from the midway point, toward the bottom. This decreased the hood length, while increasing the length of the fenders. In more recent models, this angle has been lowered more toward the bottom of the grille.

In Egypt, the YJ was produced as well as a long wheel-base version, dubbed LJ (or labeled as YJL in Egypt's Owners Manual), and which has retained the 2-door design. The YJL is considered as the first predecessor of the JK's long wheel-base by continuing as TJL (aka J8) which has directly inspired the JK's 4-door.

There is a Wrangler-based [[Pickup truck|pickup truck]], the [[Jeep Gladiator (JT)|Gladiator]], which began production in 2019 for the 2020 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/future-cars/news/a29009/2017-jeep-wrangler-pickup-info/|title=2019 Jeep Wrangler Pickup: Everything We Know|last=Perkins|first=Chris|date=|website=blog.caranddriver.com|access-date=2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although introduced in 1986 (under control of [[Renault]]), and by 1987 (the first model year) under new ownership of [[Chrysler]], the first-generation Wrangler had still been developed by [[American Motors Corporation]]. It featured rectangular headlamps, differing from the round ones on its predecessors, the CJ Jeeps. Although continuing many essentials, such as an open body with only minor modifications, on a separate frame, with the same wheelbase, part-time 4WD and live rigid axles on leaf-springs, both front and rear, just like the CJ-7 – the new 'Wrangler' was promoted by the manufacturer as a significantly new design with a wider track, slightly less [[ride height|ground clearance]], more comfort and improved safety and handling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jeep Wrangler 1986 brochure |url=https://israeljeeps.co.il/%d7%92%d7%99%d7%a4-%d7%90%d7%a1%d7%a4%d7%a0%d7%95%d7%aa/yj-%d7%a8%d7%a0%d7%92%d7%9c%d7%a8/|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli military carmaker [[Automotive Industries]] Ltd. introduced its first generation of the [[AIL Storm]], the workhorse off-road vehicle of the [[Israeli Security Forces]], as a variant of the 1991 Wrangler YJ, but on the {{convert|103.5|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} [[Jeep CJ#CJ-8 .28Scrambler.29|CJ-6 / CJ-8]] wheelbase. AIL builds the whole vehicles themselves, save for various externally sourced engines. Long and short wheelbase versions were also available for civilian purchase.

Aside from this, there was a Jeep-managed production line in Egypt, whose jeeps are used by the Egyptian armed forces – but this was absorbed into the AIL Storm production after it closed in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://egypt.jeep.com/25y.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070814105829/http://www.egypt.jeep.com/25y.htm | archivedate=2007-08-14 | title = Jeep Egypt | accessdate = 2008-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Introduced in 1996 as a 1997 model, the second-generation Wrangler reintroduced the round headlamps from the classic Jeep models. The main engine was the [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] 242 4.0L inline 6. From the Wrangler TJ onwards, all Wranglers were fitted with coil-spring instead of leaf-spring suspension.

Late in the TJ's life cycle, in 2004, a long-wheelbase "Unlimited" model was introduced for the first time. Furthermore, starting 2006, Israeli [[Automotive Industries]] Ltd. produced the first five-door Jeep Wrangler derivative, built under license from Chrysler, for the [[Israel Defense Forces]], based on a {{convert|2931|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wheelbase Wrangler (TJ)

The third-generation Wrangler was released in 2006 for the 2007 model year. Developed under ownership of [[Daimler AG|DaimlerChrysler]], the JK was Jeep's first Wrangler that was a completely clean-sheet design of body, frame and suspension. New features for the Wrangler included power windows, remote power door locks, navigation, as well as electronically detachable sway-bars on some models. 

Along with the traditional 2-door model, a 4-door "Unlimited" model was released, offering considerably more room, thanks to an over 20 inches (50 cm) longer wheelbase. These became quite successful sellers. By mid 2017 the four-door models represented three quarters of all new Wranglers on the market.&lt;ref name=2DrFail&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.autotrader.com/car-news/every-single-two-door-suv-has-failed-266841 |title=Every Single Two-Door SUV Has Failed |first=Doug |last=DeMuro |date=June 2017 |work=Autotrader |accessdate=2017-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth-generation Wrangler was unveiled in late 2017 for the 2018 model year. The JL features a host of new features including: additional powertrains over the Pentastar V6, a redesigned transmission, easier fold-flat windshield, new zipperless soft tops, and a more modern interior.  Powertrains for the 2018 model included an 2.0L Turbo I4 and a 3.6L Pentastar V6 gasoline engines and also 2.2 I4 Turbodiesel in Europe.

In 1997, 2007, and 2012, the magazine ''[[Petersen's 4-Wheel &amp; Off-Road]]'' awarded the Jeep Wrangler with its 4x4 of the Year award.

The 2008 edition of ''[[Forbes]]'' Autos lists the four-wheel-drive convertible Jeep Wrangler at number four among the top ten vehicles with the highest resale value.&lt;ref&gt;Zygmont, Jeff (July 31, 2008).

In September 2008, Chrysler Vice Chairman Tom LaSorda unveiled a [[range-extended vehicle|range-extended electric]] 4-door Wrangler along with similarly engineered [[Chrysler Town and Country|Town and Country]] minivan and a purely electric sports car.  The Wrangler would have a {{convert|40|mi|km|adj=on}} range before a gas engine starts and begins supplying additional electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/Business/article/504214 |title=Chrysler plans to sell electric car in 2010 |accessdate=2012-07-11 |last=Krisher |first=Tom |date= September 23, 2008 |newspaper=The Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, in November 2009 [[Fiat SpA]] disbanded Chrysler's [[Envi (automobile)|ENVI]] electric car division and dropped these models from future product plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/11/07/us-chrysler-ev-idUSTRE5A605N20091107 |title=Chrysler dismantles electric car plans under Fiat |author=Krolicki, Kevin |date=November 6, 2009 |work=Reuters |accessdate=2010-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jeep Grand Cherokee (ZJ)''' is the first generation of the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] [[sport utility vehicle]]. Introduced in 1992 for the 1993 model year, development of the ZJ Grand Cherokee started under [[American Motors Corporation]] (AMC) and was continued after the company was acquired by [[Chrysler]] in 1987.

Export models produced at the plant in Graz, Austria, were given the vehicle designation of "ZG".

== New Features ==

The all-new 1993 [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] ZJ offered many new and class-exclusive features that its competitors, such as the [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer]] and [[Ford Explorer]], did not offer. 

For example, all [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] ZJ models featured a standard front driver's-side [[SRS airbag]] in the steering wheel. The '''Limited''' model offered a digital climate control system. All models offered a digital Electronic Vehicle Information Center (EVIC) that monitored critical vehicle systems and provided audible and visual feedback when a fault was detected (doors, hood, tailgate, engine coolant level, engine oil level, and front and rear lighting systems were some of the systems monitored by the EVIC). In addition to monitoring vehicle status, the EVIC could also display current date and time information and vehicle service interval reminders, and could be set via buttons on the EVIC screen. An overhead console provided a mini trip computer with current direction of travel and exterior temperature information in [[Celsius]] or [[Fahrenheit]], as well as elapsed time, mileage remaining until the fuel tank is empty, and trip mileage for two trips (Trip A and Trip B). In addition to the mini trip computer, the overhead console provided storage for a single garage door opener, and two pairs of sunglasses, and included four overhead map/reading lamps. [[Keyless entry]] allowed for easy access to the vehicle without having to insert the vehicle's key into the door lock cylinder, and could also arm or disarm the class-exclusive vehicle security system. The interior lights illuminated whenever a door was opened, and could shut off automatically along with the automatic headlamps. The ignition cylinder was located on the right side of the steering column, and was lighted so that it could be easily located during nighttime driving conditions. Finally, a premium AccuSound factory audio system by [[Jensen Electronics|Jensen]] (or [[Infinity (audio)|Infinity]] Gold on 1994 and newer models) and 120-watt amplifier located underneath of the rear bench seat could be paired with an in-dash CD player and five-band graphical equalizer for a high-fidelity audio experience. 

A fully mechanical full time  [[four wheel drive]] system could split torque when a wheel was losing traction, and send all available traction to that wheel in order to keep moving . In addition, the system, called '''Quadra-Trac''', could automatically detect when [[four wheel drive]] was needed, and automatically switch from [[rear wheel drive]] without input from the driver. The Grand Cherokee ZJ also offered [[Chrysler]]'s 318 cubic inch (5.2L) Magnum electronically fuel-injected [[V8]] engine as an option, which produced {{Convert|220|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|280|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque for up to 5,000 lbs. of towing capacity, and was the only [[SUV]] in its class at the time to offer a [[V8]] engine as an option.

In 1996, even more new features were added to the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] ZJ. The newly available [[Jeep]] Memory System utilized a button panel located on the inside of the front driver's door panel to recall driver's seat adjustment, mirror adjustments, and radio preset settings when the corresponding key was inserted into the ignition cylinder (each keyless entry remote was engraved with either a '1' or a '2' to designate which key would automatically recall these settings). Heated seats also became available for the front driver and passenger with slide switches located near the lighting controls on the driver's side. A power tilt-and-sliding [[sunroof]] was added to the options list, and remote controls for the audio system were added to the back of the steering wheel on some Grand Cherokee models. For the first time on the Grand Cherokee, buyers could choose a combination cassette and single-disc CD player instead of just either a cassette or a single-disc CD player. Dual front [[SRS airbag]]s now came standard on all models, and the 5.2L Magnum [[V8]] engine gained 5 lb. ft. of torque, up to 285 from 280, and remained one of the most powerful [[SUV]]'s in its class.

Finally, in 1998, the '''5.9L Limited''' model became available for the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] ZJ, utilizing [[Chrysler]]'s 360 cubic inch (5.9L) Magnum electronically fuel-injected [[V8]] engine producing 245 horsepower and 345 lb. ft. of torque, which made the Grand Cherokee ZJ 5.9L Limited the most powerful [[SUV]] in its class.

===Introduction===

The Grand Cherokee (ZJ) was initially available in three trim levels: base, Laredo, and Limited. The base model included features such as full instrumentation, cloth interior, a standard five-speed [[manual transmission]], and was given the "SE" name for the 1994 model year. Power windows and locks were not standard equipment on the base and SE for 1993 and 1994. The minimal difference in price resulted in low consumer demand, so the low-line model was discontinued after 1994. Standard features on all models included a driver-side air bag and four-wheel anti-lock braking system (ABS). The Laredo was the mid-scale model with standard features that included [[power window]]s, [[power door locks]], and cruise control. Exterior features included medium-grey plastic paneling on the lower body and five-spoke aluminum wheels. The Limited was the premium model, featuring lower body paneling that was the same color as the rest of the vehicle. The Limited also had standard features such as [[leather]] seating, power [[sunroof]], heated mirrors, heated [[power seat]]s, and a [[remote keyless system]]. The "Up-Country" version was also offered between 1993 and 1997, often painted "Champagne Pearl" or black. It came with 4WD and the [[AMC Straight-6 engine#4.0|AMC straight-6 4.0&amp;nbsp;L]] engine. Package groups included: convenience, fog lamps, skid plate, lighting, luxury, power, security, and trailer towing.

When it was first introduced in April 1992 as an early 1993 model year vehicle, the Grand Cherokee had one powertrain, the [[American Motors|AMC]]-derived [[AMC Straight-6 engine#4.0|4.0&amp;nbsp;L]] Power Tech [[Straight-six engine|I6]] engine that produced 190 horsepower. Transmission choices were a four-speed [[automatic transmission]] (early production ZJs used the AW4 - the A500SE (later 42RE) which replaced the AW4 during the latter half of the 1993 model year) or an [[Aisin]] AX15 [[manual transmission]]. Low sales demand for the manual transmission resulted in its discontinuation after the 1994 model year for North America, but it remained on the option list for European ZJs. The drivetrain choices included [[rear-wheel drive]] or [[four-wheel-drive]].

===1993===
The all-new, 1993 [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] went on sale in April 1992 in Base, Laredo, and Limited trims. At launch all Grand Cherokees were powered by the 4.0&amp;nbsp;L Power Tech Inline Six-Cylinder engine, and were all four-wheel drive. Starting in early 1993, the Grand Cherokee became available with the 5.2&amp;nbsp;L Magnum V8 engine, and a Grand Wagoneer Limited model became available with standard four-wheel drive and V8 power, as well as a plush leather-trimmed interior and faux vinyl woodgrain side and tailgate paneling. The 5.2&amp;nbsp;L Magnum V8 engine was available with the Quadra-Trac  four-wheel drive system, which was based around a NV249 transfer case with a viscous coupler. The Quadra-Trac system was a permanent four-wheel drive system that allowed up to 60% of power to the rear wheels and a 50-50 split when loss of rear traction occurred. It also had a low range that still utilized the viscous coupler in the 1993-1995 model years. In 1996 and beyond, the low range provided a true 50-50 lock between the front and rear axles. However, the system required little to no driver input, as it was automatically determined by the viscous coupler when more front bias was required. In addition to Quadra-Trac, a Selec-Trac Full-Time four-wheel drive system was available that was a "Shift-on-the-Fly" four-wheel drive system that had a 4 wheel drive part time mode (50/50 lock) a 4 wheel drive full time mode (variable front bias, much like the Quadra-Trac) and a 4 LO. The standard part-time four-wheel drive system in the Grand Cherokee was known as Command-Trac, a part time only four-wheel drive, modes were 2 wheel drive, 4 HI and 4 LO. All three four-wheel drive systems featured a selector lever that was located next to the transmission gear selector or shifter. Two Wheel Drive Grand Cherokees featured a small storage area in place of the four-wheel drive selector lever.

===Late 1992/early 1993 production===
In late 1992/early 1993 calendar year, Chrysler made some minor changes to the 1993 model year Grand Cherokee. The changes are shown in ''The New Jeep'', a brochure on the 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee published in 1992. The crimson-colored interior option for the vinyl and cloth seats was no longer available, and the Limited model now had the option of quilted Highland-grain leather seats. The 5.2&amp;nbsp;L High-Output Magnum Engine V8 producing 220 horsepower was added in early 1993. The only transmission choice was a 46RH, four-speed automatic transmission. The [[Jeep Wagoneer|Jeep Wagoneer Limited]] was also shown in the brochure, as it became available in early 1993. The radio face was changed for the AM/FM [[cassette player]] in early 1993, with raised buttons and rounded knobs, as well as larger green display text to match the rest of the Grand Cherokee's interior. The radio also introduced [[Dolby]] noise reduction technology for the [[cassette player]]. Full-faced steel wheels replaced the six-spoke version on the Base/SE model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chrsyler|first=Corporation|title=The New Jeep|year=1992|publisher=Chrysler Corporation|pages=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chrysler|first=Corporation|title=The Jeep Book: 1993|year=1992|publisher=Chrysler Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1994===
For 1994, the upgraded [[Jensen Electronics]] AccuSound premium amplified audio system was rebranded Infinity Gold, with upgraded components. An AM/FM stereo with in-dash CD player became available for the first time. Mid-level Laredo models gained standard fifteen-inch sport aluminum-alloy wheels. The Grand Wagoneer Limited model was dropped for 1994, while the Base trim level is renamed the SE. The [[Aisin]] AW4 four-speed automatic transmission was replaced for 1994, becoming the Chrysler-built 42RE.

===1995===
In 1995, the performance of the V8 engine was upgraded to {{convert|300|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} from 285. The 1996 model featured cosmetic changes to the body including the [[grille]], bumpers, and foglights, while interior additions included dual airbags. The [[AMC Straight-6 engine#4.0|AMC 4.0&amp;nbsp;L]] straight-6 engine, rated to tow {{convert|5000|lb|0|abbr=on}}, was also refined with more torque and quieter operation. The 1996 Limited model also included more luxury items such as driver placement memory, radio controls on the steering wheel, and variable-assist power steering.

An uplevel [[Orvis]] Edition model of the Grand Cherokee was introduced in partnership with [[Orvis]] catalog, adding features to the uplevel Limited model such as perforated tan and Moss Green leather-trimmed seating surfaces and front and rear door panels, an AM/FM stereo with in-dash CD player, and unique exterior trim and fifteen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels to the Limited trim. A flip out rear glass hatch was standard with the Orvis, along with font lettering which was similar to other Chrysler products (which was phased in the following model year). The base SE trim level received more standard equipment such as power windows and door locks, [[Antilock Braking System]] (ABS), keyless entry, an AM/FM stereo with cassette player, air conditioning, and upgraded fifteen-inch styled steel wheels. The five-speed [[Aisin]] AX15 manual transmission was also no longer available for 1995.

=== 1996 Restyling ===
For 1996, the Grand Cherokee received a mid-cycle restyling, with new front and rear bumpers and side cladding, a larger front grille, new aluminum-alloy wheel options, and an entirely new interior, now featuring a front passenger side [[airbag]] and revised interior fabrics. A combination AM/FM stereo with cassette and CD players became available, as well as a rear-mounted multi-disc CD changer unit. The base SE trim level was dropped for 1996, leaving the Laredo as the new base model. The five-speed manual transmission option was also dropped for 1995. At this time, the part-time Command-Trac four-wheel drive system was dropped, leaving the full-time Selec-Trac and computerized Quadra-Trac four-wheel drive systems as options. 

A new steering wheel which featured three-spokes with integrated [[cruise control]] buttons, a new dual-note horn, and the horn buttons were deleted in favor of a single horn pad. The front seats were new as well as an upgraded interior with new door panels and interior trim panels, a [[glove box]] with more storage space, new tires and wheels, revised [[headlamps]], [[fog lamps]] that were directly integrated into the vehicle's front bumper on some models, a new [[remote keyless system]], as well as faux wood interior trim standard on all models. An optional rear lift glass (first introduced with the 1995 Orvis edition where production tailgates manufactured after January 3, 1995 have both provisions for both fixed and lift glass) for the Laredo and Limited were added to the options list (the fixed glass came standard). The base SE model was dropped for 1996, in favor of new features being added to the Laredo (now base) model. The Grand Cherokee now offered standard power windows, power door locks, rear door child locks, keyless entry, AM/FM [[radio]] with [[cassette player]] and [[compact disc]] player and four standard speakers, cloth seating surfaces, and more. The [[manual transmission]] was no longer offered after the 1994 model year Grand Cherokee sold in North America, but remained as the base transmission for European ZJs (ZG) sold in Europe with the diesel motor. New front door designs got new side body cladding strips, and the 'Laredo' subtext on the Laredo model was moved down to the cladding. The 'Grand Cherokee' badge was relocated to the front lower doors, and was now larger (using a font style similar to other Chrysler products and initially used with the 1995 Orvis package), replacing the 1974-era American Motors font style used on Jeep vehicles. On V8-equipped Grand Cherokees, there was a new [[V8 engine|V8]] badge on the rear liftgate. The 4X4 badge, on [[four-wheel-drive]]-equipped Grand Cherokees, was also changed to raised metal letters instead of the 4X4 decals offered before. A combination [[cassette player]] and [[CD player]] was available for the first time as an option, and the vehicle featured an [[OBD II]] diagnostics port under the dashboard on the driver's side, required for all 1996 [[model year]] and newer vehicles, a digital [[odometer]] and [[trip odometer]], a 120 [[miles per hour]] speedometer rating on some models, and the vehicle now included some user-programmable features such as if the [[headlamps]] and [[tail lamps]] flashed when a button was pressed on the [[remote keyless system]], how many miles until service intervals, whether the horn sounded when a button was pressed on the remote, and more. The overhead console was somewhat redesigned for the 1996 [[model year]] to improve storage space and feature availability. In addition to the cigarette lighter port, a 12-volt power port was added for [[cellular telephones]], [[coolers]], [[computers]], and other devices. The [[ashtray]] was also removed from the rear doors, replaced by a solid area. The Limited model and [[Orvis]] Edition model both got chrome interior door handles.

The engine rating was reduced by 5 horsepower to 185 to meet [[EPA]] regulations for the 1996 model year production.

===1997===
For 1997, a new trim level of Grand Cherokee, the Special Edition, was introduced, adding the Infinity Gold premium amplified audio system, an AM/FM stereo with cassette and CD players, dual power-adjustable front bucket seats, color-keyed exterior trim, and a security system to the base Laredo model. The TSi, also based on the base Laredo model, added unique sixteen-inch sport aluminum-alloy wheels, unique front and rear bumpers and side cladding, an AM/FM stereo with cassette and CD players, dual power-adjustable front bucket seats, luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces with dual heated front bucket seats, dark gray wood interior trim, and a security system to the Laredo trim. The 5.2&amp;nbsp;L Magnum V8 engine was now available with Two-Wheel-Drive (Rear-Wheel-Drive).

===1998===
For 1998, the first-generation Jeep Grand Cherokee ZJ entered its final year of production. The laredo and other models were carried over, and introduced -- for 1998 only -- was a special edition using the 5.9l motor.

The [[Orvis]] Edition was also dropped for 1998. Production ended of the first-generation Jeep Grand Cherokee ZJ in mid-1998, as production of its successor, the second-generation [[Jeep Grand Cherokee (WJ)]], began at [[Jefferson North Assembly]], following a retooling of the plant.



Between 1996 and 1998, the export Grand Cherokee Laredo (marketed for Japan) had the optional Aspen package (source: The Story of Jeep).


[[File:Jeep Grand Cherokee front 20080703.jpg|alt=|thumb|1998 5.9l Jeep Grand Cherokee, deep slate]]
In 1998, a 5.9&amp;nbsp;L Limited model featured the 5.9&amp;nbsp;L V8 Magnum engine producing {{Convert|245|hp|0|abbr=on}} with all-wheel-drive and a four-speed automatic transmission. This engine and model was only available for the 1998 model year. This  Limited model added adding the 5.9&amp;nbsp;L Magnum V8 engine from the [[Dodge Ram]] 1500 pickup truck, unique forged sixteen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, unique ruffled luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces and front and rear door panels, an AM/FM stereo with cassette and CD players, a unique ten-speaker, 180-watt Infinity Gold premium amplified audio system, a unique mesh grille and a vented performance hood to the standard Limited model.

[[File:1st Jeep Grand Cherokee -- 02-29-2012.JPG|thumb|right|1996–1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee]]

The 1993-1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee ZJ was available in many, distinct trim levels:

The '''Base''' and '''SE''' (1993-1995) were the most basic trim levels of the Grand Cherokee between 1993 and 1995. The Base was given a name, the SE, in 1994. Standard features included the 4.0L "Power-Tech" Inline Six-Cylinder (I6) engine with 5-speed manual transmission, full instrumentation, vinyl-and-cloth trimmed seating surfaces, front high-back bucket seats, a split-folding rear 60/40 bench seat, an AM/FM stereo with 4 speakers, manual roll-up windows and door locks, and fifteen-inch (15") styled steel wheels. In 1995, the SE gained standard power windows and door locks, as well as keyless entry, air conditioning, an AM/FM stereo with cassette player, warning chimes, and a 4-speed automatic transmission. The SE was dropped after 1995, and in 1996, the Laredo became the base trim level of the Grand Cherokee.

The '''Laredo''' (1993-1998) served as the midrange trim level of the Grand Cherokee between 1993 and 1995, and the base trim level of the Grand Cherokee between 1996 and 1998. It added these features to the base SE Grand Cherokee: fifteen-inch (15") alloy wheels, an AM/FM stereo with cassette player, air conditioning, warning chimes, cloth seating surfaces, keyless entry, power windows and door locks, a chrome front grille, and body-side cladding and molding. In 1996, the Laredo became the base trim level of the Grand Cherokee, and remains the base trim level to this day. In 1995, the Laredo gained a standard 4-speed automatic transmission, as the 5-speed manual transmission was dropped after 1994. Many of the features available on the luxurious Limited model could also be had on the midrange or base Laredo model.

The '''Special Edition''' (1997-1998) was slotted just above the base Laredo trim Grand Cherokee between 1997 and 1998. It added the following features to the basic Laredo trim: a premium 120-watt Infinity Gold sound system with 6 speakers, an AM/FM stereo with cassette and CD players, power front bucket seats, a security system, color-keyed body-side trim and front and rear bumpers (sourced from the Limited), a 'Special Edition' emblem on both front doors, and more.

The '''TSi''' (1997-1998) served as the "sporty" trim level of the Grand Cherokee between 1997 and 1998. Slotted above the base Laredo trim, the TSi added additional features to the basic Laredo trim that included sport alloy wheels, blue front and rear bumper and side trim accents, sport leather-trimmed and perforated seating surfaces, heated front bucket seats, an AM/FM stereo with cassette and CD players, a premium 120-watt Infinity Gold sound system with 6 speakers, and a security system.

The '''Limited''' (1993-1998) served as the "luxury" trim level of the Grand Cherokee between 1993 and 1998. It added these features to the midrange Laredo Grand Cherokee: premium leather-trimmed seating surfaces, premium low-back front bucket seats, power front seats, a premium 120-watt Infinity Gold sound system with 6 speakers, fifteen-inch (15") or sixteen-inch (16") luxury alloy wheels, a security system, 4-speed automatic transmission, an Electronic Vehicle Information Center (EVIC or VIC), carpeted floor mats, body-colored front grille, front and rear bumpers, gold-plated badging, and body-side cladding and trim, and more.

The '''Orvis Edition''' (1995-1997) was a partnership between the [[Orvis]] catalog and [[Jeep]]. Based on the Limited model, and available between 1995 and 1997, it offered two exterior color options, either Moss Green Pearl Coat or Light Driftwood Pearl Coat, an AM/FM stereo with CD player, unique beige-and-green luxury leather seating surfaces with red piping and matching door panel accents, luxury fifteen-inch (15") or sixteen-inch (16") alloy wheels with Moss Green-painted accents, a power sunroof, heated front bucket seats, unique beige-and-green carpeted floor mats with red piping, a beige-and-green leather spare tire and spare wheel cover with integrated storage pockets, and more. [[Jeep]] ended their partnership with [[Orvis]] in 1997, and thus, the Orvis Edition Grand Cherokee was discontinued after 1997.

The '''5.9&amp;nbsp;L Limited''' (1998 only) The 5.9 Limited was a Jeep Grand Cherokee produced only for the 1998 model year, having more luxury and performance than that of the regular Limited. Chrysler manufactured nearly a quarter million Grand Cherokees in 1998. Of those, fewer than fifteen thousand were 5.9s. It housed a Magnum 5.9 L V8 engine with an output of 245&amp;nbsp;hp (183&amp;nbsp;kW) and 345&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (468 N·m) of torque, going from zero to 60&amp;nbsp;mph (100&amp;nbsp;km/h) in 7.3 seconds[6] (''Motor Trend'' measured this at a slightly faster 6.8 seconds[7]), making it the quickest SUV available that year. The performance of the 1998 5.9 L V8 has been surpassed by Jeep only with the introduction of the 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT-8, which housed a 6.1 L Hemi Engine.[8] The 5.9 Jeep Grand Cherokee was named the 1998 four-wheel drive vehicle of the year by Petersen's 4-Wheel &amp; Off-Road magazine.[6]
The 5.9 Limited was available only in Deep Slate, Stone White, Bright Platinum. European version named 5.9 Limited LX and had two additional colors: Forest Green (rare)&lt;ref name="5.9 Forest Green"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jeep4x4club.ru/forums/topic/6797-ischetsia-59-limited/page-145#entry707800 |title=Forest Green Pearl Coat color of the ZJ 5.9 |publisher=jeep4x4club.ru |date= |accessdate=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Deep Amethyst.&lt;ref name="5.9 Deep Amethyst"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jeep4x4club.ru/forums/topic/944-grand-zj-59-obsuzhdenie/page-415#entry1271897 |title=Deep Amethyst Pearl Coat color of the ZJ 5.9 |publisher=jeep4x4club.ru |date= |accessdate=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 5.9 Jeep Grand Cherokee included a number of improvements over the top of the line "limited" Grand Cherokee, that were unique to the 5.9. This included, in addition to the premium motor, all the options found on the limited edition, in addition to:[7]
*a higher output alternator
*revised low profile roof racks (used on the next generation)
*unique wood grain accents
*full calf nap leather interior

The '''Grand Wagoneer Limited''' served as the most luxurious Grand Cherokee trim level for 1993, offering features in addition to the luxurious Limited features: quilted leather seating surfaces, faux vinyl wood side paneling, 'Grand Wagoneer' emblems on both upper front fenders, more wood interior trim, the deletion of the body-side cladding panels, the 5.2&amp;nbsp;L Magnum V8 engine, 4X4 only, and a chrome front grille. Meant to pay homage to the then-recently discontinued Jeep Grand Wagoneer [[Jeep Cherokee (SJ)|SJ]], the Grand Wagoneer Limited was discontinued after 1993.

== 4x4 systems ==
[[Four-wheel drive]] systems included ''[[Command-Trac]]'', a part-time unit offering temporary 4-wheel assistance; Command-Trac was dropped from lineup in conjunction with the SE trim in 1996. ''[[Selec-Trac]]'' had the option of either full-time or part-time operation; both shift-on-the-fly Command-Trac and Selec-Trac were already available for the Cherokee, and they were adapted to the Grand Cherokee. Exclusive to the Grand Cherokee was the introduction of ''[[Quadra-Trac]]'' system with permanent all-time four-wheel assistance. This was optional on all models. Low-range required using a manual shift lever for all three systems.

== Suspension ==
The Quadra-Link suspension design was used on both the front and rear axles. This design uses four control arms, two above the axle and two below it, to control longitudinal movement and rotation about the lateral axis (drive and braking reaction). A [[panhard rod]], also referred to as a track bar, is used to locate the axle laterally. Two coil springs are seated on top of the axle housing as well as two gas-charged shock absorbers. The optional "Up Country" package included heavier duty German made gas charged shocks installed upside down, taller coil springs and longer bump stops; thereby increasing ride height by one inch.

== Special edition ZJs ==

There were several different "one-off" and special edition models of the ZJ.

=== Jeep Grand Wagoneer (1993) ===
[[File:1993 Jeep Grand Wagoneer Black Cherry front.jpg|thumb|right|1993 Jeep Grand Wagoneer]]

Following the introduction of the all-new 1993 Grand Cherokee ZJ, [[Jeep]] introduced an "ultra-luxury" model of its all-new midsize [[SUV]], called the '''Grand Wagoneer Limited'''. Based on the Grand Cherokee Limited and paying tribute to the [[Jeep Wagoneer (SJ)|Jeep Grand Wagoneer]] SJ of which the Grand Cherokee ZJ replaced, the Grand Wagoneer Limited included a standard 5.2L "Magnum" High-Output V8 engine and the new "Quadra-Trac" computerized full-time [[four wheel drive]] (4X4) system, both of which were optional on all other Grand Cherokees. Additional features on top of the Limited included exclusive faux woodgrain vinyl decals on the front fenders, doors, and rear tailgate, chrome Grand Wagoneer emblems on both front fenders, deletion of the lower textured body side cladding, unique pinstripes on the front and rear bumpers and above the woodgrain decals on both sides of the vehicle, color-keyed heated power-adjustable side mirrors, a chrome front grille, front bumper-mounted driving (fog) lamps, a color-keyed leather-wrapped tilt steering wheel with cruise control, ultra-luxury quilted leather-trimmed seating surfaces, a security system, and a full-size, matching cargo area-mounted spare tire and wheel with vinyl cover. The Grand Wagoneer Limited was available in several different exterior color options, although all interiors were beige in color, regardless of exterior color. Options were very limited, as the Grand Wagoneer Limited had a long list of standard equipment, although an A/M-F/M radio with graphic equalizer and single-disc CD player was available as an option (the Grand Cherokee ZJ was one of the first midsize SUV's to offer a factory-installed, in-dash CD player as an option). As there was not a large market for the Grand Cherokee ZJ-based Grand Wagoneer Limited, it was discontinued after the 1993 [[model year]], once again leaving the Limited as the top-of-the-line Grand Cherokee trim level.

=== The Orvis Edition (1995–1997) ===
[[File:Orvis 004.jpg|thumb|right|1996 Grand Cherokee Orvis]]
[[File:1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee Orvis Edition.JPG|thumb|right|1995 Grand Cherokee Orvis]]

The [[Orvis]] (1995–1997)&lt;ref name="jeeporvis.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeeporvis.com/|title=1995 1996 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee Orvis Edition 95 96 97 Jeep Orvis Edition|accessdate=2009-05-01|work=jeeporvis.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Grand Cherokee Limited package that featured an exterior color scheme of Moss Green, or in 1997 the (less common) Light Driftwood, with roan red and maize side strip accents (1995). Moss Green paint accents on the road wheels (matching the moss green body color) and the special "Orvis" brand badging were the only significant exterior visual differences. In performance, the 5.2 V8 engine became standard, but was available with a 4.0 inline 6-cylinder engine. Also, some Orvis editions came with a rear liftglass (which in 1996 became a mainstream option), tow hooks, and the Up-Country suspension group. However, the interior was special. Two-tone green and tan leather seats were complemented with roan red accent piping and Orvis insignia. There was a slight difference between the 1996 and 1997 years' interior compared to each other. The 1996 had a black dash where the 1997 had a tan dash, The Orvis Edition luxury [[trim package]] was optional on the Limited version, and when equipped with all the other options was the most expensive of all the Grand Cherokee versions until 1998 when the 5.9 Limited was introduced. Jeep ended their relationship with [[Orvis]] Catalog in 1997, and the Orvis Edition was discontinued.

Production numbers of the Orvis Editions are:
* 1995: 10,020
* 1996: 2,341
* 1997: 2,733

=== TSi (1997–1998) ===
[[File:98 Jeep Grand Cherokee TSi.jpg|thumb|right|1998 Grand Cherokee TSi]]
A sporty TSi model (1997–1998) briefly debuted, exterior features included single color body paneling with lower indigo blue striping, a body colored grille, and TSi accent similar to that found on the [[Eagle Talon]] model. "TSi" really is a misnomer on the Jeep. Both Jeep and Eagle were originally built by AMC. The AMC Eagle TSi was a "Turbo Sport Injection," and, on that model, included a turbo.&lt;ref name=nagca&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nagca.com/forum/showthread.php?t=10498 |title=TSi Jeeps, TSi Grand Cherokees...What does the TSi mean? |website=North American Grand Cherokee Association |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eagle had intended to create a TSi Grand Cherokee; Chrysler did not agree, but nevertheless copied over the TSi logo.&lt;ref name=nagca/&gt;

The TSi could only be ordered in select colors, which included Black, Platinum, and Deep Amethyst. TSi packages came equipped with 5 spoke {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on}} alloy wheels, 225/70R16 Goodyear Eagle GA tires, fog lights, Luxury group, featuring: "Highland" perforated, power, leather seats, overhead computer, and a premium sound system with steering wheel mounted controls. Contrary to popular belief, the suspension used on the TSi was the standard duty Quadra-Coil suspension used on all non-UpCountry ZJs. Both the 4.0 I6 and the 5.2 V8 were available. Quadra-Trac was standard with the TSi package for both engines, while Selec-Trac was optional with the I6. Both engine options could also be special ordered in 2 wheel drive configurations. The TSi was priced between the Laredo and the Limited and was discontinued after a two-year run.

=== The 5.9&amp;nbsp;L Limited ZJ (1998) ===
The '''5.9 Limited''' was produced only for the 1998 model year, having more luxury and performance than that of the regular Limited. Chrysler manufactured nearly a quarter million Grand Cherokees in 1998. Of those, fewer than fifteen thousand were 5.9s. Standard was a Magnum 5.9&amp;nbsp;L V8 engine producing {{convert|245|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|345|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque and capable of accelerating from zero to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}} in 6.8 seconds&lt;ref name="Motor Trend 1998, p. 51"&gt;''Motor Trend'', January 1998, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;, making it the quickest SUV available that year (That time was not bested until almost ten years later, when jeep introduced the SRT).   The 5.9 Jeep Grand Cherokee was named the 1998 four-wheel drive vehicle of the year by ''Petersen's 4-Wheel &amp; Off-Road'' magazine.&lt;ref name="petersons-p81"&gt;''Peterson's 4-wheel &amp; Off-road'', February 1998, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 5.9 Limited was available only in Deep Slate, Stone White, and Bright Platinum. European version named 5.9 Limited LX and had two additional colors: Forest Green&lt;ref name="5.9 Forest Green"/&gt; and Deep Amethyst.&lt;ref name="5.9 Deep Amethyst"/&gt;
[[File:Pictures013.jpg|right|thumb|A Deep Slate 1998 Grand Cherokee 5.9 L (Note hood louvers and mesh grille inserts)]]

The 5.9 Jeep Grand Cherokee included unique features. These included all the options from the Limited and the following:&lt;ref name="Motor Trend 1998, p. 51"/&gt;
* a higher output alternator
* Low profile roof rack (used on the next generation)
* Unique wood grain accents
* Calf's leather interior
* Chrome exhaust tip
* Unique front grille
* Unique side rocker moldings
* Functional heat extracting hood louvers

* Unique five star wheels
* 46RE 4 Speed Automatic Transmission
*3.73 Differential gearing with rear Trac-Loc

== 2017 Jeep Grand One Concept ==
Jeep introduced several concept vehicles for its annual Easter Safari in [[Moab, Utah]]. One such vehicle was the '''Jeep Grand One''', which was created to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Jeep Grand Cherokee. This vehicle was based on a stock Stone White 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee ZJ Laredo 4X4 equipped with the 5.2&amp;nbsp;L Magnum High-Output V8 engine and 46RH 4-speed automatic transmission, which the automaker purchased off of [[Craigslist]] specifically for the project. The Grand One was repainted a robin's-egg blue with a light woodgrain-style treatment underneath of the paint, paying homage to the 1993 Jeep Grand Wagoneer ZJ, and the wheelbase was stretched to accommodate new front and rear axles (however, this is only noticeable if one looks at the slightly modified rear doors that had to be modified to accommodate the longer wheelbase). Large front and rear fender flares conceal the extended wheelbase. The Grand One also receives large, off-road capable tires, custom eighteen-inch laced aluminum-alloy wheels, a slight lift, an eight-slot gloss black-finished front grille, 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee-style 'GRAND CHEROKEE' emblems on the front doors and rear tailgate, and a new '5.2' emblem on the rear tailgate. Pinstripes on the side and rear of the body were removed, as was the textured side cladding, and the 'Jeep' emblem on the hood. Underneath the Grand One's hood, all components are stock Jeep except for a [[Mopar]] air filter and intake. Inside, the interior of the Grand One is mostly stock, except for new upholstery (the stock seats of the Grand One were re-wrapped in a modern gray leather-and-microfiber-suede with bright blue accent stitching), and a plaid headliner. Retro touches, such as the factory AM/FM radio with cassette player that has a cassette tape sticking out of the tape deck, an [[Audiovox]] car phone, and an original [[Nintendo]] [[Game Boy]] on the rear seat are eminent on the Grand One, paying tribute to the Jeep Grand Cherokee's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.caranddriver.com/jeep-grand-one-concept-the-1993-grand-cherokee-zj-gets-another-day-in-the-sun/ |title=Jeep Grand One Concept: The 1993 Grand Cherokee ZJ Gets another Day in the Sun |first=Joseph |last=Capparella |date=30 March 2017|publisher=Car and Driver |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jeep Liberty''' (KJ), or '''Jeep Cherokee''' (KJ) outside North America, is a [[compact SUV]] that was produced by [[Jeep]] and designed by Bob Boniface through early 1998.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.toledoblade.com/Automotive/2001/01/08/Liberty-designers-aimed-to-establish-a-niche.html&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced in May 2001 for the 2002 model year as a replacement for the [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Cherokee (XJ)]], the Liberty was priced between the Wrangler and Grand Cherokee. It was the smallest of the 4-door Jeep SUVs up until the car platform based 4-door [[Jeep Compass|Compass]] and [[Jeep Patriot|Patriot]] arrived for 2007. The Liberty featured [[unibody]]-construction. It was assembled at the [[Toledo North Assembly Plant]] in the United States, as well as in other countries including Egypt and Venezuela.

==Description==

Inspired by styling from the ''Dakar''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mojeepin.com/concept_dakar.html |title=Jeep Dakar Concept |publisher=Mojeepin.com |accessdate=2010-09-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508104714/http://www.mojeepin.com/concept_dakar.html |archivedate=2006-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Jeepster''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mojeepin.com/concept_jeepster.html |title=Jeep Jeepster Concept |publisher=MoJeepin.com |accessdate=2010-09-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508111114/http://www.mojeepin.com/concept_jeepster.html |archivedate=2006-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[concept vehicle]]s, the Liberty was intended as a replacement for the discontinued [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]]. The Liberty also marked a few firsts for Jeep. It was the first Jeep vehicle to use [[rack and pinion]] steering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/jeep/liberty.html |title=Jeep Liberty Steering |publisher=Allpar.com |date=2005-05-15 |accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also the first Jeep to use the two then-new ''[[Chrysler PowerTech engine|PowerTech]]'' engines; the {{convert|150|hp}} 2.4 [[Liter|L]] [[straight-4]], which was discontinued in 2006, and the {{convert|210|hp}} 3.7 L [[V6]]. However, the Liberty was not the first Jeep vehicle to use an [[independent front suspension]], as the [[Jeep Wagoneer]] first used it in the 1963 model. But, that independent front suspension was limited to four wheel drive versions and, even then, was a short lived option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wagoneers.com/FSJ/rigs/63_ifs_rice/ALL.html |title=Bruce Rice's 1963 IFS Wagoneer 4x4 |publisher=wagoneers.com |date=2007-12-24 |accessdate=2010-12-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724022927/http://wagoneers.com/FSJ/rigs/63_ifs_rice/ALL.html |archivedate=2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberty was nominated for the North American Truck of the Year award for 2002.

Three trim levels were initially offered; the top end ''Limited'', a more rugged looking ''Renegade'' and the base ''Sport''. All were made available with either [[Rear wheel drive|2WD]] or [[Four wheel drive|4WD]]. In July 2004 for the 2005 model year,  the Liberty received a mid-cycle facelift. The 2005, 2006 ''Renegade'' and 2005 ''Rocky Mountain Edition'' Liberties received an exclusive flat hood and taller grille. In 2007, the ''Renegade'' trim level was replaced with the ''Latitude'' which appeared to focus more on an urban appearance and lost the ''Renegade'' trim's unique hood and grille.

===Trim Levels and Equipment===

The 2002-2007 Jeep Liberty KJ was offered in three basic trim levels, each offering their own level of standard and optional equipment:

'''Sport:''' The '''Sport''' served as the "base" model 2002-2007 Jeep Liberty. It offered the following standard equipment: a 2.4L "Power-Tech" Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine, a five-speed manual transmission, sixteen-inch (16") steel wheels, an AM/FM stereo with cassette player (later, a single-disc CD player), a six-speaker audio system, cloth seating surfaces, dual manually-adjustable front bucket seats, a split-folding rear bench seat, full instrumentation, manual windows and door locks (power windows and door locks became standard equipment starting in 2005), gray front and rear bumpers and body side cladding panels, and a rear-mounted spare tire and wheel. 
* Optional equipment:
** Included an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD player (this later became standard equipment), power windows and door locks with keyless entry and automatic front windows, (also later became standard equipment), an Infinity premium amplified audio system, aluminum-alloy wheels, a full-size spare tire and wheel (this later became standard equipment), air conditioning (also later became standard equipment), a four-speed automatic transmission, a 3.7L "Power-Tech" V6 engine, a 2.8L Common-Rail Diesel (CRD) engine, a five-speed automatic transmission, and front-mounted fog lamps. "Special-Edition" models of the Liberty KJ, such as the '''2003 Freedom Edition''', the '''2004 Columbia Edition''', the '''2005 and 2007 Rocky Mountain Edition''', and the '''2006 65th Anniversary Edition''', were all based on the base '''Sport''' trim level.

'''Renegade:''' The '''Renegade''' served as the "off-road-ready" model of the Jeep Liberty between midyear 2002 and 2007. Based on the base '''Sport'''' model, it added the following equipment: a 3.7L "Power-Tech" V6 engine, power windows and door locks with keyless entry, cloth-and-vinyl-trimmed seating surfaces, air conditioning, sixteen-inch (16") color-keyed aluminum-alloy wheels (in '''Cactus Green''', '''Mineral Gray''', or '''Light Khaki'''), gray front and rear decorative wheel flares, Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS), front-mounted fog lamps, and an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD player.
* Optional equipment:
** Included seventeen-inch (17") chrome-clad aluminum-alloy wheels, roof-mounted "Off-Road" lamps, an Infinity premium audio system, leather-trimmed seating surfaces, low-back front bucket seats, a power tilt-and-sliding sunroof, and a four-speed automatic transmission. 

'''Limited Edition:''' The '''Limited Edition''' was the top-of-the-line 2002-2007 Jeep Liberty model. It added the following equipment to the '''Renegade''' trim level: a 3.7L "Power-Tech" V6 engine, a four-speed automatic transmission, sixteen-inch (16") aluminum-alloy wheels (later seventeen-inch (17")), color-keyed front and rear bumpers, chrome body side cladding panels, an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD player, security system, power-adjustable front driver's bucket seat, air conditioning, front-mounted fog lamps, an overhead Electronic Vehicle Information Center (EVIC), and premium cloth seating surfaces with low-back front bucket seats. 
* Optional equipment:
** Included an AM/FM stereo with Radio Data System (RDS) and cassette and single-disc CD players (later, a six-disc, in-dash CD changer), an Infinity premium amplified audio system, luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces, dual heated front bucket seats, a power-adjustable front passenger's bucket seat, seventeen-inch (17") chrome-clad aluminum-alloy wheels, Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS), a 2.8L Common-Rail Diesel (CRD) engine, a five-speed automatic transmission, and a power tilt-and-sliding sunroof.

===CRD in North America===
In 2005, DaimlerChrysler began offering a [[diesel engine]] to the North American market to gauge the marketability of diesel engines in North America. The last North American market Jeep product that was offered with a diesel engine was the 1987 [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]] and [[Jeep Comanche|Comanche]]. Only available for 2005 and 2006 in ''Sport'' and ''Limited'' trims, the 2.8L [[VM Motori]] [[List of VM Motori engines#R 428 DOHC|R 428]] [[straight-4|I4]] [[common rail]] [[turbo]][[diesel engine|diesel]] or ''CRD'' exceeded expectations by selling 10,000 examples in its first calendar year of production. The diesel utilized a [[variable geometry turbocharger]] and generated {{convert|160|hp}} and {{convert|295|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of [[torque]]. Offering 60 more foot lbs of torque than the comparable V6 gasoline engine and offered higher fuel efficiency;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=21596&amp;id=21421|title=Compare Side-by-Side|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|accessdate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it added nearly {{Convert|200|lb}} to the [[curb weight]], a price increase, and offered less peak horsepower. The CRD was prohibited from being sold in Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, New York, and California due to their higher emission standards and was discontinued for 2007 due to stricter [[United States emission standards#Phase 2: 2004.E2.80.9309|federal emission standards]] in the United States. The next year Jeep offered the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee#Diesel|Jeep Grand Cherokee]] with a diesel engine option; which was 50-state emission legal.

===Four wheel drive systems===
{{Unreferenced|section|date=July 2019}}

The Liberty is available with either a part-time [[Command-Trac]] or full-time [[Jeep four wheel drive systems#Selec-Trac|Selec-Trac]] transfer case.

The Command-Trac transfer case has four positions: 2-HI, 4-HI, Neutral, and 4-LO. The lever is placed in 2WD HI for regular driving. This allows the two rear tires to receive power. The second position, 4WD HI, is used for driving on slippery or loose surfaces. This position locks both the front and rear drive shafts together allowing the vehicle to maintain drive as long as at least one axle has traction. The third position, Neutral, disengages both drive shafts from the transfer case allowing the car to roll freely; this is used for towing behind another vehicle, for example. The last position, 4WD LO is used for situations requiring higher torque or slow speed when traversing rough terrain. A common misconception is that 4WD LO provides more traction.  It only changes the gear ratio and does not add any more friction between the tires and the driving surface. This position, like 4WD HI locks both the front and rear drive shafts together, and by using a lower gear ratio, allows for 2.72 times more torque (however, the speed is limited to around 25 MPH max). Turning while in 4WD HI or LO on dry pavement is hazardous to vehicle components, through driveline binding and wheel-hop.

The [[Selec-Trac]] transfer case has five positions: 2-HI, 4-HI Part-Time, 4-HI Full-Time, Neutral, and 4-LO. The transfer case is different from the Command-Trac transfer only in the extra 4WD HI Full-Time position. The 4WD HI Full-Time position adds the same traction benefits that the part-time 4WD setting offers, but features an open differential between the front and rear axles to allow the two axles to spin at independent speeds and eliminate drive line binding and wheel-hop. The down side of 4WD Hi Full-Time is that, due to the open differential between front and rear drive lines, at times the drive train will only deliver power to the front or the rear e.g. when the front of the vehicle has reached a high traction surface such as dry pavement and the rear is in sand, the rear tires will spin with 100% of engine power, the front receiving no traction. Under equal traction conditions (front-rear) this position gives the rear wheels 52% of the engine's power and the front wheels 48% of the engine's power. The division of power and open center differential allows the Selec-Trac transfer case to be operated at all times in an "All Wheel Drive" mode with no adverse effects.

==Government/Fleet use==

Even though no special Jeep Liberty was introduced in 2002 for police use, police and rental agencies continue to purchase it for fleet use. Most are equipped with the 3.7L "Power-Tech" V6 Engine that produces 210 horsepower mated to a 4-Speed Automatic Transmission, however, some fleet Liberties used a 2.4L I4 Engine that produced about 150 horsepower with a 4-Speed Automatic Transmission. In 2008, when the Jeep Liberty was fully redesigned, the I4 engine was dropped, and the V6 engine was the only engine choice, as was the 4-Speed Automatic Transmission. Most fleet and government Liberties also use either the [[Selec-Trac]] or [[Selec-Trac II]] [[4WD]] Systems, but some Liberties used [[2WD]].

Since it was introduced in April 2001 as a 2002 [[Model Year]] vehicle to the time it was discontinued in 2007, the Liberty KJ also found its way into [[rental car]] fleets. Most [[rental]] Liberty KJ's were the [[V6]]-powered Sport models with [[automatic transmissions]] and [[4WD]].

===International versions===
[[File:Jeep KJ Liberty (Cherokee in Poland).jpg|upright|thumb|left|European badged Cherokee Renegade]]

Numerous versions were available in markets outside the U.S. and Canada.

Early-2002 through mid-2003 model year CRDs were equipped with a 2.5lt VM Motori Diesel producing {{Convert|105|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|343|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}. An external wastegated turbo was standard and the engine was available only with a [[manual transmission]].

A commercial Cherokee version with 2.5 CRD engine and five-speed transmission rated at {{convert|34.4|mpgimp }} has a completely flat cargo area (the rear seat area has a carpeted full-length galvanized metal floor) and the rear quarter glass and rear door glass is replaced with fixed body colored aluminum panels (the front doors have power windows). For additional cargo security a removable floor to ceiling metal and mesh bulkhead is optional. In European markets, VAT registered buyers can claim back the tax paid as this qualifies as a Commercial Vehicle.

The '''Jeep Liberty''' (KK), or '''Jeep Cherokee''' (KK) outside North America, is a [[compact SUV]] that was produced by [[Jeep]]. Introduced for the 2008 model year as a successor for the [[Jeep Liberty (KJ)|first generation Liberty]]. The Liberty featured [[unibody]]-construction. It was assembled at the [[Toledo North Assembly Plant]] in the United States, as well as in other countries including Egypt and Venezuela. In 2010 estimates by Jeep were that 70% of Liberty buyers were new to the marque.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatcarstv.com/reviews/2008-jeep-liberty-limited-4-x-4.html Mid-size SUV attracts new buyers to marque] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221002157/http://www.greatcarstv.com/reviews/2008-jeep-liberty-limited-4-x-4.html |date=December 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second generation Liberty ceased production on August 16, 2012.  For its follow up, the name of [[Jeep Liberty|Liberty]] was retired; the next generation restored the name of "[[Jeep Cherokee (KL)|Cherokee]]". The model remains on sale in Venezuela as of early 2016 having yet to be replaced by FCA Venezuela with the KL model Cherokee.

==Description==
The Jeep Liberty received a complete redesign for the 2008 model year with a more boxy and utilitarian look, like that of the 2007 [[Dodge Nitro]], the latter of which lasted until its final production in December 2011. The 2008 Liberty debuted at the [[New York International Auto Show#2007|2007 New York International Auto Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automobilemag.com/auto_shows/2007_new_york/0703_2008_jeep_liberty/photo_01.html |title=2008 Jeep Liberty Front Corner Photo |publisher=Automobilemag.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the smaller [[Jeep Patriot|Patriot]] and [[Jeep Compass|Compass]] [[crossover SUV]]s now available to cater to MPG-conscious buyers, the four-cylinder engine was dropped from the Liberty's offerings. The iron-block, aluminum-head [[V6 engine|V6]] was the only engine available for 2008. Towing capacity was {{convert|5000|lb|0}}. Jeep discontinued the Liberty [[Common rail diesel|CRD]] for the American market because it couldn't meet tougher 2007 emissions standards for diesel engines. Transmission choices were both carry-overs: a six-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] or a four-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]. Standard equipment included electronic stability control with roll mitigation, [[traction control system|traction control]], and [[anti-lock brakes]] with brake assist. New Features included standard side airbags. Optional features are rain-sensing wipers, [[Sirius Satellite Radio]], [[Bluetooth]], a [[navigation system]], and the [[MyGig]] entertainment system, complete with a 30[[Gigabyte|GB]] [[hard drive]].

[[File:Jeep Liberty Renegade -- 08-12-2010.jpg|thumb|left|2010 Jeep Liberty Renegade]]

Two models were offered at rollout: Sport and Limited. Wheel choices were 16-, 17- and {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on}}. Among the more distinctive features was the Sky Slider, a power roof made from “reinforced acrylic cloth” that opens over the front and rear seats. The Sky Slider opens up to {{convert|60|in|mm}} by {{convert|30|in|mm}}, which was the largest opening in its class. Jeep claimed that the idea behind the Sky Slider was to give consumers the open-air feeling from previous Jeep models while maintaining the rigidity and safety of a sturdy frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cargurus.com/Cars/Overview-c8242-2008-Liberty.html |title=2008 Jeep Liberty&amp;nbsp;— Overview for Jeep Liberty |publisher=CarGurus |date=2008-04-27 |accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 Liberty was relatively unchanged from the 2008 models with the exception of stiffer rear axle shafts and retuned springs, shocks, anti-roll bars, steering gear valve, low rollback brake calipers and a revised brake pedal ratio. The six-speed manual transmission was dropped, and the four-speed automatic was now standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeephorizons.com/news/09_liberty_090108.html|title= 2009 Jeep Liberty|work=[[jeephorizons.com]]|accessdate=September 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trim levels and special editions==
[[File:2008 Jeep Liberty KK white-r.jpg|thumb|right|2008 Jeep Liberty]]
Throughout its five-year production run, the Liberty '''KK''' was available in two basic trim levels:

The '''Sport''' served as the base model. It was well-equipped, and included the following standard features: a 3.7L Powertech V6 engine producing 210 horsepower, a six-speed manual transmission (later, an automatic transmission became standard equipment), air conditioning, an AM/FM stereo with a single-disc CD/MP3 player and 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input jack, a four-speaker sound system (later, a six-speaker sound system became standard equipment), sixteen-inch tires and alloy wheels, power windows and door locks, keyless entry, cloth seating surfaces, a split-folding rear seat, among other standard equipment.

It added unique chrome-clad alloy wheels, power front bucket seats, unique seat trim, and special Jet emblems to the base trim levels they were based on. The Limited Jet Edition added dual heated front bucket seats, leather-trimmed seating surfaces with Axis perforated suede [[microfiber]] inserts, a touch-screen sound system, a premium eight-speaker sound system with subwoofer from Infinity, the Sky-Slider fabric sunroof, among other options to the "up-level" Limited trim level.

==Jeep Liberty plant shutdown==

[[Chrysler Group LLC]] announced in June, 2012 that the [[Toledo Complex#Toledo North|Toledo North Assembly Plant]] in [[Toledo, Ohio]], where the Liberty is manufactured, will shut down on August 21, 2012 temporarily in order to prepare for the launch of the new compact CUV [[Jeep]] vehicle, the [[Jeep Cherokee (KL)|Jeep Cherokee]]. Production will start in late spring 2013, following the introduction of the new Cherokee at the [[New York Auto Show#2013|2013 New York Auto Show]] in April 2013. The final 2012 Liberties were produced on August 16, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/08/09/jeep-liberty-has-date-with-oblivion-next-thursday/ |title=Jeep Liberty has date with oblivion next Thursday |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=2012-08-09 |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; as 2012 models in the U.S. and as 2013 models in Mexico. The new Jeep Cherokee is based on the platform of the [[Alfa Romeo Giulietta (2010)|Alfa Romeo Giulietta]] and the [[Dodge Dart (2013)|Dodge Dart]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/SUVs/jeep/2014-cherokee.html |title=2014 Jeep Liberkee: the Italian-American Liberty / Cherokee |publisher=Allpar.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which were introduced in recent years.

==Recalls==
347,000 vehicles are recalled for the rear control arms rusting and breaking: possibly causing crashes and possible deaths, according to the NHTSA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505164_162-57450518-10391734/jeep-liberty-recall-reaches-nearly-347000-vehicles/|title= Jeep Liberty recall |accessdate=August 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fleet and government Use==

Since it was redesigned in 2002{{Disputed inline|When was the KK Designed|date=May 2016|reason=The KJ was launched/designed in 2002, but the KK should be later}} to the time it was discontinued and replaced by the [[Jeep Cherokee (KL)|Cherokee KL]] in 2012, the Liberty KK found its way into [[rental car]] fleets, most vehicles being base-model Sport models in [[2WD]] or [[4WD]].

Many [[government]] and [[police]] fleets also used the Liberty KK. The models were base-model Sport models with [[4WD]].

The '''Willys Jeep Station Wagon''', '''Jeep Utility Wagon''' and '''Jeep Panel Delivery''' are [[automobile]]s produced by [[Willys]]  and [[Kaiser Jeep]] in the United States from 1946 to 1964, with production in Argentina and Brazil continuing until 1970 and 1977 respectively. They were the first mass-market all-steel [[station wagon]]s designed and built as a passenger vehicle.{{Sfn|Olsen|Lyons|2000|p=27}} 

With over 300,000 wagons and its variants built in the U.S., it was one of Willys' most successful post-[[World War II]] models. 

For some time after the 1949 introduction of a four-wheel drive option, the 2WD was sold as "Station Wagon", while the 4WD was marketed as "Utility Wagon".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.allpar.com/trucks/jeep/1960.html Jeep for 1959, 1960, and 1961 – Allpar.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The 4WD Willys Jeep Wagon is often considered the first production [[sport utility vehicle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1960 Willys Four-Wheel-Drive Station Wagon: Your (Great-) Grandfather’s SUV|url= http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/1960-willys-four-wheel-drive-station-wagon-your-great-grandfathers-suv |website=Autoweek |accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Greg |title=The Very First Sport Utility Vehicle: The Jeep Station Wagon |url= https://autoroundup.com/index.php/jeep-station-wagon-the-very-first-suv/ |website=autoroundup |accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jeep Wagon was assembled in several international markets under various forms of [[joint venture]]s, [[license]]s, or [[knock-down kit]]s.

==Development and reception==
The Jeep Wagon was designed in the mid-1940s by industrial designer [[Brooks Stevens]].{{Sfn|Olsen|Lyons|2000|p=28}} Willys did not make their own bodies, car bodies were in high demand, and Willys was known to have limited finances. Brooks therefore designed bodies that could be built by sheet metal fabricators who normally made parts for household appliances and could draw sheet metal no more than {{Convert|6|in|mm|0}}.{{Sfn|Brown|1994|pp=66,68}} 
[[File:1947 Willys Wagon (3665123269).jpg|thumb|left|The Wagon's all-steel body was sometimes painted as a woodie]]
The steel body was efficient to mass-produce, easier to maintain and safer than the real [[Woodie (car body style)|wood-bodied]] station wagon versions at the time.{{Sfn|Olsen|Lyons|2000|p=29}} Within the first two years of the Jeep Wagon's production, the only manufacturer in the United States with a station wagon that was comparable in price was [[Crosley]],{{Sfn|Brown|1994|p=70}} which introduced an all-steel wagon in 1947.

The Jeep Wagon was the first Willys product with [[independent suspension|independent front suspension]]. [[Barney Roos]], Willys' chief engineer, developed a system based on a transverse seven-leaf spring. The system, called "Planadyne" by Willys, was similar in concept to the "planar" suspension Roos had developed for [[Studebaker]] in the mid-1930s.{{Sfn|Brown|1994|p=70}} 

In 1953 the U.S. military included the 4x4 station wagon models 463 and 473 as non (standard) classified 1/4-ton trucks under [[List of U.S. military vehicles by supply catalog designation#G700 to G799|Standard Nomenclature List number G-740]] in Technical Manual edition TM9-2800-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://radionerds.com/images/c/c3/TM_9-2800-1_1953_INCLUDING_C1_EN_C2.pdf |title=TM 9-2800-1/TO 19-75A-89 – MILITARY VEHICLES |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |publisher=Departments of the Army and the Air Force |date=13 February 1953 |location=Washington |work=Technical Manual |page=152 |ref=TM9280053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== USA ===
* 1946: introduced as the 463 with 10 slot flat grille in July 1946&lt;ref&gt;Wx4: "Basic Wagon Data". Wx4.org.  Archived February 21, 2015 https://web.archive.org/web/20150221184837/http://wx4.org/to/wagons/usefulstuff/wagonspecs.html&lt;/ref&gt; , powered by the [[Willys Go Devil engine|L-134 Go-Devil]] [[flathead engine|flathead]] [[inline-four engine]].
* 1947: a [[panel van]] introduced with one seat, a pair of doors instead of the wagon's [[Trunk_(car)#Tailgate|tailgate]], and no side windows behind the front doors.{{Sfn|Brown|1994|p=72}} 663 model introduced late in year, powered by the [[Willys Lightning engine|L-148 Lightning]] [[straight-six engine]], 50 built. &lt;ref&gt;Wx4 "Basic Wagon Data"&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1948: A luxury version, the Station Sedan, had solid body colors with basket-weave trim on the sides and was better finished than the wagon throughout.{{Sfn|Brown|1994|p=70}}
* 1949: [[four-wheel drive]] became an option.{{Sfn|Brown|1994|p=72}}
* 1950: the flat 10 slot grille was replaced by a pointed v-shape design with five horizontal bars across the vertical ones. New 1950 model introduced April 16, leftover 1949 models continued into March&lt;ref&gt;Wx4 "Basic Wagon Data"&lt;/ref&gt;. The 473 model got the new '[[Willys Hurricane engine|F-134 Hurricane]], and the 673 model got a new {{convert|161|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} version of the [[Willys Lightning engine|Lightning]] six. Station sedan discontinued.{{Sfn|Brown|1994|p=72}}
* 1952: the flathead Lightning was dropped in favor of the [[Willys Hurricane engine#F161|F-161 Hurricane]], installed in the 685 model. Key start replaces floor start; chrome strip added to hood, cowl sides on Wagon only; flush side mount tail lights replace single light&lt;ref&gt;Wx4 "Basic Wagon Data"&lt;/ref&gt;.
* 1954: the first under Kaiser's ownership. The [[Continental straight six engine|6-226 Super Hurricane]], a flathead inline six, was introduced. This was a version of the Kaiser Supersonic/[[Continental Motors Company|Continental]] Red Seal engine and became available on four-wheel drive versions in 1954. Minor revisions were made to front end styling that year, including the reduction of the number of horizontal slats in the grille from five to three. There were few other changes between 1953 and 1955.{{Sfn|Brown|1994|p=86}}
* 1955: a number of new models were added. The 6-226 model lineup gained stripped chassis, flat face cowl, cowl/windshield, and ambulance models. The 475 line received only the cowl/windshield. Willys withdrew from the passenger car market and renamed the vehicle the Utility Wagon. The seventh seat and the overdrive were deleted, and the Planadyne front suspension used with the two-wheel drive wagon was replaced with a beam axle. Warn hubs, with which the front drive mechanism could be disengaged by turning the hubs by hand, became optional on four-wheel drive models.{{Sfn|Brown|1994|p=90}}
* 1958: the Maverick model introduced, a more luxurious version of the two-wheel drive wagon. It could be had only with the four-cylinder engine. The main upgrades were in the introduction of two-tone paint with matching interior in two tones and the standard [[AM radio]]. It was distinguished by its extra [[stainless steel]] trim ring under the windows. The Maverick name came from the [[Maverick (TV series)|TV series of the same name]], of which Willys was a sponsor.
* 1959: 4X2 Wagon models have one piece windshield.
* 1960: 4X4 Wagons and Delivery models receive one-piece windshield (late year)&lt;ref&gt;Wx4 "Basic Wagon Data"&lt;/ref&gt;.
* 1962: the [[Jeep Tornado engine|6-230 Tornado]] OHC engine was introduced in May&lt;ref&gt;Wx4 "Basic Wagon Data"&lt;/ref&gt;, replacing the flathead.
* 1964: production ends as the Willys model had been phased out by the [[Jeep Wagoneer (SJ)|Jeep Wagoneer]], which was introduced in the 1963 model year. Some leftover 1964 models were renumbered by dealers with 1965 VINs&lt;ref&gt;Wx4: "Vehicle Identification Numbers Explained" (Wagon/Delivery models). Wx4.org.

=== Argentina ===
The Jeep Wagon was produced as the IKA Estanciera by [[Industrias Kaiser Argentina]] from 1957 to 1970.

=== Brazil ===
In the 1950s a version based on the 1946 US version was introduced. A truck version, the Pick Up, was introduced in 1961. [[Ford Brazil]] bought the Willys factory in 1967 and the wagon was renamed Ford Rural, and the truck the Ford F-75. Both models were offered with an inline-six engine which was the first gasoline engine manufactured in Brazil. They were available in RWD or 4X4 configuration. The Rural was discontinued in 1977 and the F-75 in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=TATAREVIC|first1=BOZI|title=The Tale Of The Ford Rural And F-75 Truck|url=http://www.hoonable.com/the-creation-of-the-ford-rural-and-f-75/|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Willys Jeep Truck''' is a truck made by [[Willys|Willys-Overland Motors]] from 1947 to 1965.  The styling and engineering of the Jeep Truck was based on Willys' existing vehicles, the [[Willys Jeep Station Wagon]] and the [[Jeep CJ#CJ-2A|Jeep CJ-2A]].

==Production==
The Jeep Truck was introduced in 1947 as a 1-ton [[four-wheel drive]] truck with a wheelbase of {{convert|118|in|mm|0}}. It was available as a [[pickup truck]], a platform stake truck, a [[chassis cab]], or a [[Rolling chassis|bare chassis]]. A ¾-ton two-wheel drive version became available by 1949.{{Sfn|Brown|1994|p=74}}

The truck was restyled in 1950 with the addition of a V-shaped grille with five horizontal bars. In 1951 the ''[[Willys Hurricane engine|Hurricane]]'' [[IOE engine|IOE]] four cylinder engine replaced the earlier [[flathead engine]], increasing power from {{convert|63|hp|kW|abbr=on}} to {{convert|72|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.{{Sfn|Brown|1994|p=74}}

Optional accessories included an [[Governor (device)|engine governor]], a [[power take-off|power takeoff]], and a pulley drive.{{Sfn|Brown|1994|p=75}} A "Dump-O-Matic" hydraulic hoist became available for 1957.{{Sfn|Brown|1994|p=100}}

Over 200,000 of these trucks were manufactured.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The Jeep Truck was available with only one transmission, the [[Borg-Warner T-90]] three-speed manual, with [[synchromesh]]ed second and third gears. A Spicer/[[Dana Holding Corporation|Dana]] 18 transfer case was used on four-wheel drive models. The heavy duty Timken 51540 was used in the early years of production, later being replaced by the Dana 53. The front axle was a Dana 25

The '''Jeepster''' is an [[automobile]] originally produced by [[Willys|Willys-Overland Motors]] from 1948 to 1950.{{Sfn|Mattar|2012}} It was developed in hopes of filling a gap in the company's product line, crossing over from their "utilitarian" proto [[SUV]]s and trucks to the passenger automobile market. The basic model included numerous deluxe features and interior fittings in addition to a high level of standard equipment that cost extra on other automobiles.  A total of almost 20,000 were manufactured.

The Jeepster name was revived in 1966 on a new model, the C-101 '''[[Jeepster Commando]]'''. [[American Motors]] (AMC), [[Willys|Willys-Overland]]'s successor, removed Jeepster from the name for 1972, ending production after 1973.

==Background==
After [[World War II]], [[Jeep]] trademark owner, Willys, began producing and marketing the "CJ" (for Civilian Jeep) to farmers, foresters, and others with similar utilitarian needs. It also began producing [[Willys Jeep Station Wagon|the Jeep Wagon/Panel Utility/Pick-up]] in 1946,{{Sfn|Brown|1994|pp=70, 72}} and the [[Willys Jeep Truck|Jeep Truck]] in 1947.{{Sfn|Brown|1994|p=74}}

Seeing a gap in their product lineup, Willys developed the Jeepster to crossover from their "utilitarian" trucks to the passenger automobile market. Willys-Overland lacked the machinery to form deep-drawn fenders or complicated shapes, so the vehicle had to use a simple and slab-sided design.{{Sfn|Brown|1994|pp=58, 68}}&lt;ref name="development" /&gt; Industrial designer [[Brooks Stevens]] styled a line of postwar vehicles for Willys using a common [[automobile platform|platform]] that included the Jeep pickup and station wagon, as well as a sporty two-door open car&lt;ref name="development"/&gt; that he envisioned as a sports car for veterans of World War II.{{Sfn|Mattar|2012}}

The Willys-Overland Jeepster ("VJ" internally) was introduced in April 1948,{{Sfn|Brown|1994|p=76}} and produced through 1950.{{Sfn|Brown|1994|p=78}} Some leftover models were sold under the 1951 [[model year]].{{Sfn|Brown|1994|p=78}}{{Sfn|Statham|2002|p=77}}

==1948==
[[File:1948 Willys Jeepster.jpg|thumb|250px|1948 Willys Jeepster.]]
[[File:1949 Willys Overland Jeepster (28971691904).jpg|thumb|250px|1949 Jeepster rear with continental kit]]
The basic 1948 Jeepster included numerous deluxe features and interior fittings in addition to a high level of standard equipment that cost extra on other automobiles. These included, among many others, [[whitewall tires]], [[hubcap]]s with bright trim rings, [[sun visor]]s, deluxe steering wheel, wind wings, locking glovebox, cigar lighter, and [[continental tire]] with fabric cover.&lt;ref&gt;[[#HSW48 51J p4|1948 Willys Jeepster Design Features]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Jeepster had Willys' World War II-proven {{convert|134.2|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[inline-four engine|straight-4]] "[[Willys Go Devil engine|Go Devil]]" engine, and plastic side curtains, but its $1,765 price was about the same as a Ford Super DeLuxe club convertible with roll-down windows, fancier styling, and a [[V8 engine]].{{Sfn|Mattar|2012}}

The car was only offered with [[rear-wheel drive]], thus limiting its appeal with other Jeep customers.{{Sfn|Brown|1994|p=78}} Its distinctive boxy styling and performance were praised by automotive journalists.{{Citation needed|date= January 2015}} However, the Jeepster did not catch on with the intended [[market segmentation|market segment]]. Sales were also limited by sparse advertising and an insufficient dealer network.&lt;ref&gt;[[#HSW48 51J p5|1948 Willys Jeepster Reviews]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jeepster's engine gave {{convert|63|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, which was coupled to a 3-speed [[manual transmission]] with standard [[overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]].&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt; The Planadyne single transverse leaf spring independent front suspension , entire drivetrain, front end, rear suspension, steering, and four-wheel [[drum brake]]s were from the [[Willys Jeep Wagon|Willys Station Wagon]].&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;{{Sfn|Brown|1994|pp=68,70,76}} The flat-topped rear fenders were taken from the Jeep truck line.{{Sfn|Brown|1994|p=76}}

==1949==
The 1949 Jeepster began production with a one-model/one-engine offering. The price was lowered to $1,495, with some previously standard features returning as extra-cost options. Toward the middle of the year, an additional model was introduced, the VJ3-6, powered by Willys' new ''[[Willys Lightning engine|L148 Lightning]]'' six-cylinder engine.&lt;ref name=49to50 /&gt;

==1950==
The 1950 model year saw the VJ-3 Jeepster's first styling revisions, which included a new instrument panel and redesigned front end featuring a V-shaped grille with horizontal chrome trim.{{Sfn|Statham|2002|p=77}} The car had very little standard equipment.{{cn|date=August 2017}} Willys' ''[[Willys Lightning engine|L161 Lightning]]'' six-cylinder was offered in addition to the standard ''Go Devil'' four-cylinder.&lt;ref name=49to50 /&gt; Model designations were dependent on production timeframe, with early 1950s four-cylinder Jeepsters given VJ-3 463 and six-cylinders VJ-3 663, changed to VJ-473 and VJ-673, respectively, for later year vehicles.&lt;ref name=49to50 /&gt;

The '''Jeep Renegade''' (BU/520) is a [[subcompact]] [[crossover SUV]] ([[mini SUV]] in Europe) produced by [[Jeep]]. The [[off-road vehicle]] was first shown to the public in March 2014 at the [[Geneva Motor Show#2014|Geneva Motor Show]] and production started in late August of that year. Standard Renegade models come with [[front-wheel drive]]. The vehicle offers the [[four-wheel drive]] systems [[Active Drive I]] and [[Active Drive Low]], both of which are paired with Jeep's [[Selec-Terrain|Selec-Terrain System]].

==Overview==
[[File:Jeep Renegade 1.6 MultiJet 2WD Longitude – Heckansicht, 9. November 2014, Düsseldorf.jpg|thumb|Jeep Renegade 1.6 MultiJet (Germany)]]
At one time it was believed that the Renegade would replace the [[Jeep Compass]] and [[Jeep Patriot]] in the Jeep lineup. The Patriot was discontinued after model year 2017, but the second generation Compass was launched in early 2017.

The Renegade is the first Jeep product to be produced exclusively outside of [[North America]] and is sold in the North American, European, Brazilian, South African, Australian, and Chinese markets. The vehicle is built in [[Melfi|Melfi, Italy]] (alongside the related [[Fiat 500X]]); [[Goiana]], [[Brazil]]&lt;ref name="goiana plant"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcagroup.com/plants/en-US/Pernambuco/the_plant/Pages/default.aspx|title=FCA Group - The Plant|website=fcagroup.com|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; (alongside [[Jeep Compass]] and [[Fiat Toro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2015/10/19/fiat-toro-compact-pickup-truck-brazil/|title=We wish the Fiat Toro compact pickup would come to America|last=Ramsey|first=Jonathon|website=Autoblog|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;); and in [[Guangzhou]], [[China]].

Standard Renegade models come with front-wheel drive, with four-wheel drive available on Sport,  Latitude and Limited  trims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Undercoffler|first=David|title=Geneva Motor Show: Jeep debuts all-new Renegade crossover SUV|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-autos-geneva-jeep-renegade-crossover-suv-20140304,0,5659920.story#ixzz2v1IcCtbj|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=4 March 2014|date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the lineup consists of Sport, Latitude and Limited trims, all of which come with a choice of front- and four-wheel drive, as well as the Trailhawk trim, which is 4WD only.

The Renegade has an available ''My Sky'' dual panel removable roof. The ''My Sky'' can be either retracted like a standard sunroof or removed completely for a more open-air experience, similar to that of the [[Jeep Wrangler]].

The MySky removable "sunroof" panels, both manually-removable or power-retractable, are available on this model, the Latitude model, and higher-end models. The Trailhawk model's base MSRP, only available in four-wheel drive (4X4/4WD), is $25,995.00.

==Interior features==
[[File:" 15 - ITALY - Jeep (Fiat) showroom in Milan 03.jpg|thumb|left|Interior]]
The Renegade offers either [[cloth]] or [[leather]] seating surfaces. It offers seating for five passengers, with a 40/20/40 split-folding rear bench seat, and a fold-flat front passenger's seat for more cargo capacity.

In North America, it offers a standard Uconnect 5.0BT [[radio]] with an AM/FM radio, [[Sirius XM Radio|Sirius XM satellite radio]], voice command, a [[Microsoft]]-derived [[touch screen]] interface, and [[iPod]] and [[USB]] inputs, as well as a 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input jack. Uconnect Phone will also be standard. A rearview backup camera will be optional. The optional radio will be the UConnect 6.0 radio, offering all the features of the UConnect 5.0BT radio, while adding a [[touch screen]] interface designed by [[BlackBerry]] (a smaller version of the UConnect 8.4A and 8.4AN radios), and [[navigation system]] capabilities by [[Garmin]].

==Facelift==
===2019 model year===
[[File:Jeep Renegade, GIMS 2019, Le Grand-Saconnex (GIMS0538).jpg|thumb|2019 Renegade]]
[[File:Jeep Renegade PHEV Genf 2019 1Y7A5612.jpg|thumb|Renegade PHEV]]
In June 2018, the Renegade was updated with some slight aesthetic touches: the front and rear bumpers have been redesigned, new LED headlamps (the same ones used for the Wrangler) were adopted, and the front grille is larger.

The infotainment system was upgraded with a new, more up-to-date processor and a more generous display that varies from 7" up to 8.4" in the navigator version. The displays are all multitouch and the customizable menus also offering the possibility to adjust the air conditioning. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility was introduced.

The Longitude version now also has USB jack on the back of the armrest dedicated to passengers sitting in the rear seats.

The European version introduced the new gasoline engines of the [[Fiat Global Small Engine|Global Small Engine (FireFly)]] family produced by FCA Poland Powertrain in Bielsko Biala in two versions: 1.0 L Turbo 3-cylinder 120&amp;nbsp;hp with direct injection, Multiair system and GPF filter, and 1.3 L Turbo Multiair with direct injection and GPF filter {{convert|110|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|132|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}}. The 1.0 L is available with a 5-speed manual transmission and front-wheel drive, the 1.3 L with a 6-speed manual transmission, a 6-speed automatic double clutch or a 9-speed ZF automatic with front or 4-wheel drive. The diesel engines introduced the SCR system and are approved Euro6D-Temp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeeppress-europe.com/press/article/new-2019-jeep-renegade|title=New 2019 Jeep Renegade|website=jeeppress-europe.com|accessdate=26 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018 the facelifted Renegade was unveiled for the North American market (MY2019) which introduced the 1.3 L GSE Turbo Multiair engine with {{convert|132|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}} as a replacement for the 1.4 L Fire Turbo Multiair, while the 2.4 L Tigershark engine remains available. The North American model has the same changes applied to the European model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=20073&amp;mid=|title=FCA US Media - 2019 Jeep® Renegade Fact Sheet|website=http://media.fcanorthamerica.com|accessdate=26 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, the updated version for the South American market produced by FCA of Gioiana (Pernambuco) in Brazil was introduced and presents only aesthetic updates with the adoption for all versions of the Trailhawk bumpers; the front and rear headlamps remain those of the previous model. The engines for the South American market are the 1.8 L E.Torq Evo gasoline and the 2.0 L Multijet diesel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcapress.com.br/pt/jeep/verRelease/2143.do|title=FCA PRESS|website=fcapress.com.br|accessdate=26 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth-generation '''Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK2)''' is a mid-size [[SUV]] introduced in Spring 2010 for the 2011 model year by [[Jeep]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/automobiles/autoshow/NY-CHEROKEE.html?em |last=Ulrich |first=Lawrence |title=2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee |newspaper=The New York Times | date=2009-04-08 |accessdate=2010-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was unveiled at the [[New York Auto Show#2009|2009 New York Auto Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paukert |first=Chris |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/04/08/new-york-muscled-up-2011-jeep-grand-cherokee-will-take-the-stai/ |title=New York: Muscled-up 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee will take the stairs, thank you |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=2009-04-08 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth-generation [[Jeep Grand Cherokee|Grand Cherokee]] retains its classic Jeep styling combined with a modern and sleek body style. The 2011 Grand Cherokee has won 30 awards for off-road capability, luxury, value, best-in-class, and safety, making it the most awarded SUV ever.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jeep-brand-launches-all-new-advertising-campaign-for-the-most-awarded-suv-ever---the-2011-jeep-grand-cherokee-125747013.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK2 MY11) Limited 4WD wagon (2011-03-31).jpg|thumb|left|Interior (Australia; pre-facelift)]]
The body design is all new and has undergone testing for aerodynamic efficiency while improving ruggedness with more than 5,400 welds in the body alone. This results in a 146% increase in [[torsional rigidity]] compared to the previous design.  This improves durability and reduces [[noise, vibration, and harshness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=Jeremy|title=The 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee|url=http://www.allpar.com/trucks/jeep/2011-cherokee.html|publisher=Allpar.com|accessdate=9 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the previous generations, the chassis is a steel [[Vehicle frame#Types|unibody]]. Unlike previous models, the new WK2 features four-wheel [[independent suspension]] for better on-road handling. The Grand Cherokee (with the 2011 Durango) WK2 platform uses a derivative based on [[Mercedes-Benz]]'s [[Mercedes-Benz M-Class#Third generation (W166: 2011–present)|W166]] series.

Four wheel drive systems include [[Quadra-Trac I]], [[Quadra-Trac II]], and [[Quadra-Drive II]]. Using [[Selec-Terrain]], the driver can select modes for Auto, Sport, Snow, Sand/Mud, and Rock.

Optional ''Quadra-Lift'' [[Height adjustable suspension|height adjustable]] [[air suspension]] can raise the vehicle's ground clearance up to {{convert|11.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/trucks/jeep/2011-cherokee.html |title=The 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee |publisher=Allpar.com |date=2010-05-25 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lift modes include Park, Aero, Normal Ride Height, Off-Road 1, and Off-Road 2.

Engine choices include the all new 3.6&amp;nbsp;L [[Chrysler Pentastar engine|Pentastar]] V6 and 5.7&amp;nbsp;L Hemi V8. The Hemi V8 retains the Multiple Displacement System (MDS) that shuts down four cylinders in low-power driving situations. And the V8 remains coupled with the multi-speed automatic transmission which includes Electronic Range Selection (ERS) to manually limit the high gear operating range. Trailer tow is rated {{convert|7400|lb|abbr=on}} for Hemi models and {{convert|5000|lb|abbr=on}} for Pentastar models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paukert |first=Chris |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/04/08/new-york-2011-jeep-grand-cherokee-must-serve-two-masters/ |title=New York: 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee must serve two masters |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=2009-04-08 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 5.7&amp;nbsp;L Hemi engine was retained as the V8 option, although no Hemi badging is used on the exterior of the vehicle. Also, the WK program code remains.

In mid-2012, [[electric vehicle]] manufacturer [[Amp Electric Vehicles]], announced that it would be producing an [[electric vehicle]] version of the Jeep Grand Cherokee, offering a great electric range and the same features of the Grand Cherokee. Slated to be available in early 2013, the AMP Grand Cherokee will have a starting price of around $50,000.00. AMP also produces [[electric vehicle]] versions of a [[step van]] and the [[Mercedes-Benz M-Class|Mercedes-Benz ML]]. As of April 8, 2017 the SRT Hellcat supercharged v8 was announced for the Trackhawk edition Grand Cherokee. With {{convert|707|hp|0|abbr=on}}, it will be the most powerful SUV Chrysler has ever produced.

==Trim==

The [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] '''WK2''' is available in several different trim levels, each offering their own, distinct level of standard and optional equipment:

'''Laredo''': The Laredo became the base model of the Grand Cherokee starting in 2014. Standard equipment includes: seventeen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, a five-inch, color touch screen radio (starting in 2018, a seven-inch infotainment system), a six-speaker audio system, manually-adjustable front bucket seats, a split-folding rear 60/40 bench seat with backrest recline, premium cloth seating surfaces, air conditioning, keyless access with push-button start, a seven-inch TFT color display instrument cluster, the 3.6L Pentastar VVT FlexFuel-Capable (where applicable) V6 gasoline engine, and an eight-speed automatic transmission. There are no additional options or packages available for this trim level, due to the Laredo being a "budget" trim level for the Grand Cherokee. The differences between the Laredo "E" and Laredo are that the Laredo does not offer SiriusXM Satellite Radio like the Laredo "E", has a manually-adjustable front driver's bucket seat in place of the Laredo "E" 's power-adjustable front driver's bucket seat, and offers no additional options or packages in addition to its standard equipment.

'''Laredo "E"''': The Laredo "E" was the base model of the Grand Cherokee from 2011 until 2013 until the base Laredo model debuted in 2014. Standard equipment includes: seventeen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, an A/M-F/M stereo with single-disc CD/MP3 player and SiriusXM Satellite Radio (from 2014 until 2017, a five-inch, color touch screen radio, and a new, seven-inch infotainment system starting in 2017), a six-speaker audio system, power-adjustable front driver's and manually-adjustable front passenger's bucket seats, a split-folding rear 60/40 bench seat with backrest recline, premium cloth seating surfaces, air conditioning, keyless access with push-button start, the 3.6L Pentastar VVT FlexFuel-Capable (where applicable) V6 gasoline engine, and a five-speed (from 2014 on, an eight-speed) automatic transmission. Optional features on the Laredo "E" include eighteen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, an 8.4-inch infotainment system, heated front bucket seats, and remote start.  An Altitude package for the Laredo "E" is also available that adds gloss black-finished twenty-inch aluminum-alloy wheels and exterior accents, leather-trimmed seating surfaces with microfiber inserts, heated front bucket seats, power rear lift gate, optional single pane moonroof, and other "value-added" features that are regularly optional equipment on the Laredo "E".

'''Upland''': The Upland, available for 2018, was based on the Laredo E trim level, and utilized styling elements from the Trailhawk trim level. It included twenty-inch black-painted aluminum-alloy wheels, light blue-accented emblems, and light blue stitching on the seats, interior door panels, and center console.

'''Laredo "X"''': The Laredo "X" was available from 2011 until 2013, and was the "step-up" trim level of the Grand Cherokee. It added the following equipment to the base Laredo "E" trim level:  eighteen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, leather-trimmed seating surfaces, dual power-adjustable front bucket seats, a touch-screen infotainment system, a nine-speaker, 506-watt [[Alpine Electronics|Alpine]] premium surround-sound audio system, Bluetooth for both hands-free phone and wireless stereo audio streaming, heated front and (optional) heated rear seats, remote start, and an (optional) power rear tailgate. Other optional equipment for this trim level included the 5.7L [[HEMI]] MDS/VCT gasoline V8 engine, a six-speed automatic transmission, a dual-pane panoramic moonroof, and GPS navigation.

'''Trailhawk''': The Trailhawk is the "off-road" model of the Grand Cherokee, and was based on the Laredo "X" in 2013, and returned for 2017 based on the Limited. It adds the following features to these models of the Grand Cherokee: leather-trimmed seating surfaces with microfiber inserts, eighteen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels with a dark gray finish, the Selec-Terrain control system with Quadra-Lift air suspension, and [[Kevlar]]-coated on/off-road tires. Most of the optional features on the Laredo "X" and Limited are also available on the Trailhawk.

'''Limited''': The Limited is the "step-up" trim level of the Grand Cherokee, and succeeded the Laredo "X" when it was discontinued after 2013. It offers the same basic standard equipment as the Laredo "X", but offers additional optional features such as heated and ventilated front bucket seats, a driver's memory system, Nappa leather-trimmed seating surfaces, twenty-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, and other luxury features. The 5.7L [[HEMI]] MDS/VCT V8 gasoline engine, as well as the 3.0L [[EcoDiesel]] V6 turbocharged diesel engine (starting in 2014), are the other engine options for the Limited.

'''Sterling Edition''': The Sterling Edition is a celebratory trim level of the Grand Cherokee that will only be available for the 2018 [[Model Year]] (MY), celebrating its 25th year of production. While offering the same basic standard equipment as the luxurious Limited model, the Sterling Edition adds the following features to the trim level: twenty-inch (20") tires with twenty-inch (20") "Heritage" aluminum-alloy wheels, an 8.4-inch touch screen infotainment system with [[Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]], a nine-speaker, 506-watt [[Alpine Electronics|Alpine]] surround-sound premium audio system with subwoofer, special interior color combination options with perforated and patterned seats, unique interior trim, and special exterior badges commemorating the special edition model. A Sterling Edition Luxury Group is available for the Sterling Edition that adds features such as ventilated front seats, adaptive cruise control, blind-spot detection, rear cross-traffic alert, a panoramic dual-pane sunroof, and other luxury options. Most of the other options available on the Limited trim level are also available on the Sterling Edition, which includes the 5.7L [[HEMI]] V8 engine.

'''Overland''': The Overland is the luxury trim level of the Grand Cherokee, adding the following standard equipment to the already well-equipped Limited: Nappa leather-trimmed seating surfaces, a dual-pane panoramic moonroof, standard GPS navigation (which is otherwise an optional feature on the Limited), twenty-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, blind spot monitoring and adaptive cruise control, and other exclusive features. The 5.7L [[HEMI]] MDS/VCT V8 gasoline engine, as well as the 3.0L [[EcoDiesel]] V6 turbocharged diesel engine (starting in 2014), are the other engine options for the Overland.

'''Overland Summit''': The Overland Summit (2011-2013) and Summit (2014–present) are the most luxurious trim levels of the Grand Cherokee, and are based on the luxurious Overland, but add additional features, such as: Summit-exclusive interior color options, a nineteen-speaker [[Harman Kardon]] premium amplified surround-sound audio system with 825-watt amplifier (2014–present models ONLY), twenty-inch chrome-clad aluminum-alloy wheels, and other exclusive features. In 2017, the Summit became more luxurious by offering exclusive quilted and perforated leather-trimmed seating surfaces, lace-style polished aluminum-alloy wheels, and the Summit California Edition package, which replaces some of the chrome exterior accents with exterior color-keyed accents.

'''[[Street &amp; Racing Technology|SRT]] 392''': The SRT 392 was the highest-performance Grand Cherokee model available from 2012-2017, and then became the second most high-performance Grand Cherokee model in 2018. The SRT 392 is powered by the 6.4L [[HEMI]] MDS/VCT V8 gasoline engine, and features more "performance-oriented" exterior and interior styling unique to the SRT 392. Several special edition models, such as the SRT 392 Alpine and Vapor Editions, and the SRT 392 Red Vapor Edition, were "limited-run" models that were based on the SRT 392.

'''[[Street &amp; Racing Technology|SRT]] Trackhawk''': The SRT Trackhawk model debuted for 2018, and became the highest-performance model in the Grand Cherokee lineup. While offering the same standard and optional equipment as the SRT 392, the SRT Trackhawk swapped the SRT 392 's 6.4L [[HEMI]] V8 gasoline engine for the same 707-horsepower 6.2L Supercharged [[Hemi]] V8 gasoline engine that is currently used in the [[Dodge Challenger]] SRT Hellcat and the [[Dodge Charger (LX)]] SRT Hellcat. The SRT Trackhawk is the most powerful [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] model to ever be produced, following the 1998 [[Jeep Grand Cherokee (ZJ)]] 5.9L Limited, the 2006 [[Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK)]] SRT-8, and the 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK2) SRT 392.

==Issues==

===Maneuverability and handling, 2012===

In 2012, Swedish automotive magazine ''[[Teknikens Värld]]'' revealed that the Jeep Grand Cherokee failed one of their avoidance maneuver tests known as the "[[Moose test]]". Other SUV models in its class had no issues passing the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/07/09/watch-a-jeep-grand-cherokee-fail-swedens-moose-test |title= Watch a Jeep Grand Cherokee fail Sweden's Moose Test *UPDATE|publisher=Autoblog.com|accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; German magazine ''[[Auto, Motor und Sport]]'' (AMS) later tested the same press vehicle in a slightly different avoidance maneuver test that meets ISO ([[International Organization for Standardization]]) standards. Unlike the results of the Swedish test, the Jeep remained on all four wheels and did not lose any tires to a [[Blowout (tire)|blowout]].&lt;ref name="2nd moose test"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.consumerreports.org/cars/2012/08/jeep-grand-cherokee-survives-different-european-moose-test.html|title=Jeep Grand Cherokee survives different European "moose test"|last=Mutchler|first=Tom|date=August 1, 2012|publisher=Consumer Reports|access-date=6 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312122253/http://news.consumerreports.org/cars/2012/08/jeep-grand-cherokee-survives-different-european-moose-test.html#|archive-date=2013-03-12|url-status=dead|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Teknikens Värld'' tested the updated 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee and found that it passed the test; even up to a speed of {{convert|71|kph|mph|disp=flip|abbr=on|1}}.&lt;ref name=moosetest2014&gt;{{cite web|last=Rabe |first=Mattias |title=This is how the new Jeep Grand Cherokee 2014 handles the moose test |url=http://www.teknikensvarld.se/jeepmoosetest-2014/ |work=Teknikens Värld |access-date=3 January 2014 |author2=linus projtz |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104045911/http://www.teknikensvarld.se/jeepmoosetest-2014/ |archive-date=January 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Updates==

===2011===
On April 20, 2011, Jeep announced that the SRT8 version would be debuted at the [[New York International Auto Show|2011 New York Auto Show]]. According to Chrysler, it would be the most powerful Jeep ever built. It can accelerate from 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph in 4.7 seconds and can do the quarter-mile in 13.4 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2012-jeep-grand-cherokee-srt8-test-reviews|title=2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8|publisher=caranddriver.com |date=July 2011 |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Auto reviews measured this at 4.5 seconds, making the 2014 SRT the fastest Jeep ever produced at the time.&lt;ref name="2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT"&gt;{{cite web|last1=car and driver|title=2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/jeep/grand-cherokee-srt|website=caranddriver.com|publisher=car and driver|accessdate=2015-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2013-14 SRT Jeep Grand Cherokee includes a 6.4L Hemi motor producing {{Convert|470|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|465|lbft|0|abbr=on}}, which was the most powerful engine ever included in a Jeep at the time of production.

The Grand Cherokee SRT8 debuted alongside two other vehicles manufactured by [[Chrysler Corporation]]: the [[Chrysler 300|Chrysler 300 SRT8]] and [[Dodge Charger (LX)|Dodge Charger SRT8]], both of which also took a one-year hiatus while the new models debuted.

The new Grand Cherokee SRT8, which started production on July 16, 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wk2jeeps.com/wk2_srt8.htm |title=Jeep Grand Cherokee WK2 - 6.4L SRT8 |publisher=Wk2jeeps.com |accessdate=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; is equipped with a {{convert|470|hp|kW PS|abbr=on|0}} 6.4&amp;nbsp;L [[Chrysler Hemi engine|Hemi]] V8 engine. Jeep claims the new SRT8 gets 13&amp;nbsp;percent better fuel economy than its predecessor.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} To improve gas mileage,{{Clarify|date=September 2012}} Jeep has employed a new active exhaust system that lets Chrysler's cylinder-deactivation Fuel Saver Technology operate over a wider rpm band. Chrysler claims that with the larger gas tank, the SUV can now travel up to {{convert|500|mi|km}} on a single tank, while other sources estimate range to be {{convert|450|mi|km}}.

[[File:2013 Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK2 MY14) Laredo CRD 4WD wagon (2015-07-24) 02.jpg|thumb|right|2014 model year update]]
[[File:" 15 - ITALY - Jeep (Fiat) showroom in Milan 05.jpg|thumb|right|Interior (Italy; facelift)]]
On January 14, 2013, Jeep unveiled a revised WK2 Grand Cherokee at the [[North American International Auto Show#2013|North American International Auto Show]] at [[Cobo Center]], along with a revised 2014 [[Jeep Compass]] and [[Jeep Patriot]].  The new Grand Cherokee offered a [[List of VM Motori engines#A 630 DOHC|3.0 L DOHC V6 diesel]] engine that gets up to 30 [[Miles per gallon|MPG]], a 3.6 L [[Pentastar]] V6 engine that gets up to 24 [[Miles per gallon|MPG]] and has {{Convert|290|hp|0|abbr=on}}, a 5.7 L [[HEMI]] V8 engine that gets up to 21 MPG and has {{Convert|360|hp|0|abbr=on}}, and the 6.4 L HEMI engine that produces {{Convert|470|hp|0|abbr=on}} (SRT only). The models are the Laredo, the Limited, the Overland, and the Overland Summit Edition model has been renamed Summit. A new front end with a revised body-colored grille, new, smaller headlamps, and new tail lamps round out the exterior changes.  The silver bezel on the back was removed.  The opening rear tailgate window of previous models has been replaced with fixed glass. There are also new seventeen, eighteen, and twenty-inch wheel and tire choices. The [[SRT8]] model will continue to be offered but as an "SRT" and not an "SRT8" badged model, and for the first time will offer signature details like blacked-out head and tail lamps.  Inside, the Summit model receives the SRT's nineteen-speaker [[Harman/Kardon]] [[surround sound]] system, all Grand Cherokees receive a new steering wheel with standard [[paddle shifters]] in every model, an eight-speed [[ZF 8HP transmission|TorqueFlite 8]] [[automatic transmission]], and an 8.4-inch [[touch screen]] display with [[Garmin]] navigation software, an optional CD player, and the U Connect Access System first introduced in the all-new 2013 [[Ram 1500]]. A U Connect 5.0 touch-screen radio will also be available with an optional CD player. The [[Selec-Terrain]] System receives multiple upgrades on [[four-wheel-drive]] Grand Cherokees.  New exterior colors, new interior fabrics and materials, and new interior colors become available.

For 2014, "SRT8" was no longer a model of Jeep, but a separate corporate entity.  The "8" was also dropped in the "SRT" line for this year, the Grand Cherokee being referred to as a "SRT Jeep Grand Cherokee."  The SRT model received many new and unique features.  For example, in the interior, it received a unique steering wheel with the SRT insignia, twenty-inch [[alloy wheels]], performance tires, and additional SRT-only details including:
* SRT-only 6.4l V8, {{Convert|470|hp|0|abbr=on}}/{{Convert|465|lbft|0|abbr=on}}, propelling it from 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph in 4.5 seconds&lt;ref name="2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT"/&gt;
* Six piston Brembo Brakes at the front and four piston Brembo brakes at the rear
* 3 season tires (optional)
* SRT-only performance pages in the head unit, displaying engine statistics, quarter mile/0-60, and other metrics
* Nappa leather seats with SRT-only Alcantara inserts and headliner
* SRT-only fascia covering hitch (if so provisioned)
* SRT-only suspension modes, including track mode
* SRT-only "launch" mode, designed to model world class professional driver techniques
* upgraded software for transmission, with over 90 gear shift programs

===2015===
[[File:2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK2 MY15) SRT wagon (23490804895).jpg|thumb|right|2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT]]
The 2015 Limited Edition model no longer has the dual exhausts. This feature only comes in the Overland and up editions. There are no other major changes for the 2015 model year. However, the Limited, Summit, and Overland trims will include [[HD Radio]] as part of the U Connect feature. The SRT receives a modest {{Convert|5|hp|0|abbr=on}} bump, in part due to a reflash of the PCM. This model became the last to be sold to Canadian market.

===2017===

At the [[New York International Auto Show#2016|2016 New York International Auto Show]], Jeep announced new updates for its Grand Cherokee mid size SUV, which included two new trim levels:&lt;ref&gt;http://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=17373&amp;mid=4&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Trailhawk''' trim level is the "off-road" oriented trim level, which made its initial appearance in 2013, returns for 2017. It includes Quadra-Drive II four-wheel-drive system along with Quadra-Lift air suspension system, the Selec-Speed control, and Hill Descent Control. It will offer the same seven-slot front grille that was first offered on the 2016 Grand Cherokee Laredo and Limited 75th Anniversary Edition models, red-painted front-mounted tow hooks, standard eighteen-inch and optional twenty-inch alloy wheels, special off-road tires with [[Kevlar]] coating, Neutral Gray-painted exterior accents and badges, optional [[Mopar]] side rock rails, a standard U Connect 8.4-inch touch-screen infotainment system, red accent stitching throughout the interior, a 'Trailhawk' emblem on the steering wheel, brushed Piano black interior trim panels, and gunmetal finished interior components.

The '''Summit''' trim level is the "upscale" version of the Grand Cherokee, which was revamped in 2014, and was revamped again for 2017. It offers a restyled front grille with LED front fog lamps, and new, twenty-inch polished alloy wheels. It features include cross-stitched leather-trimmed interior, Active Noise Cancellation, an acoustic windshield and front side glass,  leather-trimmed dashboard and door panel inserts, a nineteen-speaker, 825-watt [[Harman Kardon]] surround-sound system with Green Edge technology, automatically-folding power side view mirrors, a suede-trimmed headliner, a Blind-Spot Monitoring System, Lane Departure Warning, Parallel and Perpendicular Park Assist Systems, [[Berber carpet|Berber]] carpeting, and other Summit-exclusive interior appointments.

New exterior paint color options include Rhino, Diamond Black Crystal Pearl Coat, Light Brown Stone, True Blue, and Ivory Pearl Coat (availability varies by trim level).

All 2017 models received a second facelift that features new alloy wheel designs, reshaped headlights and a reshaped grill. The new grill and headlights come from the 75th Anniversary Edition models of 2016, however, without the bronze-painted accents. In addition, all models receive a new 'GRAND CHEROKEE' emblem for the front doors.

The 75th Anniversary Edition models, based on the base Laredo and mid-level Limited, also continue on for 2017.

The SRT trim for 2017 got a new front fascia and a new interior.

The mid-level Limited trim receives a standard U Connect 4C 8.4 infotainment system with [[Garmin]] GPS navigation, which was previously available as an extra-cost option, leaving only the base Laredo, Laredo E, and Upland trims with the base U Connect 4 7.0 infotainment system as standard equipment.

==Recall==
Approximately 1.1 million 2014-2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee, as well as 2012-2014 [[Chrysler 300#Second generation LX (2011–present)|Chrysler 300]] and [[Dodge Charger (LX/LD)|Dodge Charger]] vehicles were recalled for rollaway risks. Drivers may mistakenly believe they have engaged the vehicles in park mode, allowing the vehicle to roll away. The recall was linked to [[Anton Yelchin|1 death]], 41 injuries, 212 crashes, and 308 reports of property damage.&lt;ref name="2016Recall"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woodall|first1=Bernie|last2=Shepardson|first2=David|title=Fiat Chrysler sees first software fixes for recalled Jeeps this month|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fiat-chrysler-recall-idUSKCN0Z919J |agency=Reuters|date=June 23, 2016 |accessdate= April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift lever was changed to a more traditional unit starting with 2016 model Grand Cherokees. In 2016, [[Star Trek]] actor [[Anton Yelchin]] was in his driveway when his Grand Cherokee rolled backwards, and crushed him against a pillar outside his driveway. On March 24, 2018, it was revealed that Yelchin's family received a recall notice from [[Chrysler]] exactly one week following his death. The family has settled a wrongful death lawsuit with [[Chrysler]].

Manufactured and marketed by [[Jeep]] for the 2005 model year, the third generation '''Grand Cherokee (WK)''' debuted at the [[New York International Auto Show#2004|2004 New York International Auto Show]] and subsequently in Europe at ''Euro Camp Jeep'' in [[Ardèche]], France.

Major features included [[Quadra-Drive II]] four-wheel drive, rear-seat [[DVD player]], and optional 5.7&amp;nbsp;L Hemi V8 engine. The 3.7&amp;nbsp;L [[V6 engine]] replaced the 4.0&amp;nbsp;L [[straight-6]] engine. Notably, the WK featured independent front suspension.

In 2008, the WK received a minor facelift with revised headlights and high intensity discharge (HID) Headlamps with auto leveling.  The lower portion of the front bumper became removable to increase the approach angle for off-road use. The 4.7&amp;nbsp;L was refined, now producing {{convert|305|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|334|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}.

The 2009 Jeep Grand Cherokee was available with an improved 5.7&amp;nbsp;L [[Hemi engine]] rated at {{convert|360|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|390|lb·ft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The engine uses [[variable valve timing]] to increase fuel economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeephorizons.com/news/09_grand_cherokee_090108.html|title=2009 Jeep Grand Cherokee Gets Powerful Boost from New HEMI Engine and More Premium Amenities |work= jeephorizons.com |accessdate=September 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notes ==
{{More citations needed|date=March 2018}}
* The 4.7&amp;nbsp;L High Output engine that first appeared with the Grand Cherokee '''Overland''' '''WJ''' was dropped from the Jeep lineup. It was used in the [[Dodge Dakota]] and [[Ram Pickup|Dodge Ram]] 1500. The 4.7&amp;nbsp;L was revised in 2008, increasing horsepower and torque to {{convert|310|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|330|lb·ft|N·m|0|abbr=on}} of torque. A dedicated High Output version was dropped as a result.
* The WK was known as a WH in international (i.e. non-US) markets.
* The 5.7&amp;nbsp;L HEMI engine for 2005-2008 has slightly less horsepower than those found in the Dodge Ram or the Dodge Charger (330 vs 345) due to different [[engine control unit]] (ECU) programming.
* The 5.7&amp;nbsp;L HEMI engine for 2009 and up was upgraded with Variable Cam Timing (VCT) adding {{convert|27|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|14|lb·ft|N·m|0|abbr=on}} of torque.
* The 3.0&amp;nbsp;L diesel ceased production for North America at the end of 2008.  The late production models with diesel engines are commonly referred to as 2008.5 models.  They can not be stamped as 2009 models due to more restrictive diesel emissions standards.

== SRT-8 ==

{{See also|Street &amp; Racing Technology}}
[[File:Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8.jpg|thumbnail|Jeep SRT8]]
An ''SRT-8'' ([[Street &amp; Racing Technology]] V8) version of the Grand Cherokee debuted at the [[New York International Auto Show#2005|2005 New York International Auto Show]]. Powered by a {{convert|420|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version of the 6.2&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Chrysler Hemi engine#6.1|Hemi]]'', it also features upgraded [[Brembo]] brakes, large dual performance exhaust with polished tips (exiting out the middle of the rear), [[Bilstein Shock Absorbers|Bilstein]] performance gas charged shocks and modified suspension components, Mercedes-Benz NAG1 (WA580) 5-speed transmission, unique NV146 transfer case, specially designed electronic all-wheel-drive system and interior and exterior updates. A drive shaft from a diesel application, fortified [[Dana 44]] rear differential, and 11.2" (285&amp;nbsp;mm) wide Goodyear tires in the rear (10" or 255&amp;nbsp;mm in the front) complement the performance package. The sports tuned suspension allows the Jeep SRT8 to develop 0.92&amp;nbsp;g on the skid-pad.

A road test of the 2006 production model conducted by ''[[Road &amp; Track]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-reviews/car-comparison-tests/chariots-with-fire-2006-jeep-grand-cherokee-srt8 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201154227/http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-reviews/car-comparison-tests/chariots-with-fire-2006-jeep-grand-cherokee-srt8 |title=Chariots With Fire: 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8 |publisher=Road &amp; Track |date=October 9, 2006 |accessdate=June 12, 2015 |archivedate=February 1, 2014 |first=Mike |last=Monticello}}&lt;/ref&gt; yielded a [[0 to 60 mph]] (97&amp;nbsp;km/h) time of 4.6 seconds and a quarter mile [[dragstrip]] of 13.2 seconds at {{convert|104.1|mph|1|abbr=on}}. Such numbers made the SRT-8 Grand Cherokee the fastest accelerating vehicle within the SRT-8 lineup, second only to the Dodge Viper SRT10 among all SRT vehicles. There is no electronic speed governor employed, leaving the top speed rev-limited (revving to redline in top gear) to {{convert|170|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/tests/comparison/chariots-with-fire/chariots_with_fire-3a_2006_jeep_grand_cherokee_srt8_page_3 |last=Monticello |first=Mike |title=Chariots with Fire |journal=Road &amp; Track |date=November 2006 |accessdate=2011-09-28 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401201829/http://www.roadandtrack.com/tests/comparison/chariots-with-fire/chariots_with_fire-3a_2006_jeep_grand_cherokee_srt8_page_3 |archivedate=2012-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To improve on-road handling and decrease weight, off-road gear has been removed. The SRT-8 uses an NV146 transfer case, which uses an electronic-applied clutch pack to transfer 0-50% of torque to the front axle but has no low-range or manual controls.  The front and rear differentials are both open, with no limited-slip capability. Its ride stance is significantly lower and the front fascia [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] gives the vehicle {{convert|7|in|mm|0}} of [[Ride height|ground clearance]]. A total of 14,921 Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8s were manufactured.

== Models ==

'''Laredo''': The Laredo served as the entry-level Grand Cherokee model offering an A/M-F/M [[radio]] with single-disc [[CD player]] (later, an auxiliary audio input jack was also added), seventeen-inch alloy wheels, power windows, door locks, side mirrors, and driver's seat, [[lumbar]] support, [[keyless entry]] with [[security system]], cloth seating surfaces, tinted windows, and six speakers. Features such as leather seating surfaces, heated front seats, side [[airbags]], a [[Boston Acoustics]] premium sound system, a [[navigation system]] and a [[CD]] and [[MP3]] changer, as well as a CD/MP3/Cassette combo could be added to further enhance this model.

'''Limited''': Limited trim added an A/M-F/M radio with six-disc in-dash CD changer, a [[Boston Acoustics]] premium sound system, full-sized spare [[tire]], and [[leather]] seating surfaces. Features such as a sunroof, heated front seats, and chrome wheels could also be added.

'''Overland''': The Overland added [[Uconnect]] Hands-Free [[Bluetooth]] technology, a six-disc in-dash CD/MP3 changer with [[navigation system]], [[satellite radio]], leather and suede seats, heated front seats, a sunroof, and chrome wheels.

== Diesel ==

[[File:2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee 3.0 Diesel engine.JPG|thumb|right|2005 Grand Cherokee with 3.0 V6 Turbo Diesel]]
In Europe, South America, South Africa and Australia, a [[V6]] [[Common Rail Diesel|CRD]] engine produced by [[Mercedes-Benz]] was available from the Grand Cherokee (WK) introduction in 2005:
: [[Mercedes-Benz OM642 engine|OM642]] 3.0&amp;nbsp;L [[Common Rail Diesel|CRD]] V6 [[Turbo]] Diesel with [[Variable geometry turbocharger]] (VGT). It produces {{convert|215|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|376|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of [[torque]] at 1,600 to 2,800 rpm at a fuel consumption of {{convert|17|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} city and {{convert|22|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} highway.
Note: MPG figures are based on [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], European combined consumption is {{convert|27.7|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus|abbr=on}}.

In North America the 3.0 CRD was available for the 2007 and 2008, however the rest of the world - i.e. UK, Europe  Australia etc., it had the Mercedes sourced engine for the production life of the vehicle from 2005. The Mercedes-Benz sourced unit meets stringent [[European emission standards|Euro 4 Emission standards]] without the need for a [[diesel particulate filter]] - which hampers vehicle efficiency, however - it includes a diesel particulate filter (North America only) to apparently further reduce exhaust emissions. It was not however available for sale in [[California]] or certain Northeast states, due to new stricter emissions regulations for non-commercial vehicles. Vehicles could be bought used in California and Northeast states, as the regulations only applied to new vehicles.

This engine is also used in the majority of Mercedes-Benz vehicles: [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class|C-Class]], [[Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class (W219)|CLS]], [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class|E-Class]], [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class|S-Class]], [[Mercedes-Benz ML-Class|ML-Class]], [[Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class|GLK-Class]], [[Mercedes-Benz GL-Class|GL-Class]], [[Mercedes-Benz G-Class|G-Class]], [[Mercedes-Benz R-Class|R-Class]], the [[Mercedes-Benz Vito|Vito / Viano]], and the [[Dodge]] / [[Freightliner Trucks|Freightliner]] / [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter]].

== Changes for the 2005-2010 Jeep Grand Cherokee WK ==

Throughout its five-model-year production run, the Jeep Grand Cherokee WK received many changes:

Launched on September 19, 2004 for the 2005 [[Model Year|model year]], the Grand Cherokee WK was all-new, following a 5-year development process from 1999 to 2004. The 3.7L Powertech V6 engine replaces the 4.0L Powertech Inline Six-Cylinder (I6) engine, and now produces a full 210 horsepower, up 15 horsepower from before. This engine is only available on the base ''Laredo'' trim level. The 4.7L Power-Tech High-Output V8 engine is replaced by a newly-available 5.7L HEMI V8 engine featuring Multi-Displacement System (MDS), which allows the Grand Cherokee to run on four cylinders while at cruising speeds to increase fuel economy ratings. The new engine produces 345 horsepower (this engine is only available on the top-of-the-line Limited trim level). The standard 4.7L Power-Tech V8 engine, optional on the base Laredo trim level, and standard on the top-of-the-line Limited trim level, carries over from the previous-generation WJ Grand Cherokee, and still produces 235 horsepower. Seventeen-inch (17") tires and alloy wheels are standard on all models. The Electronic Vehicle Information Center (EVIC) moves from the overhead console to the instrument cluster, with controls now located in the center stack, making it easier for the driver to make changes to the settings while the vehicle is in motion. A [[Mercedes-Benz]] sourced five-speed automatic transmission is standard with the V6 and SRT8 engines, though the 545RFE five-speed automatic transmission carries over on the 4.7 and 5.7L V8-equipped Grand Cherokees. The all-new Grand Cherokee also gets the latest infotainment systems, which include an available full-color 5.8" GPS navigational system, the [[U Connect]] hands-free Bluetooth telephone system, [[Sirius Satellite Radio]], and a rear seat DVD entertainment system, known as the Video Entertainment System (VES), which also included a pair of wireless [[Infrared|IR]] headphones. A six-speaker, 276-watt [[Boston Acoustics]] premium sound system also replaces the [[Infinity (audio)|Infinity]] Gold system. All four-wheel-drive systems are now computer assisted for higher traction control, and a Quadra-Drive II a four-wheel-drive system is now available on most all Grand Cherokees(See other Wiki page on Quadra-Drive 2 for more accurate information). The Selec-Trac manual four-wheel-drive system has been discontinued. A Rocky Mountain Edition trim level went into production on March 1, 2005, going on sale in late April 2005, and concluding at 9,500 examples on May 31, 2005.

For [[Model Year|MY]] 2006, production started on July 5, 2005 and concluded on June 30, 2006. Sales began in September 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wkjeeps.com/wk_production.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A 65th Anniversary Edition was introduced, which temporarily replaced the Rocky Mountain Edition trim level. The Overland trim level was new, as was an SRT-8 trim level that went into production on November 5, 2005 and went on-sale December 20, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wkjeeps.com/wk_srt8_history.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The A/M-F/M stereo with both cassette player and six-disc, in-dash CD/MP3 changer is discontinued. A new 3.0L CRD Diesel V6 engine debuts for both the Limited and Overland trim levels in mid-2006.

For [[Model Year|MY]] 2007, production started on July 17, 2006 (SRT-8, early August) and concluded on July 13, 2007. Sales began in September 1, 2006. The base Grand Cherokee Laredo gains exterior color-keyed door handles and rear brow, and revised tail lamps. The 26F and 28F Packages for the base Laredo trim level are now discontinued, though a 28E Package is now available for Laredo, for those who desire a base model with a V8 engine. The Rocky Mountain Edition returns for 2007. In some states, the 4.7 L [[Chrysler PowerTech engine|Powertech]] V8 engine is now [[FlexFuel]]-capable, and can now run on [[E85]] [[Ethanol]].

For MY 2008, production commenced on July 16, 2007 and concluded on July 11, 2008. A mid-cycle restyling was launched on September 1, 2007, with a revised front clip, and new tire and wheel combinations. A revised interior includes the latest infotainment systems, including touch-screen radios, as well as [[Sirius]] Backseat TV for rear seat passengers, a new steering wheel, a revised gauge cluster, and revised interior trim. The seat fabrics and trims are revised on all models. Midyear, the 4.7 L [[Chrysler PowerTech engine|Powertech]] V8 gets a power boost, now producing 305 horsepower, up 70 horsepower from its previous power rating. The 3.0L CRD Diesel V6 engine is also discontinued midyear 2008. Heated rear seats are now an option on some models, as is a 115 V AC household-style power outlet. The 5.7 L HEMI V8 engine also gets a power boost, now producing 360 horsepower, up 15 horsepower from its previous power rating.

For MY 2009, production began on August 11, 2008 and concluded on August 10, 2009. The 3.0L CRD Diesel V6 engine was discontinued, while an S Limited trim level, which had been available in Europe, was introduced to the United States.

For MY 2010, production began on August 17, 2009, with WK production ending on March 12, 2010. The 4.7L [[Chrysler PowerTech engine|Powertech]] V8 engine and Overland trim level were omitted. The S Limited trim level is also discontinued, as is the Rocky Mountain Edition trim level. The base Laredo trim level gains the option of a 5.7 L HEMI V8 engine, and the Limited trim level gains the option of a 3.7 L [[PowerTech]] V6 engine, following the discontinuation of the 4.7 L [[PowerTech]] V8 engine for all Grand Cherokee models.

The '''Jeep Grand Cherokee (WJ)''' is the second generation of the [[Jeep]] Grand Cherokee [[sport utility vehicle]]. Unveiled in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] on June 16, 1998, production lasted until 2004. The WJ was completely overhauled from its ZJ predecessor, and was renowned for its off-road capability. Jeep marketed the '''(WJ)''' as "the most capable SUV ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.jeep.com/history.html|title=Jeep History - Jeep Models By Year|website=www.jeep.com|access-date=2019-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|2}}

==Background==
Unveiled at [[Detroit, MI]] [[Cobo Hall]] on June 16, 1998, the redesigned '''WJ''' 1999 Grand Cherokee shared just 127&amp;nbsp;parts with its predecessor (mostly fasteners) and took 28 months to develop from its March 1996 design freeze (styling approval in Q3 1995). The spare tire was relocated from the side of the cargo compartment to under the floor. The two heavy [[pushrod engine|pushrod]] [[V8 engine]]s were replaced by Chrysler's then-new [[Chrysler PowerTech engine#4.6|PowerTech]]. The new V8 engine produced less [[torque]] than the old pushrods, but was lighter, offered better fuel economy, and provided similar on road performance figures (the 23-gallon fuel tank was replaced with one of a 20.5-gallon capacity). The Inline 6 engine was also updated for MY1999. A redesign of the intake manifold added {{convert|10|hp}}. While other Jeep vehicles used the Mopar 5 x 4.5 bolt circle, this was the first Jeep following the 1987 Chrysler buyout to receive a wider wheel bolt pattern:&amp;nbsp;– 5 x 5 - (metric 5 x 127mm).

A notable feature available in this generation was the automatic four wheel drive option called ''[[Quadra-Drive]]'', which employed the New Venture Gear NV247 transfer case. This two-speed chain-driven transfer case uses a gerotor, a clutch pack coupled to a hydraulic pump, to transfer torque between the front and rear axles. The transfer case contains three modes, 4-All Time, Neutral, and 4-Lo. In 4-All Time, 100% of torque is sent to the rear axle in normal conditions. If the rear axle starts spinning at a higher rate than the front axle, hydraulic pressure builds up in the gerotor and causes the clutch pack to progressively transfer torque to the front axle until both axles return to the same speed. Neutral mode is intended for towing the vehicle. In 4-Lo, the front and rear axles are locked together through a 2.72 reduction gear ratio. The NV247 transfer case is mated to front and rear axles containing Jeep's Vari-Lok differentials. Vari-Lok differentials also use a gerotor to transfer torque between the wheels on either side of the axle. The major advantage of Quadra-Drive was that the combined transfer case and progressive locking differentials in each axle could automatically control traction between all four wheels. However, only the center differential could be permanently locked, and only in 4Lo. The [[Quadra-Trac II]] system included the NV247 transfer case with the standard open front and rear differentials.

The ''[[Chrysler 45RFE transmission|45RFE]]'' and ''[[Chrysler 545RFE transmission|545RFE]]'' [[automatic transmission]] in the WJ was notable. It included three [[planetary gear]] sets rather than the two normally used in a four-speed automatic. This gave it six theoretical speeds, and it would have been the first six-speed transmission ever produced in volume, but it was programmed to only use five of these ratios. Four were used for upshifts, with a different second gear for downshifts. Although five of the six ratios were used, Chrysler decided to call it a "4-speed automatic". In 2001, the programming was changed to make use of all six ratios. Rather than have six forward gears, the transmission was programmed to act as a five-speed with the alternate second gear for downshifts. The rpm at {{convert|70|mi/h|0|abbr=}} on a 545RFE is 2000 rpm, 200 rpm less than the 45RFE programming. 1999 and 2000 model year WJ owners can have their 45RFE transmission's programming flashed to enable the extra gear as both transmissions are physically the same. The 42RE 4-speed automatic remained the transmission for the Inline 6 engine. It had slight changes from the previous model Grand Cherokee.

The interior was also completely redesigned. The redesign allowed for larger rear doors, and more space for rear passengers. Controls for various items like headlights, heated seats, and rear wiper were moved to more convenient locations. The electronic Vehicle Information Center was moved from below the radio to above the windshield, and was standard on all 2000 and up models. Limited models included automatic dual-zone climate control. A 10 CD-Changer was also available with the Infinity Audio package.

In addition to Jeep's UniFrame construction, Daimler Chrysler partnered with Porsche to further strengthen the frame.{{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion.|date=April 2009}} This was done to reduce NVH (noise, vibration, and harshness). UniFrame is an unusual construction scheme, it incorporates all of the strength and durability of a body-on-frame construction into a unitized construction. By adding stiffness and rigidity to the structure, they enhanced the ride and strengthened the network of steel beams, rails and pillars (or "safety cage") that surround and protect occupants. More than 70 percent of the underbody is high-strength steel. All Jeep Grand Cherokees feature UniFrame construction.

The Grand Cherokee received a secondary minor facelift for 2004 including round fog lamps, a lower front [[Fascia (car)|fascia]] and a new body-color matched inset grille design.

Export models produced at the plant in Graz, Austria, were given the vehicle designation of "WG".

== New Features ==

The first-generation [[Jeep Grand Cherokee (ZJ)]] offered many new and class-exclusive features, and the second-generation [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] WJ continued to offer new features that were not yet available on its competitors, such as the [[Chevrolet Blazer]] and [[Ford Explorer]].

At the time of its release, the all-new 1999 [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] WJ had many standard and optional features which were class-exclusive. [[HomeLink]] allowed the driver to program up to three devices such as garage door openers, estate gates, and other [[controlled access]] devices and operate those devices with buttons located in the overhead console. A state-of-the-art automatic dual-zone climate control system used [[infrared]] sensors located in the climate control panel to monitor the surface temperature of both driver and front passenger to automatically control the interior temperature for both front passengers. The [[Jeep]] Memory System allowed for two drivers to set their individual driver's seat, side mirror, and radio setting by using buttons located on the front driver's door interior panel to recall their preferred settings at the touch of a button, or upon insertion of the corresponding key into the ignition (the keyless entry remotes were color-coded either black or gray, and had either a '1' or '2' on the back of the remote to help the drivers easily identify their remote).

In 2002, the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] WJ added even more new features. These new features included power-adjustable foot pedals via a switch located on the driver's side near the steering wheel (the pedals also worked in conjunction with the [[Jeep]] Memory System to adjust automatically to a driver's preferred settings when a button on the front driver's door interior panel was depressed). Optional [[Supplementary Restraint System|SRS]] Side Curtain Airbags for the front passengers were available on all Grand Cherokee models for added protection. The [[Uconnect]] hands-free [[Bluetooth]] telephone system allowed the driver to pair his or her [[Bluetooth]]-enabled [[cellular phone]] to the system and make and receive hands-free telephone calls without having to handle their phone, and the driver could even store frequently-called telephone numbers in the system's memory for automatic dialing via voice. The button panel for the system was located on the front driver's door interior panel. [[Sirius]] [[Satellite Radio]] was also available for the first time regardless of factory radio option. The [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] was one of the first vehicles to offer these features from the factory.

The '''Laredo''' served as the base Grand Cherokee trim level from August 1998 to 2004, and still continues to be the base Grand Cherokee trim level to this day. A very well-equipped model, the Laredo offered these features as standard equipment: the 4.0L Power-Tech Inline Six-Cylinder (I6) engine, a 4-speed automatic transmission, sixteen-inch (16") alloy wheels, an A/M-F/M stereo with cassette and CD player (1998-2001) or CD players (2001-2004), wood interior trim (1998-2000) or aluminum interior trim (2000-2004), keyless entry, power windows and door locks, cloth seating surfaces, air conditioning, a split-folding 60/40 rear bench seat, gray-painted front and rear bumpers and body-side cladding trim panels, and more. After MY1999, the '''Laredo 26D Package''' was dropped, leaving the '''Laredo 26E/28E Packages''' as the base Grand Cherokee packages, and adding a standard overhead Electronic Vehicle Information Center (EVIC/VIC) and overhead console. Many features that were available on the luxurious Limited trim could also be optioned on the base Laredo trim. For 2001 only, a New England Special Group was available for Grand Cherokees equipped with the 26E Package. The package, which was indicated by the sales code ACJ, added features to the base model Grand Cherokee such as P235/65R17 BSW all-season performance tires, seventeen-inch (17") sport alloy wheels (both options of which were also available with the 26S and 28S Packages), an A/M-F/M stereo with cassette and CD players with integrated remote CD changer controls, and a 3.73 rear axle ratio. The New England Special Group was available exclusively in select Northeastern states.

The '''Limited''' served as the top-of-the-line Grand Cherokee trim level from 1998 to 2001, and the more "luxurious" Grand Cherokee trim level from 2001 to 2004. It added these features: color-keyed body-side trim cladding panels and front and rear bumpers, a premium 180-watt Infinity Gold stereo system with 6 speakers, leather seating surfaces, dual power front bucket seats, a full-sized spare tire and spare wheel, a security alarm, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, steering wheel-mounted remote audio system controls, driver's 2-position memory (color-coded keyless entry remotes), wood interior trim, and more.

The '''Sport''' was the lowest-priced trim level of the Grand Cherokee was introduced in November 2001, for MY2002. Offered only for 2002, the Sport was aimed at value-oriented customers who wanted a very well-equipped vehicle at a modest price point. It added these features to the base Laredo trim: dual power front heated bucket seats, leather seating surfaces, an A/M-F/M stereo with cassette and CD players, a premium 180-watt Infinity Gold audio system with 6 speakers, a full-sized spare tire and spare wheel, a 'sport' emblem on the tailgate, a security alarm, a power sunroof, and more. Cloth seating surfaces, deleted heated front bucket seats, a deleted cassette player, and a deleted sunroof could be had for credit in place of the standard options they replaced.

The '''Special Edition''' was a value-oriented trim level of the Grand Cherokee in 2002 and in 2004 (the model was put on hiatus for the 2003 model year). Based on the base Laredo trim, the Special Edition added these features: a full-sized spare tire/wheel, heated power dual front bucket seats, leather seating surfaces &amp; leather-wrapped steering wheel, an A/M-F/M stereo with cassette, CD player, 10 disc rear mounted CD changer, color-keyed body-side cladding panels and front and rear bumpers, a security alarm, power sunroof, and 'Special Edition' emblems on both front doors (the 2004 model did not have heated power dual front bucket seats, leather seating surfaces &amp; leather-wrapped steering wheel", only power seats. The power sunroof was an option)

The '''Freedom''' was a value-oriented trim level of the Grand Cherokee between March 2003 (SOP 2003/03/10) and 2004. Based on the base Laredo trim, the Freedom added these features: a full-sized spare tire and spare wheel, seventeen-inch (17") graphite-finish alloy wheels, unique cloth seating surfaces, dual power front bucket seats, an A/M-F/M stereo with cassette and CD players, a premium 180-watt Infinity Gold audio system with 6 speakers, and 'Freedom' emblems on both front doors.

Based on the base Laredo trim, the Columbia Edition added these features: a full-sized spare tire and spare wheel, seventeen-inch (17") alloy wheels, unique two-toned cloth seating surfaces, dual power front bucket seats, an A/M-F/M stereo with cassette and CD players, a premium 180-watt Infinity Gold audio system with 6 speakers, Bright Silver Metallic-painted body-side cladding panels and front and rear bumpers, and 'Columbia Edition' emblems on both front doors. Columbia Edition buyers also received a complimentary [[Columbia Sportswear|Columbia]] [[parka]] at the time of delivery of their new vehicle.
[[File:4.7 Powertech engine Jeep WJ.jpg|thumb|4.7 V8 Powertech engine Jeep WJ]]

The '''Overland''' was the top-of-the-line Grand Cherokee trim level between August 2001 and 2004, first introduced for MY2002. It added these features to the already-luxurious Limited trim level: an A/M-F/M stereo with cassette and CD players, a ten-disc remote rear-mounted CD changer, unique seventeen-inch (17") chrome-plated alloy wheels, unique leather-and-suede seating surfaces, dual power heated front bucket seats, a matching spare wheel, 'Overland' emblems on both front doors and the tailgate, a power sunroof, and the higher-output 4.7L Power-Tech V8 engine, which could also be had on the Limited trim.

The '''60th Anniversary Edition''' was manufactured to commemorate [[Jeep]]'s 60th anniversary in 2001. It added these features to the luxurious Limited trim level: unique seventeen-inch (17") "Rogue" chrome-plated alloy wheels, '60th Anniversary Edition' emblems on both upper front fenders, heated front bucket seats, a power sunroof, an A/M-F/M stereo with cassette and CD players, a matching spare wheel, and '60th Anniversary Edition'-embroidered front bucket seats.

== Chinese production ==
[[File:Jeep Grand Cherokee WJ 01 China 2016-04-06.jpg|alt=|thumb|Beijing Jeep 4000 Grand Cherokee (China)]]
Beijing Jeep Corporation, Ltd. produced the XJ classic Cherokee from 1984 to 2005. Beijing Jeep bought the old tooling for the WJ Grand Cherokee when the WK was introduced for the U.S. as a 2005 model. The WJ was introduced in the end of 2004 for the Chinese market as the Jeep 4000 and 4700 Grand Cherokee and carries differing engine names compared to their foreign counterparts known as C698QA1 for the 6 cylinder and C8V93Q for the V8. A 4 speed automatic gearbox was standard on the 6 cylinder while V8 had a 5 speed automatic gearbox. Pricing ranges 358,000 and 496,000 yuan (53,480 to 74,090 USD) with four trim levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://car.autohome.com.cn/config/spec/902.html#pvareaid=3454541|title=Jeep 4000 and 4700 specs}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was their flagship model and nearly identical to the 2004 Grand Cherokee Limited in looks and equipment, including the solid axle suspension, choice of 4wd systems, body color cladding, alloy wheels, Chrysler sound systems, and Chrysler automatic climate controls. This is unlike the XJ Cherokee that was significantly modified by Beijing Jeep for the Chinese market.

===Changes for the 1999-2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee WJ===
Throughout its production run, the Grand Cherokee received many changes.

For '''1999''', the Grand Cherokee "WJ" was all-new, now in its second generation. The 4.0L PowerTech Inline Six-Cylinder (I6) engine was reworked, and received an increase in power, up to 195 horsepower and 225 lb. ft. of torque. The 5.2L Magnum V8 engine was replaced with an all-new 4.7L PowerTech V8 engine that now produced {{Convert|235|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|305|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque.

For '''2000''', since the Grand Cherokee was fully redesigned and all-new for MY1999, the 2000 model year Grand Cherokee received minimal changes. An accessory [[Mopar]] GPS navigation system, a new technology, was available starting in the third quarter of 1999. The base Laredo package was now the 26E Package, replacing the previously-available 26D Package. An overhead console with mini trip computer and EVIC, or VIC, was now standard equipment in all Grand Cherokees. Heated leather-trimmed front bucket seats, which were previously only available on the Limited trim level, were now available on the base Laredo trim level, when equipped with the 26F or 28F Packages.

In late 2000 For '''2001''' model year, the Grand Cherokee received a few changes. The Limited received new features, such as new seventeen-inch (17") tires and alloy wheels, the deletion of the gold emblem and side pinstripe option, a standard A/M-F/M stereo with both cassette and CD players, new "Royale" leather-trimmed heated seating surfaces, revised wood interior trim, a new, white-faced electroluminescent gauge cluster and a few other minor changes. The Limited also received the optional 60TH Anniversary Edition Package. The base Laredo trim level received minor changes such as the addition of the New England Special Group for the base 26E Package, aluminum interior trim to replace the existing wood interior trim, a new standard A/M-F/M stereo with cassette player and new integrated remote CD changer controls, and a few other minor changes. All models received a radio bezel that matched the other interior trim panels. All 4.7L PowerTech V8-equipped Grand Cherokees received the 545RFE 5-speed automatic transmission as standard equipment (it was previously optional equipment from 1999-2000). The Camel interior color was changed to Sandstone, which is a slightly different shade of tan. The Jeep emblem on the steering wheel changed from being molded-in-color to the steering wheel to chrome.

In '''2002''', the Grand Cherokee received a minor update. The base Laredo trim level lost the New England Special Group, but gained new sixteen-inch (16") alloy wheels, a new standard A/M-F/M stereo with single-disc, in-dash CD player and remote CD changer controls, new seat fabric for vehicles equipped with cloth seating surfaces, an additional front 12V power outlet to replace the previously-standard front cigarette lighter, and a standard six-way power driver's bucket seat. Sport and Special Edition trim levels were new in midyear 2002. The top-of-the-line Overland trim level debuted for 2002. the Limited model received a new front grille and new seventeen-inch (17") alloy wheel options. All sound systems were now higher quality than their predecessors, and new radio options were offered, which could support both satellite radio, as well as a new remote six-disc CD changer, and a Bluetooth hands-free telephone system (this was a fairly new technology, and the Grand Cherokee was one of the first vehicles to have this feature as an option). Side-impact front and rear airbags that deployed from the side windows were also a new option for 2002. A new High-Output version of the 4.7L Powertech V8 engine, producing {{Convert|265|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|330|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque, was available for the Limited trim level, and standard on the new Overland trim level. A previously-optional full-sized spare tire and wheel (non-matching on base trim levels, and matching on uplevel trim levels) combination was now standard on all Grand Cherokees. On the base Laredo trim level, the carpeted trim on the lower portion of the door panels was deleted in exchange for a textured plastic surface.

At some point in the '''2002''' model year, brakes were switched from the original ATE/Teves style caliper, to a new [[Akebono Brake Industry|Akebono]] caliper. The original ATE/Teves caliper was prone to issues, the most common of which was significant steering vibration under high speed braking due to a complex set of brake pad brackets and guides to compensate for an imprecise caliper casting. In addition to loose pads that had a tendency to vibrate, this also occasionally led to higher brake temperatures, which could lead to premature failure. The Akebono calipers provided better seating for the brake pads, leading to more consistent pad placement over the life of the brakes. The hub and caliper placement did not change over the course of the WJ model, making the newer style brakes a direct bolt on replacement for older models.

In '''2003''', the Special Edition and Sport trim levels were discontinued (the Special Edition trim level would reappear for 2004). A new, A/M-F/M stereo with integral six-disc CD changer was available, and replaced the now-discontinued six-disc remote CD changer. A new, factory-installed A/M-F/M stereo with integral CD player and GPS navigation system became available midyear that replaced the previously-available dashboard-mounted unit. A new 28E Package was now available for the base Laredo trim level that offered the 4.7L PowerTech V8 engine at a budget-oriented price point. A Freedom trim level was available, based on the Laredo trim level. A coin console tray now replaced the ashtray in the center console, and high-back cloth front bucket seats were now standard equipment on the base Laredo trim level (low-back cloth bucket seats still remained available as an option, however). Production of the 2003 model year Grand Cherokees began in August of 2002, which was the shortest model year for the Grand Cherokee.

In '''2003''', during the Grand Cherokee WJ's final calendar year of production, the Special Edition trim level returned for MY2004, and a new Columbia Edition trim level was introduced in partnership with [[Columbia Sportswear]] that offered unique details, and an optional 4.7L High-Output PowerTech V8 engine on the Laredo trim level, taking on [[Chevrolet]]'s [[The North Face]] Edition trucks and SUV's. The GPS navigation system radio was now available regardless of sound system package. The base Laredo trim level was reduced to one package, the 26E and 28E Packages, though the previously-available options on other Laredo packages were now available on this base package. All trim levels received new front fascias, and all 4X4 Grand Cherokees were now Trail Rated, as indicated by an emblem on the driver's-side front fender. The 2004 model year began in early 2003, and the [[Jefferson North Assembly Plant]], or JNAP, temporarily closed in May 2004 to expand and remodel in preparation for the all-new, third-generation WK Grand Cherokee that debuted in April 2004 at the [[New York International Auto Show#2004|New York International Auto Show]] at [[Camp Jeep]] 2004.

==Recall==
On November 8, 2012, Chrysler announced the recall on certain model year 2002 though 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee vehicles manufactured February 13, 2001, through May 23, 2003. A component in the air bag control module may fail causing the front airbags, side curtain airbags, and/or seatbelt pretensioners to deploy inadvertently while the vehicle is being operated.

      <text bytes="4121" xml:space="preserve">'''Jeepito''' is a small vehicle of the [[Jeepney]] style. The company is owned by Ronald Carlton Papa Tan better known as ‘Tonton Papa’ from [[Baguio]]. He is a former TV host, a businessman and the owner of Philippine Property Central Realty and Development Inc. Jeepito means Small Jeepney. It is currently the World&amp;#39;s Smallest Philippine [[Jeepney]] and the only one of its kind.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Comanda|first1=Zaldy|title=Smallest jeepney Jeepito|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/baguio/images/2015/12/30/smallest-jeepney-jeepito-449297|website=Sun Star Baguio|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jeepito and his owners.jpg|thumb|274x274px|Jeepito and his owners entertaining the tourists at Wright Park in Baguio City.]]

== Conceptualization ==


Jeepito was designed in Tonton Papa’s private garage by him in Baguio City and then created in [[Mabalacat, Pampanga]] in another garage of his. It took 1 month for him and his co-builder/mechanic Arnel Pacia to finish the project. He used a 3- cylinder [[Suzuki|Susuki]] multicab engine and customized everything from scrap. It runs on gasoline as a fuel. What took long was finding a vintage Stainless horse for the hood of the jeep since the Stainless horse is already obsolete.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://baguiomidlandcourier.com.ph/life.asp?mode=%20archives/2016/january/1-3-2016/life2-Worlds-smallest-RP-jeepney.txt|title=World’s smallest RP jeepney highlights Pinoy’s ingenuity|date=3 January 2016|publisher=Baguio Midland Courier|issue=IXIX|last1=Palangchao|first1=Harley|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topgear.com.ph/features/feature-articles/meet-jeepito-the-world-s-smallest-jeepney|title=Meet Jeepito: The world's smallest jeepney|website=Top Gear|last1=Sarne|first1=Vernon|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He spent a total of Php165,000 to build jeepney and another Php50,000 for the registration for it to be street legal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Jeepito was  designed to be the smallest Philippine Jeepney, with a total length of 92 inches and a width of 42 inches and height of  55 inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lifestyle.abs-cbn.com/articles/0918/daily-diaries-have-you-seen-jeepito/|title=Daily Diaries: Have You Seen ‘Jeepito’?|last=Zamora|first=Verniece|date=|website=ABS-CBN Lifestyle|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeepito is currently touring the Philippines because of invitations by Government offices from different municipalities and cities to promote their Tourism. Jeepito also participates in Festival parades to liven up the public who is anticipating the presence of Jeepito.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phimtk.com/video/ntg-jeepito-na-pinakamaliit-na-jeep-sa-mundo-planong-ilibot-sa-pilipinas-d6bdd1791bb080f72e3517.html|title='Jeepito' na pinakamaliit na jeep sa mundo, planong ilibot sa Pilipinas|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jeep Cherokee''' is a line of [[United States|American]] vehicles sold by [[Jeep]] under various vehicle classes. Originally sold as a variant of the popular [[Jeep Wagoneer (SJ)|Jeep Wagoneer]], the Cherokee has evolved from a full-size [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]] to one of the first [[Compact sport utility vehicle|compact SUVs]] and eventually into its current incarnation as a [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover SUV]]. The nameplate has been in continuous use in some form since 1974 and also spawned Jeep's most successful vehicle, the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]], which was originally slated to be part of the Cherokee's lineup. The vehicle is named after the [[Cherokee]] tribe of [[Native Americans in the United States|North American Indians]].
__TOC__

==First generation (SJ)==
{{see also|Jeep Cherokee (SJ)}}
[[File:1974 Jeep Cherokee S - Beach (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|1974 Jeep Cherokee S (US)]]
The Cherokee was a rebadged reintroduction of a two-door body style [[Jeep Wagoneer (SJ)|Jeep Wagoneer]], with a redesigned [[greenhouse (car)|greenhouse]] that eliminated the car's [[Pillar (car)|C-pillar]]. Instead the Cherokee sported a much wider D-pillar and a single, long fixed rear side window with an optional flip-out section. Previously, a two-door version had been available in the Jeep Wagoneer line (from 1963 to 1967), although this had the same [[Pillar (car)|pillar]] and window configuration as the four-door Wagoneer. The Cherokee replaced the [[Jeepster Commando]], whose sales had not met expectations despite an extensive 1972 revamp. The Cherokee appealed to a younger market than the Wagoneer, which was regarded more as a family SUV.

The Cherokee was marketed as the "sporty" two-door variant of Jeep's [[station wagon]]. The term "sport(s) utility vehicle" appears for the first time in the 1974 Cherokee sales brochure.&lt;ref name=74Jeeppage&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.autopaper.com/images/2214/98959-02.jpg |title=1974 model year Jeep brochure picture – Cherokee page |publisher=Jeep |location=US |year=1973 |access-date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=74Jeepfront&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/jeep/74jeep.html |title=1974 model year Jeep Cherokee brochure – front |publisher=Jeep |location=US |year=1973 |access-date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen |first=Jim |title=Jeep: Collector's Library |publisher=Motorbooks, MBI Publishing | year=2003 |page=168 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4ywrhvzRCsEC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=term+Sport+Utility+appears+for+the+first+time+1974 |isbn= 978-0-7603-1486-9 |accessdate= September 2013 |authorlink=Jim Allen (4x4 writer)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A four-door was not added to the lineup until 1977. Other than the base model, the [[car model|trim level]]s of the Cherokee included the S (Sport), Chief, Golden Eagle, Golden Hawk, Limited, Classic, Sport, Pioneer, and Laredo.

==Second generation (XJ)==
{{see also|Jeep Cherokee (XJ)}}
[[File:Jeep Cherokee 2-door.jpg|thumb|right|1984– 2001 Jeep Cherokee 2-door]]
While the Wagoneer continued in production for another eight years as the Grand Wagoneer, the Cherokee nameplate was moved to a new platform for 1984. Without a traditional [[body-on-frame]] chassis, the Cherokee instead featured a light-weight [[unibody]] design.&lt;ref name=Allpar&gt;{{cite web|title=Jeep Cherokee, the best of breed SUV: 1975-2001 |url= http://www.allpar.com/trucks/jeep/cherokee.html |website=Allpar |accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This generation Cherokee would eventually be well-known as an innovator of the modern SUV, as it spawned competitors as other automakers began to notice that this Jeep design began replacing regular cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bradsher |first=Keith |title=High and Mighty: SUVs&amp;nbsp;— the World's Most Dangerous Vehicles and How They Got That Way |publisher=PublicAffairs |year=2002 |isbn=978-1-58648-123-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/highmightysuvs00brad/page/41 41] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/highmightysuvs00brad/page/41 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also began to supplant the role of the station wagon and "transformed from truck to limousine in the eyes of countless suburban owners."&lt;ref name="Cumberford"&gt;{{cite journal| url= http://www.automobilemag.com/features/lists/0604_jeep_cherokee/ |first=Robert |last=Cumberford |title=20 greatest cars |journal=Automobile Magazine |quote=Great designs never grow old, a truth no better confirmed than by designer Dick Teague's masterpiece, the Jeep Cherokee. Possibly the best SUV shape of all time, it is the paradigmatic model to which other designers have since aspired. |date=April 2009 |accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The XJ is a "significant link in the evolution of the 4x4."&lt;ref name="Brubaker107"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QKrYGfVMUdMC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=vehicle+is+noteworthy+as+the+first+nonmilitary+4x4+with+unibody+construction |page=107 |title=Jeep Off-Road |first=Ken |last=Brubaker |first2=Tom |last2=Morr |publisher=Motorbooks |year=2007 |isbn=978-0760329948 |accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It would prove to be so popular that the second generation Cherokee's replacement was released as a separate vehicle altogether as the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]], itself starting a successive line of vehicles as Jeep's flagship vehicle.

[[File:2003 Jeep Cherokee (KJ MY03) Limited Edition wagon (2015-07-09) 01.jpg|thumb|right|2003 Jeep Cherokee Limited Edition wagon (Australia)]]
The third generation, marketed as the '''[[Jeep Liberty]]''' in [[North America]] to differentiate it from the Grand Cherokee, was introduced in April 2001 for the 2002 model year. It was sold as the Jeep Cherokee in markets outside of North America.

The Cherokee was priced between the [[Jeep Wrangler|Wrangler]] and Grand Cherokee. It remained the smallest of the 4-door Jeep SUVs up until the crossover-based 4-door [[Jeep Compass|Compass]] and [[Jeep Patriot|Patriot]] arrived for 2007. The Cherokee featured unibody-construction. It was assembled at the [[Toledo North Assembly Plant]] in the United States, as well as in other countries including Egypt and Venezuela.

It was the first Jeep vehicle to use [[rack and pinion]] steering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/jeep/liberty.html |title=Jeep Liberty Steering |publisher=Allpar.com |date=2005-05-15 |accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the first Jeep to use the two then-new ''[[Chrysler PowerTech engine|PowerTech]]'' engines; the {{convert|150|hp}} 2.4 [[Liter|L]] [[straight-4]], which was discontinued in 2006, and the {{convert|210|hp}} 3.7 L [[V6]]. However, the Cherokee was not the first Jeep vehicle to use an [[independent front suspension]], as the Wagoneer first used it in the 1963 model. But, that independent front suspension was limited to four wheel drive versions and, even then, was a short lived option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wagoneers.com/FSJ/rigs/63_ifs_rice/ALL.html |title=Bruce Rice's 1963 IFS Wagoneer 4x4 |publisher=wagoneers.com |date=2007-12-24 |accessdate=2010-12-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730040804/http://wagoneers.com/FSJ/rigs/63_ifs_rice/ALL.html |archivedate=2010-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fourth generation (KK)==
{{see also|Jeep Liberty (KK)}}
[[File:Jeep Cherokee Liberty 2.8 CRD 2012 (16733352286).jpg|thumb|right|Jeep Cherokee Liberty (US)]]
Still using the Jeep Liberty name in North America, the Cherokee was redesigned in 2008. For the first time, a [[Rebadging|rebadged]] version of a Jeep model existed, as [[Dodge]] sold this version of the Cherokee as the [[Dodge Nitro]] during the same time period as the fourth-generation Cherokee. It was eventually discontinued both due to slow sales as well as [[Sergio Marchionne]] wanting to avoid duplicated vehicles with Dodge and Jeep (as well as [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]]) sharing the same sales network.

With the smaller Patriot and Compass now available to cater to MPG-conscious buyers, the four-cylinder engine was dropped from the Cherokee's offerings. The iron-block, aluminium-head [[V6 engine|V6]] was the only engine available for 2008. Towing capacity was {{convert|5000|lb|0}}. Jeep discontinued the Cherokee's [[Common rail diesel|CRD]] for the American market because it couldn't meet tougher 2007 emissions standards for diesel engines. Transmission choices were both carry-overs: a six-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] or a four-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]. Standard equipment included electronic stability control with roll mitigation, [[traction control system|traction control]], and [[anti-lock brakes]] with brake assist. New Features included standard side airbags. Optional features are rain-sensing wipers, [[Sirius Satellite Radio]], [[Bluetooth]], a [[navigation system]], and the [[MyGig]] entertainment system, complete with a 30[[Gigabyte|GB]] [[hard drive]].

==Fifth generation (KL)==
{{see also|Jeep Cherokee (KL)}}
[[File:2016 Jeep Cherokee Limited Multjet II 2.2.jpg|thumb|right|Jeep Cherokee Limited Multijet (United Kingdom)]]
For the fifth generation, the Cherokee nameplate returned to North America as the vehicle was converted to a crossover and grew to midsize in order to make room for the [[Jeep Renegade (BU)|Jeep Renegade]] below the Cherokee and Compass. It was introduced for the 2014 [[model year]] at the 2013 [[New York International Auto Show]] and the sales started in November 2013.&lt;ref name="NY Daily news"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/chrysler-lets-2014-jeep-cherokee-details-fly-new-york-auto-show-debut-article-1.1273180|title=Chrysler lets 2014 Jeep Cherokee details fly ahead of New York auto show debut|accessdate=February 27, 2013|work=[[Daily News (New York)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeep.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeep.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeep.com/en/2014/cherokee/|title=The All-New 2014 Jeep Cherokee|accessdate=March 7, 2013|work=[[Jeep]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112184312/http://www.jeep.com/en/2014/cherokee/|archive-date=November 12, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cherokee is the first Jeep vehicle to be built on the [[Fiat Compact platform|Fiat Compact/Compact U.S. Wide platform]], co-developed by Chrysler and Fiat.&lt;ref name="Autoblog" /&gt; The Jeep Cherokee is built at [[Belvidere Assembly Plant]] in [[Belvidere, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt;

The Cherokee has a highway fuel economy rating of {{convert|31|mpgu.s.|L/100 km mpgimp}}&lt;ref name="Autoblog"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harley|first=Michael|title=2014 Jeep Cherokee flaunts its new contemporary curves|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2013/03/27/2014-jeep-cherokee-flaunts-its-new-contemporary-curves/|work=autoblog.com|publisher=[[Autoblog.com]]|accessdate=27 March 2013|date=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 45% better fuel economy rating than the Liberty/Cherokee it replaced.&lt;ref name="Jeep.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewdepaula/2013/02/26/2014-jeep-cherokee-polarizes-with-new-design/|title=Jeep Revives Cherokee For 2014 With Polarizing New Design|accessdate=February 27, 2013|work=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its controversial front-end styling,&lt;ref name="Jeep.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; the fifth-generation Cherokee would become such a sales success that FCA discontinued the slow-selling [[Dodge Dart (PF)|Dodge Dart]] and [[Chrysler 200]] (both mechanically similar to the Cherokee) in order to increase production capacity for the Cherokee to meet demand.  For 2019 the front end is to be updated to a more conservative style. In 2019, a new 2.0L turbo engine was added to the engine line up. It creates 270 HP and 295 LBS FT of torque. There is also an already existing 3.2L V-6, which is best for towing; and a 2.4L inline-4.

}}The '''Jeep Wrangler (JL)''' is the fourth generation of the [[Jeep Wrangler|Wrangler]] [[off-road vehicle]], available in two- and four-door bodies. Unveiled at the 2017 [[LA Auto Show|Los Angeles Auto Show]] on November 29, 2017, production of the vehicle began in November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jalopnik.com/2018-jeep-wrangler-this-is-finally-it-1820027177|title=2018 Jeep Wrangler: This Is Finally It|last=Tracy|first=David|date=2017-11-01|work=[[Jalopnik]]|access-date=2017-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

[[File:2018 Jeep Wrangler JL 3-door 2.2 Multijet II 200.jpg|thumb|2-door Wrangler]]
The 2-door '''Wrangler''' and 4-door '''Wrangler Unlimited''' feature an exterior design that is reminiscent of the 1997–2006 [[Jeep Wrangler (TJ)|Wrangler (TJ)]], with a "raked" front grille with seven vertical slots and round headlamps that integrate into the front grille.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/future-cars/news/a33071/2018-jeep-wrangler-leaked-can-you-see-the-differences/ This Is the 2018 Jeep Wrangler, Can You Spot the Changes?]. ''Road &amp; Track''.&lt;/ref&gt; The designers have moved the traditional [[Jeep]] logo off the grille.

The Wrangler has retained a [[body-on-frame]] construction and [[solid axle]]s. The vehicle is offered with three different [[four-wheel drive]] systems: Command-Trac, Selec-Trac and Rock-Trac. Options available on all JL models (except Rubicon) include an anti-spin rear [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]]. The JL is designed to be more comfortable on-road&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2017/12/15/review-new-jeep-wrangler-lets-you-tear-up-trails-comfort/950008001/ Review: New Jeep Wrangler lets you tear up trails in comfort]. ''USA Today''&lt;/ref&gt; and has recirculating ball steering with [[Power steering#Electric systems|electric power assistance]].

The Wrangler is 2.5 inches longer overall than before, while the Wrangler Unlimited has grown by 3.5 inches.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[https://www.caranddriver.com/news/2018-jeep-wrangler-jl-finally-unveiled-all-the-details-all-the-photos-news 2018 Jeep Wrangler: An All-New Version of an Icon!]. ''Car and Driver''.&lt;/ref&gt; The new Wrangler is roughly 90 kilograms (200 pounds) lighter than the Wrangler JK. [[Overhang (car)|Overhangs]] increase significantly with the new model having 29.2 and 40.8 inches front and rear.

==Trim levels==
The JL is available in '''Sport''', '''Sport S''', '''Sport Altitude''', '''Sahara''', '''Sahara Altitude''', '''Rubicon''', and '''Moab''' [[Automotive trim nomenclature|trim level]]s. The Sport Altitude, Sahara, Sahara Altitude, and Moab trims only come in four-door configurations.

===Sport/Sport S===
[[File:2018 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sport 4-door rear 6.10.18.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view]]
The Sport is the entry level trim with push-button start, manual windows, cloth seats and seventeen-inch steel wheels. Single-zone manual air conditioning remains optional on two-door models and is standard on four-door models. The JL has a 41.4-degree [[approach angle]] on its base model.&lt;ref&gt;[https://newatlas.com/2018-jeep-wrangler-la/52405/ All-new 2018 Jeep Wrangler specs released at LA Auto Show]. ''New Atlas''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Sport S adds more features to the Sport, such as power door locks, power windows, keyless entry, air conditioning and seventeen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels. The optional Cold Weather Group is a [[Automotive package|package]] that includes heated front seats, steering wheel and remote engine start. 

The Sport and Sport S come with all new Dana axles AdvenTEK m186 in front and AdvenTEK m200 axles in the rear.&lt;ref&gt;[https://teraflex.com/news_items/all-new-2018-jlu-jeep-wrangler-unlimited-rubicon-arrives-at-teraflex All-New 2018 JLU Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon]. ''Teraflex''.&lt;/ref&gt; With the anti-spin rear differential, it comes with a Dana 44 M220 instead of the Dana m200

===Sahara===
Jeep considers the Sahara trim version as its luxury level as it offers upgraded interior configurations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.topspeed.com/cars/car-news/you-can-now-pre-order-the-2018-jeep-wrangler-jl-here-s-all-the-details-ar178065.html Order guide spills details about engine, trim, color, and options]. ''TopSpeed.''&lt;/ref&gt; The four-door-only Sahara adds more luxury features to the JL, such as eighteen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels with gray-painted accents, color-keyed fender flares, optional [[LED]] front headlamps with [[daytime running lamp]]s (DRL's), and premium cloth seating surfaces. Touch sensors located on all door handles for Sahara equipped with Remote Proximity Keyless Entry option. 

Additional options include leather-trimmed seating surfaces, a stitched vinyl dashboard, and Keyless Enter-'n'-Go. The Sahara, when equipped with leather-trimmed seats, features a stitched vinyl dashboard panel reminiscent to that of the Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK2).

The Sahara comes equipped with the same axles as the Sport/S. The Sahara has an optional Selec-Trac two-speed transfer case with full-time four-wheel-drive available. When ordered with selec-trac the M186 has cv joints instead of U-Joints. &lt;ref&gt;[http://autoweek.com/article/los-angeles-auto-show/2018-jeep-wrangler-jl-official-specifications-and-details-reavealed 2018 Jeep Wrangler JL revealed: Get all the details about America’s new favorite off-roader]. ''Autoweek''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rubicon===
[[File:Jeep Wrangler Rubicon Genf 2018.jpg|thumb|Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon]]
[[File:GIMS 2019, Le Grand-Saconnex (GIMS0535).jpg|thumb|Wrangler Rubicon 1941 Edition by [[Mopar]]]]
The Rubicon trim level features the most capable off-road equipment. The JL has a 44-degree approach angle on its two-door Rubicon edition. Ground clearance measures 10.8 inches(274mm) for the Rubicon. Water fording depth measures 30 inches(762mm). 

Rubicon models get the [[Jeep four-wheel-drive systems|Rock-Trac]] system with an enhanced NV241 OR [[transfer case]] as standard,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; as well as a front sway-bar disconnect system and hydraulic rebound stop. The Rubicon will also feature an electronic [[locking differential]], which allows the driver to lock either the rear differential only or both the front and rear differentials via a toggle switch located in the center of the instrument panel. It has a [[Dana 44]] M210 axle in the front, and for the rear there is a Dana 44 M220 axle (4.10 axle ratio).&lt;ref&gt;[https://jlwrangler.com/showthread.php?369-JL-Wrangler-AXLES-Dana-M186-amp-M210-Front-M200-amp-M220-Rear Rubicon – Dana M210 Front / Dana M220 Rear] www.jlwrangler.com&lt;/ref&gt; The Tru-Lok electric [[Locking differential|lockers]] can be engaged on the fly at up to 30 mph in 4WD low-range.

The Rubicon adds off-road features to the Sport S, such as 33-inch BF Goodrich KO2 off-road tires, seventeen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels with gray-painted accents, electronic-locking front and rear axles, Rock rails, high clearance fenders and premium cloth seating surfaces. Touch sensors located on the front door handles, and tailgate handle for Rubicons optionally equipped with the Remote Proximity Keyless Entry option.

Additional options include LED front headlamps with daytime running lamps (DRL's), polished aluminum-alloy wheels with black-painted pockets, Keyless Enter-'n'-Go, a steel bumper group, leather-trimmed seating surfaces, and color-keyed fender flares. The Rubicon offers a color-keyed dashboard panel.

===MOAB===

In mid-2018, Jeep announced the first "Special Edition" model of the all-new Jeep Wrangler JL. Named the Moab, it is the top trim-level offered on a Wrangler, is based on the Unlimited Sahara, and bridges the gap between the Unlimited Sahara and Unlimited Rubicon trim levels. Named for the off-road trails of [[Moab, Utah]], the Moab adds Rubicon-inspired styling cues and luxury amenities to the Unlimited Sahara, while also featuring some options that are not available on the Rubicon, such as Jeep Premium Parts rock rails, the Selec-Trac® full-time two-speed transfer case and limited-slip differentials, which are more suited to all-wheel-drive use on paved roads, and 17x7.5 inch low-gloss black aluminum-alloy wheels with 32" BFGoodrich KM2 Mud Terrain tires. The headlight surrounds, grille throats and tow hooks are also painted low-gloss black, and other unique features include 'MOAB' front fender decals and black 'Jeep' and 'WRANGLER' emblems.

The Moab is the only model that shares the Rubicon vented hood and performance suspension components. Other standard equipment on the Moab Edition that is also available as options on the Rubicon include the steel front bumper with removable end caps, LED front head and fog lamps, luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces, the U Connect 4C 8.4 infotainment system with [[Garmin]]-based GPS navigation, a nine-speaker [[Alpine Electronics|Alpine]] premium amplified audio system with rear-mounted subwoofer, a passive keyless access system, color matched three-piece removable hardtop roof with removable headliner, Blind-spot Monitoring and Rear Cross Path detection, ParkSense park assist with reverse stop and ParkView rear backup camera with dynamic grid lines, and the thick rubber all-weather floor mats. Available options for the Moab Edition include the premium Sunrider soft top in addition to the Freedom hard top, the cold weather package (heated front seats / steering wheel and remote start), and the trailer towing package, (receiver hitch and electrical connectors, 240amp alternator, and 4 pre-wired auxiliary power switches in the cab)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jlwranglerforums.com/forum/threads/2018-jeep-wrangler-jl-moab-edition-official-specs-and-pricing.13314/&lt;/ref&gt;. The Moab is only available with the base 3.6L [[Pentastar]] VVT V6 gasoline engine with Electronic Stop Start (ESS) and the 8-speed automatic transmission. The Rubicon Rock-Trac transfer case, 4.10:1 final drive gears, remote-locking front and rear differentials, and electronic disconnecting anti-sway bar are not available on the Moab Edition&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wowwoodys.com/research/2019-jeep-wrangler-trims/&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Moab went on sale at Jeep dealerships in the U.S. in October 2018, beginning as a mid-year 2018 model year vehicle, though the Moab will continue for 2019. The 2019 Moab starts at $51,300 [[MSRP]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jeep.com/bmo.wrangler.2019.html#/models/2019/wrangler&lt;/ref&gt;, without additional options, making it the most expensive Jeep Wrangler JL trim level. &lt;ref&gt;https://jalopnik.com/the-2018-jeep-wrangler-moab-is-the-first-jl-special-edi-1828680647&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sport Altitude and Sahara Altitude===

In mid-2019, Jeep announced two new "Special Edition" models of the Jeep Wrangler JL Unlimited, the Sport Altitude and Sahara Altitude. Both trims are only available as four-door Wrangler Unlimited models. Joining the Altitude lineup that is available on all other Jeep models, the Altitude models add the following features to their respective Sport S and Sahara trim levels:

* Gloss Black Grille Throats

* Gloss Black Headlamp Inserts

* Low-Gloss Black Fender Badges

* "Wizard Black" Instrument Panel and Dashboard Trim

* Eighteen-Inch Gloss Black Aluminum-Alloy Wheels

* Black Cloth Seating Surface (Sport Altitude Only)

* Black Leather-Trimmed Seating Surfaces (Sahara Altitude Only)

* Black or Body-Colored 3-Piece Freedom Top Hard Top Roof 

* Jeep Performance Parts Interior Hard Top Headliner

All available options and packages on the Sport S and Sahara trims are also available on their respective Altitude trims. Both trims are available in six exterior colors: Bright White Clear Coat, Granite Crystal Metallic Clear Coat, Flame Red Clear Coat, Black Clear Coat, Billet Silver Metallic, and Sting Gray Clear Coat. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.jeep.com/limited-editions/2019/wrangler/altitude.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powertrain==
The 3.6L [[Pentastar]] VVT V6 gasoline engine still remains available from the existing Wrangler and Wrangler Unlimited, and is standard on all models, though has been redesigned for improved fuel economy. The engine features an [[Aisin Seiki|Aisin]] AL6 six-speed manual transmission as standard equipment, with an 850RE [[Torqueflite]] eight-speed [[automatic transmission]] being optional. The automatic transmission made its debut in the 2018 [[Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK2)|Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK2]]), replacing the older Torqueflite 845RE unit. The eight-speed automatic unit will feature a traditional shifter. The engine performance is unchanged from the previous model at {{convert|285|Hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|260|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. This is only offered on Wrangler models sold in [[North America, Australia and New Zealand]]. 

A 2.0L [[turbocharged]] four-cylinder ([[Inline-4]]) [[Chrysler Hurricane engine]] is available on all models. Paired exclusively with the 850RE Torqueflite eight-speed automatic transmission, the new engine features a [[mild hybrid]] system branded as eTorque for improved fuel economy and off-road performance, and produces {{convert|270|Hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|295|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} combined. This is the only gasoline engine offered in Europe. In North America, this engine had late availability, and the Wrangler was launched with the existing 3.6L Pentastar V6 gasoline engine.&lt;ref&gt;https://askformitch.com/2020-jeep-wrangler-towing-capacity/9281#turbo&lt;/ref&gt;

For the North American market Jeep has announced that a 3.0L [[EcoDiesel]] V6 turbodiesel engine, built by [[VM Motori]] and available in 2020 (same engine already available in the Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK2) and the [[Ram 1500]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.slashgear.com/all-new-2018-jeep-wrangler-is-official-and-aims-to-be-most-capable-suv-ever-30510034/ All-New 2018 Jeep Wrangler is official and aims to be most capable SUV ever]. ''SlashGear.''&lt;/ref&gt;) It will produce approximately {{convert|260|Hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|442|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. &lt;ref&gt;https://askformitch.com/2020-jeep-wrangler-towing-capacity/9281#eco&lt;/ref&gt;

For the rest of the world (except North America) a 2.2L 16V Multijet II turbo four-cylinder diesel engine producing {{convert|200|Hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|450|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} with Start&amp;Stop is available. {{CN|date=June 2019}}

Jeep has also announced that a [[plug-in hybrid]] electric vehicle will be released in 2020. {{CN|date=June 2019}}

==Roof options==
[[File:Rubicon_color-keyed_hard_metal_roof.jpg|thumb|left|Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon with color-keyed fiberglass roof]]
All roof systems are new for 2018. The interior roll bar has been redesigned to accommodate the new roof systems. The JL will offer three roof options called Freedom Top hardtop, Sunrider soft top and Sky One-Touch Power Top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jalopnik.com/the-new-jeep-wranglers-roof-may-do-three-things-its-nev-1777624947|title=The New Jeep Wrangler's Roof May Do Three Things It's Never Done|first=Andrew P.|last=Collins|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Freedom Top hardtop is a color-keyed, hard fiberglass roof. Like its predecessor, the Freedom Top hardtop is a three-piece system, with two removable roof panels in the front of the vehicle (known as the freedom panels), allowing the driver to remove the panels without having to remove the entire roof. The roof has been redesigned to allow the driver to easily lift and remove the roof, as it is now made of lighter designed fiberglass. The hardtop option remains available in black or body color.

The Sunrider soft top is a soft canvas roof, and is the standard roof option on all models except the Moab, which comes with both the premium black Sunrider and body color Freedom tops. This roof has been fully redesigned, and is now easier to remove. The rear and side windows easily lift out, and the previous [[Velcro]] and [[zipper]] enclosures have been deleted. Once the rear and side windows have been removed (they can be stowed inside of the vehicle behind the rear seats), the driver is able to unlatch the roof latches, and drop the roof back, where it will stow behind the rear seats (a similar system to that of many soft top roadsters, such as the [[Mazda MX-5 Miata]]). There is a lever that allows the driver to lock the roof in place in the "down" position so the roof will not flap when the vehicle is in motion. In addition, the Sunrider soft top is now available in either black or tan, whereas it was only available in black on the [[Jeep Wrangler (JK)|Wrangler (JK)]].

The Sky One-Touch Power Top is a soft canvas panel that is power-retractable, and is the first of its kind on any Wrangler. The driver simply presses a switch located inside of the vehicle, and the roof folds back. The system is similar to that of the 2008–2012 [[Jeep Liberty (KK)]]. The roof can be operated at up to 60 [[Miles per hour|MPH]], or 96.5 [[kmh]].

==Removable parts==
[[File:Geneva International Motor Show 2018, Le Grand-Saconnex (1X7A1811).jpg|thumb|Wrangler Unlimited with doors removed]]
The front windshield can now easily be folded down, or completely removed, and is made of [[aluminum]], as are some of the body panels (some body panels are still made of [[steel]]), as well as the hard roof, to make it easier to remove. The doors are also made of aluminum, making them lighter than previous models. There is also a grab handle inside the doors thus the JL doors are much easier to carry. 

A labeled and fitted storage area for roof, doors, and windshield screws is located in the rear cargo area, and a tool kit that stores in a fitted area in the upper portion of the center console, is provided with a manual that depicts how to remove each exterior component from the vehicle, as well as the specific tool from the kit that is required to do so.

==In-vehicle infotainment ==
There are three updated [[In-car entertainment|infotainment systems]] (Uconnect 3 5.0BT, Uconnect 4 7.0, and Uconnect 4C 8.4N). The different Uconnect infotainment systems supply 5-inch, 7-inch, or 8.4-inch [[pinch-to-zoom]] displays.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.topspeed.com/cars/car-news/the-2018-jeep-wrangler-s-three-infotainment-systems-ar178732.html The 2018 Jeep Wrangler’s Three Infotainment Systems]. ''TopSpeed''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The base Sport and upgraded Sport S both feature the standard Uconnect 3 5.0BT system, while the uplevel Sahara and Rubicon both feature the Uconnect 4 7.0 system with [[Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]], which is also optional on the upgraded Sport S, when equipped with the Electronic Infotainment Group. The Uconnect 4C 8.4N system is only available on the uplevel Sahara and Rubicon models, when equipped with the Electronic Infotainment II Group. [[SiriusXM]] [[Satellite Radio]] is standard on all models aside from the base Sport, where it is available as a standalone option. 

An eight-speaker audio system, with dashboard and rear "sound bar" mounted speakers is standard on all models, whereas an optional nine-speaker [[Alpine Electronics|Alpine]] premium amplified audio system that adds an all-weather [[subwoofer]], is a standalone option on all models, also included with the Electronic Infotainment Group and Infotainment II Group on Sport S, Sahara, and Rubicon models.

All three infotainment systems include a fully integrated and federally mandated rear-view backup camera as standard equipment. The camera is mounted to the spare tire, and can be removed if the tire is removed.

Rear passengers now get a 115 V AC household-style power outlet, as well as rear [[USB]] charging ports on Wrangler Unlimited models.

==Interior==
The interior design was inspired by the 1954–1983 [[Jeep CJ-5]] and 1987–1995 [[Jeep Wrangler (YJ)|Wrangler (YJ)]] models. The majority of the interior [[switchgear]] in the JL is unique to the JL, except for some parts which are shared with other [[Chrysler]] products.

The power window controls remain in the center of the instrument panel, and the front woofers remain in the lower corners of the instrument panel. There is a new three-spoke, [[Retro style|retro]]-inspired steering wheel, and a color instrument cluster display screen is available on upper-level trims. 

Standard cloth seating surfaces are standard on Sport and Sport "S", while upgraded Premium Cloth seating surfaces are standard on Sahara and Rubicon models (the upgraded seats include either 'SAHARA' or 'RUBICON' embroidery on the front seat backrests, depending on model). Luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces are standard on the MOAB trim level, and optional only on Sahara and Rubicon models (the front seat backrests are also embroidered with either the 'SAHARA', 'MOAB', or 'RUBICON' logos, depending on model). Interior colors are either Black or Heritage Tan for cloth-equipped models, or Black or Saddle on leather-equipped models. All models can be equipped with heated front seats and a heated leather-wrapped steering wheel. Rubicon models equipped with the Black interior include exclusive red stitching on the seats and steering wheel, while Moab models feature contrasting gray stitching. Black Katzkin leather-trimmed seating surfaces are available as a [[Mopar]] dealer-installed accessory option for all trim levels, in either standard or perforated trim.

Cloth-equipped models include a real metal dashboard surface (Silver-painted on Sport, Sport "S", and Sahara models, and Red-painted on some Rubicon models, dependent on exterior colour choice). Leather-equipped Sahara and MOAB include an interior color-keyed stitched vinyl dashboard.

==Safety==
Safety improvements include standard side-impact airbags and strengthened [[B-pillar]]s. Driver assist safety features are located in the Active Safety group.

The JL has a lowered [[Beltline (automotive)|beltline]] with larger windows for better outward visibility. The rear spare tire has been moved down to increase rear visibility. [[LED]] front headlamps and rear tail lamps are available, as are [[daytime running lamp]]s (DRL's) on the front fenders. A [[blind spot monitor]] is built directly into the taillight housing.

In the Euro NCAP (New Car Assessment Programme) frontal crash test, the [[Pillar (car)|A-pillar]] structure showed signs it might not withstand heavier collisions. Deformation in the footwell area indicated "that the structure had reached the limit of its integrity."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.euroncap.com/en/results/jeep/wrangler/34192 Official Jeep Wrangler safety rating], Euro NCAP&lt;/ref&gt; The Wrangler received a top score in the Euro NCAP side barrier test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a25411607/2019-jeep-wrangler-euro-ncap-crash-test|title=2019 Jeep Wrangler Fares Poorly in Euro NCAP Crash Test|last=Lorio|first=Joe|date=2018-12-05|website=Car and Driver|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==

Production of the Wrangler Unlimited began in November 2017, while two-door Wrangler production will commence in early 2018. As with its predecessors, the JL is produced at Jeep's [[Toledo Complex]] in [[Toledo, Ohio]], and also was produced alongside its predecessor, the [[Jeep Wrangler (JK)|Wrangler JK]], which remained in production until April 27, 2018. The simultaneous sales was to ensure that dealerships could meet demand. The 2018 Wrangler JK was virtually unchanged from the 2017 model, and a WRANGLER JK decal on the front fenders distinguished the outgoing model from its successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jeep.com/wrangler-jk.html|title=2018 Jeep Wrangler JK &amp; Wrangler Unlimited JK – SUVs|website=www.jeep.com|publisher=Jeep|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant which produced the JK will temporarily close as it receives a retooling for the upcoming Wrangler-based [[Jeep Gladiator (JT)|Jeep Gladiator]].{{CN|date=June 2019}}

FCA announces that the Toledo Machining Plant will assemble the power electronics module and components for the Jeep Wrangler Plug-in Hybrid which will be launching in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todaysmotorvehicles.com/article/fca-jeep-wrangler-phev-toldeo-machining-081718/|title=FCA taps Toledo Machining for plug-in hybrid Jeep Wrangler components – Today's Motor Vehicles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==

Before the JL's actual debut at the 2017 Los Angeles Auto Show, the song [[Believer (Imagine Dragons song)|Believer]] by [[Imagine Dragons]] was used in the opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=FCA North America|title=2018 Jeep® Wrangler Reveal (Full Program) {{!}} 2017 LA Auto Show|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGPZ8JlJmlY|access-date=2018-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the teaser, it uses 7 letters that are narrowed to represent the 7 vertical slots and 2 circles on the left and right to depict the front fascia.

A debut television advertisement for the 2018 Wrangler JL, entitled "Jeep Jurassic", first aired during [[Super Bowl LII]]. The ad is a [[Pastiche|reenactment]] of the classic [[Tyrannosaurus rex]] chase scene from the 1993 movie [[Jurassic Park]]. However, instead of a 1992 [[Jeep Wrangler (YJ)|Wrangler (YJ)]] Sahara Edition, [[Jeff Goldblum]], who played Ian Malcom in the movie, drives a silver two-door 2018 Wrangler JL Rubicon with red accents. The commercial ends with Goldblum seated in the driver's seat of the aforementioned Jeep in a showroom, where a Jeep saleswoman asks if he would like to take the JL for a test drive, to which Goldblum replies that he has.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMOljrWUUXc|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pickup truck==
{{main|Jeep Gladiator (JT)}}
The all-new 2020 Jeep Gladiator was introduced at the 2018 Los Angeles Auto Show on November 28, 2018. Based on the Wrangler JL, the Gladiator features exterior and interior styling cues similar to the Wrangler Unlimited, seating for five passengers, and a five-foot pickup bed.{{CN|date=June 2019}}

The '''Jeep Wrangler (JK)''' is the third generation of the [[Jeep Wrangler]] [[off-road vehicle]]. The Wrangler was unveiled at the [[North American International Auto Show#2006|2006 North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]], the JK series 2007 Wrangler Unlimited at the [[New York Auto Show#2006|2006 New York Auto Show]].

The car's [[Automobile body|body]] and [[chassis]] were completely redesigned during the era when Jeep was part of [[Daimler AG#Merger with Chrysler|DaimlerChrysler]]. Just like the [[Willys MB]], the [[Jeep CJ|CJ Jeeps]] and the Wranglers before it, the JK continues to have a separate body and frame, rigid [[solid axle|live axles]] both front and rear, a fold-flat windshield, and can be driven without doors. Also, with the exception of optional 4x2 models, the Wrangler JK continues to have part-time [[Jeep four-wheel-drive systems|four-wheel drive systems]], with the choice of high and low gearing.

In addition to the traditional 2-door Jeep, the JK introduced for the first time a factory standard four-door model, called the Wrangler Unlimited. Contrary to the first, [[Jeep Wrangler (TJ)#Wrangler Unlimited|TJ-based Unlimited]], and the CJ-8 "Scrambler", its wheelbase is stretched by 20 instead of 10 inches. The Wrangler Unlimited became a big sales success — by mid 2017 three quarters of all new Wranglers listed for sale were four-door models.&lt;ref name=2DrFail/&gt;

== Development ==
In 2001, [[DaimlerChrysler]] commissioned development of a [[Jeep Wrangler (TJ)|TJ]] successor under the "JK" program code for the third generation Jeep Wrangler. Design work began almost immediately in 2001, with Mark Moushegian winning an internal design competition against Dan Zimmerman (later responsible for 2005 [[Jeep Hurricane]] Concept) by the second quarter of 2003. In January 2004, the JK design was frozen at 31 months ahead of production and work began on a conceptual preview.
[[File:Picturegladiator 203 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The 2005 Jeep Gladiator concept.]]
On November 16, 2004, Jeep released 2 CAD renderings of a Jeep pickup. On December 5, 2004, the [[Jeep Gladiator#2005 Jeep Gladiator|2005 Jeep Gladiator]] Concept was unveiled ahead of its January 2005 Detroit Auto Show debut, previewing many of the design elements on the incoming JK. The Wrangler JK was introduced at the [[North American International Auto Show#2006|2006 North American International Auto Show]] with past Chrysler group CEO [[Tom LaSorda]] driving one up some steps and through a plate glass window, just as [[Bob Lutz (businessman)|Robert Lutz]] had done at the show in January 1992 with the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee|Grand Cherokee]].
{{clearleft}}

==Initial release==
The JK was first available for purchase with the 2007 model year, beginning in August 2006. The 2007 model year brought a complete redesign of the Jeep Wrangler, and also a four-door model. The TJ chassis was replaced by an all new JK platform.

The JK Wrangler has been offered from the start in two models:
* A short-wheelbase 2-door, in X, Sahara and Rubicon trim levels.
* A long-wheelbase ''Unlimited'' 4-door, also in X, Sahara and Rubicon trim levels.

This next-generation Wrangler was noticeably wider than the previous model, with a {{convert|3.4|in|mm|adj=on}} wider track; and though the two-door model has a {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=on}} longer wheelbase, it is actually {{convert|2.5|in|mm}} shorter in overall length than the TJ, allowing for a 44.3° [[approach angle]] and a 40.4° departure angle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeep.com/shared/2012/wrangler/capability/capabilitytour/secondary/10_j_w2d_cap_cap_angles_sec.jpg 2007–2012 wrangler approach and departure angles] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004214136/http://www.jeep.com/shared/2012/wrangler/capability/capabilitytour/secondary/10_j_w2d_cap_cap_angles_sec.jpg |date=2013-10-04 }}. jeep.com. Retrieved 2011-02-28.&lt;/ref&gt; With a larger factory available tire size of 32&amp;nbsp;inches, the breakover angle on the Rubicon is increased from 22.6° to 25.4°.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeepforum.com/forum/f176/tj-vs-jk-1080441/index10.html Jeep TJ vs JK ]. jeepforum.com. Retrieved 2011-02-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The four-door ''Unlimited'' model has an over {{convert|20|in|mm|adj=on}} longer wheelbase at 116 in (2,950&amp;nbsp;mm)&lt;!-- the convert function wrongly calculates 116 in as 2,900mm ?! --&gt; to offer much improved rear seating room, but is nevertheless only {{convert|2.4|in|mm|adj=on}} longer than the 2006 TJ Unlimited.

The JK runs almost all vehicle functions, other than steering, under computer software control. Engine, transmission, and to some extent braking are computer controlled, as are lights and auxiliary systems. This is a first for the Wrangler. As of mid-2007, there have been three safety recalls for software fixes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://project-jk.com/jeep-jk/jeep-jk-tsb-recalls/recalls/ |title=Jeep JK Wrangler Resource " Recalls |publisher=Project-JK.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stability control]] was a new safety feature for the JK Wrangler. All versions offer off-road tuned [[Anti-lock braking system]] and [[traction control system]] with electronic [[limited slip differential#Electronic|limited slip differential]]. Standard on the Rubicon trim is a new electronic sway bar disconnect system.

A ''Sunrider'' convertible soft top is standard equipment. Also available on the JK model is an optional 3-piece modular hardtop. Although the doors can still be removed in traditional Wrangler fashion, power windows and remote power door locks was offered for the first time in a Wrangler. Another first is an available [[navigation system]]. This is the first generation of the Jeep Wrangler to have a change in the tail lamps.

New features included power windows, remote power door locks, navigation, as well as electronically detachable sway-bars on some models.

The Wrangler X is available with factory installed [[right-hand drive]], targeted at U.S. Mail carriers.  Rural mail boxes in the United States are serviced with the carrier behind the wheel.  This may also be useful for carriers who wish to get out of their vehicle without the risk of getting hit by traffic. For the 2007 and 2008 model years, the right-hand drive Jeep was the short-wheelbase Wrangler. For the 2009 model year, the right-hand drive Wrangler will be replaced by the right-hand drive Wrangler Unlimited.

The JK series 2007 Wrangler Unlimited was unveiled at the [[New York Auto Show]] on April 12, 2006. It is stretched even more than the TJ model, and featured four doors. This change made it the last-remaining 2-door SUV in [[North America]] to gain a four-door option and made it the only four door convertible in production. A full 20.6&amp;nbsp;inches (523&amp;nbsp;mm) was added to the JK Wrangler's 95.4-inch (2423&amp;nbsp;mm) wheelbase. It hit production line in August 2006 and was priced near $21,000.

The Unlimited has the same engine and transmission choices as a short-wheelbase JK. X and Sahara trims offer an option of 4x2 rear-wheel drive in the USA. Optional 4x2 was discontinued after the 2010 model year for the Unlimited. 4-wheel drive became standard for the 2011 model year. It is the only four-door convertible available in the US, since the Hummer H1 with optional rag-top is no longer sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Firan |first1=Zia |title=Programmer Tuners for Jeep JK |url=https://jeepequipment.com/tuners-and-programmers-for-jeep-jk/ |accessdate=8 December 2019 |work=JeepEquipment |date=31 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Unlimited offers more options and equipment than any previous Wrangler model, including standard [[electronic stability program]] and optional seat-mounted side airbags, remote keyless entry, [[navigation system]], and [[Sirius Satellite Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=109966 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060413164405/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId%3D109966 |archivedate=2006-04-13 |title=Jeep Unveils Stretched 2007 Wrangler Unlimited with $21,000 Price Tag |work=Edmunds.com |accessdate=2006-04-12 |url-status=dead|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The navigation and satellite systems are a part of the MyGig Entertainment system that also has a hard drive allowing for the storage of MP3 music files and pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chrysler.com/en/owners/mygig/|title=My Chrysler: MyGig- How MyGig Works|work=Chrysler LLC |accessdate=2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Standard Wranglers are available in six trim packages (including 2 special editions).
The Unlimited Wranglers are available in four trim packages (including 1 special edition).
Most packages can be ordered with either hard or soft top, full or half doors ("Sport" and "Rubicon" only).

The '''Sport''' base model is available in 2-door versions. It is the "bare bones" Wrangler that can be customized to a buyer's specifications by adding such options as air conditioning and other accessories. It was originally called the "Wrangler X" until 2009. Later, stain-resistant YES Essentials cloth seats replaced standard vinyl seats, an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD/MP3 player and auxiliary audio input jack, and full-sized spare tire and wheel came standard on this model.

The X-S model features 32-inch tires (on 17-inch wheels), air conditioning, fog lights, cruise control, driver’s seat height adjuster, removable doors, and a fold-down windshield. It can be customized to a buyers specifications adding such options as power windows and locks, soft or hard top, rear LSD or locker (2007 only), and other accessories.  It was renamed "Sport S" in 2009. Advantages over the Sport included standard air conditioning, alloy wheels, matching spare tire and wheel, YES essentials stain-resistant cloth seats, optional [[Chrysler Uconnect|Uconnect]] touch-screen radios, optional seven-speaker premium sound system with subwoofer, and optional power equipment, such as power door locks and power windows, a first on any Wrangler model.

The '''Sahara''' model is the "luxury" model offering accessories such as body colored fenders, "Yes Essentials" seats (in late 2007–2008), power windows and locks and a 7 speaker infinity sound system with subwoofer, later, an AM/FM stereo with single CD-player with MP3 capability, SiriusXM, an aux input, Bluetooth, and USB port, among others. It also offered exterior-color fender flares and a gold 'SAHARA' decal on both front fenders.

[[File:Jeep Rubicon Green.JPG|thumb|left|Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon Hardtop (JK, USA)]]
The '''Rubicon''' is the "off-road ready" model, offering 32in BF Goodrich Mud-Terrain KM off-road tires with aggressive tread, seventeen-inch alloy wheels, and more. 'RUBICON' decals adorned both sides of the hood.

The Rubicon package is the dedicated "Offroad" package. Standard components of the Rubicon package include front and rear next generation  [[Dana 44]] axles with electric lockers, [[Rock-Trac]] four-wheel drive with 4:1 transfer case, rock rails, 32-spline rear axle with an 8.8-inch ring gear, 4.10 axle gearing, electric releasing sway bar, "Yes Essentials" seats (2007–08), 7-speaker infinity sound system, and any other available option can be added.

==Powertrain==
[[File:Jeep Wrangler 2.8 CRD Sport 2010 (15584155440).jpg|thumb|The 2.8 l diesel engine in this 2010 Wrangler Sport from Chile was never available in the U.S.]]
A 3.8&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.8|EGH]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] with a displacement of 230.5 cubic inches (3,778&amp;nbsp;cc)&lt;ref name="3.8L"/&gt; producing {{convert|202|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|237|lb·ft|N·m|abbr=on}} of torque was the base engine in 2007 -2011 models.  It replaced the [[AMC Straight-6 engine|AMC 242 straight-6]], and was shared with the first-generation [[Chrysler Pacifica]] [[crossover (automobile)|crossover]] (CUV), and [[Chrysler Town and Country]], [[Dodge Grand Caravan]], and [[Volkswagen Routan]] [[minivans]]. Transmission choices included a standard six-speed [[Chrysler NSG370 transmission]] (manual transmission), or an optional [[Chrysler]] [[Ultradrive]] '''42RLE''' 4-speed automatic transmission.

For the 2012 [[model year]], the Wrangler received an updated 3.6L [[Pentastar]] VVT V6 engine from the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK2)]], now producing 285 horsepower, and 260 lb. ft. of torque. The [[Chrysler NSG370 transmission]] (manual transmission) remained standard equipment, although an all-new 5-speed [[Chrysler RFE transmission]] '''545RFE''' automatic transmission replaced the [[Chrysler]] [[Ultradrive]] '''42RLE''' 4-speed automatic transmission.

The 2.8&amp;nbsp;L [[VM Motori]] [[turbodiesel]] [[straight-4]] producing {{convert|177|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|302|lb·ft|N·m|abbr=on}} of torque used in the [[Jeep Liberty|Liberty]] is offered as options outside of U.S., as it does not satisfy U.S. emission control standards for 2007.

A six-speed [[manual transmission]] is standard, with a four-speed [[automatic transmission]] offered as an option. The lower two levels have the Jeep [[Command-Trac]] part-time four-wheel drive system with an optional ''Trac-Loc'' [[limited-slip differential]], while the ''Rubicon'' uses [[Rock-Trac]] a version of the NV241 with a 4:1 low range. Electronic locking front- and rear-axles called ''Tru-lok'' are also standard on Rubicon models. (A rear [[locking differential]] was optional on X and Sahara models for 2007, then only on select X models for 2008 and 2009.  From 2010 onward, the only non-Rubicon Wrangler to have the ''Tru-lok'' locking differential as an option are the 2015 Wrangler X, based on the Sahara, and the 2016 75th Anniversary Edition Wranglers.)

===2015 model year update===
Changes for 2015 include the new paint colors (including, new for 2015, Tank (dark olive green), Sunset Orange, Copper Brown, Baja Yellow, and Firecracker Red.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autobytel.com/jeep/wrangler/2015/color/ 2015 jeep colors] and [http://www.autobytel.com/jeep/wrangler/2015/ new features for 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; and trim packages (Sport, [[Willys]] Wheeler, Sahara, Rubicon, and Rubicon Hard Rock levels.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autobytel.com/jeep/wrangler/2015/ |title=new features for 2015 |publisher=Autobytel.com |date=2014-10-10 |accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes include a package that bundles steel wheels with 31-inch tires for Sport models, and a Torx tool set that's standard on all models, allowing owners to remove the doors or lower the windshield wherever they are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/jeep_wrangler_2015 |title=2015 Jeep Wrangler Review |date=7 September 2014|publisher=The Car Connection}}&lt;/ref&gt; On base Wrangler and Wrangler Unlimited models, sixteen-inch gloss black-painted styled steel wheels were available to replace the standard Sparkle Silver-painted styled steel wheels. 

The 2015 Wrangler received a new nine-speaker, 552-watt Alpine premium audio system (replacing the previously-standard seven-speaker, 368-watt Infinity premium amplified audio system with [[subwoofer]]) with amplifier and rear cargo floor-mounted all-weather [[subwoofer]] that was optional on all trim levels. All trim levels included a newly-standard eight-speaker audio system (replacing the previously-standard six-speaker audio system). The eight-speaker system replaced the instrument panel-mounted [[tweeter]] speakers with 3.5-inch mid-range speakers, and also added a pair of 3.5-inch mid-range speakers to the rear sound bar. 

The Jeep Wrangler was released in India on 30 August 2016. Alongside the Grand Cherokee, the Wrangler was the first model to be sold directly by Jeep in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Will Jeep storm India despite ‘exorbitant’ price tag?

=== 2018 model year update ===
For 2018, the [[Jeep Wrangler]] and Wrangler Unlimited JK were sold alongside the all-new 2018 [[Jeep Wrangler (JL)]] and Wrangler Unlimited JL in order to meet demand for the Wrangler until the all-new JL model went on sale in early 2018. The two models would be produced at separate plants at the [[Toledo Complex]] in [[Toledo, Ohio]]. To distinguish between JK and JL models, a '''Wrangler JK''' decal was applied to the front fenders of the vehicle. There were very minimal changes from the 2017 [[model year]] Wrangler and Wrangler Unlimited (aside from the '''75TH Anniversary Edition''' models), with the same trim levels and special editions being offered, although a new '''Golden Eagle''' special edition models were also offered, with bronze-painted accents and aluminum-alloy wheels and special front fender decals. The '''Golden Eagle''' was also the only Wrangler JK to be offered with a beige top option. Wrangler and Wrangler Unlimited JK production ended in April of 2018 once [[Jeep Wrangler (JL)]] and Wrangler Unlimited JL production ramped up. The plant where the Wrangler and Wrangler Unlimited JK were produced received a [[retooling]]{{dn|date=February 2020}} to produce the all-new 2020 [[Jeep Gladiator (JT)]], which would begin production in late 2018.

==Military Jeep J8 (2007–present)==
[[File:Military Light Tactical Vehicle Type C Display at ROCMA Ground 20160604a.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Republic of China]][[Republic of China Army]] Wrangler Unlimited]]
{{Main|Jeep J8}}
On September 13, 2007, at the [[Defence Systems and Equipment International]] trade show, [[Chrysler LLC]] unveiled a Wrangler Unlimited version designed for military use dubbed the J8. The unarmored [[Jeep J8]] is equipped with larger brakes, axles and suspension components than the civilian version and has a payload capacity of 1,339&amp;nbsp;kg (2,952&amp;nbsp;lb). The J8 also differs from the civilian model by utilizing heavy-duty rear [[leaf springs]] for carrying heavier payloads. The Jeep J8 is powered by a [[VM Motori|VM]] 2.8-liter (169&amp;nbsp;CID) four-cylinder [[turbo-diesel engine]] that produces 118&amp;nbsp;kW (158&amp;nbsp;hp) and 400&amp;nbsp;N·m (295&amp;nbsp;lbf·ft) of torque, providing towing capability of up to 3,500&amp;nbsp;kg (7,700&amp;nbsp;lb).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jgms.com/resource/655820905c7c49b0a0b17451f2ba5cf6.pdf|title=Specifications Sheet: Jeep J8 4x4|work=JGMS.com|accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine is mated to a five-speed automatic transmission. The J8 also features a unique air-intake system with special filtration and a hood-mounted snorkel that enables the J8 to wade in water up to 762&amp;nbsp;mm (30&amp;nbsp;in) deep and tackle sandstorm conditions for up to five hours. Available as a two-door with an extended pickup bed for personnel or equipment transport, or a four-door multipurpose vehicle, it may be produced with numerous vehicle-body and seating configurations in either right-hand- or left-hand-drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeephorizons.com/news/j8_091307.html|title=New Military Version of Jeep Wrangler Unlimited|work=jeephorizons.com|accessdate=2007-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Targeted for use by the militaries in overseas markets, the J8 is not available in the United States because it will not meet U.S. emissions requirements. The J8 will be produced in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2007/autos/0709/gallery.jeep_wrangler_history|title=

== End of Production ==
Production of the [[Jeep]] Wrangler JK and Wrangler Unlimited JK ceased on Friday, April 27, 2018, after twelve years, as dealer stock of the 2018 [[Jeep Wrangler (JL)]] ramps up. The current [[Jeep]] Wrangler JK plant will receive a [[Tool|retooling]] in order to produce the upcoming JL-based [[Jeep Gladiator (JT)]] that will debut for the 2020 [[model year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/future-cars/a25097901/jeep-gladiator-pickup-photos-wrangler-truck/|title=2020 Jeep Gladiator Is the Wrangler Pickup Truck We've Been Waiting For|first1=Bob|last1=Sorokanich|first2=David|last2=Zenlea|date=November 28, 2018|website=Road &amp; Track}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jeep-related vehicles unlike the jeep vehicle-concept==
[[File:Ford GPA.jpg|thumb|Ford GPA next to a regular World War II jeep]]

      <text bytes="1908" xml:space="preserve">The '''Jeep Wagoneer''' is a [[sport utility vehicle]] (SUV) marque of [[Jeep]] vehicles, with several models marketed for the 1963 to 1993 model years. The name “Wagoneer” comes from the [[station wagon]] style rear end later known as the SUV body style.

Various versions of the Wagoneer were manufactured in the US and other nations by [[Kaiser Motors]] (1962−1971), then [[American Motors]] (1971−1987), and lastly by [[Chrysler]] (1987−1993). Wagoneer was a model built by Jeep.
 
A revival of the Jeep Wagoneer is expected to debut in early 2020 as a 2021 model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/12/new-jeep-wagoneer-caught-hungry-for-2021-chevrolet-tahoe-gmc-yukon/ "New Jeep Wagoneer Caught Hungry For 2021 Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Yukon"] from GM Authority (December 5, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jeep Wrangler YJ''' was the first generation of [[Jeep Wrangler]] [[four-wheel drive]] small [[off-road vehicle]]s, [[rebadging]] and succeeding [[Jeep]]'s [[Jeep CJ|CJ series]], produced from 1944 to 1986. The first Wrangler (internally "YJ") was launched in 1986 and ran through 1995. Although the new Wrangler stood out by its square headlights, its body was a direct evolution of the preceding [[CJ-7]], and rode on the same wheelbase. The Wrangler featured an updated interior, offered more comfort and improved safety and handling, through a revised chassis that included wider tracks and a slightly lower stance.

Development of a potential [[CJ-7]] replacement was green-lit in 1982, with engineering and design work (under Chuck Mashigan) commencing. After approval earlier in 1983, a final design freeze occurred by the fall of 1983, with CJ-7 based mules being built in late 1983 and the first production body test prototypes in the spring of 1984. By late 1985, development concluded, as the transition from pilot to series production began. In February 1986, the 1987 Jeep Wrangler was unveiled, entering production that March, and going on sale on May 13, 1986.

== History ==

The [[Jeep]] YJ, sold as the Wrangler in the United States, replaced the [[Jeep CJ]] line in 1986 and was built in [[Brampton, Ontario]], [[Canada]], until the plant closed on April 23, 1992. Production was then moved to Toledo, Ohio, using the same plant that produced the  Willys Jeeps during World War II.

[[American Motors Corporation]] (AMC) had designed the new Jeep to be more comfortable on-road in an attempt to attract more daily drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4-the-love-of-jeeps.com/jeep-wrangler.html |title=Jeep Wrangler: The Real Thing or Compromise? |publisher=4-the-love-of-jeeps.com |date=1995-03-21 |accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a significantly new design with a wider track, slightly less [[ride height|ground clearance]], more comfort and improved handling. The YJ still had [[leaf spring suspension]] similar to that of the CJ – however the springs were wider, and the first Wrangler sported [[Panhard rod|trackbar]] [[suspension link]]s and [[anti-roll bar]]s for improved handling and safety, making it less easy to flip by untrained or unwary drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.allpar.com/SUVs/wrangler/jeep-name.html | title=How the Jeep got its name}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the new grille, the body is very similar to that of the CJ-7, and it is interchangeable with some minor modifications. The YJ also was given a larger windshield over the CJ. The YJs are easily identifiable due to the rectangular headlights and the fact that the wiper blades rest on the windshield, giving this version a distinctive look.  The blades rested on the windshield due to the now wider arc of the blades to clean the larger windshield. These two changes were later removed when the TJ was launched 1996. 632,231 YJs were built through model year 1995, although YJs were still sold into mid-1996, bringing the total production number to 685,071 units. Despite its similar look to the Jeep (CJ) its design was new from the ground up and had more in common with the newer downsized Cherokee (XJ) model.

The YJ used a 2.5&amp;nbsp;L ''[[AMC Straight-4 engine|AMC 150]]'' I4 or optional 4.2&amp;nbsp;L ''[[AMC Straight-6 engine#258|AMC 258]]'' I6 until 1990. Starting in 1991, a [[fuel-injected]] 180&amp;nbsp;hp (134&amp;nbsp;kW) 4.0&amp;nbsp;L [[AMC Straight-6 engine#4.0|AMC 242]] variant replaced the 112&amp;nbsp;hp (84&amp;nbsp;kW) 4.2&amp;nbsp;L 258&amp;nbsp;CID [[straight-6]]. The NP207 transfer case was used only for 1987 and replaced by the NP231.

The roll cage was extended in 1992 to allow for rear shoulder belts, and [[anti-lock brake]]s were added as an option the next year. An [[automatic transmission]] option for 4-cylinder Wranglers came in 1994, along with a [[center high-mounted stop lamp|center high-mounted brake light]].  Also, in 1992, the Sahara debuted.

In 1994, the slave cylinder on manual transmissions was moved outside of the transmission's bellhousing to allow for easier replacement, and in 1995 the [[Dana 30]] larger U-joints were used [front axle U-joints (297x) and rear pinion U-joint (1330)]. For the 1992 model year, the YJ switched over to an electronic speedometer, outmoding the cable speedos on older YJs.

There were no 1996 model year Jeep Wranglers.&lt;ref name=FosterJeep&gt;{{cite book|quote=One highly irregular thing about the 1996 model year was that the company didn't offer a 1996 Wrangler.|title=The Story of Jeep |first=Patrick R. |last=Foster| page=231 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=D05p17q4cSYC&amp;pg=PA231&amp;dq=1996+Jeep+Wrangler |year=2004| isbn= 978-0-87349-735-0 |publisher=Krause Publications |accessdate=2010-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; YJs produced in early 1996 were sold as 1995 model years, but featured a few new parts not seen on any earlier YJ. This included the new TJ bumpstops on the hood (rubber boots vs the traditional U-bars), reinforced tailgate hinges, and some even had rear TJ bumpers. Some also got the newly tuned I6 that was designed to run quieter in preparation for the TJ.

Top options for YJ were the same as those offered on TJ. A Soft top with "half doors", featuring soft plastic zipper windows came standard (windows could be removed completely from these doors). Full-frame doors with conventional glass windows were optional on soft-top models. Hard tops with rear wiper and defroster were optional, but came standard with full-framed doors. The YJ featured large mirrors with manually adjustable arms on half-door models, while full-framed doors received smaller adjustable mirrors with fixed arms (which were mounted further away from the door corner, compared to the larger-style mirrors). Depending on year and interior color, Jeeps could be had with the top colors in black, white, tan and gray. Roll-bar padding normally matched top color, with the exception of white tops.

[[File:91 Jeep Renegade.jpg|thumb|right|1991 Jeep Renegade]]
From October 1990 until 1994, Jeep produced an options package on the YJ Wrangler listed as the "Renegade Decor Group". Vehicles were shipped as optioned Wranglers to Autostyle in the [[Detroit]] area, where the Renegade Decor Package was installed, then shipped back to Jeep for delivery to dealers. Renegades all have a small sticker on the driver's side door, right above the latch denoting the visit to Autostyle. Initially, all Renegades were white, black, or red. Blue and bronze were added for the 1992 and 1993 model years, respectively. The Renegade Decor Group was a $4,266 option over a base Wrangler for 1991 and included special alloy wheels, exclusive body flares, along with many other features. Contents of the Renegade Decor Package include:

A hardtop was a $923.00 option and came with a mandatory rear window defroster at $164.00. Although soft-top models came standard with "half doors", full framed doors with glass windows were an option, and as on all 6-cylinder Wranglers, air-conditioning was also an option. Renegades typically had the tilt steering wheel ($130.00) and an AM/FM/cassette stereo radio ($264.00). A column shift automatic was also an available option, but it was not popular.

== Trim levels ==

The '''Jeep Grand Commander''' (codeproject K8) is a 7-seater [[Mid-size car|mid-size]] [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover]] [[SUV]] by [[Jeep]]. 

==Overview==
Previewed by the Jeep Yuntu Concept, the Grand Commander debuted in April 2018 at the [[Beijing Auto Show]] and was launched on the Chinese car market in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://carnewschina.com/2017/12/08/leaked-china-2018-jeep-grand-commander/|title=Leaked In China: This Is The 2018 Jeep Grand Commander}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://carnewschina.com/2018/01/16/new-jeep-grand-commander-seven-seat-suv-china/|title=This Is The New Jeep Grand Commander Seven-seat SUV For China}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pricing of the Grand Commander ranges from 239,900 to 330,800 yuan ($38,120 – 52,580).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://carnewschina.com/2018/02/06/jeep-announces-pricing-grand-commander-china/|title=Jeep Announces Pricing For The Grand Commander In China}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufactured by the  [[GAC Fiat]] joint venture, the Grand Commander will be positioned above the locally made [[Jeep Cherokee (KL)|Jeep Cherokee]] [[compact CUV]]. A 5-seater version is also available as the Jeep Commander.

Despite its appearance and name, the Jeep Grand Commander will not be sold as a successor to the 2006-2010 [[Jeep Commander]] XK. The Grand Commander is exclusive to the [[China|Chinese]] market. [[North America]] will get a successor to the [[Jeep Commander]] XK that will be based on the full-size [[Ram Truck]], and is slated to be named the [[Jeep Wagoneer (SJ)|Jeep Grand Wagoneer]].

In late 2018, multiple reports stated that the Grand Commander may come to the North American market as a [[Chrysler (brand)|Chrysler]], due to Jeep's reputation of making true off-road vehicles. The Chrysler-badged Grand Commander would serve as a replacement for the [[Dodge Journey]] and likely be built at the [[Belvidere Assembly Plant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.carscoops.com/2018/12/chinas-jeep-grand-commander-might-come-u-s-chrysler/|title=China's Jeep Grand Commander Might Come To U.S. As A...

The '''Rubicon Trail''' is a 22-mile-long route, part road and part [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] [[trail]], located in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] of the western United States, due west of [[Lake Tahoe]] and about {{convert|80|mi|km}} east of [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]].

The western maintained portion of the route is called the '''Wentworth Springs Road'''; it begins in [[Georgetown, California]], a hamlet in California's [[Gold Country]].  The road continues from its intersection with [[California State Route 193|State Route 193]] toward Wentworth Springs, where the [[trailhead]] for the unmaintained portion of the route exists adjacent to [[Loon Lake (California)|Loon Lake]].  The trail portion of the route is about {{convert|12|mi|km}} long and passes in part through the [[El Dorado National Forest]] as well as the Tahoe National Forest and the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit. The eastern maintained portion of the trail is called the '''McKinney Rubicon Springs Road''', and leads to Lake Tahoe.

[[Image:Rubicon_Trail_Walker.jpg|thumb|A Jeep climbing up the first part of Walker Hill]]
[[Image:Rubicon_Trail_Littlesluice.jpg|thumb|The Little Sluice Obstacle]]

There are entrances to the trail, either at Wentworth Springs at the Loon Lake spillway or on the Lake Tahoe side along highway 89 near Tahoma. The [[Wentworth Springs]] entrance, at [[Gerle Creek]], is the original entrance to the trail, and starts with an obstacle known as Devil's Postpile (not to be confused with [[Devils Postpile National Monument]] near [[Mammoth Lakes, California|Mammoth Lakes]]). The [[Loon Lake (California)|Loon Lake]] route is shorter, first crossing the Granite Bowl, a large open rock valley. (The Loon Lake entrance previously had an obstacle known as The Gatekeeper. It was demolished in October 2004 to limit trail use deemed unacceptable by the USFS and had nothing to do with [[erosion]]).

The Wentworth Springs entrance joins the trail from Loon Lake shortly before Ellis Creek. After driving through the relatively mild section beyond Ellis Creek the [[Walker Hill]] obstacle is encountered. It includes a rocky climb followed by a notch that can either be straddled or side-hilled.

A short distance beyond Walker Hill is the Soup Bowl. The Soup Bowl is a short climb with a series of ledges that are difficult to climb. High clearance and long [[wheelbase]]s help with this obstacle. After passing the Soup Bowl, the Little Sluice awaits.

The Little Sluice, also known as the [[Sluice Box]] or simply as "The Box", is close to Spider Lake. Such can be bypassed in two ways for vehicles that cannot ascend the main trail. The most common bypass route is to the left of the obstacle known as the long bypass. The second way to bypass the Little Sluice is to drive up Toyota Rock. Toyota Rock is to the right toward [[Spider Lake, California|Spider Lake]] (so named because it resembles a spider from above), just before the large rocks in the Little Sluice, and leads to the slabs that surround Little Sluice.  The large rocks in the Little Sluice were reduced in size in the fall of 2012 by El Dorado County in order to reduce concentrated camping and the "spectator" atmosphere at the Sluice.  The section is still difficult, but difficulty has been reduced.

After passing the Little Sluice the next obstacle is Thousand Dollar hill (also sometimes called Million Dollar hill). It is a rock ledge followed by a steep grade, facing downhill if driving the trail toward Lake Tahoe. As of 7/15/2012, Thousand Dollar Hill has been closed. This obstacle had a moderately difficult bypass (the original trail), which is now the only route open.

The trail splits again about a half mile past this point, the lower trail continuing on the granite slabs (aka Indian Trail) or the upper trail through the Old Sluice. Both routes lead to [[Buck Island Lake]]. The granite slabs are [[Off-camber corner|off camber]] but are an easier and much quicker route to take.

Before passing Buck Island Lake you come across Silby Rock. Silby Rock can be considered difficult if the wrong line has been taken. Before hitting the rock, you'll be coming out of a stream that can make the rocks slick. The trail then continues toward the Big Sluice. This downhill section contains a switchback with a rock drop-off and an off camber rocky section, leading to the Rubicon River Bridge and then into the private property of the [[Rubicon Springs]].

Rubicon Springs is on private property and must be respected as such. A cabin (in the same spot as the former 2-story hotel) houses the caretaker family. A seemingly endless number of camp spots is available around the springs, as well as a [[helipad]] for emergencies and for large events to fly supplies in. Most large events will set up base camp in the Springs because it is large enough for hundreds of people to camp. Notable annual events are the Jeepers Jamboree (maximum of 500 vehicles), the Jeep Jamboree (200 vehicles), the Toyota Land Cruiser Association's Rubithon (approximately 150-200 vehicles), and the Marlin Crawler Round-Up (approximately 150-200 vehicles).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://board.marlincrawler.com/index.php?board=3.0 |title=Marlin Crawler Round-Up Talk Forum |publisher=MarlinCrawler.com |accessdate=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Rubicon Springs is [[Cadillac Hill]]. Cadillac Hill is a series of switchbacks up to Observation Point, starting with a rutted out section with many exposed tree roots. After turning a hairpin the trail becomes very off camber and contains a series of boulders to maneuver around or over. After that is a steep stairstep obstacle to climb. At the top of the hill is Observation Point, a good place to see where you have just driven and to take a short break before the long dirt road back to [[Lake Tahoe]]. There are a few small sections of rocks like "Potato Patch" and the "Slabs" after this but nothing that poses a significant obstacle.

== Rubicon land use issues ==
[[Image:Rubicon_Trail_Bigsluice.jpg|thumb|A stock Ford Ranger descending Big Sluice]]
In 2001 the Lahontan Water Board contemplated filing an order to force closure of the east end of the trail near the Tahoe Basin.  In order to prevent this closure Friends of the Rubicon (FOTR), a grass-roots, user-driven organization was formed and built more than thirty erosion control devices on the trail in order to prevent erosion and siltation of the watershed. The Lahontan Water Board dropped their effort and FOTR kept the trail open and have conducted many work projects on the trail each year since then.

The initial organized effort to close the trail involved embroiling El Dorado County in an effort to manage the trail. This effort resulted in the Rubicon Trail Master Plan which the county rejected because it was projected to be too costly. Most of the costs involved were for monitoring, not for fixing problems on the trail.

When the Master Plan effort failed multiple complaints were filed with the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Board. The complaints were that the trail was causing erosion and siltation of the watershed, sanitation problems were not being addressed, and OHVs were spilling oil on the trail. These complaints resulted in a Draft Cleanup and Abatement Order that would have closed the trail had it been implemented as written. During the hearing, before issuing a final order, testimony was heard from El Dorado County, the Eldorado National Forest, and the Rubicon Trail Foundation. The result of that hearing was a more manageable order requiring El Dorado County and the Eldorado National Forest to repair the trail, build bridges, obtain an accurate user count, conduct education and planning efforts, report regularly to the board, and provide more law enforcement on the trail. The Cleanup and Abatement Order was rescinded on October 14, 2014, noting the efforts by government agencies and trail users to redress water quality concerns.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edcgov.us/Government/Parks/CAO_Rescission_10-10-14.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rubicon Trail Foundation, Friends of the Rubicon, El Dorado County, and the Eldorado National Forest continue their efforts to keep this "crown jewel" of OHV routes open.

== Usage ==
Part of the trail is used as a testing ground by Jeep and many aftermarket Jeep product companies local to Northern California including ([[Metalcloak]]) ([[RuffStuff Specialties]]), ([[SPIDERWEBSHADE]]), and quite frequently, ([[GenRight]]). The Rubicon variants of the [[Jeep Wrangler]] and [[Jeep Gladiator]] are named after this trail.

Many large events take place on the trail, ranging from Jeep-only events ([[Jeep Jamboree USA|Jeep Jamboree]]) and 4x4 enthusiast events ([[Jeepers Jamboree]], TLCA's Rubithon, Marlin Crawler Round-Up, Cantina on the Con) to family trips to special events organized just for SUVs and stock 4x4s that could not otherwise complete the trail.

As of April 2016, the TV show ''[[Top Gear (U.S. TV series)|Top Gear USA]]'' on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] Google Imaged the entire Rubicon Trail with the NCTech iSTAR 360 degree camera as part of their show. A few hundred of the 6000 images can be found on Google Maps provided by NCTech.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nctechimaging.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Google Maps"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/maps/@39.0124276,-120.30768,3a,75y,63.64h,95.4t/data=%213m6%211e1%213m4%211swkGfDBDEBz8AAAQvOyaAeA%212e0%217i10000%218i5000 |title=Google Maps: Top Gear Rubicon Tour |accessdate=2016-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jeep Gladiator''' is a midsize [[pickup truck]] manufactured by the [[Jeep]] division of [[Chrysler|FCA US]]. It was introduced at the [[Los Angeles Auto Show#2018|2018 Los Angeles Auto Show]] on November 28, 2018, and went on sale in the spring of 2019. Based on the same platform as the [[Jeep Wrangler (JL)|Wrangler JL]], the Gladiator is Jeep's first pickup truck since the [[Jeep Comanche|Comanche]] was discontinued in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=20427&amp;mid=|title=FCA US Media – All-new 2020 Jeep® Gladiator: The Most Capable Midsize Truck Ever|website=FCA North America|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedrive.com/news/25068/here-at-last-2020-jeep-gladiator-pickup-finally-makes-its-debut-at-los-angeles-auto-show|title=2020 Jeep Gladiator Pickup Truck: Everything You Need to Know, and Then Some|last=Kirchner|first=Chad|work=The Drive|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The vehicle's name harkens back to the [[Jeep Gladiator (SJ)|original Jeep Gladiator]], made from 1962–1988 and known as the J-Series after 1971. Jeep considered reviving the Gladiator name alongside Comanche and most commonly [[Jeep CJ#CJ-8 (Scrambler)File:Jeep Gladiator Concept.JPG|Scrambler]], as well as simply using a new name, before deciding on Gladiator, feeling it fits the truck the best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NS_s-Zyeks|title=A Closer Look – 2018 LA Auto Show – 2020 Jeep® Gladiator|first=|last=Jeep|publisher=|accessdate=9 December 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of a Jeep Scrambler pickup truck was shown in 2003 at the North American Dealers Association. In late-2004 the Jeep Gladiator [[Concept car|concept]] was introduced. The [[Jeep Gladiator (SJ)#2005 Jeep Gladiator|2005 Gladiator Concept]] did not feature a removable roof, but featured removable doors and a pickup bed. It also previewed the design of the upcoming [[Jeep Wrangler (JK)]]. The Gladiator concept was powered by a 3.0L Common-Rail Diesel (CRD) engine produced by [[VM Motori]] (similar to the one used in some models of the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]]), mated to a manual transmission, and four-wheel-drive. It featured functional rear mini-doors, and rear seating. The Gladiator concept featured a green-on-gray color scheme for both the exterior and interior.

== Exterior design ==
[[File:2020 Jeep Gladiator Rubicon, rear 2.1.20.jpg|thumb|left|Jeep Gladiator (JT) rear]]
The all-new four-door, five-passenger midsize Gladiator features exterior and interior styling cues from the Wrangler JL. Taylor Langhals was the lead exterior designer on Gladiator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Gladiator Has a Secret Tribute to Jeep’s Factory Workers |url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-shows/los-angeles-auto-show/a25358177/jeep-gladiator-pickup-truck-easter-egg-toledo-ohio/ |website=Road &amp; Track |accessdate=3 December 2018 |date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because a truck is frequently used for both hauling and towing, the front grille slots were enlarged to allow for increased airflow and heavier-duty engine cooling. A full-sized spare tire, normally mounted on the Wrangler's rear tailgate, is mounted underneath the cargo bed of the Gladiator.

Four different roof options are available, similar to those on the Wrangler JL, including a black vinyl ''Sun-Rider'' soft top and a premium black fabric ''Sun-Rider'' soft top (both of which can be fully retracted), a black ''Freedom-Top'' three-piece hard top, and a color-keyed ''Freedom-Top'' three-piece hard top, both of which have removable aluminum roof panels. 

The truck has front and rear doors that can be fully removed, as well as a windshield that can be lowered (like the Wrangler JL, Jeep includes a tool kit with the tools necessary to remove the doors and lower the windshield). The Gladiator is unique in that it is the only truck available with a removable roof.

A front facing trail cam, mounted in one of the front grille slots, is also available that displays an image on the [[touchscreen]] of what is directly in front of the vehicle (this feature requires one of the two larger U Connect [[touchscreen]] displays), and will assist in off-road maneuverability, such as water fording, as well as climbing over objects like logs and rocks. The "Off Road Pages" application, displayed in the instrument cluster, allows a Gladiator driver to view approach and departure angles, steering angles, and more.

== Trim levels ==
The Gladiator is available in base '''Sport''', mid-level '''Sport S''', luxurious '''Overland''', and off-road ready '''Rubicon''' (a limited-edition '''Rubicon Launch Edition''' model, limited to 4,190 units, is also available (see above)). The Gladiator and Wrangler JL diverge when it comes to their luxury trim levels. The luxury Wrangler gets the '''Sahara''' name, while the luxury trim on the Gladiator is known as the "Overland" model. When equipped with leather upholstery, the '''Overland''' receives a stitched soft-touch dashboard surface and hand-stitched dashboard, similar to that of the Wrangler Sahara.

== Powertrain ==
At launch, the only engine option for the Gladiator will be the [[Chrysler Pentastar engine#3.6L|3.6L Pentastar]] [[V6 engine|V6]] gasoline engine with [[Variable Valve Timing]] (VVT) and an Electronic [[Start-stop system|Stop-Start System]] (ESS), and like the Wrangler JL, will produce 280 horsepower. However, a 3.0L [[EcoDiesel]] Turbocharged V6 diesel engine will become available in mid 2020. The 3.6L V6 will be mated to either a six-speed Aisin manual transmission, or the Wrangler JL's [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] 850RE eight-speed automatic transmission. Like the Wrangler JL, all Gladiator models will be [[four-wheel drive]].

== Payload and towing capacities ==
Payload for the Gladiator is {{convert|1700|lb|abbr=on}}. The bed of the truck can be optionally equipped with a rear folding tonneau cover, which features a "Weekend Warrior Mode" that allow for the tailgate to be closed and 2 x 4 lumber to be hauled in the pickup bed and only one section of the tonneau cover to be open (the cover can also be fully retracted or removed, if required). The tailgate is hinged, and can be locked in a partially-open position if the owner does not want to fully lower the tailgate.

The standard Gladiator will feature a towing capacity of {{convert|7000|lb|abbr=on}}, though a heavy-duty towing package will be available on select Gladiator models that increases the towing capacity to {{convert|7650|lb|abbr=on}} and includes a 4.10 rear axle ratio. 

The diesel-powered Gladiator will feature a lower towing capacity rating than the gasoline-powered variant.

== Off-roading ==
The Gladiator features an [[Approach and departure angles|approach angle]] of 43.6 degrees, a [[breakover angle]] of 20.3 degrees and a [[departure angle]] of 26 degrees. The Rubicon comes with front- and rear-axle electric lockers and an electronic disconnecting front sway-bar.

A front camera system is available on the Gladiator that allows the driver to see obstacles in front and to the sides of the vehicle while off-road.

== Interior ==
Unique features on the Gladiator include a flat rear load floor for carrying of longer and taller items inside the truck's interior, secure and lockable storage underneath the rear bench seat, and a removable [[Bluetooth]] wireless speaker that charges when the vehicle is running, and the speaker is in its docking station located behind the rear bench seat. From the front seats forward, the Gladiator features an interior design that is nearly identical to that of the Jeep [[Jeep Wrangler (JL)|Wrangler JL]]

Like the Wrangler JL, three different touchscreen infotainment systems are available on the Gladiator, each integrating the rearview camera into the touchscreen:

* '''Sport''' and '''Sport S''' trims feature a standard U Connect 3 5.0BT radio with U Connect Bluetooth connectivity. [[SiriusXM]] [[Satellite Radio]] is available as an option, and includes one year of service.

* '''Overland''' and '''Rubicon''' trims feature a standard U Connect 4 7.0 infotainment system with U Connect Bluetooth connectivity, [[Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]] and SiriusXM Satellite Radio with one-year service included. This system is also optional on the Sport S.

* The '''Rubicon Launch Edition''' and '''North Edition''' both feature a standard U Connect 4C 8.4 infotainment system with U Connect Bluetooth connectivity, [[HD Radio]], SiriusXM Satellite Radio with one-year service included, [[Garmin]]-based GPS navigation, [[4G]] [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] in-vehicle wireless hotspot, U Connect Guardian powered by SiriusXM with one-year service included, SiriusXM Travel Link with five-year service included. This radio is also available on both '''Overland''' and '''Rubicon''' models as an option, as part of the Infotainment and Premium Audio Group. This option also later became an option on the '''Sport S''' model.

* All Gladiator models except for the Rubicon Launch Edition feature a standard eight-speaker audio system with speakers in the lower knee panels, upper instrument panel, and rear roll bar. The Rubicon Launch Edition includes the optional [[Alpine Electronics|Alpine]] premium audio system with 552-watt amplifier and subwoofer (this system is also available on all trim levels except for the base Sport with the optional Infotainment and Premium Audio Group). 

* With the Alpine premium audio system and Infotainment and Premium Audio Group on all models except for the base Sport, Gladiator buyers can choose the optional removable and rechargeable Bluetooth wireless speaker, which stows and recharges behind the rear bench seat, a feature unique to the Gladiator. This speaker is also included as standard equipment on the Rubicon Launch Edition.

== Safety ==
The Gladiator has most safety features that are also in the Wrangler JL including [[Collision avoidance system|forward-collision warning with active braking]] and [[Autonomous cruise control system|adaptive cruise control]]. The Jeep Active Safety Group and Jeep Advanced Active Safety Group are both available on all models except for the base Sport, and included on the Rubicon Launch Edition.

Safety ratings from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) indicate for the 2020 model of the Gladiator, the Front Drivers Side received a 4 / 5 stars, and the Front Passenger Side received 5 / 5 stars.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2020/JEEP/GLADIATOR/PU%25252FCC/4WD&lt;/ref&gt;   The technical crash test report for those ratings was prepared by Calspan Corporation and was released on December 10, 2019.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/database/MEDIA/GetMedia.aspx?tstno=10831&amp;index=1&amp;database=V&amp;type=R&lt;/ref&gt;

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), has not released their ratings for the 2020 Jeep Gladiator as of December 2019.  

== Marketing ==
The introduction video at the Los Angeles Auto Show used a sound clip from the 2000 film ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'', showing the original Jeep Gladiator telling the new model that it "needed to win the crowd", just before the formal introduction of the new model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5qzwhlMUv8|title=2020 Jeep® Gladiator Reveal -**Multi-Cam Option** – LA Auto Show – Jeep®|first=|last=Jeep|publisher=|accessdate=December 9, 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Super Bowl LIV]], Jeep premiered a [[Super Bowl commercials|commercial]] for the Gladiator starring [[Bill Murray]], reprising his starring role from the film ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]'' (the game itself also fell on [[Groundhog Day]]). It was named the best commercial of Super Bowl LIV on ''[[USA Today]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s [[Super Bowl Ad Meter]] survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2020/02/groundhog-day-returns-bill-murray-in-new-jeep-commercial-1202849357/|title=‘Groundhog Day’ Returns Bill Murray In New Jeep Commercial|last=Haring|first=Bruce|date=2020-02-02|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2020-02-03|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/Ad-Meter/2020/02/03/jeeps-groundhog-day-ad-commercial-bill-murray-wins-ad-meter/4643140002/|title=Jeep, Bill Murray win USA TODAY's Ad Meter with hilarious 'Groundhog Day' commercial|last=Schad|first=Tom|website=USA Today|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Special editions ==

=== Rubicon Launch Edition ===

Jeep celebrated the launch of the all-new Gladiator with the limited-edition '''Rubicon Launch Edition''' model. Available for preorder only through a special website, and only on April 4th, 2019 (Jeep 4X4 Day), the Rubicon Launch Edition is based on the top-of-the-line Rubicon trim level, and includes all available options on that trim level with no additional options available. Available for an MSRP of $62,310, only 4,190 limited-edition Rubicon Launch Edition Gladiators will be produced (the number "4,190" pays homage to the "419" area code of [[Toledo, Ohio]], the home of [[Toledo Complex]] where the Gladiator is assembled). Special features that distinguish the Rubicon Launch Edition from other Gladiator models include special badging, special wheels, and a leather-wrapped instrument panel with red stitching. The Launch Edition is available in five colors: Black, Bright White, Firecracker Red, Granite Crystal Metallic, and Billet Silver Metallic. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.jeep.com/gladiator/launch-edition.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North Edition ===

In late 2019, [[Jeep]] introduced the Gladiator '''North Edition'''. Based on the luxury-oriented '''Overland''' model, the '''North Edition''' is marketed towards Gladiator buyers living in colder climates. In addition to the standard equipment offered on the '''Overland''', the Gladiator '''North Edition''' model adds features such as the U Connect 4C 8.4 touchscreen infotainment system with [[SiriusXM]] Guardian, [[Satellite Radio]], and Travel Link services and [[Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]] smartphone integration, the nine-speaker [[Alpine Electronics|Alpine]] premium amplified audio system with [[subwoofer]], the Cold Weather Group (which includes dual heated front bucket seats, a heated leather-wrapped steering wheel, and a remote vehicle starter system), a unique '''North''' emblem on the rear tailgate, and rubberized all-weather front and rear floor mats. The '''North Edition''' is the first special-edition Gladiator trim level to be released, and will be followed by the Gladiator '''Mojave''' model. &lt;ref&gt;https://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=21482&amp;mid=1015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mojave ===

At the 2020 [[Chicago Auto Show]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], [[Jeep]] introduced the Gladiator '''Mojave'''. The '''Mojave''' is the first "Desert-Rated" [[Jeep]] model. Features on the '''Mojave''' trim include 33-inch [[Falken]] Wildpeak all-terrain tires (mud-terrain tires are also available as an option), unique seventeen-inch painted aluminum-alloy wheels, FOX brand 2.5-inch internal bypass shocks with external reservoirs, a unique "Desert Rated 4X4" emblem in place of the "Trail Rated 4X4" emblem on both front fenders, unique "Mojave" decals on both sides of the hood, orange tow hooks, an "Off Road Plus" button on the center console for increased off-road capabilities, and the ability to lock the Gladiator's rear axles at high speeds when in 4WD High mode (a feature exclusive to the '''Mojave'''). The interior, when equipped with the optional leather-trimmed seats, features special heat-reflective seating material that is engineered to withstand the hottest climates (all interiors on the '''Mojave''' feature unique orange stitching on the seats, steering wheel, dashboard, and door trim panels). &lt;ref&gt;https://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=21498&amp;mid=1015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== High Altitude Edition ===

At the 2020 [[Chicago Auto Show]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], [[Jeep]] introduced the Gladiator '''High Altitude Edition''' as the new "up-level" Gladiator trim level.

The Gladiator is a midsize pickup truck, and competes with other midsize pickup trucks already on the market, such as the [[Chevrolet Colorado]] and the [[GMC Canyon]], the [[Ford Ranger]], the [[Nissan Frontier]], the [[Honda Ridgeline]], and the [[Toyota Tacoma]].

== Recalls ==

On September 13, 2019, [[Chrysler]] announced a recall for the 2020 Jeep Gladiator JT, with approximately 3,427 total Gladiators affected. The [[Dana Corporation]], which manufactures the rear [[driveshaft]] for the Gladiator, may have assembled the rear axle monoblocks without grease, which could lead to the potential fracture of the rear driveshaft, leading to a sudden loss in power. Jeep dealers will replace the rear driveshaft on affected 2020 Gladiator models. The recall, which affects 2020 Jeep Gladiator JT models built between December 15, 2018 and June 25, 2019, is expected to begin on October 18, 2019. There has also been a Stop-Sale Order issued for all affected Jeep Gladiator JT models still on dealership lots. Only Gladiators which were built before June 25, 2019 are affected by the recall. &lt;ref&gt;https://carbuzz.com/news/jeep-discovers-serious-problem-with-2020-gladiator&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jeep Wrangler (TJ)''' is the second generation of the [[Jeep Wrangler]] [[Off-road vehicle|off-road]] and [[Sport utility vehicle|sport utility]] vehicle. Introduced in 1996 as a 1997 model, the TJ reintroduced the circular headlights the classic Jeep models had been known for.

Contrary to the original [[Willys MB]], the [[Jeep CJ|CJ Jeeps]], and the [[Jeep Wrangler (YJ)|Wrangler (YJ)]], starting with the TJ all Wranglers were fitted with [[coil spring]] [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] instead of leaf-springs. In 2004 the name ''Unlimited'' was introduced for the long-wheelbase version.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}
In 1990, development of a successor to the YJ began in Chrysler's "Jeep-Truck Engineering Pre-Program" department under Bob Sheaves and TJ program director, Craig Winn. Mules based on the YJ were built from 1990 to 1993, when formal approval was given for the TJ development program at a $260 million budget. From 1991 to 1992, designers worked at the new [[Chrysler Headquarters and Technology Center|Chrysler Technical Center]], building on various design proposals. In late 1992, Michael Santoro's TJ proposal was chosen by Tom Gale, Lee Iacocca, and executive management. In May 1993, now with engineering and supplier input, Santoro's final Wrangler production design was frozen at 32 months ahead of initial assembly. Verification prototypes using production bodies were built from early 1994 and tested through late 1995. As YJ production ceased in December 1995, the last pre-production TJ examples were assembled, with start of series of production in January 1996.

Unveiled on January 2, 1996, at the 1996 Detroit Auto Show as an early 1997 model year introduction (1996 model year skipped), the TJ was an evolutionary update. It later arrived in Jeep showrooms in April 1996, after 6 years of overall investment and 36 month production development phase.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

Instead of [[leaf spring]]s, this updated Wrangler featured a modern coil-spring suspension, front and rear, based on that of the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]], for better ride and handling, and a return to the classic CJ's round headlamps. The engine is the same 4.0&amp;nbsp;L [[AMC Straight 6 engine|AMC 242 Straight-6]] used in the [[Jeep Cherokee|Cherokee]] and [[Jeep Grand Cherokee|Grand Cherokee]]. A 2.5&amp;nbsp;L [[AMC Engines#150 (2.5 L) AMC|AMC 150 Inline-4]] engine was available on entry-level models until 2002. The 2.4&amp;nbsp;L [[DOHC]] 4-cylinder engine previously used on the Chrysler PT Cruiser replaced it for 2003.

A [[right hand drive]] version of the TJ was available for export markets, and was also offered for sale to U.S. rural route postal carriers. The version offered to U.S. postal carriers was only available with an automatic transmission.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

[[File:Jeep TJ in the snow.jpg|thumb|left|A modified 1998 TJ offroading in Alaska]]
In 1998 (MY1999), the fuel tank became standard at {{convert|19|U.S.gal|L impgal}} capacity. There were some changes between the 2002 and 2003 years. From 1996 to 2002, the side door mirrors were black metal framed mirrors; and from 2003 to 2006 they were plastic molded mirrors. The fit of hard and soft tops is slightly different, and the fabric and colors available changed from 2001 to 2003. In 2002 (MY2003), the 3-speed [[automatic transmission]] was replaced with a 4-speed automatic with overdrive. The overdrive can be turned off with a dash switch. The radio bezels went from a rectangle in 2002 to a rounded-edged rectangle for 2003. The sound bar inside was changed to sound pods. The interior seats also changed design, going from a rounder model to one with a distinct separation between back and headrest areas. The standard skid plate was also revised for 2003 to make room for the Rubicon's bigger NV241OR transfer case. The change from the 30/32RH to the 42RLE also gained an additional skid plate.

This version of the Wrangler is also notable for being the last production vehicle to use [[American Motors|AMC]]-related parts.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} The [[AMC Straight-4 engine]] was retired after the 2002 model year, and both the [[AMC Straight-6 engine]] and the door handles (the latter of which first appeared on AMC vehicles in the 1968 model year) were retired along with this generation in 2006. Like the YJ Wrangler, the TJ Wrangler used both the AMC passenger car door handles as well as the larger door handles off the AMC-built [[Jeep CJ]] for higher-end models.

===Wrangler Unlimited===
In April 2004 – after a hiatus of 18 years – Jeep reintroduced a {{convert|10|in|mm|adj=on}} longer wheelbase (LWB) version, virtually identical to the 103.5 in wheelbase of its [[Jeep CJ#CJ-6|Jeep CJ-6]] and [[Jeep CJ#CJ-8 (Scrambler)|CJ-8 Scrambler]] predecessors, and called it the Wrangler Unlimited.
The 2004½ Wrangler Unlimited (or LJ) was the first introduction of the Jeep Unlimited nameplate. The longer frame has one extra crossmember and overall, the Unlimited is some 15 inches longer than a standard TJ, offering 2 inches more rear-seat legroom, and 13 inches more cargo space length.&lt;ref name=4Wcom/&gt; The TJ Unlimited has nearly double the towing capacity of its shorter wheelbase sibling, partly due to the increased wheelbase (3500&amp;nbsp;lbs LJ vs 2000&amp;nbsp;lbs TJ).&lt;ref name=4Wcom&gt;[http://www.fourwheeler.com/vehicle-reviews/129-0408-2004-jeep-wrangler-unlimited/ Road Test - 2004 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited – Four Wheeler Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Standard were a [[Dana 44]] rear axle with a 3.73 gear ratio and the Command-Trac NV231 transfer case.

For the 2005 model year, Jeep released the Rubicon Unlimited, combining the same wheelbase of the standard Unlimited, but sharing the drivetrain of its shorter Rubicon sibling including such features as front and rear Dana 44 axles with the [[Rock-Trac]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; NV241 four-wheel-drive system, diamond plate rocker guards, 245/75R16 Goodyear MT/R tires, a six-speed manual or the optional 4 speed automatic transmission, as well as some minor comfort and convenience features not available on other Wrangler models.

===AIL Storm Mark II===
Starting in 2006, [[Automotive Industries|Automotive Industries Ltd.]] (AIL), an Israeli automaker and major supplier of the [[Israeli Security Forces]], began delivery of their 2nd generation of "Storm" military jeeps, manufactured under licence from Chrysler, to the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. The [[AIL Storm#Storm II|M-242 Storm Mark II]], known in the field as the "Storm Commander" was now based on the Jeep Wrangler (TJ). The new model incorporated a number of significant changes – both in regard to its predecessor, as well as compared to its Wrangler basis. Perhaps the most obvious change is the addition of dual passenger doors, making the Storm II the first five-door [[Jeep Wrangler]] derivative.&lt;ref name = "IDF"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www1.idf.il/dover/site/mainpage.asp?sl=HE&amp;id=7&amp;docid=47587.HE | script-title=he:ה"סופה" החדשה מגיעה לצה"ל | publisher = [[IDF Spokesperson's Unit]] | date = 2005-11-25 | accessdate = 2007-07-19| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070311103431/http://www1.idf.il/dover/site/mainpage.asp?sl=HE&amp;id=7&amp;docid=47587.HE| archivedate = March 11, 2007|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Jeepolog"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.jeepolog.com/178.html | script-title=he:סופה 2 במבחן שטח | author = אסף קציר| publisher = Jeepolog.com | date = 2006-01-15 | accessdate = 2008-07-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080705111453/http://jeepolog.com/178.html| archivedate= 5 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| url-status= live|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "YnetSufa2"&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.winwin.co.il/Static/Articles/Art/art_CMHVALUE3267876.htm | script-title = he:הג'יפ החדש של צה"ל: סופה 2 | author = מישל דור | publisher = [[Ynet]] | date = 2006-06-27 | accessdate = 2008-07-06 | language = he | title = Archived copy | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930134927/http://www.winwin.co.il/Static/Articles/Art/art_CMHVALUE3267876.htm | archive-date = 2007-09-30 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The AIL Storm II had a vehicle length of {{convert|4463|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, and an extended wheelbase of {{convert|2931|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} — almost the same as that of the JK Wrangler Unlimited: {{convert|116|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}.

Jeep Wrangler TJ uses a [[recirculating ball]]-type steering gear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=HlbCM7VEmroC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=wrangler+Recirculating+ball#v=onepage&amp;q=wrangler%20Recirculating%20ball&amp;f=false |title = High-Performance Jeep Wrangler TJ Builder's Guide|isbn = 9781932494266|last1 = Lee|first1 = Christian|year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2003 Model Year Update ==

For the 2003 [[model year]], the [[Jeep Wrangler]] TJ received a mid-cycle restyling. On the exterior, there were new wheel designs to choose from, as well as new exterior decals. Under the hood, a new 2.4L "Power-Tech" Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) gas engine from the [[Jeep Liberty]] KJ producing 147 horsepower and 165 lb. ft. of torque replaced the 2.5L Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) gas engine that was shared with the [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)]]. A new off-road focused '''Rubicon''' model was introduced, and offered the new [[Chrysler NSG370 transmission]] manual transmission, which would later be offered on all Wrangler TJ models equipped with the 4.0L "Power-Tech" Inline Six-Cylinder (I6) gas engine. The [[Ultradrive]] 42RLE [[automatic transmission]] became the sole [[automatic transmission]] regardless of engine choice. On the interior, a new steering wheel derived from the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee (WJ)]] was added, and interior switch gear was also revised. All audio systems were redesigned, and the standard audio system was now an A/M-F/M stereo radio with a cassette player (a single-disc CD player was also available, and a six-disc, in-dash CD changer replaced the previous remotely-mounted unit). A standard four-speaker audio system and optional seven-speaker premium audio system with a front center console-mounted [[subwoofer]] and amplifier were both available. [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] became available for the first time on the Wrangler. The seats were redesigned with new fabrics and improved comfort. The key was also redesigned with a new round head.

== 2006 Model Year ==

2006 was the final [[model year]] for the [[Jeep Wrangler]] TJ and [[Jeep Wrangler]] TJ Unlimited before being replaced by the all-new, third-generation [[Jeep Wrangler (JK)]] and [[Jeep Wrangler (JK)]] Unlimited. For 2006, two new special edition models were offered for the regular-wheelbase Wrangler TJ: a '''65TH Anniversary Edition''' and the '''Golden Eagle Edition''', both paying tribute to [[Jeep]]'s heritage (the '''Golden Eagle''' was an option package for the [[Jeep CJ-7]], and the '''65TH Anniversary Edition''' celebrated 65 years of production for the [[Jeep]] brand). The 4.0L "Power-Tech" Inline Six-Cylinder (I6) engine became standard equipment on all Wrangler TJ models, as the 2.4L "Power-Tech" Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) gas engine was dropped, and all Wrangler TJ models now featured the [[Chrysler NSG370 transmission]] (manual transmission) as standard equipment, as the five-speed manual transmission was dropped. The all-new 2007 [[Jeep Wrangler (JK)]] and first-ever [[Jeep Wrangler (JK)]] Unlimited were introduced at the 2006 [[North American International Auto Show]] (NAIAS) in [[Detroit, Michigan]] in January 2006.
