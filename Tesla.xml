Similar to how the first US-made Model 3s were delivered to employees in July 2017, the first Chinese-made Model 3 cars were delivered to employees at the end of 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tesla delivers first China-made Model 3s to its own workers |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/30/tech/tesla-china-model-3/index.html |website=CNN |date=December 30, 2019 |access-date=December 30, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191230144848/https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/30/tech/tesla-china-model-3/index.html |archive-date=December 30, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerns===
In May 2018, [[Consumer Reports]] found "big flaws, such as long stopping distances in our emergency braking test and difficult-to-use controls", finding the braking distance was worse than a Ford F-150 full-size truck, and branding the Model 3 "not recommended".  Tesla responded to the claims with concern and, over the next weekend, released an [[Over-the-air programming|OTA update]] for the anti-lock braking algorithm.  Consumer Reports, impressed with the prompt OTA update, verified the improved braking performance and changed their rating to a recommended model.&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports May 30, 2018 braking update"&gt;{{cite web |title=Tesla Model 3 Gets CR Recommendation After Braking Update |url=https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/tesla-model-3-gets-cr-recommendation-after-braking-update/ |first=Patrick |last=Olsen |work=Consumer Reports |location=US |date=May 30, 2018 |access-date=June 5, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180531211817/https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/tesla-model-3-gets-cr-recommendation-after-braking-update/ |archive-date=May 31, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wired May 30, 2018 brake fix OTA"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Marshall |first1=Aarian |title=Tesla’s Quick Fix for Its Braking System Came From the Ether |url=https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-model3-braking-software-update-consumer-reports/ |work=Wired |location=US |date=May 30, 2018 |access-date=June 5, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181019115808/https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-model3-braking-software-update-consumer-reports/ |archive-date=October 19, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2019, Consumer Reports revoked the Model 3 recommendation because "many customers have reported problems with the [car], including loose body trim and glass defects."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/21/tech/consumer-reports-tesla-model-3/index.html|title=Consumer Reports no longer recommends the Tesla Model 3|work=[[CNN Business]]|last=Isidore|first=Chris|date=February 21, 2019|accessdate=February 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190221194657/https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/21/tech/consumer-reports-tesla-model-3/index.html|archive-date=February 21, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with Model S and Model X, Model 3 production flaws were reduced over time.&lt;ref name=bloombergSurvey&gt;{{cite web |author1=Tom Randall, Dean Halford and Cedric Sam |title=The Tesla Model 3 Survey 5,000 Tesla Owners Told Us What Elon Musk Got Right and Wrong |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-tesla-model-3-survey/ |website=www.bloomberg.com |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=October 29, 2019 |access-date=October 29, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029164702/https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-tesla-model-3-survey/ |archive-date=October 29, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 2019, Consumer Reports reinstated the Model 3 recommendation, claiming it was the fifth-most reliable of twelve compact luxury cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/15/tesla-model-3-s-consumer-reports-recommended-list/|title=Tesla's Model 3 and S are (once again) recommended by 'Consumer Reports'|work=[[Engadget]]|last=Moon|first=Mariella|date=November 15, 2019|accessdate=November 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191117060147/https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/15/tesla-model-3-s-consumer-reports-recommended-list/|archive-date=November 17, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During long-term testing of a Model 3 in December 2019, ''Car and Driver'' experienced a rear [[inverter]] [[short circuit|short]] after 5,286 miles and 3 months of ownership.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30383959/tesla-model-3-repaired-after-breakdown/&lt;/ref&gt;  It was their first long-term vehicle to suffer such a major failure while parked.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30361800/tesla-model-3-long-term-failure-stranded-while-parked/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2020, due to the coronavirus outbreak, closure of the Shanghai factory at the end of January, and supply chain issues, Tesla used the 2.5 version processor instead of the 3.0 processor that Chinese users expected to find in their vehicles. This led to mass complaints. Tesla promised to upgrade the hardware free of charge once the supply chain is restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51736405|title=Tesla downgraded Chinese car tech because of virus|date=2020-03-04|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-03-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Automotive-industry analyst Toni Sacconaghi of [[AllianceBernstein]] said after driving one of the early Tesla vehicles in November 2017 that "Overall, we found the Model 3 to be a compelling offering, and believe it is likely to further galvanize the overall Electric Vehicle category." He was less impressed with build quality of the test samples. "Fit and finish on the two demo cars we saw—perhaps not surprisingly—was relatively poor." He said that there were quality issues at first with the Model X which led to some concern. "This is going to be a much, much higher-volume car, and if there are any quality issues, that could overwhelm the service centers and undermine the Tesla brand." Nonetheless, Sacconaghi was impressed with the ride quality, performance and interior space, and concluded that the 3 "risks cannibalizing the [much more expensive] Model S going forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-tesla-quality-20171114-story.html|title=Tesla's new Model 3 sedan has test drivers swooning – but quality issues lurk on the horizon|first=Michael|last=Hiltzik|date=November 14, 2017|access-date=January 5, 2018|via=LA Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105035824/http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-tesla-quality-20171114-story.html|archive-date=January 5, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Road &amp; Track]]''{{'}}s Bob Sorokanich said the "Model 3 proves that Tesla is thinking far beyond the edges of the Model S and X. Stepping out of the 3, you realize that, as far as the S and X pushed the envelope, they were always meant as intermediaries, stepping stones designed to draw people away from comfortable convention and into the future of the automobile. ... The Model 3 is Tesla at its most unabashed. It's an automaker finally willing to abandon the [[skeuomorph]]ism of a false radiator grille, the tradition of a driver-oriented gauge panel."&lt;ref name="r&amp;t20180112"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/first-drives/a15070866/tesla-model-3-test-drive-review/ |title=Tesla Model 3: The Road &amp; Track Review : Can Tesla's most affordable model kick-start the electric car revolution? |author=Bob Sorokanich |work=[[Road &amp; Track]] |date=January 12, 2018 |accessdate=January 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112234745/http://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/first-drives/a15070866/tesla-model-3-test-drive-review/ |archive-date=January 12, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tesla Model S''' is an [[electric car|all-electric]] five-door [[liftback]] sedan,  produced by [[Tesla, Inc.]], and introduced on June 22, 2012.&lt;ref name=MSlaunch/&gt; {{As of|2020|03}}, the Model S Long Range Plus has an EPA range of {{Convert|390|mi|sp=us||abbr=}}, which is higher than any other battery electric car.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tesla.com/blog/longest-range-electric-vehicle-now-goes-even-farther |title=The Longest-Range Electric Vehicle Now Goes Even Farther|date=April 23, 2019|website=www.tesla.com |access-date=April 24, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Luke John |title=New Tesla Model S Long Range REVIEW - More range, better handling but the same design |url=https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/cars/1158264/Tesla-Model-S-Long-Range-2019-review-range-uk |website=Express.co.uk |language=en |date= July 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 8, 2015, Tesla introduced the Model S 70D as its new entry-level car, with all-wheel drive and an improved range of {{convert|240|mi|abbr=out|round=5}}. The 70D replaced the 60 and 60D in the Model S lineup, with the latter two models no longer being available for purchase.

In the 85D, the rear drive unit is replaced by one with a smaller motor, while a second motor of similar size is added to the front wheels. This results in an AWD car with comparable power and acceleration to the rear wheel drive (RWD) version. Additionally, Tesla said the 85D has a 2% (5-mile) range increase and 11% increase in top speed over the 85.&lt;ref name="my.teslamotors.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://my.teslamotors.com/models/design |website=my.teslamotors.com |title=Model S Design Studio |publisher=Tesla Motors |access-date=July 7, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705065210/http://my.teslamotors.com/models/design |archive-date=July 5, 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the P85D, the high-power rear drive unit is retained, while the additional front drive motor boosts the total power by about 50%. This results in a significant increase in acceleration and top speed. Deliveries of the P85D started in December 2014, with the 85D models starting in February 2015, and the 70D models starting in April 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On April 16, 2017, Tesla removed the model 60 and 60D options, since most customers pick the larger 75-kwh battery option.

In July 2015, Tesla introduced its 70, 90, 90D and P90D variants along with a "ludicrous mode" for the performance model. The P90D combines a front axle power of {{convert|259|hp|kW}} and rear axle power of {{convert|503|hp|kW}} for a 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph time of 2.8 seconds.

Tesla described its July 2015 introduction of the 90&amp;nbsp;kWh battery as a "range upgrade" of the 85&amp;nbsp;kWh battery and explained that the 6% energy increase was due to "improved cell chemistry"&lt;ref name=autoblog20150715&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2015/07/17/tesla-announces-model-s-ludicrous-upgrade-90-kwh-battery/ |work=Autoblog |first=Sebastian |last=Blanco |title=Tesla announces Model S Ludicrous upgrade, 90-kWh battery |date=July 17, 2015 |access-date=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the introduction of [[silicon]] into the cell's graphite [[anode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://qz.com/459315/why-did-elon-musk-passed-up-a-chance-to-boast-about-a-scientific-coup/ |work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |first=Steve |last=LeVine |title=Why did Elon Musk pass up a chance to boast about a scientific coup? |date=July 21, 2015 |access-date=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla additionally announced its expectation of an annual improvement in battery capacity of about 5%. Tesla also explained that apart from the P90D the Model S has its main battery conductor protected by a [[fuse (electrical)|fuse]] rated for 1,300&amp;nbsp;A and that this rating is somewhat conservative given the uncertainty of the exact conditions under which a fuse melts. To reduce this uncertainty Tesla has for the P90D introduced [[Inconel]] battery contactors&lt;ref name=ludiInco&gt;{{cite web |url=http://electrek.co/2015/07/22/elon-musks-recent-ludicrous-announcement-hints-at-more-synergy-between-tesla-and-spacex/ |title=Elon Musk's recent "Ludicrous" announcement hints at more synergy between Tesla and SpaceX |work=Electrek |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150912040737/http://electrek.co/2015/07/22/elon-musks-recent-ludicrous-announcement-hints-at-more-synergy-between-tesla-and-spacex/ |archive-date=September 12, 2015 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an electronically controlled pyro-activated fuse, which monitors the current at the millisecond level, cuts the power with "extreme precision and certainty" and has a rating of 1,500&amp;nbsp;A.&lt;ref name=autoblog20150715/&gt;

In February 2016, the 85 kWh battery option was discontinued in countries including the US, Australia and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://evobsession.com/tesla-pulls-85-kwh-battery-option-from-us-design-studio/ |title=Tesla Pulls 85 kWh Battery Option From US Design Studio |website=evobsession.com |first= James |last=Ayre |date=February 9, 2016 |access-date=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, Tesla ceased offering the 60 kWh software-limited battery option. The lowest-capacity option became the 75 kWh, and at the same time Tesla significantly reduced the software upgrade options for facelifted 60 and 70 models to be upgraded over-the-air to 75 (and rebadged at their next visit to a Tesla service centre).

In January 2019, Tesla discontinued the 75 kWh battery option, leaving two possible configurations with the 100 kWh battery pack as the 100D and the P100D.

=== Practicality and livability ===
{{Advert section|date=December 2019}}
The Model S is notable for being designed solely with an electric powertrain in mind,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tesla history |url=https://www.tesla.com/about}}&lt;/ref&gt; unlike other vehicles where the manufacturer has simply swapped out or supplanted an internal combustion engine with an electric motor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.netcarshow.com/audi/2017-a3_sportback_e-tron/ |title=Audi A3 Sportback e-tron (2017)|access-date=September 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Perlo/&gt; As a result, the Model S is able to offer unique features such as a front trunk (a "frunk" — rear wheel drive version has bigger frunk) in addition to a spacious rear trunk (with a total cargo volume of {{convert|31.56|cuft|L|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and an enlarged front crumple zone compared to the typical combustion engine powered vehicle.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

To enhance livability, Tesla has developed a network of fast-charging [[Tesla Supercharger|'Supercharger' stations]] that allow the driver to recharge their Model S faster than from a house socket where most charging occurs.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; A Supercharger takes about 20 minutes to charge to 50%, 40 minutes to charge to 80%, and 75 minutes to 100% on the original 85 kWh Model S. Supercharger networks have expanded in Europe, across the United States, and in other countries where there is significant demand, and {{as of|2016|09|lc=y}}, the network has been established in most American states, thus making cross-country and long distance trips in an electric vehicle feasible and alleviating [[range anxiety]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Researchers from the [[University of California, Davis]] conducted a study to identify the factors influencing the decision to adopt high-end battery electric vehicles (BEV), such as the Tesla Model S, as these vehicles are remarkably different from mainstream BEVs. The 2016 study found that "environmental, performance, and technological motivations are reasons for adoption; the new technology brings a new segment of buyers into the market; and financial purchase incentives are not important in the consumer's decision to adopt a high-end BEV."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=1392633 |title=Exploring the Decision to Adopt a High-End Battery Electric Vehicle: Role of Financial and Nonfinancial Motivations |first1=Scott |last1=Hardman |first2=Gil |last2=Tal |journal=Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board |volume=2572 |issue=|pages=20–27 |location=US |year=2016 |access-date=September 17, 2016 |doi=10.3141/2572-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under its five-cycle testing protocol, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) rated the 90&amp;nbsp;kWh Model S model with a combined [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] equivalent of 104&amp;nbsp;MPGe ({{cvt|104.25|mpgus|L/100km|disp=out|2|sp=us}} or {{cvt|104.25|mpgus|mpgimp|disp=out|0|sp=us}}), with an equivalent {{cvt|102|mpgus}} in city driving and {{cvt|107|mpgus}} on highways.&lt;ref name=EPAratings&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=38524&amp;id=38569&amp;id=38525&amp;id=38640 |title=Compare Side-by-Side|work=fueleconomy.gov|publisher=[[U.

[[Fuel economy in automobiles|Vehicle energy consumption]] is [[Drag (physics)#Power|highly dependent on speed]]; the Model S can use {{cvt|14|hp|kW}} at {{cvt|70|mph|kph}}, but {{cvt|42|hp|kW}} at {{cvt|100|mph|kph}}.&lt;ref name=cd24/&gt;

=== Battery placement ===
In contrast to most earlier [[battery electric vehicle]]s including the [[Tesla Roadster (2008)|Roadster]], the battery pack of the Model S forms the floor of the vehicle between the axles, providing the vehicle with several advantages. Most notably, since the battery pack is the heaviest component of the vehicle, the Model S has a [[center of gravity]] [[Automobile handling#Center of mass height|height]] of only {{convert|18|in}}&lt;ref name=rope/&gt;&lt;ref name=sciAbuild/&gt; (about the same as a [[Lotus Elise]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://willmartin.com/suspension/ |title=Suspension |date=February 4, 2014 |access-date=June 5, 2016 |quote=The Lotus Elise has a kinematic roll center height of 30mm above the ground and a center of gravity height of 470mm. The Lotus Elise RCH is 6% the height of the CG, meaning 6% of lateral force is transferred through the suspension arms and 94% is transferred through the springs and dampers. |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160625121424/http://willmartin.com/suspension/ |archive-date=June 25, 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; helping it to achieve a [[Formula One car#Lateral acceleration|lateral acceleration]] of 0.9 g&lt;!--cornering speed--&gt;&lt;ref name=youtube_RWQ_dnpplaA&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWQ-dnpplaA 2015 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat vs. 2015 Tesla Model S P85D! - Head 2 Head Ep. 65] at 14m.

Tesla credits the sedan's battery pack for that, which gives the Model S a very low center of gravity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gcsafe/&gt; Secondly, the absence of a heavy engine between the front or rear axle allows the bulk of the [[Mass distribution|mass to be centralized]] between the axles, lowering [[rotational inertia]] allowing it to turn more quickly for its weight. Thirdly, the placement of the battery pack increases the [[Anti-intrusion bar|rigidity of the passenger compartment]], improving the [[Automobile safety#Active and passive safety|passive safety]] of the vehicle. Fourth, placing the battery pack under the vehicle makes it possible to remove or replace the entire unit in 90 seconds for maintenance.

The Model S comes equipped with a different charger and connector in North American versus other markets, derived from differences in the local electric grid systems.

==== North America ====
The standard North American onboard charger accepts single phase 120 or 240 volt sources at a rate of up to {{nowrap|10 kW}}. Included adapters allow the car to charge from a standard 120 volt outlet, a 240 volt NEMA 14-50 outlet, a 208 volt leg to leg of a 208Y/120&amp;nbsp;V 3-phase configuration, a 277 volt leg to neutral of a 480Y/277&amp;nbsp;V 3-phase configuration and [[SAE J1772]] public chargers. An optional upgrade for a second {{nowrap|10 kW}} onboard charger supports a total of up to {{nowrap|20 kW}} charging from an {{nowrap|80 amp}} available Tesla Wall Connector.&lt;ref name="MT20120622" /&gt; The North American connector uses a proprietary Tesla design.

Charging times vary depending on the battery pack's state-of-charge, its overall capacity, the available voltage, and the available [[circuit breaker]] amperage. From a 120 volt/15 amp household outlet, the range increases by {{convert|3.75|mi|0}} for every hour of charging. From a {{nowrap|10 kW}}, [[AC power plugs and sockets#NEMA 14-50|NEMA 14–50]] 240 V/50 A outlet (like those used by [[RVs]] or standard cooking ranges), the charge rate is {{convert|28.75|mi|0}} per hour. Using Tesla's {{nowrap|20 kW}}, {{nowrap|240 V}} High Power Wall Connector increases the rate to {{convert|57|mi|0}} per hour if the car is configured with dual chargers ({{nowrap|20 kW}}).&lt;ref name="TMCharging"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teslamotors.com/models/charging#/highpower|title=Charge your Model S – Adapter Guide, High Power Charging, and Supercharge|publisher=Tesla Motors|access-date=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Europe/Asia-Pacific ====

The standard European charger accepts single phase {{nowrap|230 V}} at up to {{nowrap|7.6 KW}}, three phase {{nowrap|230 V}} ({{nowrap|400 V}}) at up to {{nowrap|11 KW}}. The [[Type 2 connector]] on the car directly accepts "Mennekes" [[IEC 62196]] charging from public stations at up to 400&amp;nbsp;V, and included adapters allow the car to charge from standard continental European outlets and [[IEC 60309]] 230 volt (blue 3-pin) or 400 volt (red 5-pin) outlets, depending on region. The addition of a second charger supports charging at up to 22&amp;nbsp;kW (up to 16.5&amp;nbsp;kW with new charger for 3 phase 400 V 24 A on new front fascia Model S), providing up to {{cvt|110|km||0|order=flip}} ({{cvt|80|km|order=flip}} on new front fascia Model S) of range per hour of charge.

=== Suspension ===
The Model S originally had [[Independent suspension|independent]] [[coil spring]] suspension on all four wheels{{snd}} front [[Double wishbone suspension|double wishbone]], virtual steer axis [[control arm]] and rear independent [[Multi-link suspension|multilink]].&lt;ref name=model_s_specs/&gt; The car comes with [[Self-leveling suspension|self-leveling]], [[height adjustable suspension|height-adjustable]] [[air suspension]], which was originally an extra cost option. This is accomplished via adjustable Bilstein shock absorbers controlled by the driver. The car lowers itself at highway speeds and can be set to a higher level to traverse steep driveways and rough terrain, mitigating the default low {{convert|6|in}} [[ground clearance]] and relatively long {{convert|116|in}} wheelbase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edmunds.com/car-reviews/track-tests/2012-tesla-model-s-signature-performance-suspension-walkaround.html |title=2012 Tesla Model S Signature Performance Suspension Walkaround |publisher=Edmunds.com |first=Dan |last=Edmunds |date=September 26, 2012 |access-date=March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The suspension system has been changed retroactively on several occasions in "over-the-air" software updates. During the 2013 'fire investigation', [[NHTSA]] asked Tesla to disable the car's ability to lower itself at speed on the theory that ground clearance below {{convert|6|in}} might cause the batteries underneath the car to contact road debris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20140328/OEM11/140329874/nhtsa-closes-tesla-fire-inquiry-as-model-s-gets-new-battery-shield |title=NHTSA closes Tesla fire inquiry as Model S gets new battery shield |work=[[Automotive News]] |first=Gabe |last=Nelson |date=March 28, 2014 |access-date=March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, Tesla upgraded the [[Height adjustable suspension|height adjustment feature]] for Model S cars equipped with air suspension to remember locations where the driver has requested higher clearance and automatically apply the setting each time the car enters the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fortune.com/2014/09/19/tesla-model-s-suspension-upgrade/ |title=Potholes and Tesla's Model S: Never the twain shall meet |first=Kirsten |last=Korosec |work=[[Fortunes]] |date=September 19, 2014 |access-date=March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autopilot-enabled cars receive software wirelessly, the same as other car software updates.

According to Elon Musk, the Model S was designed to be a computer on wheels: "We really designed the Model S to be a very sophisticated computer on wheels. Tesla is a software company as much as it is a hardware company. A huge part of what Tesla is, is a Silicon Valley software company.

==== Fatal accident ====
&lt;!--Please feel free to improve and expand this section, but keep in mind Wikipedia policies to reflect NPOV and encyclopedic facts, not anecdotal, and it is advisable to wait for the finding of the NHTSA and NTSB investigations.--&gt;

The first known fatal accident involving a Model S when Autopilot was active occurred in [[Williston, Florida]] on May 7, 2016. In June 2016, the U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) opened a formal investigation into the accident, working with the [[Florida Highway Patrol]]. According to the NHTSA, preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when a tractor-trailer made a left turn in front of the Tesla at an intersection on a non-controlled access highway, and the car failed to apply the brakes.&lt;ref name=AutopilotCrash01&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/30/tesla-autopilot-death-self-driving-car-elon-musk |title=Tesla driver dies in first fatal crash while using autopilot mode |first1=Danny |last1=Yadron |first2=Dan |last2=Tynan |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=[[San Francisco]] |date=July 1, 2016 |access-date=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AutopilotCrash02&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/business/self-driving-tesla-fatal-crash-investigation.html |title=Self-Driving Tesla Involved in Fatal Crash |first1=Bill |last1=Vlasic |first2=Neal E. |last2=Boudette |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 30, 2016 |access-date=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AutopilotCrash03&gt;{{cite news|title=Highway patrol found DVD player in wreckage of fatal Tesla accident|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/01/truck-driver-involved-with-fatal-tesla-accident-says-driver-was-watching-a-movie.html|first=David Paul|last=Morris|publisher=[[CNBC]]|agency=Associated Press|date=July 1, 2016|access-date=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NHTSA's preliminary evaluation was opened to examine the design and performance of any automated driving systems in use at the time of the crash, which involves a population of an estimated 25,000 Model S cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/cs/jaxrs/download/doc/UCM530776/INOA-PE16007-7080.PDF |title=ODI Resume - Investigation: PE 16-007 |publisher=Office of Defects Investigations, [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) |location=U.S. |date=June 28, 2016 |access-date=July 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tesla, "neither autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied." The car attempted to drive full speed under the trailer, "with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the Model S." Tesla also stated that this was Tesla's first known Autopilot-related death in over 130 million miles (208 million km) driven by its customers while Autopilot was activated. According to Tesla there is a fatality every 94 million miles (150 million km) among all type of vehicles in the U.S.&lt;ref name=AutopilotCrash01/&gt;&lt;ref name=AutopilotCrash02/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.teslamotors.com/blog/tragic-loss |title=A Tragic Loss |publisher=[[Tesla Motors]] |date=June 30, 2016 |access-date=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, the NTSB report concluded Tesla was not at fault since the driver in the crash had seven seconds to see the truck and take action; the investigation revealed that the Tesla car crash rate dropped by 40 percent after autopilot was installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/19/14323990/tesla-autopilot-fatal-accident-nhtsa-investigation-ends |title=Fatal Tesla Autopilot accident investigation ends with no recall ordered|date=January 19, 2017 |access-date=January 19, 2017 |website=[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2016/INCLA-PE16007-7876.PDF |title=PE 16-007.

=== Instrument panel ===
[[File:Tesla Model S digital panels.jpg|thumb|Production dashboard with {{convert|12.3|in|adj=on}} main dashboard digital display (left) and central {{convert|17|in|adj=on}} [[touchscreen]] control panel (right)]]

As there are no buttons or dials, the instrument panel is a {{convert|12.3|in|adj=on}} [[liquid-crystal display]] [[electronic instrument cluster]] that indicates speed, power usage, charge level, estimated range and active gear, as well as navigation directions (driven by [[Garmin]]). The gear selector can be set to ''drive'', ''neutral'', ''reverse'', and ''park''. The [[infotainment]] control [[touchscreen]] is a {{convert|17|in|adj=on}} [[multi-touch]] panel divided into four areas. A top line displays status symbols and provides shortcuts to Charging, [[HomeLink]], Driver Profiles, vehicle information (software version and the [[vehicle identification number]]) and [[Bluetooth]]. The second line provides access to several apps including Media, Nav (driven by [[Google Maps]], and thus is separate from the navigation on instrument panel), Energy, Web, Camera and Phone. The central main viewing area displays the (two) active apps, subdivided into upper and lower areas. (Most apps can be expanded to take up the entire area). At the bottom is access to various controls and settings for the vehicle such as doors, locks and lights as well as temperature controls and a secondary volume control.

The instrument cluster and the infotainment panel are driven by separate [[Nvidia]] [[Tegra 3]] [[3D computer graphics|3D Visual Computing]] Modules until mid 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=NVIDIA Powers Digital Dashboard in New Tesla Motors Electric Sedan |url=http://nvidianews.nvidia.com/Releases/NVIDIA-Powers-Digital-Dashboard-in-New-Tesla-Motors-Electric-Sedan-816.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625192927/http://nvidianews.nvidia.com/Releases/NVIDIA-Powers-Digital-Dashboard-in-New-Tesla-Motors-Electric-Sedan-816.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 25, 2012 |publisher=NVidia |date=June 21, 2012 |access-date=January 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://recode.net/2014/10/14/whats-inside-the-tesla-model-s-dashboard/ |title=What's Inside the Tesla Model S Dashboard |first=Arik |last=Hesseldahl |work=Re/code}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla was the first company to ship this technology. The Tegra [[system on a chip]] (SoC) integrates eight specialized processors, including a [[multi-core]] [[ARM architecture|ARM]] [[CPU]], a [[GPU]], and dedicated audio, video and image processors. Nvidia claimed that it consumes 2% of the energy of a typical CPU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Visual Computing Module |url=http://www.nvidia.com/object/visual-computing-module.html |publisher=NVIDIA |access-date=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The navigation system uses [[GPS]] and a mix of Garmin and Google Maps route guidance. The map display on the {{convert|17|in}} screen requires a constant Internet connection, so navigation is limited in areas without mobile network coverage. The Nav on the instrument panel is loaded on the car and does not need Internet access to function. Update 6.2 features automatic navigation guidance to charging stations if range is insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tu.no/industri/2015/03/19/slik-vil-tesla-gjore-slutt-pa-rekkeviddeangsten |title=Tesla Model S – Slik vil Tesla gjøre slutt på rekkeviddeangsten |trans-title=Tesla Model S – How will end the Tesla range anxiety |last=Olsen |first=Stein Jarle |work=[[Teknisk Ukeblad]] |language=Norwegian |date=March 19, 2015 |access-date=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enthusiasts have developed the Open Vehicle Monitoring System ([[OVMS]]) which allows the owner to remotely observe a variety of different vehicle operating parameters, such as battery state of charge, typically using a [[smartphone]]. Some switchgear used are Mercedes parts, such as window switches, cruise control lever, and drive selector.

According to Elon Musk, the Model S runs on the open-source [[Linux]] [[operating system]].&lt;ref name=2015shareholdermeeting&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.teslamotors.com/2015shareholdermeeting |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428052441/http://www.teslamotors.com/2015shareholdermeeting |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 28, 2015 |title=2015 Annual Shareholder Meeting |publisher=Tesla Motors }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Autoblog reported that Tesla Models S owners had determined via the car's combined [[On-board diagnostics|diagnostics]] and [[Ethernet]] port that a [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] system controlling the central touchscreen is connected to the car's internal Ethernet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2014/04/12/tesla-model-s-owners-hack-their-cars-find-ubuntu/ |work=Autoblog |title=Tesla Model S owners hack their cars, find Ubuntu |date=April 12, 2014 |access-date=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same users determined that another Ubuntu system controlling the dashboard/navigation screen also is connected to the internal network, together with a third computer of unknown type with an unknown function.

&lt;!-- Child's face intentionally blurred out. Please discuss on talk page before restoring original pic. --&gt;

All versions of the Model S have the same body and normally seat five passengers. A four passenger version with executive rear seats was an option briefly in 2015 in the United States; other locations may still offer this option. An optional folding third row (discontinued in November 2018) becomes a rear-facing two-place child seat with a [[five-point harness]].&lt;ref name=sciAbuild&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-tesla-motors-builds-the-safest-car-video/ |title=How Tesla Motors Builds One of the World's Safest Cars [Video] |first=David |last=Biello |magazine=[[Scientific American]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gcsafe&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1086352_tesla-models-s-gets-highest-safety-test-score-ever-awarded-by-nhtsa |title=Tesla Models S Gets Highest Safety-Test Score Ever Awarded By NHTSA |first=Antony |last=Ingram |website=Green Car Reports}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' said that the 7-passenger capacity afforded by this option is larger than any other electric vehicle, though not really the same as a full-size SUV that seats 7 adults.&lt;ref name=Shenhar2013/&gt; The two extra seats are only for children over {{cvt|37|in}} tall and weighing between {{cvt|35|to|77|lb}}, which the magazine described as "a narrow size range.

Cargo space is available under the front hood, which Tesla calls the "frunk". In October 2014, the upgraded Model S 85D ("D" for dual motor) was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.inc.com/associated-press/tesla-adds-all-wheel-drive-safety-features.html |title=Elon Musk Reveals the Car of the Future, and It Is Glorious |agency=[[Associated Press]] |magazine=Inc.com |date=October 10, 2014 |access-date=March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upgraded version has two electric motors, one driving the rear wheels as in prior versions, and one driving the front wheels. The dual motor version was available for both the performance and non-performance version. The rear wheel drive version of the P85 was removed, and the dual motor option is not available for the 60&amp;nbsp;kWh version.&lt;ref name="David Noland"/&gt;

The 2015 model year update introduced [[electromechanical brake]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/news/a6358/first-look-tesla-model-s-p85d-dual-motor/ |title=Tesla Model S P85D: Dual motors, AWD, 691 hp, 3.2 to 60 |first=Chris |last=Cantle |magazine=[[Road &amp; Track]] |access-date=April 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the 85&amp;nbsp;kWh and later 90&amp;nbsp;kWh battery was discontinued from all markets. A glass roof with no horizontal roof bar between the [[Pillar (car)|B-pillars]] was introduced in late 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://electrek.co/2016/11/04/tesla-adds-new-glass-roof-model-s-option-discontinues-p90d/ |title=Tesla adds new "Glass Roof" Model S option; discontinues P90D |first= Jameson |last=Dow |date=November 4, 2016 |website=Electrek |access-date=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before adding an all-glass roof option for the Model S, possible roof options were: body colored roof, a black painted roof, or the panoramic sunroof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designboom.com/technology/tesla-model-s-now-in-production/|title=Tesla Model S now in production|date=June 27, 2012 |work=DesignBoom |access-date=June 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vehicle warranty and maintenance ===
The Model S is covered by a 4-year, {{cvt|50000|mile|}} limited warranty,&lt;ref name=teslaspecs&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.teslamotors.com/models/specs |title=Tesla Model S Specs and Standard Features}}&lt;/ref&gt; that includes all standard equipment, the transmission and the complete powertrain (excluding tires).&lt;ref name=teslaservice&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teslamotors.com/service |title=Tesla Service |publisher=Tesla Motors |access-date=December 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warranty can be extended an additional 4 years or {{Convert|50000|mi}} beyond the original terms.&lt;ref name="teslaservice"/&gt; Warranty coverage includes a complementary loaner car—a Performance 85 or Tesla Roadster—when service is required.&lt;ref name=teslablog&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/creating-world%E2%80%99s-best-service-and-warranty-program-0 |title=Tesla Blo – Creating the World's Best Service and Warranty Program |publisher=Tesla Motors |date=April 26, 2013 |first=Elon |last=Musk |access-date=December 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, Tesla announced that a previously mandatory annual vehicle inspection and maintenance fee would be made optional, and would not be required to maintain warranty coverage.&lt;ref name=teslablog/&gt; If chosen, the fee covers a complete inspection, tire alignment, new brake pads, hardware upgrades and miscellaneous other maintenance items as needed. In California alone, Tesla offers their own insurance, as the computer in the car can tell if you drive the car safely, then Tesla will make an evaluation and give you a more custom tailored, and quite likely cheaper insurance package.

The battery and drive unit are covered for eight years or 125,000 miles (200,000&amp;nbsp;km in metric countries) for the 60&amp;nbsp;kWh base model, or eight years and unlimited distance for all 70 and 85&amp;nbsp;kWh models.&lt;ref name=TMOptions/&gt;&lt;ref name=NAwarranty&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teslamotors.com/sites/default/files/blog_attachments/model_s_new_vehicle_limited_warranty_2.1.pdf |title=Model S new vehicle limited warranty for North America |page=3 |publisher=Tesla |year=2015 |access-date=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unconditional battery warranty covers everything except deliberate damage, even including user error.&lt;ref name=CNNmoney&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/04/26/autos/tesla-service-gaurantee |title=Tesla offers idiot-proof battery warranty |first=Peter |last=Valdes-Dapena |date=April 26, 2013 |publisher=CNN |access-date=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, loss of battery capacity over time or usage is not covered under warranty.{{clarify|date=March 2015|reason=how does it differ from warranty – percentage of allowable degradation?}}&lt;!--support centre said via phone that a limit has not been established, but should be reasonable, and that a certain Roadster had lost 5% in 6 years--&gt;&lt;ref name=NAwarranty/&gt;&lt;ref name=QuickGuide&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/blog_attachments/modelsownersguide_0.pdf |title=Model S Quick Guide |publisher=Tesla |year=2013 |access-date=April 1, 2014 }}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, the Automotive Science Group (ASG) published the result of a study conducted to [[Life-cycle assessment|assess the life-cycle]] of over 1,300 automobiles across nine categories sold in North America. The study ranked the Model S as the best environmental performer in the 2014 [[full-size car]]s category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insideevs.com/nissan-leaf-has-smallest-lifecycle-footprint-of-any-2014-automobile-sold-today-in-north-america/ |title=Nissan LEAF Has Smallest Lifecycle Footprint of Any 2014 Model Year Automobile Sold in North America |first=Eric |last=Loveday |publisher=Inside EVs |date=February 11, 2014 |access-date=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the assessment of life-cycle environmental footprint, the study concluded that the increased environmental impacts of manufacturing the vehicle are more than offset with increased environmental performance during operation. For the assessment, the study used the average electricity mix of the U.S. grid in 2014. The [[Nissan Leaf]] had the smallest life-cycle environmental footprint of any model year 2014 automobile available in the North American market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.automotivescience.com/blogs/news/75574661-data-driven-assessment-provides-missing-link-in-car-buying-experience |title=Life-cycle Assessment of 1,300 Models Reveals Best of 2014|date=February 4, 2014 |publisher=Automotive Science Group (ASG) |access-date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Automotive Service Group is an advertising-supported website and marketing consulting company founded by a Seattle couple in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/How-green-is-that-product-Seattle-startup-lets-891369.php |newspaper=[[Seattle P-I]] |date=October 28, 2009 |title=How green is that product?

In 2012, a study by the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] found that an electric vehicle in the United States with similar efficiency to the Model S is responsible for the production of the same amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a gasoline-powered car that gets 34 to 115 MPG, depending on the source of electricity in the region in which the car is being charged. The study estimated that nearly half of Americans lived in regions where an electric vehicle would result in less emissions than a 50 MPG hybrid vehicle.&lt;ref name=UCS2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/clean_vehicles/electric-car-global-warming-emissions-report.pdf |title=State of Charge: Electric Vehicles' Global Warming Emissions and Fuel-Cost Savings across the United States|publisher=[[Union of Concerned Scientists]] (UCS)|last1= Anair |first1=Don |last2=Mahmassani|first2=Amine|date=June 2012|access-date=June 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study by Union of Concerned Scientists found that in the US regions where the Model S is popular, the 68% higher manufacturing emissions are offset within a few years of average driving.

[[File:Автомобиль Tesla (Яндекс.Такси) в процессе зарядки.jpg|thumb|Taxi Model S, charging in [[Moscow]]]]

=== Home charging ===
Tesla recommends that the primary method of charging be overnight charging at home, "just like your mobile phone". Tesla Model S vehicles come with the Mobile Connector, which allows charging at up to 72 amps&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://insideevs.com/news/330194/should-you-go-with-a-48-amp-or-a-72-amp-charger-for-your-next-tesla/|title=Should you go with a 48 amp or a 72 amp Charger for your next Tesla?|last=Tesla|website=InsideEVs|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and includes adapters for connecting to a variety of electricity sources.&lt;ref name=homecharging&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tesla.com/support/home-charging-installation|title=Home charging installation|work=Tesla.com|publisher=Tesla Motors|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, adapters for 120 volt [[NEMA 5-15]] and 240 volt [[NEMA 14-50]] outlets, as well as an adapter for [[SAE J1772]] charging stations, are included.&lt;ref name=homecharging /&gt; In Europe, adapters for [[IEC 60309#Red 3P+N+E, 6h|CEE red 3P+N+E]], [[IEC 60309#Common plugs|CEE blue 2P+E]], [[AC power plugs and sockets#CEE 7 standards|CEE 7]], and [[BS 1363]] are available (inclusion varies by country), and an adapter cable for connecting to chargers with a [[Type 2 connector]] is also included.&lt;ref name=ukcharging&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/support/home-charging-installation|title=Home charging installation|work=Tesla UK|publisher=Tesla Motors|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=decharging&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tesla.com/de_DE/support/home-charging-installation|title=Installation der Lademöglichkeiten zu Hause|language=German|trans-title=Home charging installationwork=Tesla Deutschland|publisher=Tesla Motors|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tesla Wall Connector is available for installation at a home or business, and it allows charging at up to 19.2&amp;nbsp;kW in North America and 22&amp;nbsp;kW in Europe (although charging the vehicle at 11.5&amp;nbsp;kW requires the High Amperage Charger option on the vehicle).&lt;ref name=homecharging /&gt;&lt;ref name=ukcharging /&gt;

=== Destination charging ===
The Tesla Destination charging network is a network of businesses that have installed Tesla Wall Connectors. These units are provided to the businesses by Tesla for free or at a heavily discounted price, although the business is responsible for the cost of electricity.As of {{As of|2019|9}}, Tesla has also distributed 23,963 destination chargers to locations worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Tesla Supercharger|date=2020-03-30|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tesla_Supercharger&amp;oldid=948079516|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all destination chargers are available to the public, as some businesses limit them to customers, employees, or residents only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cleantechnica.com/2016/04/29/tesla-makes-full-court-press-destination-charging/|title=Tesla Makes Full-Court Press With Destination Charging|first=Kyle|last=Field|work=Clean Technica|publisher=Sustainable Enterprises Media|date=April 29, 2016 |access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tesla vehicles are also able to utilize public charging stations using the SAE J1772, Type 2, and [[CHAdeMO]] charging standards via adapters.&lt;ref name=homecharging /&gt;&lt;ref name=ukcharging /&gt; SAE J1772 and Type 2 adapters are included in the appropriate regions, while the CHAdeMO adapter is available for purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://shop.teslamotors.com/products/chademo-adapter| title=Tesla CHAdeMO Adapter |work=Tesla Gear |publisher=Tesla Motors, Inc. |access-date=June 4, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407233600/https://shop.teslamotors.com/products/chademo-adapter |archive-date=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tesla Superchargers ===
[[File:Tesla Model S at a Supercharger station.jpeg|thumb|Tesla Model S charging at the Supercharger network station in [[Harris Ranch|Harris Ranch, California]], United States]]
{{Main|Tesla Supercharger}}

In 2012, Tesla began building a network of 480-volt [[charging station]]s, called [[Tesla Supercharger]]s, to facilitate long-distance travel. The Tesla network is currently usable only by Tesla vehicles, which are engineered for compatibility.  Supercharging hardware is a standard on almost all vehicles sold by Tesla.&lt;ref name="TMOptions" /&gt; &lt;ref name="GCC092512"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2012/09/tesla-20120925.html|title=Tesla launches first six Supercharger locations; 100 kW charging, with 120&amp;nbsp;kW in future|date=September 25, 2012|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|access-date=December 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HC121012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hybridcars.com/tesla-superchargers-open-october-19-53925/|title=First Tesla Superchargers Open October 19|last=Cobb|first=Jeff|date=October 12, 2012|publisher=HybridCars.com|access-date=December 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT122112"&gt;{{cite news|last=Motavalli|first=Jim|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/21/tesla-begins-east-cost-fast-charging-corridor/?ref=automobiles|title=Tesla Begins East Coast Fast-Charging Corridor|date=December 21, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=December 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supercharger is a proprietary DC rapid-charging station that provides up to 250&amp;nbsp;kW of power, providing up to 15 miles per minute (depending on circumstances).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Tesla Supercharger|date=2020-03-30|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tesla_Supercharger&amp;oldid=948079516|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

{{As of|2020|March}}, Tesla operates 16,103 superchargers in 1,826 stations worldwide; these include 908 stations in the U.S., 98 in Canada, 16 in Mexico, 520 in Europe, and 398 in the Asia/Pacific region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://supercharge.info/charts|title=supercharge.info|website=supercharge.info|access-date=2020-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Battery swapping ===
Tesla designed the Model S to allow fast battery swapping, which also facilitates vehicle assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://green.autoblog.com/2009/09/27/report-tesla-model-s-being-designed-with-battery-swaps-in-mind/ |title=Report: Tesla Model S was designed with battery swaps in mind |first=Sebastian |last=Blanco |publisher=Autoblog Green |date=September 27, 2009 |access-date=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a demonstration Tesla showed a battery swap operation taking around 90 seconds, about half the time it takes to refill an empty fuel tank.&lt;ref name=Swapping01&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/markrogowsky/2013/06/21/tesla-90-second-battery-swap-tech-coming-this-year/ |title=Tesla 90-Second Battery Swap Tech Coming This Year |first=Mark |last=Rogowsky |work=[[Forbes]] |date=June 21, 2013 |access-date=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Swapping02&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2013/06/model2-20130621.html |title=Tesla Motors demonstrates battery swap in the Model S |work=[[Green Car Congress]] |date=June 21, 2013 |access-date=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, Tesla announced plans to deploy [[Tesla Supercharger#battery swapping|Tesla stations]], with facilities to support battery pack swaps, although by June 2015 Tesla said that it was unlikely that more battery swap stations would be added.&lt;ref name=unlikelyswap&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/car-technology/news/a25872/elon-musk-tesla-battery-swap/ |title=Musk: Tesla "unlikely" to pursue battery swapping stations |first=Robert |last=Sorokanich |work=Road &amp; Track}}&lt;/ref&gt; Battery swapping was planned to be deployed along [[Interstate 5 in California]] between San Francisco to Los Angeles, followed by the Washington, D.C. to Boston corridor. Each swapping station costs {{USD|500000}} and stocks about 50 batteries.&lt;ref name=Swapping01/&gt; Owners can pick up their original battery pack fully charged on the return trip, which is included in the swap fee.

However, in July 2017, the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS) found that during front crash tests, the Model S safety belts let the driver's torso move too far forward, resulting in the head striking the steering wheel hard through the airbag. This problem was already pointed out in one of the IIHS's earliers tests, to which Tesla responded they would improve their safety belt design, which, according to the IIHS's latest tests, has not been done. The IIHS also gave the Model S the worst possible rating for its headlights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/news/desktopnews/near-miss-two-all-electric-cars-fall-short-of-earning-an-iihs-safety-award|title=Two electric cars miss IIHS awards|last=|first=|date=February 1, 2017|work=IIHS|access-date=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report caused Tesla to lose 6.4% of its stock value.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-no-longer-biggest-us-car-company-by-market-cap-as-stock-plunges-after-safety-distinction-eludes-model-s-2017-07-06|title=Tesla no longer biggest U.S. car company by market cap as stock plunges briefly into bear-market territory|last=Kilgore|first=Tomi|date=July 6, 2017|work=MarketWatch|access-date=July 6, 2017|last2=Assis|first2=Claudia|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first widely reported Model S fire occurred several minutes after the vehicle hit metal debris on the [[Washington State Route 167]] highway in [[Kent, Washington]] on October 1, 2013.&lt;ref name=ModelSfire01/&gt; The driver "was able to exit the highway as instructed by the onboard alert system, bring the car to a stop and depart the vehicle without injury".&lt;ref name=ModelSfire03&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/10/04/elon-musk-explains-how-model-s-caught-on-fire/ |title=Musk Explains Why Tesla Model S Caught on Fire |author=Steven Russolillo |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=October 4, 2013 |access-date=October 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then contacted authorities and, while awaiting their arrival, smoke began coming out the front of the vehicle.

The module was evidently punctured by a "curved section" that fell off a truck and was recovered near the accident. Tesla stated that the debris punched a {{convert|3|in|adj=on}} diameter hole through the {{convert|.25|in|adj=on}} armor plate under the vehicle, applying force of some 25 [[ton]]s. Built-in vents directed the flames away from the vehicle so that the fire did not enter the passenger compartment. According to Tesla, the firefighters followed standard procedure; using large amounts of water to extinguish the fire was correct,&lt;ref name="Model S First Responder Guide"&gt;{{cite book |title=2012–2013 Model S Emergency Response Guide |date=2013 |publisher=Tesla Motors |page=18 |url=http://www.teslamotors.com/sites/default/files/downloads/en_EU/emergency_response_guide.pdf#page=20 |access-date=October 23, 2014 |quote=If the high voltage battery becomes involved in fire or is bent, twisted, damaged, or breached in any way, or if you suspect that the battery is heating, use large amounts of water to cool the battery.

On October 24, 2013, the U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) announced, "After reviewing all available data, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not found evidence at this time that would indicate the recent battery fire involving a Tesla Model S was the result of a vehicle safety defect or noncompliance with federal safety standards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20131024/AUTO01/310240137/1121/auto0102/U.S.-will-not-open-investigation-into-Tesla-fire |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191027/http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20131024/AUTO01/310240137/1121/auto0102/U.S.-will-not-open-investigation-into-Tesla-fire |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 29, 2013 |title=U.S. will not open investigation into Tesla fire |author=David Shepardson |newspaper=[[The Detroit News]] |date=October 24, 2013 |access-date=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the following month, the NHTSA opened a preliminary evaluation to determine "the potential risks associated with undercarriage strikes on model year 2013 Tesla Model S vehicles".&lt;ref name=NYT11192013&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/business/us-safety-agency-opens-inquiry-into-tesla-fires.html?ref=automobiles&amp;_r=0 |title=After 3 Fires, Safety Agency Opens Inquiry into Tesla Model S |author=Bill Vlasic and Jaclyn Trop |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 19, 2013 |access-date=November 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insideevs.com/nhtsa-opens-formal-investigation-into-13108-2013-tesla-model-s-sedans-sold-in-us/ |title=NHTSA Opens Formal Investigation into 13,108 Model Year 2013 Tesla Model S Sedans Sold in US (Update) |author=Eric Loveday |publisher=InsideEVs.com |date=November 19, 2013 |access-date=November 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 28, 2014, NHTSA closed its investigation, claiming that the new titanium underbody shield and aluminum deflector plates, along with increased ground clearance, "should reduce both the frequency of underbody strikes and the resultant fire risk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/29/business/safety-agency-ends-investigation-of-tesla-fires.html?ref=automobiles&amp;_r=0 |title=Federal Safety Agency Ends Its Investigation of Tesla Fires |author=Danielle Ivory |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 28, 2014 |access-date=March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distance records ===
A distance record of {{cvt|670|mi}} in a P100D was set on August 5, 2017 by Italian drivers, making the Model S the first production electric car to exceed {{cvt|1000|km|order=flip}} on a single charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/6/16104628/tesla-drivers-italy-distance-record-model-s |title=Italian Tesla drivers set distance record after driving Model S 670 miles on a single charge |first=Andrew |last=Liptak |work=The Verge |date=August 6, 2017 |access-date=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously the record of {{convert|560|mi|abbr=out|+1}} in a P100D was set on June 20, 2017 by Belgian drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-model-s-sets-new-hypermiling-record-560-miles-2017-6|title=Two Tesla fanatics just drove a Model S for a record 560 miles on a single charge -- here's how |first=Danielle |last=Muoio |work=Business Insider |location=Australia |date=June 22, 2017 |access-date=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that the distance record was {{convert|452.8|mi|abbr=out|+1}} in a Model S.

===Lap records===

== Controversies ==
=== Range limitation ===
On February 8, 2013, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a review by John M. Broder about a trip between Washington, D.C., and Boston using Tesla's Supercharger network. At the time it included only two stations on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. Broder made a variety of critical claims about the battery's performance in cold weather and the distance between charging stations. The trip ended with the Model S carried by a [[flatbed truck]] to the [[Milford, Connecticut]], station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Broder |first=John |title=Stalled Out on Tesla's Electric Highway |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/automobiles/stalled-on-the-ev-highway.html?ref=automobiles&amp;_r=0 |access-date=February 16, 2013 |date=February 10, 2013 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tesla responded by publishing logs of the vehicle's charge levels and driving speed that contradicted Broder's account on several factual details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Musk |first=Elon |title=A Most Peculiar Test Drive |url=http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/most-peculiar-test-drive |date=February 13, 2013 |access-date=February 16, 2013 |publisher=Tesla Motors}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla implied that Broder's behavior forced the car to fail. Broder replied to the criticism in a blog post and suggested that the speed discrepancies may have been because the car had been equipped with [[Dub (wheel)|19-inch wheels rather than the specified 21-inch wheels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Broder |first=John |title=That Tesla Data: What It Says and What It Doesn't |url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/that-tesla-data-what-it-says-and-what-it-doesnt/ |access-date=February 16, 2013 |date=February 14, 2013 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the midst of the controversy, a [[CNN]] reporter recreated Broder's trip without exhausting the battery. However, two key differences distinguished the two journeys. The weather was about {{cvt|10|F-change|0}} warmer and CNN did the trip in one day; the ''Times'' let the car sit overnight without being plugged in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/02/15/autos/tesla-model-s/index.html |title=Test drive: DC to Boston in a Tesla Model S |author=Peter Valdes-Dapena |work=[[CNN]] Money |date=February 15, 2013 |access-date=February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reporter from [[CNBC]] also recreated the trip in one day without incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/100464893/page/1 |title=Behind the Wheel, Putting the Tesla to the Test |author=Philip LeBeau |publisher=[[CNBC]] |date=February 19, 2013 |access-date=February 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One week later, a group of Tesla owners recreated Broder's trip without problems. One owner was delayed because his car failed to charge and required two [[firmware]] updates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1082401_tesla-model-s-road-trip-electric-cars-make-it-from-dc-to-ct |title=Tesla Model S Road Trip: Electric Cars Make It From DC To CT |author=Elvia Thompson |publisher=Green Car Reports |date=February 18, 2013 |access-date=February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://green.autoblog.com/2013/02/18/tesla-model-s-road-trip-drivers-have-no-problem-video/ |title=Tesla Model S road trip drivers find success along NYT's failed drive route [w/video] |author=Sebastian Blanco |publisher=Autoblog Green |date=February 18, 2013 |access-date=February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 18, 2013, ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[Public Editor]] Margaret Sullivan published an editorial stating that Broder took "casual and imprecise notes" of his test drive and did not use good judgment, but she maintained that the article was written in good faith. She also admitted that Broder's vehicle logs were "sometimes quite misleading."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/problems-with-precision-and-judgment-but-not-integrity-in-tesla-test/ |title=Problems With Precision and Judgment, but Not Integrity, in Tesla Test |author=Margaret Sullivan |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 18, 2013 |access-date=February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2136866,00.html |title=Charged Debate |author=James Poniewozik |authorlink=James Poniewozik |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=March 4, 2013 |access-date=February 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/automobiles/after-a-charging-system-test-a-debate-erupts-online.html?ref=automobiles&amp;_r=1&amp; |title=After a Charging System Test, a Debate Erupts Online |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 22, 2013 |access-date=February 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July and September 2014 tests performed by an independent German car magazine in cooperation with the TÜV (German Association for Technical Inspection) and Tesla owners seemed to reveal issues with the battery's performance. According to the magazine, Tesla did not take up the invitation to repeat the test, and also seemed to refuse to offer vehicles for a second test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/news/e-auto-haertetest-auto-motor-und-sport-unterstreicht-harte-testmethoden-8563278.html |title=E-Auto-Härtetest auto motor und sport unterstreicht harte Testmethoden|trans-title=car auto motor und sport emphasizes hard test methods |work=Auto motor und Sport |access-date=November 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/news/tesla-s-im-nachtest-258-km-reichweite-bei-120-km-h-und-13-grad-8612751.html |title=Tesla S im Nachtest 258 km Reichweite bei 120&amp;nbsp;km/h und 13 Grad |trans-title=Tesla S at posttest reaches 258 km at 120&amp;nbsp;km / h, 13 degrees |work=Auto motor und Sport |date=September 12, 2014 |access-date=November 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A test performed by another German publication ("[[Die Welt]]") supported the findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/motor/article131669893/Beim-dritten-Gasstoss-faengt-der-Tesla-an-zu-schwaecheln.html |title=Beim dritten Gasstoß fängt der Tesla an zu schwächeln |trans-title=By the third step on the pedal the Tesla starts to weaken |first=Jens |last=Meiners |newspaper=[[Die Welt]] |date=August 28, 2014 |access-date=November 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production delay ===
&lt;!--section needs better refs--&gt;
In 2007, Tesla announced plans to build 10,000 Model S sedans annually starting in 2009.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Production was delayed, and Tesla's website later stated that deliveries would start in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teslamotors.com/models/index.php |title=Tesla Model S Homepage |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114015912/http://www.teslamotors.com/models/index.php |archivedate=January 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in January 2010, Musk stated that he expected to launch the Model S sedan "within two and a half years", translating to Q3 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yet Another Delay for Telsa Motors – Model S Coming in 850 Days or So, Maybe |url=http://sfcitizen.com/blog/2010/01/15/yet-another-delay-for-telsa-motors-model-s-coming-in-850-days-or-so-maybe |date=January 15, 2010 |access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;!--personal blog--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power dissipation when not in use ===
Older versions of the system software suffered from power drain issues when the car wasn't being used, with the batteries losing 4.5&amp;nbsp;kWh overnight (known commonly as "vampire drain").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1088648_life-with-tesla-model-s-even-after-update-vampire-draw-remains |title=Life With Tesla Model S: Even After Update, Vampire Draw Remains |first=David |last=Nolan |work=Green Car Reports |date=November 25, 2013 |access-date=November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; System software v5.8 (v1.49.30), released December 12, 2013, reduced overnight energy loss substantially, to 1.1&amp;nbsp;kWh per night, or around 3 miles.&lt;ref name=vampire/&gt;

=== Consumer Reports' recommendation ===
In October 2015, two months after naming the Tesla 'the best car ever tested,' Consumer Reports declined to give the Tesla Model S a "recommended" designation, citing too many complaints from owners. Complaints ranged from minor, such as misaligned doors and squeaky body, to severe - things like total drive train replacement and inoperable door handles. Tesla's shares dropped 15%, both because of the magazine's cut and because of concerns over the Tesla Model X luxury SUV.&lt;ref name=CR2015&gt;{{cite web |title=Consumer Reports Cuts Tesla From Its Recommended List Over Reliability |url=https://www.yahoo.com/autos/teslas-reliability-doesnt-match-its-high-170529595.html |publisher=Yahoo! |access-date=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cars/tesla-reliability-doesnt-match-its-high-performance |title=Tesla Reliability Doesn't Match Its High Performance |first=Mark |last=Rechtin |magazine=[[Consumer Reports]] |date=October 20, 2015 |access-date=November 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Edmunds.com found quality and safety issues in their long-term road test and "amassed quite the repair résumé during the last 17 months."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/tesla/model-s/2013/long-term-road-test/wrap-up.html|title=2013 Tesla Model S Long-Term Wrap-Up {{!}} Edmunds.com|website=Edmunds|access-date=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Edmunds and Consumer Reports reported issues, including the vehicle stalling while driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/tesla-model-s-critical-backlash-five-main-problems-electric-car-identified-recent-1656144|title=Tesla Model S Critical Backlash: Five Main Problems With Electric Car Identified In Recent Reviews|website=International Business Times|access-date=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 2016 Annual Auto Reliability Survey, Consumer Reports improved the Model S rating to average reliability, while reporting that the Model X has had significant malfunction issues. The magazine also raised "serious concerns about how some automakers, including Tesla, have designed, deployed, and marketed semi-autonomous technology."&lt;ref name=CR2016&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/car-reliability/car-reliability-survey-2016/ |title=Consumer Reports Car Reliability Survey 2016|magazine=[[Consumer Reports]]|date=October 24, 2016 |access-date=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2017, in the [[Consumer Reports]] Car Reliability Survey, Tesla's position on the list had moved up four spots; the predicted reliability rating for Model S reached "above average" for the first time.&lt;ref name="fortune-2017-10-30" /&gt;

In 2018 the annual consumer reports reliability survey found Tesla cars amongst the worst with the brand falling 6 spots from 2017 and third worst amongst the brands surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/24/tesla-reliability-slips-to-third-worst-in-us-consumer-reports-says.html|title=Tesla slips several spots in Consumer Reports reliability ranking|last=LeBeau|first=Phil|date=2018-10-24|website=CNBC|language=en|access-date=2019-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/10/26/tesla-cars-may-be-the-safest-in-america-but-fail-in-reliability-consumer-reports/|title=Tesla Cars May Be The Safest In America, But Fail In Reliability: Consumer Reports|last=Su|first=Jean Baptiste|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Model S dropped "below average" in reliability with suspension problems and other issues that included the extending door handle.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;

=== Power consumption ===
In early March 2016, a report by [[Stuff (magazine)|''Stuff'' magazine]] revealed that test performed by VICOM, Ltd on behalf of Singapore's Land Transport Authority had found a 2014 Tesla Model S to be consuming {{cvt|444|Wh/km|kWh/mi}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.tv/sg/features/be-prepared-these-roadblocks-if-you-want-drive-tesla-in-singapore/page-3|title=Be prepared for these roadblocks if you want to drive a Tesla in Singapore {{!}} Stuff|website=[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]] |access-date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/lta-on-tesla-car-test-all/2572062.html|title=LTA on Tesla: CO2 emissions for electric cars start at power grid|website=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was greater than the {{cvt|0.38|kWh/mi|Wh/km|order=flip}} reported by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/bymodel/2014_Tesla_Model_S.shtml|title=Gas Mileage of 2014 Tesla Model S|website=www.fueleconomy.gov|access-date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the {{cvt|181|Wh/km|kWh/mi}} reported by Tesla.&lt;ref name="cleaninsingapore" /&gt; As a result, a carbon surcharge was imposed on the Model S, making Singapore the only country in the world to impose an environmental surcharge on a fully electric car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/electric-car-tesla-slapped-with-15000-tax-surcharge|title=Electric car Tesla slapped with $15,000 tax surcharge|last=hermes|date=March 4, 2016|website=The Straits Times|access-date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Land Transport Authority justified this by stating that it had to "account for {{CO2}} emissions during the electricity generation process" and therefore "a grid emission factor of 0.5 g/watt-hour was also applied to the electric energy consumption",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/lta-on-tesla-co2/2572062.html|title=LTA on Tesla: CO2 emissions for electric cars start at power grid|website=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; however Tesla countered that when the energy used to extract, refine, and distribute gasoline was taken into account, the Model S produces approximately one-third the {{CO2}} of an equivalent gasoline-powered vehicle.&lt;ref name="cleaninsingapore"&gt;{{cite web|title=Here's how clean a Model S is in Singapore (and elsewhere)|url=https://www.teslamotors.com/support/heres-how-clean-model-s-singapore-and-elsewhere|website=Tesla Motors|access-date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that month, the Land Transport Authority released a statement stating that they and the VICOM Emission Test Laboratory will be working with Tesla engineers to determine if there was a flaw in the test,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techinasia.com/singapores-lta-tesla-model-tested-car-efficiency|title=Singapore's LTA says the Tesla Model S it tested was a used car, hence its low efficiency|website=Tech in Asia|date=March 10, 2016|access-date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Tesla statement indicated that the discussions were "positive" and that they were confident of a quick resolution.&lt;ref name="cleaninsingapore" /&gt;

The '''Tesla Model X''' is a [[mid-size]] [[electric car|all-electric]] [[luxury car|luxury]] [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]] made by [[Tesla, Inc.]]. The vehicle is unique in the concept that it uses [[falcon wing doors]] instead of traditional automotive doors. 

The Model X was developed from the [[full-size car|full-sized sedan]] platform of the [[Tesla Model S]]. The Model X has an EPA Size Class as an [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]],&lt;ref name="ModelX90EPA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=36979&amp;id=36980|title=2016 Tesla Model X AWD – 90D and P90D, Fuel economy and specs|author=[[U.

Among the reasons for delay were problems with the falcon-wing doors and cooling the motors when hauling trailers.&lt;ref name=gcr022015&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Voelcker |url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1096685_why-tesla-model-x-electric-suv-is-late-range-towing-falcon-doors/page-2 |title=Why Tesla Model X Electric SUV Is Late: Range, Towing, 'Falcon Doors'  |website=Green Car Reports |date=February 9, 2015|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the company filed a lawsuit against Swiss hydraulics firm Hoerbiger Holding for not producing satisfactory [[Gull-wing door|falcon-wing]] doors for the Model X. Tesla claimed the doors suffered from oil leakage and overheating. Many believe this is one of the reasons for the delay of the Model X.&lt;ref name=ab20160126&gt;{{cite news |title=Tesla sues Model X falcon wing door supplier |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2016/01/25/tesla-model-x-falcon-wing-supplier-lawsuit/ |website=Autoblog |date=January 26, 2016 |accessdate=February 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was settled in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://electrek.co/2016/09/27/tesla-settles-in-court-with-supplier-over-the-development-of-the-model-xs-falcon-wing-doors/ |title=Tesla settles court case with supplier over the development of the Model X's Falcon Wing doors|website=Electrek|accessdate=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 29, 2015, Tesla announced a [[Referral marketing|referral program]] though October 31, 2015 wherein owners of a Model S who refer 10 new buyers gain the option to buy a Founder Series Model X for the price of a base model.

On July 13, 2016, Tesla introduced its Model X 60D, which is slightly lower priced than the Model X's starting price.

A series production vehicle was unveiled on September 29, 2015. It has a panoramic [[windshield]]. According to Tesla CEO [[Elon Musk]], it is the safest SUV in terms of frontal and side impact crash,&lt;!--check refs at http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/5-Star+Safety+Ratings/2011-Newer+Vehicles/Search-Results?searchtype=manufacturer&amp;manufacturer=151 --&gt; being more than twice as safe as the next closest SUV in [[Vehicle rollover|rollover]] tests as well. The Model X does come with Autopilot as standard, and has an optional [[Tesla Autopilot#Hardware 3|Full Self Driving]] chip. The Model X has standard a [[collision avoidance system]] that uses radar-based autonomous emergency braking (AEB) and side-directed ultrasound detection that steers the car away from threats. Tesla uses a wide-band radar system to help prevent the falcon wing doors from hitting nearby objects when opening or closing.

The Model X has double-hinged falcon wing doors which open upwards, allowing the leading edge of the door to remain tucked close to the body, unlike traditional gull-wing doors. Tesla claims the falcon-wing (modified gull-wing) doors ease access to the vehicle by having the door raise up vertically, rather than swinging out hinged at the front, which tremendously reduces accessibility. The Model X offers room for seven adults and their luggage in three rows of seating and front and rear trunks.&lt;ref name=NYT032013/&gt;

After the first quarter of 2016 all Tesla Model X deliveries had gone to US customers.

==Reception==
''[[Consumer Reports]]'' wrote that the all-wheel-drive Model X 90D largely disappoints, as rear doors are prone to pausing and stopping, the second-row seats that cannot be folded, and the cargo capacity is too limited. Even its panoramic, helicopter-like windshield was disapproved of as it is not tinted enough to offset the brightness of a sunny day. Also, Consumer Reports added that overall "the ride is too firm and choppy for a $110,000 car".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumerreports.org/suvs/2016-tesla-model-x-review/ 2016 Tesla Model X Review: Fast and Flawed – Consumer Reports]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Car and Driver]]'', despite some criticism of the Model X's falcon wing doors, approved of the panoramic windshield, stating "We were left dumbfounded, like slack-jawed tourists endlessly looking upward. Lose the Falcon Wing doors, Elon; the windshield is the Model X's best gimmick". Overall, it was given a rating of 5/5 stars, stating "There are no other electric SUVs at the moment. And even against fossil-fuel-fed SUVs, the Tesla's effortless performance and efficiency can't be matched." &lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.caranddriver.com/tesla/model-x Car and Driver: Tesla Model X]'', May 2016.

Lawyers were present during the review presumably because Clarkson's previous scathing review of the original [[Tesla Roadster (2008)|Roadster]] caused a lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/02/jeremy-clarkson-and-the-grand-tour-admit-many-nice-things-about-the-tesla-model-x/|title=Jeremy Clarkson and The Grand Tour Admit Many Nice Things About the Tesla Model X|first=Tom|last=Pritchard|date=12 February 2018|accessdate=1 March 2018|website=[[Gizmodo]] UK|quote=Model X got reviewed on ''The Grand Tour''. … ten years since Jeremy Clarkson reviewed a Tesla car}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidates for this award are nominated by hundreds of thousands across Europe for excellence across six categories. The Golden Steering Wheel jury, composed of professional race car drivers, accomplished technicians, editors, designers, and digital and connectivity experts, then spent three days judging Model X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tesla.com/blog/model-x-wins-golden-steering-wheel|title=Model X Wins the Golden Steering Wheel|date=November 8, 2016|website=www.tesla.com|publisher=Tesla Motors|access-date=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.markenartikel-magazin.de/no_cache/events/artikel/details/10015847-goldenes-lenkrad-2016-ua-fuer-audi-tesla-bmw-und-renault/ |website= www.markenartikel-magazin.de |title= 'Goldenes Lenkrad 2016' u.a. für Audi, Tesla, BMW und Renault |date= November 9, 2016 | accessdate= November 10, 2016 |trans-title= 'Golden Steering Wheel 2016' among others for Audi, Tesla, BMW and Renault |language= de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, 2017, the [[American Automobile Association]] named the Tesla Model X 75D its Top Green Vehicle overall, as well as best in the [[SUV]]/[[Minivan]] category,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://newsroom.aaa.com/2017/04/consumer-appetite-electric-vehicles-rivals-pickups/ Consumer Appetite for Electric Vehicles Rivals Pickups]'', April 18, 2017. Retrieved June 19, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; with a score of 100/130. The vehicle scored 10/10 for its EPA Emissions Score, [[crashworthiness]], Fuel Economy and Luggage Capacity. Though ambivalent toward Autopilot and the Model X's glass roof, AAA favoured its falcon-wing doors, and approved of the vehicle's performance, stating that its "acceleration is smooth and strong, as is the braking."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://ww1.aaa.com/services/automotive/greencar/greencar.html#/view/2DDC59BE-A593-4128-945A-027536EA9C1B Green Car Guide, 2017 Edition, Tesla Model X 75D]'', April 18, 2017.

On June 8, 2017, the Model X was awarded the Australian ''Good Design Award'' in the Automotive and Transport category. The design of the vehicle was described as "set with an athletic build, whilst remaining proportional.

==Guinness World Record==
On May 15, 2018, the Tesla Model X and [[Qantas]] set the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for "heaviest tow by an electric production passenger vehicle." The Model X was able to tow a {{convert|287,000|lb|kg|abbr=on|sp=us}} [[Boeing 787|Boeing 787-9]] nearly 1,000 feet on a taxiway at [[Melbourne Airport]], which demonstrates the power of the vehicle, while also {{citation needed|date=December 2019}} proving the practicality of an electric powertrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/15/technology/tesla-tows-boeing-dreamliner-video/index.html |title=Tesla SUV earns a Guinness World Record for towing massive airplane |author=Valinsky, Jordan |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=May 15, 2018 |accessdate=May 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues with production units ==
The Tesla Model X faced criticism in 2016 for issues with the falcon-wing doors, which sometimes did not open or latch properly in some early production units, and the windows, which sometimes did not open or close all the way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/20/tesla-model-x-owners-finding-car-doors-wont-shut-windows-wont-close/ Tesla Model X owners finding car doors won't shut, windows won't close] [[TechCrunch]], Retrieved April 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla addressed these issues with several software updates, and no known issues remained after the 8.0 firmware was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://electrek.co/2016/10/10/tesla-model-x-falcon-wing-doors-v8-0-software-update/ |title=Tesla Model X's Falcon Wing doors are significantly faster after v8.0 software update|date= October 10, 2016 |website=Electrek|accessdate= October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 27, 2016, Tesla settled on a lawsuit over usability concerns, accepting that the Model X was rushed to production before it was ready,&lt;ref&gt;[http://fortune.com/2016/06/27/model-x-lawsuit/ Tesla Settles Lawsuit Over Model X Design Flaws - Fortune]&lt;/ref&gt; and by October 2016, Tesla claimed the problems had been reduced by 92%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://electrek.co/2016/10/26/tesla-model-x-92-reduction-issue/ |title=Tesla says it reduced Model X issues by 92% amid criticism from Consumer Reports|date=October 26, 2016 |website=Electrek |accessdate=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Chinese newspaper ''Xinhua'' reported that security researchers from Keen Security Lab at [[Tencent]] were able to remotely gain control of the Tesla Model X, allowing them to remotely open the car's doors, blink the lights and control their brakes. They found [[Zero-day (computing)|zero day]] vulnerabilities that allowed them to install new [[firmware]]. The lead researcher for the team said they informed Tesla of the findings and most of the cars were patched by an update one month after Tesla was made aware of issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Same Chinese white hat group hacks into Tesla for second year |website=Xinhua |accessdate = 2018-03-20| url = http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-08/01/c_136489007.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roadster's efficiency, {{as of|2008|9|lc=on}}, was reported as 120 [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent|MPGe]] (2.0 L/100&amp;nbsp;km). It uses 135 [[Watt-hour|Wh]]/km (21.7&amp;nbsp;kW·h/100&amp;nbsp;mi, 13.5&amp;nbsp;kW·h/100&amp;nbsp;km or 490&amp;nbsp;kJ/km) battery-to-wheel, and has an efficiency of 88% on average.&lt;ref name="motor technology"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.teslamotors.com/roadster/technology/motor |title=Roadster Innovations: Motor |publisher=Tesla Motors |accessdate=February 25, 2011 |quote=The Roadster achieves an overall driving efficiency of 88%, about three times the efficiency of a conventional car.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Prototypes of the car were officially revealed to the public on July 19, 2006, in [[Santa Monica, California]], at a 350-person invitation-only event held in Barker Hangar at [[Santa Monica Airport]].&lt;ref name="Tesla Press 42"&gt;{{cite press release | publisher=Tesla Motors | title=Tesla Motors Hosts World Debut of Tesla Roadster Offering Performance, Style &amp; Efficiency – With a Conscience | url=http://www.teslamotors.com/media/press_room.php?id=42 | date=July 20, 2006 | accessdate=April 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The San Francisco International Auto Show, held on November 18–26, 2006, was the Tesla Roadster's first auto show.

It was featured in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in December 2006 as the recipient of the magazine's "Best Inventions 2006—Transportation Invention" award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1939342_1939392_1939459,00.html |title=Batteries Included - Best Inventions of 2006 |work=Time |location=US |year=2006 |access-date=January 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first "Signature One Hundred" set of fully equipped Roadsters sold out in less than three weeks, the second hundred sold out by October 2007 and general production began on March 17, 2008.

The first Tesla Roadster was delivered in February 2008 to Tesla co-founder, chairman and product architect [[Elon Musk]]. The company produced 500 similar vehicles through June 2009. In July 2009, Tesla began production of its 2010 model-year Roadster—the first major product upgrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.teslamotors.com/display_data.php?data_name=WardsAutoArticle |title=Drive Tesla Roadster; Forget What You Knew About Acceleration |first=Eric |last=Mayne |date=September 4, 2009 |format=PDF |publisher=Wards Auto |accessdate=June 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, Tesla began producing the Roadster Sport, the first derivative of Tesla's proprietary, patented powertrain. The car accelerates from {{convert|0|to|60|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}} in 3.7 seconds, compared to 3.9 seconds for the standard Roadster. Changes for the 2010 model-year cars included:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.automobilesreview.com/auto-news/tesla-roadster-2/16337/ |title=Tesla Roadster 2 |date=July 22, 2009 |publisher=Automobiles review |accessdate=June 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An upgraded interior and push-button gear selector, including "executive interior" of exposed carbon fiber and premium leather, and clear-coat carbon fiber body accents.
* Locking, push-button glove box wrapped in leather.
* A centrally mounted video display screen to monitor real-time data, including estimated range, power regenerated, and the number of barrels of oil saved. This screen is visible to the driver and passenger.
* Adjustable, custom-tuned suspension. The shock absorbers' response and anti-sway bars are manually adjustable.
* More powerful and immediate heating, ventilation and air-conditioning.
* More efficient motor and hand-wound stator. The increase in efficiency allows the motor to deliver higher peak power.
* A suite of sound-deadening measures to dramatically reduce noise, vibration and harshness. For instance, engineers added pellets to a member of the chassis side rail. These pellets expand by 50 times original volume during the adhesive heating cycle to eliminate rattles.
All of these features, except for the motor, were available either as standard or as add-on option for the non-sport model.

Beginning mid-March 2010, Tesla, in an effort to show off the practicality of its electric cars, sent one of its Roadsters around the world. Starting at the Geneva auto show, the Roadster completed its journey upon its arrival in Paris on September 28, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-20003938-48.html?tag=mncol |title=Globe-trotting Tesla Roadster Reaches Moscow |first=Wayne |last=Cunningham |date=April 30, 2010 |work=The Car Tech Blog |publisher=[[CNET.com]] |accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, Tesla introduced the "Roadster 2.5", the latest update of the Roadster.&lt;ref name=ReferenceA&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.teslamotors.com/about/press/releases/tesla-unveils-roadster-25-newest-stores-europe-and-north-america |title=Tesla Unveils Roadster 2.5 at Newest Stores in Europe and North America |publisher=Tesla Motors |date=July 1, 2010 |accessdate=October 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; New features in Roadster 2.5 include:
* A new look, which included a new front fascia with diffusing vents, and rear diffuser reflecting the future of Tesla design
* Directional forged wheels available in both silver and black
* New seats with improved comfort, larger more supportive bolsters and a new lumbar support system
* Power control hardware that enables spirited driving in exceptionally hot climates
* An optional 7" touchscreen display with back-up camera
* Improved interior sound reduction including new front fender liner material to make the cabin quieter

At the time, the US$112,000 Roadster was the most expensive single prize ever offered, though not won, on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', in a playing of [[List of The Price Is Right pricing games|Golden Road]] on April 22, 2010 for Earth Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPq_I_L2UL4 |title= TPiR 4/22/10: Historic Golden Road - TESLA ROADSTER - $112,000+ |accessdate=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|History of Tesla Inc.}}

The Roadster was developed by Tesla to mass-produce [[AC Propulsion tzero|AC Propulsion's tzero concept car]].

After [[Martin Eberhard]] sold [[NuvoMedia]] to [[Gemstar-TV Guide International|TV Guide]], he wanted a sports car with high mileage, but could not find one.

Before Tesla had developed the Roadster's proprietary powertrain, they borrowed an [[AC Propulsion]] [[AC Propulsion tzero|Tzero]] vehicle as a test mule and converted from lead acid AGM batteries to lithium ion cells which substantially increased the range, reduced weight, and boosted 0-60 performance. Tesla then licensed [[AC Propulsion]]'s EV power system design and reductive charging patent which covers integration of the charging electronics with the [[Inverter (electrical)#Electric vehicle drives|inverter]], thus reducing mass, complexity, and cost. However, Tesla was dissatisfied with how the motor and transmission worked in the chassis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Elon-Musk-Tesla-was-founded-on-2-false-ideas-7955528.php |title=Elon Musk: Tesla was founded on 2 false ideas, and survived anyway |first=David R. |last=Baker |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=May 31, 2016 |accessdate=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla then designed and built its own power electronics, motor, and other drivetrain components that incorporated this licensed technology from [[AC Propulsion]].&lt;ref name="Reductive"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acpropulsion.com/technology/reductivecharging.htm|publisher=[[AC Propulsion]]|accessdate=March 7, 2007|title=Reductive Charging, AC Propulsion's Reductive Charger Integrated Charging for the Electric Vehicle |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070206121745/http://www.acpropulsion.com/technology/reductivecharging.htm  |archivedate = February 6, 2007 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Interview with Musk, pt 2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.autobloggreen.com/2008/06/24/autobloggreen-qanda-tesla-motors-chairman-elon-musk-part-2-tran/ | title=AutoblogGreen Q&amp;A: Tesla Motors Chairman Elon Musk Part 2 – Transmission shifts | date=June 24, 2008 | accessdate= June 24, 2008 | first=Sam |last=Abuelsamid }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TeslaWtoW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teslamotors.com/efficiency/well_to_wheel.php|title=Well-to-Wheel Energy Efficiency|last1=Tarpenning|first1=Marc|first2=Martin |last2=Eberhard |date=August 24, 2007|publisher=Tesla Motors| accessdate=February 25, 2011|quote=The AC Propulsion lithium-ion charging system (the basis for the design of the Tesla Roadster charging system)...|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011010258/http://www.teslamotors.com/efficiency/well_to_wheel.php|archivedate=October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the extensive redevelopment of the vehicle, Tesla Motors no longer licenses any proprietary technology from AC Propulsion.

On July 11, 2005, Tesla and British sports car maker Lotus entered an agreement about products and services based on the [[Lotus Elise]], where Lotus provided advice on designing and developing a vehicle as well as producing partly assembled vehicles,&lt;ref name="lotustesla1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://contracts.onecle.com/tesla-motors/lotus-supply-2005-07-11.shtml |title=Supply agreement for products and services based on Lotus Elise technology |first1=Clive |last1=Dopson |first2=Simon |last2=Wood |first3=Thomas E. |last3=Colson |first4=Martin F. |last4=Eberhard |website=OneCLE |date=July 11, 2005 |accessdate=September 7, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617160922/http://contracts.onecle.com/tesla-motors/lotus-supply-2005-07-11.shtml |archivedate=June 17, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and amended in 2009,&lt;ref name="lotustesla2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://contracts.onecle.com/tesla-motors/lotus-supply-2009-08-04.shtml |title=Contract Amendment 1 |first1=Luke |last1=Bennett |first2=Roger |last2=Becker |first3=Mike |last3=Donoughe |first4=Craig W. |last4=Harding |website=OneCLE |date=August 4, 2009 |accessdate=September 7, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617171938/http://contracts.onecle.com/tesla-motors/lotus-supply-2009-08-04.shtml |archivedate=June 17, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; helped with basic chassis development.

Several prototypes of the Tesla Roadster were produced from 2004 through 2007. Initial studies were done in two "[[test mule]]" vehicles based on Lotus Elises equipped with all-electric drive systems. Ten engineering prototypes (EP1 through EP10) which led to many minor changes were then built and tested in late 2006 and early 2007. Tesla then produced at least 26 validation prototypes which were delivered beginning in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teslamotorsclub.com/showthread.php/429-Validation-Prototypes-(VPs) VP1 through VP26]&lt;/ref&gt; These final revisions were endurance and crash tested in preparation for series production.&lt;ref name="Motor Press Guild Speech" /&gt;

Tesla announced in early August 2009 that Roadster sales had resulted in overall corporate profitability for the month of July 2009, earning {{USD|1 million}} on revenue of {{USD|20 million}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20090807005516/en/Tesla-Motors-Attains-Profitability-Milestone |title= Tesla Motors Attains Profitability Milestone (press release) |website=[[Business Wire]] |date= August 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tesla, which signed a production contract with Group Lotus in 2007 to produce "gliders" (complete cars minus electric powertrain) for the Roadster, announced in early 2010 that Roadster production would continue until early 2012. Starting one year prior to the end of the contract, Tesla put a hiatus on new orders to allow time for tooling changes at Lotus's assembly plant in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.automobilemag.com/news/tesla-extends-production-contract-with-lotus-2822/ |title=Tesla Extends Production Contract with Lotus |magazine=Automobile Magazine |date=March 30, 2010 |accessdate=April 5, 2010 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411195948/http://www.automobilemag.com/news/tesla-extends-production-contract-with-lotus-2822/ |archivedate=April 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roadster's single-speed gearbox was made in Detroit to Tesla's specifications by Auburn Hills, Michigan-based supplier [[BorgWarner]]. Brakes and airbags were made by [[Siemens]] in [[Germany]], and some crash testing was conducted at Siemens as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120761191252596525?mod=hps_us_whats_news | title=Detroit Sets Bold Goal: Exporting U.S. Cars | date=April 8, 2008 | last=John D.

For Roadsters bound for customers in North America, the chassis was then sent to Menlo Park, California, for final assembly, and for Roadsters bound for customers in Europe or elsewhere outside of North America, the chassis was sent to a facility at Wymondham near Hethel, for final assembly. At these final assembly locations, Tesla employees installed the entire powertrain, which consisted of the battery pack, power electronics module, gearbox and motor. Tesla also performed rigorous "pre-delivery inspection" on every car before customers took ownership.

Tesla ordered 2,500 [[glider (automobiles)|glider]]s from Lotus, which ended supplies in December 2011 when their contract expired.&lt;ref name=Sales0611/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT050611/&gt; Tesla ended production of the Roadster in January 2012.&lt;ref name=EndPro/&gt;

=== Timeline ===

Subsequent to completion of production car number one at Hethel, the company announced problems with [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] reliability. The development transmission, with first gear enabled to accelerate {{convert|0|to|60|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}} in 4 seconds, was reported to have a life expectancy of as low as only a few thousand miles. Tesla's first two transmission suppliers were unable to produce transmissions, in quantity, that could withstand the gear-shift requirements of the high torque, high rpm electric motor. In December 2007, Tesla announced plans to ship the initial Roadsters with the transmissions locked into second gear to provide {{convert|0|to|60|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}} acceleration in 5.7 seconds. The first production car was not delivered with this interim solution; P1 has both transmission gears enabled. According to the plan, the initial transmissions were to be swapped out under warranty when the finalized transmission, power electronics module (PEM), and cooling system became available. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency#Fuel economy testing and results|EPA range]] of the car was also restated downward from {{convert|245|to|221|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The downward revision was attributed to an error in equipment calibration at the laboratory that conducted the original test.&lt;ref name="Tesla Motors 55"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.teslamotors.com/blog2/?p=55 | title=A Letter to Customers from Ze'ev Drori |first=Ze'ev |last=Drori | author-link =Ze'ev Drori| date=December 27, 2007 | access-date=December 31, 2007| publisher=Tesla Motors|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071230184757/http://www.teslamotors.com/blog2/?p=55 |archive-date=December 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scoble QIK"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://qik.com/video/22264 | title=Ride in first production Tesla with Elon Musk |first=Robert |last=Scoble | date=February 19, 2008 | accessdate=February 26, 2008 | quote=2:58 into video Elon Musk says "This particular car [P1] actually has two speeds" }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telsa Motors Club Forum 4465-11"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teslamotorsclub.com/4465-post11.html |date=December 12, 2007 |accessdate=February 12, 2008 |first=Daryl |last=Siry  |author-link=Daryl Siry |title=Re: My Town Hall Notes |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716212321/http://www.teslamotorsclub.com/4465-post11.html |archivedate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transmission ===

Starting in September 2008 Tesla selected [[BorgWarner]] to manufacture gearboxes and began equipping all Roadsters with a single speed, fixed gear gearbox (8.2752:1) with an electrically actuated [[parking pawl]] mechanism and a mechanical lubrication pump.&lt;ref name="Tesla 2008-09-09" /&gt;

The company previously worked with several companies, including XTrac and [[Magna International]], to find the right [[automatic transmission]], but a two-gear solution proved to be too challenging. This led to substantial delays in production. At the "Town Hall Meeting" with owners in December 2007, Tesla announced plans to ship the initial 2008 Roadsters with their interim Magna two-speed direct shift [[manual transmission]]s locked into second gear, limiting the performance of the car to less than what was originally stated ({{convert|0|to|60|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}} in 5.7 seconds instead of the announced 4.0 seconds). Tesla also announced it would upgrade those transmissions under warranty when the final transmission became available.&lt;ref name="Tesla Motors 55" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Telsa Motors Club Forum 4465-11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBlog 2007-12-19"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.autoblog.com/2007/12/19/tesla-clarifies-report-of-temporary-transmissions/ |date=December 19, 2007 |title=Tesla clarifies report of "temporary transmissions" | first = John | last = Neff }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the "Town Hall Meeting" with owners on January 30, 2008, Tesla Motors described the planned transmission upgrade as a single-speed gearbox with a drive ratio of 8.27:1 combined with improved electronics and motor cooling that retain the acceleration from {{convert|0|to|60|mph|abbr=on}} in under 4 seconds and an improved motor limit of 14,000 rpm to retain the {{convert|125|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} top speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.teslamotors.com/blog2/?p=55 | title = A Letter to Customers from Ze'ev Drori |publisher=Tesla Motors |first=Ze'ev |last=Drori |date=December 17, 2007 |accessdate=December 8, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231060859/http://www.teslamotors.com/blog2/?p=55 |archive-date=December 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upgraded system also improved the maximum torque from {{convert|200|to|280|lb·ft|abbr=on|order=flip|N.m}} and improves the Roadster's [[Dragstrip|quarter mile]] times.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In the interior the gear selector is similar to a push-button automatic with buttons labeled P, R, N and D while some earlier models have a gear lever similar to that in cars with manual transmission.

Tesla refers to the Roadster's battery pack as the Energy Storage System or ESS. The {{convert|992|lb|abbr=on|order=flip}} ESS contains 6,831 [[lithium ion battery|lithium ion]] cells arranged into 11 "sheets" connected in series; each sheet contains 9 "bricks" connected in series; each "brick" contains 69 cells connected in parallel (11S 9S 69P).

A full recharge to {{convert|53|kWh|abbr=on}} requires about 3½ hours using the High Power Connector which supplies 70-amp, 240-volt electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teslamotors.com/blog4/?p=59|title=The Most Coddled Automotive Battery Ever? - Tesla Motors|work=teslamotors.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tesla 59"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teslamotors.com/blog4/?p=59|title=The Most Coddled Automotive Battery Ever?|last=Toomre, Tesla Motors Director of Manufacturing Programs|first=Eric|date=August 8, 2007|publisher=Tesla Motors|accessdate=February 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tesla said in February 2009 that the ESS had expected life span of seven years/{{convert|100000|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}}, and began selling pre-purchase battery replacements for about one third of the battery's price today, with the replacement to be delivered after seven years. Tesla says the ESS retains 70% capacity after five years and {{convert|50000|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}} of driving, assuming {{convert|10000|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}} driven each year. A July 2013 study found that after {{convert|100000|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}}, Roadster batteries still had 80%–85% capacity and the only significant factor is mileage (not temperature).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pluginamerica.org/surveys/batteries/tesla-roadster/PIA-Roadster-Battery-Study.pdf |title=Tesla Roadster Battery Study |first=Tom |last=Saxton |website=Plug In America |date=July 13, 2013 |access-date=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recharging ===

The Roadster uses a proprietary charging connector, although Tesla sells a mobile adapter that enables recharging with an [[SAE J1772|SAE J1772-2009]] connector.&lt;ref name="Tesla-J1772"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teslamotors.com/goelectric/charging/j1772-mobile-connector |title=J1772 Mobile Connector |publisher=Tesla Motors |accessdate=May 13, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607050856/http://www.teslamotors.com/goelectric/charging/j1772-mobile-connector |archivedate=June 7, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle can be recharged using:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teslamotors.com/electric/charging.php |title=Tesla Motors – Charging Solutions |publisher=Tesla Motors |accessdate=May 11, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104104736/http://www.teslamotors.com/electric/charging.php|archivedate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A wall-mounted 208–240&amp;nbsp;V, 70&amp;nbsp;A maximum current Home Connector. This appears to be an OEM version of the TS-70 [[charging station]] from ClipperCreek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=ClipperCreek to Supply Power Control Stations for Tesla Motors |url=http://clippercreek.net/images/ClipperCreek%20to%20Supply%20Power%20Control%20Stations%20for%20Tesla%20Motors.pdf |publisher=ClipperCreek |date=April 30, 2009 |accessdate=May 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A portable 120–240&amp;nbsp;V, 40&amp;nbsp;A maximum current Universal Mobile Connector cable that can plug into a [[NEMA connector#NEMA 14|NEMA 14–50]] receptacle and other 240 V receptacles using adapters.
* A portable 120&amp;nbsp;V, 15&amp;nbsp;A maximum current Spare Mobile Connector cable that plugs into a standard North American domestic socket.

Charging times vary depending on the ESS's state-of-charge, the available voltage, and the available circuit breaker amp rating ([[Electric current|current]]). In a best case scenario using a 240 V charger on a 90 A circuit breaker, Tesla documents a recharging rate of {{convert|56|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}} of range for each hour charging; a complete recharge from empty would require just under four hours. The slowest charging rate using a 120 V outlet on a 15 A circuit breaker would add {{convert|5|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}} of range for each hour charging; a complete recharge from empty would require 48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teslamotors.com/goelectric/charging |title=Charging |publisher=Tesla Motors |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628041831/http://www.teslamotors.com/goelectric/charging |archivedate=June 28, 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Testing the Tesla at Argonne National Laboratory (3).jpg|thumb|Roadster being tested through a driving cycle at [[Argonne National Laboratory]]'s two-wheel dynamometer. These tests helped researchers develop test procedures to evaluate [[fuel efficiency]] in electric vehicles in 2010]]

In 2007, the Roadster's [[life cycle analysis|battery-to-wheel]] motor efficiency was reported as 88%&lt;ref name="motor technology"/&gt; to 90% on average and 80% at peak power.&lt;ref name="2007 Roadster Specs"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.teslamotors.com/performance/tech_specs.php | title=2007 Tesla Roadster Technical Specifications | accessdate=February 25, 2011 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020043035/http://www.teslamotors.com/performance/tech_specs.php | archivedate=October 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, [[internal combustion engine]]s have a tank-to-wheel efficiency of about 15%.&lt;ref name="EPA FuelEconomy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/atv.shtml |title=Advanced Technologies and Energy Efficiency |accessdate=February 10, 2008 |publisher=US EPA }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking a more complete picture including the cost of energy drawn from its source, Tesla reports that their technology, assuming electricity generated from natural gas-burning power plants, has a high [[Tank-to-wheel|well-to-wheel]] efficiency of 1.14&amp;nbsp;km per mega[[joule]], compared to 0.202&amp;nbsp;km/MJ for gasoline-powered sports cars, 0.478&amp;nbsp;km/MJ for gasoline-powered commuter cars, 0.556&amp;nbsp;km/MJ for [[Hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid cars]], and 0.348&amp;nbsp;km/MJ for hydrogen [[fuel cell vehicle]]s.&lt;ref name="The 21st century Electric Car"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teslamotors.com/goelectric/efficiency |title=Using Energy Efficiently |publisher=Tesla Motors |accessdate=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Petroleum-equivalent efficiency ===
{{Howto|section|date=June 2017|reason=Besides how-to instructions, this isn't specific to the Roadster. This applies to any BEV. Why is it here? }}
{{see also|electric car#Comparison with internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs)}}

As the Roadster does not use gasoline, petroleum efficiency (MPG, L/100&amp;nbsp;km) cannot be measured directly but instead is calculated using one of several equivalent methods:

A number comparable to the typical [[Monroney sticker]]'s "pump-to-wheel" fuel efficiency can be calculated based on regulations from the [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] and its energy content for a U.S. gallon of gasoline of 33,705&amp;nbsp;{{frac|Wh|gal}} (also called the [[Lower heating value|Lower Heating Value (LHV)]] of gasoline):&lt;ref name="petroleum-equivalency"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fueleconomy.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/compx2008f.jsp?year=2003&amp;make=Toyota&amp;model=RAV4%20EV&amp;hiddenField=Findacar |title=fueleconomy.gov 2003 Toyota RAV4 EV |year=2003 |publisher=[[USDOE]] and [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] |accessdate=May 11, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115024534/https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/compx2008f.jsp?year=2003&amp;make=Toyota&amp;model=RAV4%20EV&amp;hiddenField=Findacar |archivedate=January 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{33705\,\frac{\mathrm{Wh}}{\mathrm{gal_{ge}}}}
       {135\,\frac{\mathrm{Wh}}{\mathrm{km}} \times \frac{1.6\, \mathrm{km}}{\mathrm{mi}}}
       \times 77.6 \% {\mathrm{_{charging\ eff.}}}= 120 \,\mathrm{mpg_{ge}} = 1.95 \frac{\mathrm{L_{ge}}}{100\, \mathrm{km}}&lt;/math&gt;

For [[Corporate average fuel economy|CAFE]] regulatory purposes, the [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]]'s full petroleum-equivalency equation combines the primary energy efficiencies of the USA [[electric power transmission|electric grid]] and the well-to-pump path with a "fuel content factor" that quantifies the value of conservation, scarcity of fuels, and energy security in the USA.&lt;ref name="petroleum-equivalency"&gt;{{cite journal | publisher=[[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)]], Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy |title=10 CFR Part 474, Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Program; Petroleum-Equivalent Fuel Economy Calculation; Final Rule |volume=64 |number=113 | date=July 12, 2000 |url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2000_register&amp;docid=00-14446-filed.pdf |accessdate=September 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This combination yields a factor of 82,049&amp;nbsp;{{frac|Wh|gal}} in the above equation and a regulatory fuel efficiency of 293 [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent|mpg&lt;sub&gt;ge&lt;/sub&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;CAFE&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[File:Roadster 2.5 charging.jpg|thumb|Tesla Roadster 2.5 charging from a conventional outlet]]

Recharging with electricity from the average US grid, the factor changes to 12,307&amp;nbsp;{{frac|Wh|gal&lt;sub&gt;US&lt;/sub&gt;}}&lt;ref name="petroleum-equivalency"/&gt; to remove the "fuel content factor"&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|0.15}} and the above equation yields a [[life cycle energy analysis|full-cycle energy-equivalency]] of 44.0 mpg&lt;sub&gt;ge full-cycle&lt;/sub&gt;. For full-cycle comparisons, the sticker or "pump-to-wheel" value from a gasoline-fueled vehicle must be multiplied by the fuel's "well-to-pump" efficiency; the DOE regulation specifies a "well-to-pump" efficiency of 83% for gasoline.&lt;ref name="petroleum-equivalency"/&gt; The [[Prius]]'s sticker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/compx2008f.jsp?year=2008&amp;make=Toyota&amp;model=Prius&amp;hiddenField=Findacar |title=Model 1 Vehicle Characteristics |publisher=Fueleconomy.gov |date=September 10, 2006 |accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|46|mpgus|abbr=on}}, for example, converts to a full-cycle energy-equivalent of 38.2 mpg&lt;sub&gt;full-cycle&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="petroleum-equivalency"/&gt;

Recharging with electricity generated by newer, 58% efficiency [[Combined cycle|CCGT]] power plants,&lt;ref name="DOE Top Power Project"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.fossil.energy.gov/news/techlines/2003/tl_baglanbay.html | title = Advanced Natural Gas Turbine Hailed as Top Power Project of 2003 | publisher = [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] | date=December 30, 2003 | accessdate = March 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; changes the factor to 21,763&amp;nbsp;{{frac|Wh|gal}}&lt;ref name="petroleum-equivalency"/&gt; in the above equation and yields a fuel efficiency of 77.7 mpg&lt;sub&gt;ge&lt;/sub&gt;.

Recharging with non-fossil fuel electricity sources such as [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]], [[solar power]], [[wind power|wind]] or [[nuclear power|nuclear]], the petroleum equivalent efficiency can be even higher as fossil fuel is not directly used in refueling.&lt;ref name="fueleconomy.gov evtech"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/evtech.shtml |title=Electric Vehicles (EVs) |publisher=Fueleconomy.gov |accessdate=June 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Service ==
Whereas vehicles with internal combustion engines require more frequent service for oil changes and routine maintenance on engine components and other related systems, Tesla's website recommends the owner bring the vehicle in for service "once a year or every 12,000 [[mile]]s".&lt;ref name="tesla"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.teslamotors.com/own/service|title=Service Everywhere &amp;#124; Own a Tesla &amp;#124; Tesla Motors|publisher=Tesla Motors|accessdate=August 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For other concerns with vehicles, Tesla created a "mobile service unit" that dispatches company-trained technicians to customers' homes or offices in case the owner is experiencing problems. Tesla charges the customer according to the distance the service unit needs to travel: one US dollar per mile roundtrip with a 100-dollar minimum.&lt;ref name="tesla" /&gt; Technicians drive company vans equipped with numerous tools and testing equipment to do "in the field" repairs, enhancements and software upgrades. Tesla debuted this "house call" approach in the spring of 2009, when the company announced a recall due to a manufacturing problem in the Lotus assembly plant, which also affected the Lotus Elise and other models from the British sports car maker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teslamotors.com/media/press_room.php?id=1376|title=Press Releases|publisher=Tesla Motors|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611150607/http://www.teslamotors.com/media/press_room.php?id=1376|archivedate=June 11, 2009|url-status=dead|accessdate=August 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Tesla service center, in Los Angeles, [[California]], was opened on [[Santa Monica Boulevard]] on May 1, 2008.&lt;ref name="AutoblogGreen 2008-05-02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autobloggreen.com/2008/05/02/first-tesla-store-opens-in-santa-monica-now-we-just-need-some-c/|title=First Tesla store opens in Santa Monica, now we just need some cars|last=Abuelsamid|first=Sam|date=May 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla publicly opened their second showroom and service area in [[Menlo Park, California]] on July 22, 2008. The Menlo Park location is also the final assembly area for Tesla Roadsters. Tesla also operates service centers in [[New York City]], [[Miami]], [[Chicago]], and [[Seattle]].

In 2007, Tesla announced plans to build additional service centers over the following few years to support sales of its next vehicle, the [[Tesla Model S|Model S sports sedan]].

{{As of|2017|05}}, Tesla has issued two product safety recalls for the Roadster.&lt;ref name="SalesModelX042016"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2016/04/11/tesla-recalls-2700-model-x-cars-for-seat-problem/|title=Tesla Recalls 2,700 Model X Cars for Seat Problem|last=Fehrenbacher|first=Katie|date=April 11, 2016|work=Fortune|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, Tesla issued a recall for 345 Roadsters manufactured before April 22, 2009. Tesla sent technicians to customers' homes to tighten the rear, inner hub flange bolts. Using wording from the [[National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration]], Tesla told customers that without this adjustment, the driver could lose control of the car.&lt;ref name="hub nuts recall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-10251758-48.html|title=Tesla Motors recalls electric Roadster|last=Ashe|first=Suzanne|date=May 28, 2009|accessdate=January 11, 2013|website=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem originated at the [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]] assembly line, where the Roadster glider was built. Lotus also recalled some [[Lotus Elise|Elise]] and [[Lotus Exige|Exige]] vehicles for the same reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.motortrend.com/cars/2009/lotus/elise/recalls/index.html|title=2009 Lotus Elise Recalls—2009 Lotus Elise Recall Reports|magazine=Motor Trend|accessdate=October 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2010, Tesla issued a second product safety recall in the US affecting 439 Roadsters. The recall involved the 12V low-voltage auxiliary cable from a redundant back-up system. The recall followed an incident where the low voltage auxiliary cable in a vehicle chafed against the edge of a carbon fiber panel, causing a short, smoke and a possible fire behind the right front headlamp. This issue was limited to the 12V low-voltage auxiliary cable and did not involve the main battery pack or main power system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Tesla Initiates Voluntary Recall After Single Customer Incident|date=October 1, 2010|publisher=Tesla Motors|url=http://www.tesla.com/about/press/releases/tesla-initiates-voluntary-recall-after-single-customer-incident|accessdate=October 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reviews ==

Tesla Roadster reviews can be grouped in two main categories: older reviews of "validation prototypes" (2006–2008), before Tesla began serial production and customer deliveries, and reviews on cars in serial production (2008–2010).

The global online auto review site Autoguide.com tested Tesla's fourth-generation car in October 2010. Autoguide editor Derek Kreindler said "The Tesla Roadster 2.5 S is a massively impressive vehicle, more spacecraft than sports car. Theories like global warming, peak oil and rising oil prices should no longer bring heart palpitations to car fans. The Tesla shows just how good zero-emissions "green" technology can be. Quite frankly, getting into a normal car at the end of the test drive was a major letdown. The whirr of the engine, the shove in the backside and the little roadster that seems to pivot around you is replaced by a grunting, belching, feedback-free driving experience". He continues on that "but for a $100,000 car, it could use some work" complaining of purposefully cheap work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoguide.com/manufacturer/tesla/2011-tesla-roadster-25-s-review-1444.html |title=2011 Tesla Roadster 2.5 S Review: Car Reviews |publisher=Autoguide.com |date=October 12, 2010 |accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the March 2010 print edition of British enthusiast magazine ''EVO'' (p.&amp;nbsp;120), editor Richard Meaden was the first to review the all-new right-hand-drive version of the Roadster. He said the car had "serious, instantaneous muscle". "With so much torque from literally no revs the acceleration punch is wholly alien. Away from traffic lights you'd murder anything, be it a 911 Turbo, GT-R or 599, simply because while they have to mess about with balancing revs and clutch, or fiddle with launch controls and invalid warranties, all you have to do is floor the throttle and wave goodbye".

In December 2009, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' editor Joseph White conducted an extended test-drive and determined that "you can have enormous fun within the legal speed limit as you whoosh around unsuspecting Camry drivers, zapping from 40 to 60 miles per hour in two seconds while the startled victims eat your electric dust". White praised the car's environmental efficiency but said consumer demand reflected not the environmental attributes of the car but its performance. "The Tesla turns the frugal environmentalist aesthetic on its head. Sure, it doesn't burn petroleum, and if plugged into a wind turbine or a nuclear plant, it would be a very low-carbon machine. But anyone who buys one will get the most satisfaction from smoking someone's doors off. The Tesla's message is that "green" technology can appeal to the id, not just the superego".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704201404574589900770542192 |work=The Wall Street Journal |title=The Surge in Electric Cars |date=December 16, 2009 |first=Joseph B. |last=White}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, ''Motor Trend'' was the first to independently confirm the Roadster Sport's reported {{convert|0|to|60|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}} time of 3.7 seconds. (''Motor Trend'' recorded {{convert|0|to|60|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}} of 3.70 seconds; it recorded a quarter-mile test at 12.6 sec at {{convert|102.6|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}}). Engineering editor Kim Reynolds called the acceleration "breathtaking" and said the car confirms "Tesla as an actual car company. ...Tesla is the first maker to crack the EV legitimacy barrier in a century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/alternative/112_0912_2010_tesla_roadster_sport_test/specs.html#ixzz0b8yiYKO0 |title=2010 Tesla Roadster Sport Specs |magazine=Motor Trend |accessdate=October 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, ''Automobile Magazine West Coast'' editor Jason Cammisa spent a week driving a production Tesla Roadster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.automobilemag.com/green/reviews/0911_2009_tesla_roadster_electric_car/index.html |title=2009 Electric Tesla Roadster – Electric Convertible Sport Coupe – Automobile Magazine |publisher=Automobilemag.com |accessdate=October 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cammisa was immediately impressed with the acceleration, saying the car "explodes off the line, pulling like a small jet plane. ... It's like driving a Lamborghini with a big V-12 revved over 6000 rpm at all times, waiting to pounce—without the noise, vibration, or misdemeanor arrest for disturbing the peace". He also took the car to [[Infineon Raceway]] in Sonoma, California, and praised the car for its robustness, saying the Roadster:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"wins the Coolest Car I've Ever Driven award. Why? Despite the flat-out sprints, the drag racing, the donuts, the top-speed runs, and dicing through traffic like there's a jet pack strapped to the trunk, [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company|Pacific Gas and Electric]]—which generated power for the Tesla—released into the atmosphere the same amount of carbon dioxide as would a gasoline-powered car getting 99 mpg. And the Roadster didn't break. It didn't smoke, lock up, freeze, or experience [[Flux capacitor|flux-capacitor]] failure. Over the past ten decades, no company has been able to reinvent the car—not General Motors with the EV1, not Toyota with the Prius. And now, a bunch of dudes from Silicon Valley have created an electric car that really works—as both an environmental fix and a speed fix".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2009 the Tesla Roadster was one of the Scandinavian Sports Car of the Year participants. In a comparison made by Nordic car magazines ''[[Tekniikan Maailma]]'' (Finland), ''[[Teknikens Värld]]'' (Sweden) and [[Bil Magasinet|''Bil Magasine''t]] (Denmark), critics praised the torque of the car and a track car structure, but also highlighted more negative aspects such as a short battery life; they were unable to drive a full track lap in dry track conditions.&lt;ref name="tekniikanmaailma.fi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tekniikanmaailma.fi/autot/vertailut/tm-vertailu-scandinavian-sports-car-of-the-year-2009 |title=Scandinavian Sports Car of the Year 2009 |accessdate=March 30, 2011 |year=2009 |work=tekniikanmaailma.fi |language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, ''[[Car and Driver]]'' technical editor Aaron Robinson wrote a review based on the first extended test-drive of a production Tesla Roadster. Robinson had the car for nearly a week at his home. He complained of "design anomalies, daily annoyances, absurd ergonomics, and ridiculous economics " and stated he never got to see if the car could go 240 miles on a single charge because the torturous seating forced him to stop driving the car. He also complained of Tesla increasing the car prices on those who had already made deposits and charging extra for previously free necessary components.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/car/09q2/2009_tesla_roadster-road_test 2009 Tesla Roadster – Road Test], ''Car and Driver'', May 2009. Retrieved August 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, automotive critic Dan Neil of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the production Tesla Roadster "a superb piece of machinery: stiff, well sorted, highly focused, dead-sexy and eerily quick". Neil said he had the car for 24 hours but "caned it like the Taliban caned Gillette salesmen and it never even blinked".&lt;ref&gt;Neil, Dan. [http://articles.latimes.com/2009/feb/06/business/fi-neil6 Tesla Roadster packs power in a flash of electricity], ''Los Angeles Times'', February 6, 2009. Retrieved August 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, ''[[Road &amp; Track]]'' tested another production vehicle and conducted the first independently verified metered testing of the Roadster. Engineering editor Dennis Simanitis said the testing confirmed what he called "extravagant claims", that the Roadster had a 4.0 s {{convert|0|to|60|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}} acceleration and a {{convert|200|mi|order=flip|adj=on}} range. They said the Roadster felt like "an over-ballasted [[Lotus Elise]]", but the weight was well-distributed, so the car remained responsive. "Fit and finish of our Tesla were exemplary", which ''Road &amp; Track'' thought fit the target market. Overall, they considered it a "delight" to drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/article.asp?section_id=10&amp;article_id=7297&amp;page_number=2 | title=World Exclusive: First Complete Test of the 2009 Tesla Roadster | magazine=Road &amp; Track | accessdate=December 21, 2008 | date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testing a pre-production car in early 2008, ''Road &amp; Track'' said "The Tesla feels composed and competent at speed with great turn-in and transitioning response", though they recommended against it as a "primary grocery-getter".&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/article.asp?section_id=2&amp;article_id=6393 |title=First Drive: 2008 Tesla Roadster |magazine=Road &amp; Track |date=March 2008 |accessdate=March 21, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306115842/http://www.roadandtrack.com/article.asp?section_id=2&amp;article_id=6393 |archive-date=March 6, 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, automotive critic Warren Brown of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called the production Roadster "a head-turner, jaw-dropper. It is sexy as all get-out". He described the feeling behind the wheel as, "Wheeeeeee! Drive a Tesla, even if you have to fly to Tesla's Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters, to get your hands on one for a day. ... If this is the future of the automobile, I want it".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Warren. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/23/AR2009012301591.html A Jaw-Dropping Ride, Batteries Included], ''Washington Post'', January 25, 2009. Retrieved August 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of a Roadster prototype before the cars were in serial production, ''[[Motor Trend]]'' gave a generally favorable review in March 2008, stating that, it was "undeniably, unbelievably efficient" and would be "profoundly humbling to just about any rumbling Ferrari or Porsche that makes the mistake of pulling up next to a silent, {{convert|105|mpgus|abbr=on|order=flip}} Tesla Roadster at a stoplight"; however, they detected a "nasty drive-train buck" during the test drive of an early Roadster with the older, two-speed transmission.&lt;ref name="mt"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/alternative/112_0803_2008_tesla_roadster/index.html |title=First Drive: 2008 Tesla Roadster |magazine=Motor Trend |accessdate=March 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a July 8, 2007, review of a prototype Roadster, [[Jay Leno]] wrote, "If you like sports cars and you want to be green, this is the only way to go. The Tesla is a car that you can live with, drive and enjoy as a sports car. I had a brief drive in the car and it was quite impressive. This is an electric car that is fun to drive".&lt;ref name="Times Online UK"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://driving.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/driving/new_car_reviews/article2036260.ece?OTC-HPtoppuff&amp;ATTR=tesla |title=Tesla Roadster&amp;nbsp;– The most fun you can have without fuel |first=Jay |last=Leno |newspaper=The Sunday Times |date=July 8, 2007 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a November 27, 2006, review of a prototype Roadster in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', Paul Boutin wrote, "A week ago, I went for a spin in the fastest, most fun car I've ever ridden in—and that includes the Aston Martin I tried to buy once. I was so excited, in fact, that I decided to take a few days to calm down before writing about it. Well, my waiting period is over, I'm thinking rationally, and I'm still unbelievably stoked about the Tesla".&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2154425/ |title=It's Electric!

=== ''Top Gear'' controversy ===

In the third quarter of 2008, [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|''Top Gear'']]'s [[Jeremy Clarkson]] reviewed two production Roadsters with the v1.5 transmission and described the driving experience with the exclamations "God Almighty! Wave goodbye to the world of dial-up, and say hello to the world of broadband motoring!" and "This car is biblically quick!" when comparing the acceleration versus the car the Roadster was based on, a [[Lotus Elise]]. Clarkson also noted, however, that the handling of the car was not as sharp as that of the Elise: "through the corners things are less rosy".&lt;ref name=Clarkson2009&gt;

[[The Stig]] recorded a time of 1:27.2 on a moist track, faster than a [[Nissan 370Z]] on a dry track but slower than a [[Porsche 911]] C2S also on a damp track, and also slower than the [[Lotus Exige]], Exige S and [[Lotus Evora|Evora]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; the BBC issued a statement saying "the tested Tesla was filmed being pushed into the shed in order to show what would happen if the Roadster had run out of charge.

After several weeks of increasing pressure and inquiries from the BBC, Clarkson wrote a blog entry for ''[[The Times]]'', acknowledging that "Inevitably, the film we had shot was a bit of a mess. There was a handful of shots of a silver car. Some of a grey car". "But as a device for moving you and your things around, it is about as much use as a bag of muddy spinach".&lt;ref name=Clarkson2009/&gt; In the months that followed Clarkson's acknowledgment, the original episode—including the misstatements—reran on BBC America and elsewhere without any editing, though the BBC is still looking into ''Top Gear''{{'}}s journalism standards, according to British media reports.&lt;ref&gt;

The Roadster had a three-year, {{convert|36000|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip|adj=on}} warranty. Tesla also offered an extended powertrain warranty and a battery replacement warranty.

In July 2009, Tesla announced that US consumers could finance the Roadster through [[Bank of America]].

Tesla sold Roadsters directly to customers. It sold them online, in 13 showrooms and over the phone in North America and Europe. Tesla does not operate through franchise dealerships but operates company-owned stores. The company said that it took its retail cues from Apple, Starbucks and other non-automotive retailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/06/05/seven-new-tesla-stores-will-open-soon-one-roadster-makes-it-to|title=Seven new Tesla stores will open soon; one Roadster makes it to Yosemite|website=Autoblog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevin Yu, the director of Tesla Motors Asia Pacific, said Roadsters in Japan had additional yearly taxes for exceeding the width limit of [[Vehicle size class#Japan|normal sized]] cars.

=== Controversy ===

In 2009, Roadster reservation holders who had already placed deposits up to US$50,000 to lock in their orders were informed that their orders had been unlocked and that they had to re-option their ordered vehicles on the threat of losing their spot on the orders list. Tesla then raised the prices of several options, and a new Tesla Roadster with the same set of features that had previously been standard became US$6,700 more expensive than before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/01/20/tesla-raises-prices-on-roadster-options-sparks-controversy-ang/|title=Tesla raises prices on Roadster options, sparks controversy, anger among early adopters|last=Korzeniewski|first=Jeremy|date=January 20, 2009|work=Autoblog|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the high performance charger that was previously claimed to be standard on all vehicles was changed to be an optional feature costing US$3,000, and the previously claimed standard forged alloy wheels became a US$2,300 upgrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.saxton.org/tom_saxton/2009/01/tesla-price-increase.html|title=Tesla Increases Prices on Locked-In Orders|last=Saxton|first=Tom|date=January 15, 2009|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One person who pre-ordered a Tesla Roadster complained:

{{quote|"I am [pre-ordered owner] number 395. I am not a rich person dabbling in a plaything. I thought I was actually doing some good by supporting a company that was moving us to a more sustainable future. I put $50,000 of my own money down on this car in May of 2007. I withstood the delays. I held in there when it almost seemed the company was going bankrupt. Now, after locking in my options, they pull this on me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bad PR: Tesla Forces Pre-Ordered Roadster Owners to Pay More |url=https://forcechange.com/1881/bad-pr-tesla-forces-pre-ordered-roadster-owners-to-pay-more/ |work=ForceChange |date=2009-01-17 |access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The 2020 version of the Roadster was shown in a surprise moment at the end of the [[Tesla Semi]] event on November 16, 2017—during which a Roadster was driven out of the back of one of the semi-truck trailers to the song "[[Sabotage (song)|Sabotage]]".&lt;ref name="barlow"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/new-tesla-roadster|title=The new Tesla Roadster is Formula One car fast|magazine=[[British GQ]] |first=Jason |last=Barlow |authorlink=Jason Barlow|date=November 17, 2017|accessdate=November 21, 2017|quote=Beastie Boys classic "[[Sabotage (song)|Sabotage]]" was playing as the Roadster was disgorged from the Semi's trailer in front of a whooping audience.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musk explained the concept as: "The point of doing this is to give a hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars.

In June 2018, Elon Musk revealed a potential feature called "SpaceX option package" for the Roadster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.autoblog.com/2018/06/09/tesla-roadster-spacex-option-package-performance/ |title=SpaceX option package for 2020 Tesla Roadster could add more performance |first=Jonathon |last=Ramsey |work=Auto Blog |location=US |date=June 9, 2018 |access-date=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would add around ten [[cold gas thruster]]s to the car to improve maneuverability; it would comprise an electric pump to recharge an air tank used to provide [[compressed air]] flowing through [[propelling nozzle]]s to generate a cold jet thrust. The air tanks, based on "composite overwrapped pressure vessel" (COPV) also used in the [[Falcon 9]] and [[Falcon Heavy]] rockets, would replace the back seats. The thrusters would be used to improve cornering, acceleration, top speed, and braking.&lt;ref name=eletrek-2018-06-10&gt;{{cite news |url=https://electrek.co/2018/06/10/tesla-roadster-elon-musk-thruster-backseat/ |title=Elon Musk is serious about adding thrusters to the new Tesla Roadster, the option will replace the back seats |first=Fred |last=Lambert |date= June 10, 2018 |publisher=Electrek |access-date=June 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fortune-2018-06-10&gt;{{cite news |url= http://fortune.com/2018/06/10/musk-tesla-roadster-spacex-rocket-thrusters/ |title= Elon Musk Says Tesla’s Next Roadster Will Feature Actual SpaceX Rocket Thrusters |first=David Z. |last=Morris |publisher=Fortune Magazine |date=June 10, 2018 |access-date=June 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNET-Roadshow-2018-06-11&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/elon-musk-tesla-roadster-thrusters-very-serious/ |title=Elon Musk is 100 percent serious about Roadster thrusters |first=Andrew |last=Krok |publisher=CNET |work=Roadshow |date=June 11, 2018 |access-date=June 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working pressure would be {{convert|10000|psi|bar|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|first=Elon|last=Musk|authorlink=Elon Musk|interviewer=[[Joe Rogan]]|title=Elon Musk|work=[[The Joe Rogan Experience]]|date=September 7, 2018|accessdate=September 8, 2018|url=http://podcasts.joerogan.net/podcasts/elon-musk|issue=1169|format=offset: 1.14:46‒1.15:25|quote=The next generation Roadster, … where you put rocket thrusters on it … ultra high compressed air … cold gas thrusters … electric pump … pump it up to like 10,000 psi … could make it fly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Inside the new Tesla Roadster.jpg|thumb|Second generation Tesla Roadster interior]]
The second-generation Tesla Roadster is a [[2+2 (car body style)|2+2]] [[coupé]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://jalopnik.com/the-new-tesla-roadster-isn-t-actually-a-roadster-1820545274 |title=The New Tesla Roadster Isn’t Actually A Roadster |first=Tom |last=McParland |work=Jalopnik |location=US |date=November 17, 2017 |access-date=March 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a removable [[automobile roof|glass roof]]. It was designed by [[Franz von Holzhausen]], who formerly worked at [[Mazda]] and [[Volkswagen]]. The Roadster has a 2+2 seating arrangements, with smaller rear seats for two passengers.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The Roadster has three electric motors, one in front and two at the rear,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; allowing for [[all-wheel drive]], and [[torque vectoring]] during cornering. Tesla said that the vehicle had a {{cvt|200|kWh}} battery, twice the capacity of the largest battery in an existing Tesla car (in the [[Tesla Model S|Tesla Model S Performance or Long Range Plus]]), and the Roadster a {{convert|620|mi|km|-1|abbr=in|order=flip}} range on one charge at [[controlled-access highway|highway speed]]s. Tesla stated that the torque at wheels was {{Convert|10000|Nm|lbft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}. The rear wheels are larger than the front wheels.&lt;ref name="dow"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://electrek.co/2017/11/20/teslas-next-gen-roadster-technical-analysis/|title=Tesla's Next-Gen Roadster: A (speculative) technical look at the car that will "smack down" gasoline powered cars|date=November 20, 2017|accessdate=November 22, 2017|website=Electrek |first=Jameson |last=Dow |quote=tires on the prototype are Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 325/30ZR21 (104Y) rear and 295/35ZR20 front.

== Performance ==
[[File:Tesla Roadster 2.0 (47619421652).jpg|thumb|Second generation Tesla Roadster (2019)]]

The following claims have been made by Musk for the prototype Roadster's acceleration:
* {{Convert|0|–|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} in 1.9 seconds (without specifying if this includes a 1-foot [[rollout (drag racing)|rollout]] or not, or whether thrusters are used or not)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet |user=elonmusk |last=Musk |first=Elon |number=931407490889084928 |title=0 to 100 km/h in 1.9 |date=November 16, 2017 |access-date=November 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Convert|0|–|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} in 2.1 seconds for the base model before adding rocket thruster option (without specifying if this includes a 1-foot [[rollout (drag racing)|rollout]] or not)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=elonmusk |last=Musk |first=Elon |number=1144241444435238913 |title=2.1 sec 0-60 mph is base model before adding rocket thruster option |date=June 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its claimed {{convert|0|to|1/4|miles|m|-1|order=flip|abbr=in}} time will be under 9 seconds, with a top speed above {{convert|400|km/h|abbr=on|}}.&lt;ref name="Tracy2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nerdist" /&gt; If the production Roadster achieves these performance numbers, it will outperform the [[supercar]]s of 2019 and would set new [[List of fastest production cars by acceleration|production car records]], none of which had yet done better than {{Convert|0|–|100|km/h|abbr=on|}} in 2.0 seconds or 9.0 seconds in the 1/4&amp;nbsp;mile.&lt;ref name="Tracy2017"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://jalopnik.com/heres-what-a-battery-researcher-told-us-about-the-tesla-1820558723 |title=Here's What A Battery Researcher Told Us About The Tesla Roadster's Crazy Performance Claims |last=Tracy |first=David |website=[[Jalopnik]] |access-date=November 18, 2017 |language=en-US |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118090127/https://jalopnik.com/heres-what-a-battery-researcher-told-us-about-the-tesla-1820558723 |archivedate=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nerdist"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://nerdist.com/elon-musk-tesla-semi-roadster/ |title=Elon Musk Unveils Tesla Semi, Roadster in 'Smackdown to Gasoline Cars' |website=Nerdist |date=November 17, 2017 |access-date=November 18, 2017 |language=en |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119075700/https://nerdist.com/elon-musk-tesla-semi-roadster/ |archivedate=November 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the performance, Musk stated, "this is what we are achieving in the prototype", he also indicated the performance may improve in the production model and that the stated numbers refer to the anticipated "base model."&lt;ref name="Tracy2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nerdist" /&gt;

==Analysis==

Research completed by [[Bloomberg L.P.]] indicates that the estimate as to range per charge is optimistic, based on comments from Salim Morsy, electric vehicle analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. In an article titled ''Tesla's Newest Promises Break the Laws of Batteries'', Morsy indicated that the claimed battery capacity would require batteries that would be too large for the Roadster's small frame. "I really don't think the car you saw last week had the full 200 kilowatt hours in it. I don't think it's physically possible to do that right now."&lt;ref name="randall-lippert"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-24/tesla-s-newest-promises-break-the-laws-of-batteries |title=Tesla's Newest Promises Break the Laws of Batteries |first1=Tom |last1=Randall |first2=John |last2=Lippert |work=Bloomberg |date=November 24, 2017 |access-date=June 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morsy's analysis directly contradicts Musk, who stated "this is what we are achieving in the prototype".&lt;ref name="Tracy2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nerdist" /&gt;

Venkat Viswanathan, a [[mechanical engineering]] professor at [[Carnegie Mellon University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/faculty/viswanathan.html |title=Venkat Viswanathan |publisher=Carnegie Mellon University |access-date=June 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; told ''[[Jalopnik]]'' that the 1.9 second figure for {{cvt|0-60|mph|km/h|0|order=flip}} seemed reasonable given the estimated battery weight of {{cvt|833|kg|lb|0}}. He added that the feasibility of the acceleration claim assumed suitable tires would be available for the required traction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://jalopnik.com/heres-what-a-battery-researcher-told-us-about-the-tesla-1820558723 |title=Here's What A Battery Researcher Told Us About The Tesla Roadster's Crazy Performance Claims |first=David |last=Tracy |work=Jalopnik |date=November 17, 2017 |access-date=June 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Elon Musk]] teased a Model 3-based Model Y with falcon-wing doors.&lt;ref name=ars-2015-10-07&gt;{{cite news |url= https://arstechnica.com/cars/2015/10/tesla-model-y-with-falcon-wing-doors-hinted-at-by-elon-musk/ |title= Elon Musk hints at Tesla Model Y with falcon-wing doors |author= Sebastian Anthony |date= 7 October 2015 |work= [[Ars Technica]] |access-date= 15 March 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190330193150/https://arstechnica.com/cars/2015/10/tesla-model-y-with-falcon-wing-doors-hinted-at-by-elon-musk/ |archive-date= 30 March 2019 |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tesla originally announced plans at the unveil to assemble the Model Y at [[Giga Nevada]] (in Sparks, Nevada), along with the battery and drivetrain for the vehicles, unlike the Model 3, where drivetrains and batteries are assembled at Giga Nevada, with final assembly completed at the [[Tesla Factory]] in [[Fremont, California]]. Two months later, in May 2019, Tesla confirmed that they instead plan to shuffle production lines at the Tesla Fremont Factory to make space for Model Y production.&lt;ref name=CNBC-2019-05-29&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kolodny|first1=Lora|title=Tesla is rejiggering its Fremont factory to build the Model Y SUV and a Model S refresh|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/29/tesla-fremont-factory-prepping-for-model-y-production-model-s-refresh.html|website=CNBC|date=29 May 2019|access-date=June 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190602063953/https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/29/tesla-fremont-factory-prepping-for-model-y-production-model-s-refresh.html|archive-date=2 June 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Model Y will also be assembled at [[Giga Shanghai]] in China&lt;ref name=CarAndDriver-2019-03-15&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Capparella|first1=Joey|title=The Tesla Model Y Is the All-Electric Brand's Entry into the Compact-Crossover Fray|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a26828716/tesla-model-y-photos-info/|work=[[Car and Driver]]|date=15 March 2019|access-date=March 14, 2019|magazine=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403044043/https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a26828716/tesla-model-y-photos-info/|archive-date=3 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Giga Berlin]] in Germany.&lt;ref name="electrek20191112" /&gt;

The '''Tesla Cybertruck''' is an [[Electric car|all-electric]], [[battery electric vehicle|battery-powered]], [[light commercial vehicle]] in development by [[Tesla, Inc.]] Three models have been announced, with range estimates of {{convert|250–500|miles|km|round=10|abbr=out}} and an estimated [[0 to 60 mph|0–60 mph time]] of 2.9–6.5 seconds, depending on the model.&lt;ref name=tesla20191122 /&gt;

In mid-2016, Musk outlined the intent for a new kind of consumer pickup truck,&lt;ref name="part-deux-20160720"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Tesla, Inc.|url=https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux?redirect=no|title=Master Plan, Part Deux|first=Elon|last=Musk|date=2016-07-20|access-date=2019-11-16|quote=With the [[Tesla Model 3|Model 3]], a [[Tesla Model Y|future compact SUV]] and a new kind of pickup truck, we plan to address most of the consumer market.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191116060648/https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux%3Fredirect%3Dno|archive-date=16 November 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested using the same [[chassis]] for a van and a pickup truck.&lt;ref name="musk-2016"&gt;{{cite tweet|number=759798110470205440 |first=Elon|last=Musk |authorlink=Elon Musk|user=elonmusk|date=2016-07-31 |title=probably makes sense to build off the pickup truck chassis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late-2017, the size was estimated to be at least that of a [[Ford F-150]], in order to be large enough to enable a "[[wikt:game-changing|game-changing]]" feature.&lt;ref name="musk-2017-12-26"&gt;{{cite tweet|first=Elon|last=Musk |authorlink=Elon Musk|user=elonmusk|date=2017-12-26 |number=945729229001334784 |title=Similar total size.

=== Interior ===
The interior of the prototype unveiled on 21 November 2019 includes a 17-inch center display, seating for 6 using two bench seats with the front middle seat being a fold-down center arm rest, a digital rear-view camera based mirror, a race car style steering yoke, and a dashboard with a surface resembling marble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTw1eOpjHi4 |title=Riding in a Tesla Cybertruck is Unlike Any Other Tesla |first=Ben |last=Sullins |access-date=2019-11-26 |via=YouTube |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191128024045/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTw1eOpjHi4 |archive-date=28 November 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rear middle seat  folds down to allow loading long cargo extending into the cab from the vault (enclosed lockable bed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.teslarati.com/top-10-tesla-cybertruck-hidden-features-you-may-have-missed/|title=Top 10 Tesla Cybertruck hidden features you may have missed|last=Alvarez|first=Simon|date=2019-11-26|website=TESLARATI|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191129150850/https://www.teslarati.com/top-10-tesla-cybertruck-hidden-features-you-may-have-missed/|archive-date=29 November 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "marble look" dashboard of the unveil prototype vehicle was a [[Paper composite panels|paper composite]] material made from "paper, wood-based fibers, natural wood pigments and non-petroleum based resins."&lt;ref name=trati20191125&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-marble-dashboard-paper-material/ |title=Tesla Cybertruck's 'marble' dashboard is actually made from paper and it's genius |work=Teslarati |date=25 November 2019 |access-date=26 November 2019 |first=Joey |last=Klender |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191224051245/https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-marble-dashboard-paper-material/ |archive-date=24 December 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vault (bed) ===
The bed of the truck is {{convert|6.5|ft}} long and similar to a conventional pickup truck bed with tailgate. It has sloped side walls and an integral motorized [[roller shutter]] style [[tonneau]] cover to improve the aerodynamics of the vehicle. Because of the additional security this provides, Tesla terms this {{convert|100|ft3|adj=on}} enclosed space "the vault". It includes [[Solid-state lighting|LED light strips]] along each side, an additional under-floor storage space behind the rear wheels, 110 and 220&amp;nbsp;[[Volt|V]] [[Alternating current|AC]] outlets, and a [[compressed air]] outlet for [[pneumatic tools]].&lt;ref name=Alvarez&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.teslarati.com/top-10-tesla-cybertruck-hidden-features-you-may-have-missed/ |title=Top 10 Tesla Cybertruck hidden features you may have missed |last=Alvarez |first=Simon |date=26 November 2019 |website=Teslarati |language=en-US |access-date=2019-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191129150850/https://www.teslarati.com/top-10-tesla-cybertruck-hidden-features-you-may-have-missed/ |archive-date=29 November 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; One article claims that there is a pass-through to the cabin for long cargo,{{r|Alvarez}} the displayed prototype lacks any corresponding opening in the front of the bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ALL CyberTruck discussion |author=Mongo |date=26 November 2019 |website=Tesla Motors Club |type=forum posting |access-date=2019-11-27 |url=https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/4241098/ |quote=the bed has no pass through that I see}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elon Musk indicated in a tweet that the cabin's climate control will also be available in the vault for uses such as camping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-camping-mode-hvac-truck-bed/|title=Tesla Cybertruck owners will be able to “camp” in the truck bed, says Elon Musk|last=Randell Suba|date=2019-12-18|website=TESLARATI|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218152125/https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-camping-mode-hvac-truck-bed/|archive-date=18 December 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://electrek.co/2019/12/18/tesla-cybertruck-bed-access-2nd-row-great-camping-machine/|title=Tesla Cybertruck's bed accessible from 2nd row, making a great camping machine|last=Dow|first=Jameson|date=2019-12-18|website=Electrek|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218152126/https://electrek.co/2019/12/18/tesla-cybertruck-bed-access-2nd-row-great-camping-machine/|archive-date=18 December 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; One feature demonstrated on the prototype, but not explicitly advertised, is a ramp that extends from the tail gate to the ground for loading cargo.{{cn|date=December 2019}}&lt;!-- it is unclear that this is actually any sort of an intended feature for the production truck; if not, it probably should not be in this section on Features --&gt;

The Cybertruck was unveiled at the Tesla Design Studio in Los Angeles on 21 November 2019.  During the presentation, Musk demonstrated the durability of the vehicle and its materials. Despite successful drop tests conducted on a pane of the specialized 'Tesla armor glass' and a successful pre-show test where a steel ball was thrown at the windows of the truck itself by chief of design [[Franz von Holzhausen]] with apparently no damage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Musk |first1=Elon |title=Franz throws steel ball at Cybertruck window right before launch.

Musk jokingly exclaimed that "the ball didn't make it through" and "we'll fix it in post" after the unexpected outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975475/tesla-cybertruck-announcement-musk-electric-truck-pickup-features-range-price-release-date|title=Elon Musk just announced the new Tesla Cybertruck|last=O'Kane|first=Sean|date=2019-11-21|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2019-11-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191126153855/https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975475/tesla-cybertruck-announcement-musk-electric-truck-pickup-features-range-price-release-date|archive-date=26 November 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later explained that the windows were damaged because in an earlier demonstration, the door was hit by a sledgehammer and that cracked the base of the glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20981489/tesla-cybertruck-glass-window-fail-elon-musk-explanation|title=Elon Musk explains why Tesla's Cybertruck windows smashed during presentation|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Vincent|first=James|date=25 November 2019|access-date=25 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191125123816/https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20981489/tesla-cybertruck-glass-window-fail-elon-musk-explanation|archive-date=25 November 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the presentation, the [[Tesla Cyberquad]], an [[all-terrain vehicle]] (ATV), was driven onto the bed of the Cybertruck using built-in ramps in the [[Trunk (car)#Tailgate|tailgate]]. The Cyberquad was plugged into the Cybertruck's onboard power outlet to charge the Cyberquad batteries. The ATV will be available for sale as an optional package with the Cybertruck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20977300/tesla-atv-electric-features-range-price-release-date-announcement-elon-musk-all-terrain|title=Tesla made an ATV to complement its futuristic Cybertruck|date=21 November 2019|access-date=5 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191125075008/https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20977300/tesla-atv-electric-features-range-price-release-date-announcement-elon-musk-all-terrain|archive-date=25 November 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
The Cybertruck unveiling event was covered heavily by traditional media and online blogs/social media. In social media, many commentators expressed dislike of the sharp contours and unusual exterior of the Cybertruck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/22/tech/cybertruck-tesla-pickup-truck-jokes/index.html |title=Tesla's Cybertruck has become the butt of every internet joke |first=Matt |last=McFarland |work=CNN |location=US |date=22 November 2019 |access-date=27 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191122235642/https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/22/tech/cybertruck-tesla-pickup-truck-jokes/index.html |archive-date=22 November 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
