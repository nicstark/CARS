The '''Chrysler Royal''' is a [[full-size car]] that was produced by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]].

The '''Chrysler Windsor''' is a [[full-size car]] which was built by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] from 1939 through to the 1960s.  The final Chrysler Windsor sold in the United States was produced in 1961, but production in Canada continued until 1966. The Canadian 1961 to 1966 Windsor model was for all intents and purposes the equivalent of the [[Chrysler Newport]] in the United States.

The Windsor was positioned above the entry-level [[Chrysler Royal|Royal]] from 1939 to 1950. With the demise of the Royal for the 1951 model year the Windsor became Chrysler's price leader through to 1960. For the 1961 model year the [[Chrysler Newport]] was made the marque's price leader with the Windsor positioned one level above the Newport. Chrysler replaced the Windsor name in 1962 with the introduction of the non-lettered series [[Chrysler 300 non-letter series|Chrysler 300]].&lt;ref name=Standard_Catalog&gt;Standard Catalog of American Cars, 1946–1975 (Revised 4th Edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Windsor first came out in 1939 as the junior model to the larger Chrysler New Yorker. In 1940, the Windsor came in either long or short wheelbase versions&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; as a 6-passenger sedan, a 6-passenger coupe, a convertible,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1940_Chrysler/1940_Chrysler_Brochure/1940%20Chrysler-22.html |title=Directory Index: Chrysler_and_Imperial/1940_Chrysler/1940_Chrysler_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Victoria sedan, or an 8-passenger sedan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1940_Chrysler/1940_Chrysler_Brochure/1940%20Chrysler-19.html |title=Directory Index: Chrysler_and_Imperial/1940_Chrysler/1940_Chrysler_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; New this year were sealed beam head lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1940_Chrysler/1940_Chrysler_Brochure/1940%20Chrysler-30.html | title = 1940 Chrysler Brochure | publisher = Oldcarbrochures.com | accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Windsor used independent front suspension, 11" brakes, and a X girder truss type frame.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1940"/&gt;

New for 1941 was the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country (1941–1988)#1941–1950|Windsor Six Town and Country]], a station wagon type vehicle designed by David A. Wallace, who was the president of Chrysler at the time.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; Fog lights and bumper crash bars were optional.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;

Production ended in January, 1942,&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; as all automobile companies in the USA switched to war production. The 1942 heralded post-war design, with fenders being better integrated into the overall bodywork.

After the war, the Windsor was put back into production. It was similar to the 1942 models. New things included a [[handbrake]] warning signal that warned that the [[handbrake]] was not fully released,&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1946_Chrysler/1946_Chrysler_Owners_Manual/1946%20Chrysler%20Owners%20Manual-04.html |title=Directory Index: Chrysler_and_Imperial/1946_Chrysler/1946_Chrysler_Owners_Manual |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[grille (motor vehicle)|new grille]]. Tank capacity was 17USgallons.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1946"/&gt; There was full instrumentation.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures2"/&gt;

The Windsor made up 62.9% of the company's sales.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt;

In 1949, for Chrysler's 25th anniversary, Chrysler Windsors were redesigned, however, the styling was "boxier" than the competition.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; New this year was a padded dashboard with sponge rubber for safety.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1949_Chrysler/1949_Chrysler_Brochure/1949%20Chrysler-03.html |title=Directory Index: Chrysler_and_Imperial/1949_Chrysler/1949_Chrysler_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1949 through 1952 Chryslers continued the Highlander trimmed cars which added an interior trimmed in a tartan fabric and leather, available on all bodies except the station wagon. The Highlanders came with most options standard, including full wheel covers and radio.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.allpar.com/cotm/12-08-highlander.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://wildaboutcarsonline.com/members/AardvarkPublisherAttachments/9990548605107/1949_Chrysler_Info_1B.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, the Windsor Traveler Sedan was reintroduced, but only lasted one year.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; The Windsor still had full instrumentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1950_Chrysler/1950_Chrysler_Brochure/1950%20Chrysler-15.html |title=Directory Index: Chrysler_and_Imperial/1950_Chrysler/1950_Chrysler_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Windsor Newport" hardtop coupe bodystyle, seating six and with a three-piece wraparound rear window was new for the year and reserved for the Windsor and [[Chrysler New Yorker|New Yorker]].&lt;ref name=Schrysler&gt;{{Cite book | ref = SCchr | title = Standard Catalog of Chrysler, 1924-1990 | first = John | last = Lee | publisher = Krause Publications, Inc. | location = Iola, WI | pages = 158-159 | date = 1990 | isbn = 0-87341-142-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

1951, the Royal was dropped, and the Windsor became Chrysler's low-priced car.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; The costly egg crate-style grille was deleted in favor of painted metal and two broad chrome strips. The Windsor DeLuxe had an electric clock standard, while electric windows were optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---December/1951-Chrysler-Windsor-Brochure-788767471/1951-Chrysler-Windsor-12-13 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-12-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220123855/http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---December/1951-Chrysler-Windsor-Brochure-788767471/1951-Chrysler-Windsor-12-13 |archive-date=2016-12-20 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the September 1951 issue of Popular Mechanics, readers reported getting an average of 14.1&amp;nbsp;mpg with the Windsor and 98 percent reported liking the padded dashboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=49gDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=Chrysler+Windsor&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiextD-kvDQAhUK4mMKHavqBu0Q6AEINDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Chrysler+Windsor&amp;f=false|title=Popular Mechanics|first=Hearst|last=Magazines|date=1 September 1951|publisher=Hearst Magazines|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, the Chrysler Windsor (along with the rest of the Chrysler line) got new sheet metal and finally a one-piece curved windshield.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; Power steering was a $177 option.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt;

For 1954, the base Windsor was dropped and all that was left was the Windsor DeLuxe.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; The grille was new.

In 1955, all Chrysler cars were completely restyled with styling by [[Virgil Exner]], sharing some visual similarities with the all-new [[Imperial (automobile)#First generation (1955–1956) A Separate Make|Imperial]] which became its own division.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt;

The styling of the Windsor was more rounded and featured wrap around windshields. The word DeLuxe was added to Windsor again. Front head room was {{convert|35|in|mm}}. Rear axle ratio for the 3-speed manual was 3.73.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1955_Chrysler/1955_Chrysler_Folder/1955%20Chrysler-03.html |title=1955 Chrysler Folder |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Windsor made up 64.72% of Chrysler's sales.

For 1956, the "Forward Look" restyling came out, introducing the first tail fins on a Chrysler car.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; Interior trims remained mostly the same, though a new Highway Hi-Fi phonograph player was a new option on the Windsor.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt;

The 1956 edition for the Canadian market featured the Plymouth 303 Poly V-8 Engine, the same one used in the Plymouth Fury and the Canadian Dodge Custom Royal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/world/canada.html|title=Chrysler of Canada - the history and the cars|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1957, Chrysler cars, including the Windsor, were restyled again. This time with taller tailfins with vertical taillights, thinner C-pillars, and a wraparound front bumper. Mid-year, dual headlights became standard.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; Front head room grew to 35.7&amp;nbsp;inches.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; Safety equipment was optional on the Windsor. Unfortunately for Chrysler, 1957 cars were plagued with quality problems, such as breaking [[torsion bar suspension]]s and rust.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt;

In 1958, the Windsor (LC1-L) was moved to the Dodge/DeSoto Firesweep {{convert|122|in|mm|adj=on}} chassis.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; Canadian Windsors still used the longer, {{convert|126|in|mm|adj=on|abbr=out}} chassis and was essentially a rebadged Saratoga (LC2-M), a model which was not sold in Canada this year.&lt;ref name=canadians&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.allpar.com/cars/production/chrysler-canada.html | first = Gerard | last = Wilson | title = Chrysler Cars and Production Numbers, Canada | work = Allpar.com | date = June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; New this year for all Chrysler cars was the new "Auto-Pilot" cruise control system.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; It had two features. One was the speed-warning feature that the driver would turn the knob to set a certain speed.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1958"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1958_Chrysler/1958_Chrysler_Auto-Pilot_Brochure/1958%20Chrysler%20Auto-Pilot%20Brochure-03.html |title=Directory Index: Chrysler_and_Imperial/1958_Chrysler/1958_Chrysler_Auto-Pilot_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, when the driver would start to pass the speed, pressure would be felt in the pedal, letting the driver know that they were going too fast. The other feature was the actual cruise control. It was activated by pressing on the speed-set knob.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1958"/&gt; The Windsor made up 42.36% of Chrysler's sales in 1958.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt;

In 1959, Chrysler started to advertise the car's new wedge-head "B" engines as "Golden Lions" and the cars as "Lion Hearted".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1959_Chrysler/1959_Chrysler_Brochure/1959%20Chrysler-01.html |title=Presenting the Lion-Hearted car that's every inch a new adventure: Chrysler '59 | type = brochure | publisher = Chrysler Division | id = CS-422 |date= 1958 |accessdate=2015-08-29 | page = 1 | location = Detroit | ref = Chry59 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The RB&amp;nbsp;383 produces {{convert|305|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with a twin-barrel carburetor. Lions were used in the advertising, and the cars had lion emblems on the front doors and on the cylinder heads. Air conditioning was a $510 option.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt;

Canadian-built cars did not get the new RB&amp;nbsp;383 engine, but were equipped with the "Low Block" {{convert|361|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine as used in US Dodges and DeSotos. Thus, Canadian Windsors also did not get the "Golden Lion" decorations; instead, they were fitted with three golden crests on the front doors.&lt;ref name=CDNchrysler&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chryslerclub.org/Chryslers%20in%20Canada%20-%201955-%201962.pdf | title = Chrysler Products in Canada, Eh.

In 1960, all Chrysler cars got a unibody frame. A new parking brake was also used,&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures3"/&gt; and the brakes on the Windsor were 11" drums.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures3"/&gt;

In 1961, all Chrysler cars were redesigned.

The '''Chrysler Fifth Avenue''' was a trim level/option package or model name used by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] for its larger sedans from 1979 to 1993.  The Fifth Avenue name was no longer used after 1993 when Chrysler introduced its new LH-platform [[Chrysler New Yorker#Eleventh generation|New Yorker]] and similar [[Chrysler LHS|LHS]]. The title "Fifth Avenue" references a street in [[New York City]] in the [[United States]] which contains many upscale shops and cultural attractions.

==Origin and the "R-Body years"==
[[File:79-81 Chrysler New Yorker 5th Avenue.jpg|thumb|left|1979 R-body Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue]]

The Fifth Avenue name was first used in 1979 on an upmarket sub-model of the R-body [[Chrysler New Yorker]] [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]. This generation of Chrysler, although already smaller than its maximum size in the mid 1970s, remained [[V8 engine|V8]]-powered and [[rear wheel drive]]. The R-body rode on a {{Convert|118.5|in|mm|sing=on}} [[wheelbase]], which was still considerably longer than its downsized [[General Motors|GM]] and [[Ford]] competitors. For 1979, ordering the New Yorker Fifth Avenue Edition package got the buyer a car finished in two-tone beige with matching [[leather]] interior. There was a standard [[landau (car)|landau]] [[vinyl roof]], and somewhat unusual opera windows which opened with the rear doors. The package was so thoroughly color-keyed that even the bumper rub strips were beige. The R-body Fifth Avenues ran for three years, although additional Fifth Avenue colors were added for 1980 and 1981. Adding to an already exclusive model, the 1980 and 1981 Fifth Avenues had the option of a special edition version.  This special edition model was painted a single tone "Nightwatch Blue" with gold pinstriping with a matching blue Landau roof. Of the 7,356 Fifth Avenues built between 1980 and 1981, only 733 were special editions.

Overall production of the R-body New Yorkers was low (less than 75,000 from 1979 through 1981) and Fifth Avenue production was at most 25% of them. Very few exist today, in any condition. Approximately 14 were stretched into limos and several were provided for use during the 1980 winter [[Olympics]] in [[Lake Placid, NY]]. The others were loaned to for use by Hollywood movie studios. A few still exist and are in the hands of collectors.

===ASC LeBaron Fifth Avenue===
[[File:1980 LeBaron 5th Avenue Limited Edition.JPG|thumb|left|1980 M-body Chrysler LeBaron Fifth Avenue]]

In 1980, a Fifth Avenue package was created by ASC (American Sunroof Corporation) for the [[Chrysler LeBaron]], which shared its [[Chrysler M platform]] with the [[Dodge Diplomat]]. This rare option package, produced on 654 LeBarons for the year, included many of the exterior features found on the New Yorker Fifth Avenue in a smaller, more sensible package.

}}

In 1982 the R-body line was discontinued and the New Yorker nameplate transferred to the smaller M-body line. Up to this point, the Chrysler M-body entry had been sold as LeBaron, but that name was moved to a new K-car based FWD line (refer to the [[Chrysler LeBaron]] article for information on the 1977-1981 M-bodies). Following the nameplate swap, the M-body line was consolidated and simplified. 360 V8 engines were gone, as were coupes and station wagons (the K-car LeBaron's coupe and wagon replaced them).

The Fifth Avenue option was still available as a $1,244 option package. It was adapted from the earlier LeBaron's package, with a distinctive vinyl roof, electro-luminescent opera lamps, and a rear fascia adapted from the Dodge Diplomat, albeit modified. Interiors featured button-tufted, pillow-soft seats covered in either "Kimberley velvet" or "[[Corinthian leather]]", choices that would continue unchanged throughout the car's run.  In addition, the carpet was thicker than that offered in the base New Yorker, [[Dodge Diplomat|Diplomat]] and [[Plymouth Gran Fury|Gran Fury/Caravelle Salon]], and the interior had more chrome trim. The Fifth Avenue option also included illuminated entry, AM/FM stereo with a rear amplifier, power door locks, power 6-way driver's seat, power antenna, remote trunk release, dual side mirrors, full undercoating, passenger vanity mirror, tape stripes, locking wire wheel covers, as well as a standard 5.2L (318&amp;nbsp;in³) V8 engine.

1982 was the last year for the optional AM/FM 8-track stereo, and AM/FM stereo with integrated CB. The exterior of a Fifth Avenue Edition New Yorker can be identified from a regular New Yorker by the following: opera lights, hood stripes, and Fifth Avenue Edition badges on the rear door window filler panels—New Yorkers bore "New Yorker" badges.

In another confusing name swap, the New Yorker name was now used for another new K-car line in 1983, the E-body New Yorker and [[Dodge 600]]. The larger M-body car was now called New Yorker Fifth Avenue to distinguish it from the E-bodies. 1983 was the last year M-bodies were made in Canada and the last year for the optional "Chronometer" glovebox-mounted clock, the 225 [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine|Slant-six]] [[Straight-six engine|six-cylinder engine]], and all analog tuned radios and chrome-trimmed pedals.

For 1984 the car was simply called Fifth Avenue, setting the name that would continue for six successful years.  The Fifth Avenue (and its Dodge and Plymouth siblings) would prove to be the last V8-powered, rear wheel drive Chrysler vehicles until the [[Chrysler 300]] was revived in that configuration for 2005.

All Fifth Avenues from 1984 to 1989 were powered by a {{convert|318|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine, with either a two barrel [[carburetor]] making {{Convert|140|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} (in all states except California) or a four barrel rated at {{Convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} (in [[California]]), mated to Chrysler's well-known [[Torqueflite]] three speed [[automatic transmission]].  As this was the largest Chrysler model available, sales took off, especially during 1985-86, when over 100,000 were made each year.

Starting with the 1984 models, Fifth Avenue production was moved from [[Windsor, Ontario]] to [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Beginning in late 1986 through the 1989 model year, they were manufactured at the [[American Motors]] plant in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] (purchased by Chrysler in 1987).

The Fifth Avenue also far outsold its [[Dodge Diplomat]] and [[Plymouth Gran Fury]] siblings, with a much greater proportion of sales going to private customers, despite its higher price tag.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allpar.com/model/dodge-diplomat.html "Dodge Diplomat, Plymouth Gran Fury, Chrysler Lebaron, Town &amp; Country, New Yorker, Fifth Avenue, and Caravelle", allpar.com], retrieved on 2010-01-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Production peaked at 118,000 cars for 1986 and the Fifth Avenue stood out in a by-now K-car dominated lineup as Chrysler's lone concession to traditional RWD American sedans.

Although it takes a trained eye to catch changes in the M-body Fifth Avenue, there were a few during its six-year run:
* 1984 - New Yorker badge replaced by Fifth Avenue badge on trunklid; "Fifth Avenue Edition" badge continues on the rear doors, a new steering wheel was added. The regular Pentastar was replaced by a crystal one and was now used on the hood ornament and steering wheel this would continue through the end. Wiper arms were now black (instead of silver). Engine blocks were also now painted black (previous ones were painted light blue) Optional 10 spoke alloy "Road Wheels" were replaced with new optional "Snowflake" alloy wheels.
* 1985 - New black gearshift knob introduced (1982 to 1984 models have chromed knobs). Turn signal lever is now also black (1984 and below models were interior color keyed) with the exception of models with two-tone paint. A revised 5.2&amp;nbsp;L V8 now had a roller camshaft, swirl-port heads, and a [[carburetor]] changed from a two-barrel Carter to a two-barrel Holley. This increased horsepower from 130 to 140 and torque was also increased to 265 lb-ft (from 230). The interiors were given a make-over with plusher leather seats, headliners, and upgraded door panels featuring larger armrests with the power window switches located on them, as opposed to being on the door panels separately.
* 1986 - New-style ignition key and center high-mounted stop lamp (the latter a federal mandate) introduced. Models with two-tone paint had lower roof lines.
* 1987 - New steering wheel; final year for optional alloy wheels, two-tone paint, and rear stereo amplifier were offered. Also the last year for 17-ounce deep-pile carpeting and the last year the radio, headlight switch and climate control panels were silver.
* 1988 - Vinyl roof restyled; lower edge of sail panel covering extended below chrome window sill moldings. "Fifth Avenue Edition" badge replaced by a crystal Pentastar surrounded by a gold wreath which in 1990 would reappear on the Imperial. Driver's side seat now had a manual recliner (previous models had 6-way power adjusters, but no recliner). Front headrests were more cushioned. The piping around the seats was now stitched material rather than the plastic in previous years.  Some radios were replaced with new ones. Door panels are restyled and new power mirrors are standard. Passenger side dash vents were now interior color-keyed (instead of black with chrome trim). A new overhead console with map lamps, compass/temperature display and sunglasses storage became available.  A driver's side airbag and padded knee bolster affixed below the instrument panel became optional in May.
* 1989 - Final year of production. Driver's side [[airbag]] is standard.  At the time the Fifth Avenue (as well as its M body twins) was one of the only cars that offered an airbag with a tilt steering wheel.

In the AMC television shows ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' and ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', Mike Ehrmantraut drives a black M-body Chrysler Fifth Avenue. During the years 1982-1988, approximately 60 of these cars were stretched into limousines by various coach companies.

1990 saw the previous relationship between New Yorker and Fifth Avenue return, as the Fifth Avenue became a model of the New Yorker. There was some substantive difference, however, as the New Yorker Fifth Avenue used a [[Chrysler Y platform|slightly longer chassis]] than the standard car. The new New Yorker Fifth Avenue's larger interior volume classified it as a full-size model this time; despite having smaller exterior dimensions than the first generation. 1990 also saw the return of [[hidden headlamps]] which when off were concealed behind retractable metal covers. Hidden headlamps had not been available since the 1981 [[Chrysler R platform|R-body]] New Yorker Fifth Avenue. For 1990, Chrysler's new 3.3-liter [[V6]] engine was the standard and only choice, teamed with the company's A-604 four-speed electronic automatic transaxle.  Beginning in 1991, a larger 3.8-liter V-6 became optional.  It delivered the same 147 horsepower as the 3.3, but had more torque.
[[File:ChryslerNewYorker.jpg|thumb|left|1992–1993 Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue]] 

The New Yorker Fifth Avenue's famous seats, long noted for their button-tufted appearance and sofa-like comfort, continued to be offered with the customer's choice of velour or leather, with the former "Corinthian leather" replaced by that of the Mark Cross company. Leather-equipped cars bore the Mark Cross logo on the seats and, externally, on an emblem attached to the brushed aluminum band ahead of the rear door opera windows.

In this form, the New Yorker Fifth Avenue resembled the newly revived [[Chrysler Imperial#1990–1993|Chrysler Imperial]], although some much-needed distinction was provided between the cars when the New Yorker Fifth Avenue (along with its New Yorker Salon linemate) received restyled, rounded-off front and rear ends for the 1992 model year, while the Imperial continued in its original crisply-lined form.

All New Yorker Fifth Avenues of this generation were covered by Chrysler's market-leading "Crystal Key Owner Care Program" which included a 5-year/50,000-mile limited warranty and 7-year/70,000-mile powertrain warranty. A 24-hour toll-free customer service hotline was also provided. The Fifth Avenue name was discontinued at the end of the 1993 model year when the New Yorker was replaced by the redesigned, longer, and more aerodynamic 1994 [[Chrysler New Yorker|New Yorker]] and similar [[Chrysler LHS|LHS]].

===Base prices===

All prices listed are in US$.

*'''1990''' - $20,860  (equal to $39,740 in 2018)

}}Three '''Chrysler Imperial Parade Phaetons''' were produced in 1952 by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] as ceremonial vehicles. They were styled by [[Virgil Exner]] and were in many ways a preview of the new "Forward Look" styling that would debut in 1955 on the newly separate [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]] marque and on other full-size Chryslers.

== Details ==

The cars were based on stretched (to 147.5 in) 1952 [[Chrysler Imperial#1949–1954|Imperial Crown Limousine]] chassis and carried completely custom bodywork with the exception of the 1951 Imperial grille, bumpers and front and rear trim. Almost uniquely for a postwar car, they were dual-cowl [[Phaeton body|phaeton]]s, with separate front and rear passenger compartments, each with its own [[windshield]]. There were no side windows, and the flimsy lightweight [[Dacron]] convertible top covered only the rear compartment. It retracted fully beneath the rear-hinged deck lid when not in use. The rear doors were [[suicide door]]s and had no exterior handles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Strohl |first=Daniel |title=SIA Flashback – Imperial Parade Phaeton |url= https://www.hemmings.com/blog/index.php/2009/01/25/sia-flashback-imperial-parade-phaeton/ |website=www.hemmings.com  |date=25 January 2009 |accessdate=7 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the custom bodywork, the mechanicals were standard top-of-the-line Chrysler for the period, with a [[Chrysler FirePower engine#331|331 cubic inch (5.42 L) FirePower]] [[V8 engine]], [[torque converter]] transmission, and [[power steering]].

Three cars were built. One was for [[New York City]], the second for [[Los Angeles]], and the third was intended to be a gift to the [[White House]], but the gift was refused as against the then rules for receiving gifts. Instead, the third car was nominally based in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] and was used around the country. The cars continued to be owned and serviced by the Chrysler Corporation.

After three years of service, the cars were brought back to the factory in 1955 to be updated to 1956 Imperial appearance, in which form they continue to exist to the present day. The front and rear, including grilles, bumpers and trim, were replaced. Internally, the engines were updated with 4-barrel [[carburetor]]s, and fully automatic [[Powerflite]] transmissions were installed. The cars were all repainted. After the rebuild, the cars were donated to the respective cities.

A revival was introduced by Chrysler as a [[concept car]], called the [[Chrysler Phaeton]] in 1997.

== New York car ==
[[File:Apollo 11 Parade.jpg|thumb|The [[Apollo 11]] astronauts ride in New York's Chrysler Imperial Parade Phaeton in a [[ticker-tape parade]] ]]
The New York car was originally painted in black with a grey interior. In the 1955 rebuild, it was repainted off-white with a red interior. It must have been repainted in black again before the August 11, 1969 parade with the [[Apollo 11]] astronauts as evidenced in the photo. The car remains in the possession of the City of New York, and was rebuilt in the early 1980s. At this time, it was repainted in black again, but retained the red interior.

The Phaeton is still occasionally used for official functions, parades and ceremonies. It has carried many dignitaries, celebrities, and notables over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hu |first=Winnie |title=Your Ride Has Arrived for the Ticker-Tape Parade |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/30/nyregion/parade-car-chrysler-phaeton.html |work=The New York Times |date=30 July 2018 |accessdate=7 May 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Los Angeles car ==

The Los Angeles car was painted cream with a rose interior, and was first used in the 1953 [[Tournament of Roses]] Parade. It was subsequently used up and down the West Coast. In its 1955 rebuild, it was repainted metallic silver-blue with an off-white interior. It can be seen in that form in the [[Li'l Abner (1959 film)|1959 film]] of the Broadway musical [[Li'l Abner (musical)|''Li'l Abner'']], transporting the "General Bullmoose" character. It was later restored and repainted white, retaining its off-white interior. The interior was more recently replaced in red leather. It is still in the possession of the City of [[Los Angeles]] and takes part in official parades and celebrations.

It was apparently the Los Angeles car that was featured in the 1987 Charles Bronson film [[Assassination (1987 film)|''Assassination'']]. It also made an appearance in the 1960 Jerry Lewis film ''[[Cinderfella]]''.
 
The car was also used as Victor Mature's limousine in the Allied Artists production "The Big Circus" .

== Detroit car ==
[[File:1956 Imperial Parade Phaeton - Dwight Eisenhower car - rvr.jpg|thumb|Another view of the Detroit car]]
The Detroit car was originally painted in a metallic green with a natural pigskin interior, and was used in events around the country. It was repainted in desert sand with a red interior in its 1955 rebuild. This Phaeton was sold and ended up in private hands, becoming part of Paul Stern's collection for some time before being sold to the [[Imperial Palace (hotel and casino)|Imperial Palace]] collection in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] where it was displayed for many years. In 2001, with the mass of the Imperial Palace collection being broken up, it was sold to Robert Petersen and is now on display at the [[Petersen Automotive Museum]] in Los Angeles. The car is currently in white with a red interior.

The '''Chrysler Crossfire''' is a [[rear-wheel drive]], two-seat [[sports car]] that was sold by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] and built by [[Karmann]] of Germany for the 2004 to 2008 [[model year]]s.

Developed during the [[Daimler AG#Merger with Chrysler|union of Daimler and Chrysler]], the two-seater is based on the [[Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class (R170)|Mercedes-Benz R170 platform]] which shares 80% of its components with the first generation SLK. The [[Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class (R171)|second generation SLK]] was built on a new R171 platform starting in the 2005 model year; the R170 platform was essentially handed down to Chrysler for use in building the Crossfire. Having initially arrived in 2001 as a [[concept car]] styled by [[Eric Stoddard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Phil |last=Patton |title=From a Bad Marriage, Pretty Babies |newspaper=The New York Times |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/automobiles/27DESIGN.html?ex=1182052800&amp;en=96cb47326aa3af0a&amp;ei=5070 |date=27 May 2007 |accessdate=2 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Chrysler was further refined by Andrew Dyson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Joe |first=Lorio |title=Chrysler Crossfire – Road Test &amp; Review| journal=Automobile |url= http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/coupes/0304_chrysler_crossfire/viewall.html |date=April 2009 |accessdate=15 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before production began in 2003 for 2004 model year sales.

==Design ==

The name "Crossfire" refers to the two [[character line]]s that run from front to rear along the body sides — their crease directions cross below the mirrors on the door panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Odell |first=John |title=Chrysler Crossfire: Los Angeles Times's view |url= https://www.cars.com/reviews/los-angeles-timess-view-1420689204923/ |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |publisher=cars.com |date=28 May 2003 |accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conceived during the period of [[Chrysler]]'s ownership by [[Daimler-Benz]], the name also refers to the collaboration of the two companies.

[[File:Chrysler Crossfire Red Coupe2.JPG|thumb|The "crossfire" character lines of the bodyside change direction of their creases on the door]]

The Chrysler Crossfire [[concept car]] was introduced at the 2001 [[North American International Auto Show]] and the production version unveiled at the 2002 [[LA Auto Show|Los Angeles Auto Show]] as a 2004 model "is as faithful a translation from concept to production as any in recent memory."&lt;ref name="Wyss"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wyss |first=Wallace A. |title=Chrysler Crossfire - Car News |url= https://www.caranddriver.com/news/chrysler-crossfire-car-news |publisher=Car and Driver |date=April 2003 |accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preview: '04 Chrysler Crossfire |url= https://www.thecarconnection.com/tips-article/1003379_preview-04-chrysler-crossfire |publisher=The Car Connection |date=7 January 2002 |accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept car was made "to evoke a strong, passionate, emotional response. We had to retain that.

== Construction and features ==
[[File:Chrysler Crossfire roadster yellow FL rear.jpg|thumb|Roadster with the top down]]

Chrysler executed the interior and exterior styling. All other elements of the car such as [[wheelbase]], track, [[engine]], [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], [[chassis]] structure, [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] components, are shared with the [[Mercedes-Benz R170|R170 platform]].&lt;ref name="Edmonson"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2003-09-28/daimlerchrysler-stalled |first=Gail |last=Edmonson |first2=Kathleen |last2=Kerwin |date=29 September 2003 |title=DaimlerChrysler: Stalled |publisher=BusinessWeek |accessdate=2 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the engine bay of the Crossfire, which is virtually identical to the [[Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class|Mercedes-Benz SLK320]] on the [[Mercedes-Benz R170|R170 platform]]. The seats from the Mercedes-Benz SLK320 would bolt directly into the Crossfire chassis. The dashboard layout, controls and instruments are also similar to those on the Mercedes-Benz SLK320.

The standard [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] is a 6-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] with an optional 5-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]. Base (Standard) and Limited models, originally sold beginning in the 2004 model year, are equipped with a Mercedes-Benz M112 3.2&amp;nbsp;L, 18-[[valve]], [[Overhead camshaft|SOHC]] [[V6 engine]] which produced {{convert|215|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|229|lb·ft|N·m|0}} of [[torque]]. SRT-6 models were equipped with a supercharged version of the M112 engine built by Mercedes' performance branch, [[Mercedes-AMG|AMG]]. SRT-6 models came only with the 5-speed automatic transmission, consistent with AMG cars of the same era. The 6-speed transmission used by the Chrysler Crossfire is a variant of the Mercedes sourced [[Chrysler NSG370 transmission|NSG-370]]. The 5-speed automatic transmission in the Crossfire (known as [[Mercedes-Benz 5G-Tronic transmission|5G-Tronic]]) is also Mercedes sourced and a variant of the 722.6 family. The automatic achieves a better EPA fuel efficiency rating over the 6MT, mostly due to the difference in gear ratios.

Unlike most cars of its time, the Crossfire does not use a [[rack and pinion]] steering system; instead, it utilizes a [[recirculating ball]] system as employed on the donor [[Mercedes-Benz R170|R170 platform]].&lt;ref name="Edmonson"/&gt; Front suspension is unequal length (SLA) double wishbone suspension with 5 point multi link in the rear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Joe |last=Lorio |date=April 2009 |title=Chrysler Crossfire – Road Test &amp; Review |journal=Automobile |url= http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/coupes/0304_chrysler_crossfire/index.html |accessdate=15 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Just like the concept car, all Crossfire models were built with two different wheel sizes measuring 18x7.5-inch on the front and 19x9-inch on the rear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart |first=Ben |title=Automotive: Reports From Around The World |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=June 2003 |volume=180 |issue=6 |page=50 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AdEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=Chrysler+true+to+crossfire+concept+front+and+19-in.+wheels |accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standard all-season tires were 225/40R18 on the front and 255/35R19 on the rear.

The first production Crossfire was driven off the assembly line on 3 February 2003, by Chrysler Group's COO [[Wolfgang Bernhard]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://business.highbeam.com/3574/article-1G1-98188423/chrysler-group-coo-wolfgang-bernard-drives-first-allnew |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160107104234/https://business.highbeam.com/3574/article-1G1-98188423/chrysler-group-coo-wolfgang-bernard-drives-first-allnew |url-status= dead |archive-date= 7 January 2016 |title=hrysler Group COO Wolfgang Bernhard drives first, all-new 2004 Chrysler Crossfire off the production line |date=3 February 2003 |publisher=business.highbeam.com |accessdate=3 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chrysler Crossfire SRT6 2005 AMG Engine.jpg|right|thumb|Chrysler Crossfire 2005 SRT-6 with Mercedes-AMG Engine]]

== Equipment ==

The Chrysler Crossfire's standard features included large alloy wheels with performance-rated tires, a [[Harman Kardon|Becker (part of Harman/Kardon)]]–sourced AM/FM stereo with anti-theft system and a single-disc CD player, keyless entry with security alarm, a power-retractable rear wing spoiler, leather-trimmed seating surfaces, dual power front sports bucket seats, full instrumentation, a 3.2L V6 engine with manual transmission, rear-wheel-drive (RWD), a leather-wrapped and stitched steering wheel, a power-retractable cloth convertible roof (for convertible models), front floor mats, and air conditioning.

Optional features on the Chrysler Crossfire included an automatic transmission, a six-speaker premium [[Infinity (audio)|Infinity]] sound system with two "subwoofers" mounted directly behind each seat, a CD-based GPS navigational system, exterior paint colors, and additional interior color choices.

== Sales and production numbers ==

The original contract with Karmann to build the Crossfire was for about five years with an annual sales target of 20,000 units in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USA: Chrysler's Crossfire 'halo' car has doubtful future|url= https://www.just-auto.com/news/chryslers-crossfire-halo-car-has-doubtful-future_id74248.aspx|publisher=just-auto|accessdate=24 November 2017|date=30 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales of the Crossfire were slow, with an average 230-day supply of the vehicles during November 2005. A small number of Crossfires were imported to the United States and Mexico for 2006 (and almost all of these were roadsters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-11826007_ITM |title=Overstock.com Announces New Marketing Partnership With Chrysler Group |publisher=Overstock.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210163409/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-11826007_ITM |archivedate=February 10, 2009 |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrysler discontinued the Crossfire after the 2008 model year, as part of its restructuring plans.&lt;ref name="chrysler_job_cuts"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071101/ap_on_bi_ge/chrysler_job_cuts |title=Chrysler to cut up to 12,000 jobs |agency=Associated Press |first=Dee-Ann |last=Durbin |date=1 November 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071103060124/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071101/ap_on_bi_ge/chrysler_job_cuts |archivedate=November 3, 2007 |accessdate=2 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last Crossfire rolled off of the assembly line on December 17, 2007.

===Base and Limited ===
For the first model year (2004), only the coupe was offered (with no trim levels), equipped quite similarly to the next year's Limited model. In model year 2005, there were two models available; Coupe and Roadster, each with three trim levels: Base (with fewer amenities), Limited, and SRT-6 (supercharged). There was an SE Roadster model (essentially a base model) in 2006-2007 available only in Blaze Red Crystal Pearl and with black accented 15-spoke SRT-6 style wheels. Base Crossfire models, both Coupe and Roadster, have black painted windshield frames, black filler plugs (in place of fog-lights) in the front fascia, and fabric seats with separate, movable headrests. Limited and SRT-6 models, both Coupe and Roadster, all have silver painted windshield frames and are equipped with fog lights. The Limited has leather upholstery. The SRT-6 model has unique Leather/Alcantara upholstery. All Base and Limited Crossfire models included an electronic wing on the back hatch that would go up at about 65 mph and comes back down at 45 mph. The wing had a manual switch to raise it and lower it at any speed. 

=== SRT-6 ===
{{See also|Street and Racing Technology}}
[[File:2005 Chrysler Crossfire SRT6 AeroBlue-right.jpg|thumb|right|2005 Crossfire SRT-6 Coupe in Aero Blue]]

The SRT-6 trim level, as both [[coupé|coupe]] and [[convertible (car)|convertible]], featured an [[Mercedes-Benz M112 engine|Mercedes-Benz AMG M112 3.2L V6]] [[supercharger|supercharged]] engine delivering {{convert|330|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|310|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.&lt;ref name="2006specSRT6"/&gt; Other SRT-6 model-specific features included [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] and [[brake]] modifications, a front fascia air dam and a fixed rear [[spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]]. The Crossfire SRT-6 model used the same drivetrain, suspension, and braking components as those used on the [[Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class#R170 facelift .282000.29|Mercedes-Benz SLK 32 AMG]]. The standard tires were upgraded to Z-rated Michelin Pilot Sports, sized 225/40R18 on the front and 255/35R19s in back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New Cars and Trucks Buyer's Guide |year=2006 |publisher=Edmunds |page=217 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AvoIAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=with+Z-rated+225/40R18+Michelin+Pilot+Sports+and+19s+in+back+with+255/35+rubber |accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The SRT-6 cars did not feature the electronic wing that the Base and Standard cars featured. 

In 2006, the SRT-6 was changed to special order only.

The '''Chrysler E-Class''' was a [[mid-size car]] produced by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]]. Introduced in 1983 on a [[Chrysler E platform|stretched version]] of the [[Chrysler K platform]], the E-Class was a less expensive, less equipped version of the similar 1983 [[Chrysler New Yorker|New Yorker]].

==History==
The Chrysler E-Class was targeted at those who wanted Chrysler luxury at a more affordable price than the flagship New Yorker. Due to this reason, the E-Class is the ''de facto'' replacement for the 1981 [[Chrysler Newport|Newport]], which had been Chrysler's cheaper, more basic version of the New Yorker. The E-Class was originally to be called the "Grand LeBaron",&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of American Cars "Chrysler" p.255: "Chrysler Vehicles."&lt;/ref&gt; however Chrysler decided to name it "E-Class" in reference to the new [[Chrysler E platform|E-platform]].

The E-Class came with a number of features and options including a cassette player, split 50/50 front bench with middle seat mounted console, woodgrain interior trim, two-tone exterior paint, power window &amp; door locks, and air conditioning. Engines were the [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2&amp;nbsp;L naturally aspirated I4]] and the [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]] 2.6&amp;nbsp;L I4. 1984 saw the debut of [[fuel injection]] on the 2.2&amp;nbsp;L engine and an optional [[Garrett AiResearch]] T-03 [[turbocharger]]. Larger, wraparound tail lights were also added for 1984.

The E-Class however, was not a sales success. Sales of the more expensive New Yorker were nearly double the E-Class's sales for 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of American Cars "Chrysler" p.279: "Chrysler Production Figures."&lt;/ref&gt; Its slow sales caused it to be dropped from Chrysler's lineup after only two years on the market. Rather than discontinue a lower-priced model to be sold on [[Chrysler-Plymouth]] lots, Chrysler gave the car a minor refreshment (it lost the waterfall grille and crystal pentastar hood ornament) and transferred it to [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]]'s lineup, where it became the [[Plymouth Caravelle|Caravelle]] for 1985.

The '''Chrysler Sigma''' is a version of the [[Mitsubishi Galant]] automobile that was built by [[Chrysler Australia]] in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] from 1977. When [[Mitsubishi Motors Australia]] (MMAL) took over Chrysler Australia's manufacturing facilities in 1980, they renamed the vehicle the '''Mitsubishi Sigma'''. The range was progressively discontinued and replaced by the [[Mitsubishi Magna]], starting with the sedan in 1985 and the wagon in 1987.

Chrysler launched the GE series Sigma in October 1977 to replace the outgoing [[Mitsubishi Galant#GD|GD Galant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/carfamilytree?ReadForm&amp;make=Mitsubishi&amp;model=Galant |title=Mitsubishi Galant – Used Car Research |work=GoAuto |access-date=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assembly occurred at the [[Clovelly Park, South Australia|Tonsley Park, Adelaide]] plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/186921597 |title=Sigma success story |newspaper=Victor Harbour Times |date=18 June 1980 |page=23 |access-date=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sigma SE offered equipment including five-position, reclining rear seats.&lt;ref name="New Chrysler Sigma: the total sum"/&gt; An interior boot lid release, roof console (incorporating dome lamp, map reading lamp, seat belt and door ajar warning lamps), steel belt [[radial tire|radial ply tyres]], laminated windscreen, distinctive grille, smoked glass on all instrument dials, front seat back pockets, and ''Ivanhoe'' cloth trim were also standard with the SE (with leather optional).&lt;ref name="New Chrysler Sigma: the total sum"/&gt; The SE was further distinguished by its body-coloured [[hubcap]]s with silver trim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tocmp.com/brochures/Chrysler/1977/Sigma-Aus/images/brochurege01pg02_jpg.jpg |title=Chrysler Sigma (GE) brochure |publisher=[[Chrysler Australia]] |date=September 1977 |page=2 |access-date=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From launch, Chrysler also offered a "Sportspack" option for the GL 2.0-litre.&lt;ref name="Chrysler Sigma (GE) brochure, September 1977, p. 15"/&gt; This included exterior striping, [[halogen lamp|quartz-halogen high-beam headlights]], a sports [[steering wheel]], low-fuel warning light, [[tachometer]] and steel belted radial tyres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Davis |first=Pedr |date=7 February 1978 |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/131714372 |title=Five-speed Sigma a surprise |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |page=14 |access-date=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1978, a Japanese-made, two-door [[coupé]] version called the "Sigma Scorpion" was released—based on the [[Mitsubishi Galant Lambda]].&lt;ref name="New Scorpion unveiled"/&gt; Although the Sigma Scorpion shared many common engine and mechanical components with the sedan, all body panels and most interior features were unique to the coupe.&lt;ref name="New Scorpion unveiled"/&gt; On 12 October 1978, a [[station wagon]] body variant of the Sigma was released—available in Galant, GL, and SE trims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/186913383 |title=New Sigma wagon – a winning formula |newspaper=Victor Harbour Times |date=12 October 1978 |page=10 |access-date=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 April 1980, Chrysler unveiled the GH Sigma in [[Brisbane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=de Fraga |first1=Christopher |last2=Porter |first2=Ian |date=29 April 1980 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XuBUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=u5IDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3203,6651465 |title=Chrysler might lift output |newspaper=[[The Age]] |page=30 |access-date=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then on 30 April, [[Mitsubishi Corporation]] and [[Mitsubishi Motors]] jointly acquired [[Chrysler]]'s remaining 65&amp;nbsp;percent share of Chrysler Australia (bringing the dual Mitsubishi ownership to 98.9&amp;nbsp;percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Port |first=Ian |date=1 May 1980 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=A_dUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AJMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3321,170275 |title=Chrysler sold for a song |newspaper=[[The Age]] |page=19 |access-date=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Robertson |first=David |date=1 May 1980 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kv9jAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4-YDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3021,116186 |title=$52m deal on Chrysler |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |page=11 |access-date=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 October 1980, the GH range was rebadged from Chrysler Sigma to Mitsubishi Sigma, due to the renaming of Chrysler Australia to [[Mitsubishi Motors Australia]] (MMAL) following the buy-out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Davis |first=Tony |date=11 March 1994 |url=http://www.carrentaladelaide.com.au/car-rental-adelaide-articles/1994/3/11/diamonds-are-for-export/ |title=Diamonds Are For Export |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510025552/http://www.carrentaladelaide.com.au/car-rental-adelaide-articles/1994/3/11/diamonds-are-for-export/ |archive-date=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Released to the market on 12 May, the GH series saw a considerable facelift on both front and rear ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/110959529 |title=New Sigma handles better on less fuel |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=27 May 1980 |page=14 |access-date=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it was only introduced to Australia in 1980, the facelift actually appeared on the Japanese home market Galant models and on New Zealand assembled Mitsubishi Sigma models in 1979.

The mechanical layout was as before except for addition of a five-speed manual for the 2.6-litre model (with automatic exiled to the options list).&lt;ref name="New Sigma models unveiled at Victor"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/186921144 |title=New Sigma models unveiled at Victor |newspaper=Victor Harbour Times |date=14 May 1980 |page=10 |access-date=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The base model was now simply called "Sigma" instead of "Sigma Galant".

A GLX model was placed between GL and SE level and was advertised as a "sports pack". A limited run of 1,016 "Peter Wherrett" editions of the GLX were built (option A05), named after Australian motoring journalist [[Peter Wherrett]] who was given the task of improving the [[car handling|handling]] of the Sigma by MMAL after complaining about it. The improvements included 15-inch Globe "Montego" [[alloy wheel]]s fitted with [[Pirelli]] P6 tyres, [[Recaro]] seats, [[Momo (company)|Momo]] [[steering wheel]], Sonic extractors, as well as lowered [[coil springs]] and [[Bilstein Shock Absorbers|Bilstein shock absorber]]s.

Mitsubishi released a limited edition, GL-based Sigma Satellite in c. April 1981, adding two-tone paint (available in three combinations), unique hubcaps, a soft grip sports steering wheel, cloth upholstery, full [[window film|tinted glass]] including [[laminated glass|laminated windscreen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/126831198 |title=Advertisement: Limited edition Sigma. So rare, some people will do anything to get their hands on one |publisher=[[Mitsubishi Motors Australia]] |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=2 April 1981 |page=6 |access-date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1981, in partnership with [[turbocharger]] specialists [[Garrett AiResearch|Normalair-Garrett]], Mitsubishi produced a limited run of 500 Sigma Turbos, the first Australian-built turbocharged production car. The forced-induction 2.0-litre ''Astron'' powerplant produced {{convert|116|kW|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|235|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}}. Mitsubishi discontinued the GH series in February 1982.

[[File:1983 Mitsubishi Sigma (GJ) SE station wagon (2009-04-07).jpg|thumb|Mitsubishi Sigma (GJ) SE station wagon]]

The redesigned GJ Sigma was released in March 1982, based on the 1980 [[Japanese domestic market]] Mitsubishi Galant. While a complete redevelopment was done for the sedan models, the wagon models in fact were new only from the firewall forward—the rest of the bodyshell was still GH based. Engine and transmission offerings remained as before, but received power and torque boosts; the 2.0-litre now produced {{convert|70|kW|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|152|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} and the 2.6-litre {{convert|76|kW|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|192|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}}.

In February 1983, Mitsubishi launched a special edition Sigma GL Satellite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/116450693 |title=Advertisement: Sigma Satellite Limited Edition |publisher=[[Mitsubishi Motors Australia]] |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=17 February 1983 |page=8 |access-date=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Priced $1,000 below the GL luxury level, the Satellite was built in sedan and wagon versions, with air conditioning, five-speed manual or automatic transmission all as options.&lt;ref name="Latest Sigma the best yet"&gt;{{cite news |last=Davis |first=Pedr |date=8 March 1983 |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/116372589 |title=Latest Sigma the best yet |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |page=10 |access-date=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, two-tone paintwork, a laminated windscreen, AM/FM radio, adjustable steering column, intermittent windscreen wipers and a heated rear window were fitted as standard equipment.&lt;ref name="Latest Sigma the best yet"/&gt;

The SE model featured cut pile carpets, a [[tachometer]], overhead reading lamps, door step lamps, rear footwell lamps, four-speaker AM/FM/[[MPX filter|MPX]] stereo radio/cassette system, remote boot and fuel cap releases, adjustable lumbar support and tilt for the driver seat, and tinted side windows.&lt;ref name="New Sigma Super Saloon"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/186020490 |title=New Sigma 'Super Saloon' |newspaper=Victor Harbour Times |date=16 November 1983 |page=26 |access-date=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1982 Mitsubishi Sigma (GJ) GL sedan (2015-07-14) 02.jpg|thumb|left|Mitsubishi Sigma (GJ) GL sedan]]

A sporting model, the Sigma GSR, was also released with either 2.0 or 2.6-litre engines offered with either [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] or [[manual transmission]]s. Features included alloy wheels, four-wheel [[disc brake]]s, a sports steering wheel and blackouts, particularly on the window frames and doorhandles.

June 1983 saw the entry-level Sigma rebadged as the Sigma XL, to coincide with the trim level designations on MMAL's small car, the Colt.

October 1983 saw the release of the luxurious, Sigma Super Saloon.&lt;ref name="Limited-edition luxury Sigma"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gover |first=Paul |date=1 November 1983 |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/116392928 |title=Limited-edition luxury Sigma |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |page=12 |access-date=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Produced as a limited edition of 500 cars and placed above the SE trim level from which it derives, it came only with the 2.6-litre in either five-speed manual or three-speed automatic.&lt;ref name="New Sigma Super Saloon"/&gt; The five-speed manual fitted was of Japanese origin, rather than the [[Drivetrain Systems International|BorgWarner Australia]] unit previously fitted to Sigmas, and the suspension received a re-tune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gover |first=Paul |date=3 January 1984 |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/116382520 |title=Improvements for Sigma |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |page=13 |access-date=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Super Saloon featured two-tone metallic paint and crushed velour upholstery for the interior.&lt;ref name="New Sigma Super Saloon"/&gt; Two paint and trim combinations were offered—blue upper body with silver lower body and blue interior—or dark brown/light brown exterior with a bronze interior.&lt;ref name="New Sigma Super Saloon"/&gt; The Super Saloon introduced standard [[power steering]], [[power window]]s and [[central locking]]—features that also became optional on Sigma GL, SE, and GSR trims.&lt;ref name="Limited-edition luxury Sigma"/&gt; The central floor console was also revised to accommodate the power window and central door locking switches.&lt;ref name="New Sigma Super Saloon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Limited-edition luxury Sigma"/&gt; Other equipment fitted to the Super Saloon included air conditioning, alloy wheels, and four-wheel [[disc brake]]s.&lt;ref name="Limited-edition luxury Sigma"/&gt;

The GJ series Sigma had the distinction of being the only Australian car during the 1980s to be exported to Europe (Chrysler previously did this with the Australian [[Chrysler Valiant|Valiant]]). The car was sold in the United Kingdom, in both sedan and wagon models, under the marque [[Lonsdale (car)|Lonsdale]].

The GK Series was released in March 1984. It was a comprehensive facelift, both outside and in. Externally the GK was changed by having a new [[Hood (vehicle)|bonnet]] and a shallower [[grille]], while at the rear new [[Automotive lighting#Rear position lamps (tail lamps)|taillight]] clusters (which had actually appeared in certain overseas markets in 1982) and rear valance were fitted, the [[Vehicle registration plate|registration plate]] being relocated below the [[Bumper (automobile)|bumper]]. Internally the specifications and trim of the models had changed. Seats were different in certain models, particularly the GL, and all models had the option of power windows (although rare), an option not available in most previous models.

The Sigma XL was the entry-level model of the range and came with either the 1.6 or 2.0-litre engines. In the SE, [[velour]] seats with lumbar control, adjustable [[head restraint|headrests]] and a fold-down rear seat armrest with [[Trunk (automobile)|boot]] access were fitted. Reading lights incorporated into the roof-mounted dome light and built into the rear pillars were now a stock feature on the SE model Sigma. Power assisted steering was also an option along with electric windows. The SE model Sigma had stock dual line striping around the car, with chrome bonnet indicators.

Chrome detailing (around gauges and air vents, which often had a tendency to peel off) was replaced by black painting, and the door trim was now two-tone in certain models. A few other slight changes were included in the GK Sigma, for example, the boot was fully lined with carpet and also featured a plastic protector for the lights. A painted boot with only base carpet was used in the GN Sigma, with no plastic light protector. Also, red courtesy lights were built into the bottom of the doors on the SE model.

As for the mechanics of the car, the GK was unchanged from the GJ, while the SE model featured rear disc brakes as standard. The GSR received a sportier front [[Spoiler (automotive)|air dam]], rear [[spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] and 15-inch alloy wheels and was only available with the 2.6-litre engine and five-speed manual transmission. The GSR Sigma also had a sports steering wheel, black door frames and door handles and came standard with rear disc brakes.

In July 1984, Mitsubishi reintroduced the Super Saloon trim level, again based on the Sigma SE sedan and incorporating luxury items normally offered as options.&lt;ref name="Top-line model introduced"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gover |first=Paul |date=3 July 1984 |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/127211858 |title=Top-line model introduced |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |page=12 |access-date=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GK Super Saloon generally followed the GJ's structure, although changes included new [[corduroy]] trim and stereo system with [[Compact Cassette]] facility, AM/FM scan tuning, and digital display.&lt;ref name="Top-line model introduced"/&gt; Mitsubishi also introduced a limited edition GK Sigma Satellite in late 1984, based on the XL but with the 2.6-litre engine and five-speed manual (or automatic optional), side stripes with Satellite badge identification, cloth-trimmed upholstery, AM/FM/MPX radio with dual speakers, distinguished wheel trim, additional [[soundproofing|silencing]], tinted [[windscreen]], and [[defogger|heated rear window]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/201144948 |title=Advertisement: Launch yourself into a new Sigma Satellite and take off $1022 |newspaper=Victor Harbour Times |publisher=Southern Mitsubishi |date=24 October 1984 |page=9 |access-date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1985-1987 Mitsubishi Sigma (GN) GL 2.6 station wagon (22563531348).jpg|thumb|right|Mitsubishi Sigma (GN) GL wagon]]
Released in July 1985, the GN was an update, but also a rationalization of the previous Sigma range due to only being offered in GL trim. The range was rationalized due to the April 1985 release of the [[Mitsubishi Magna]] [[front-wheel drive]] range, which was developed eventually to replace the Sigma in Australia.

[[File:1987 Mitsubishi Sigma (GN) GL 2.6 sedan (28671220015).jpg |thumb|left|Mitsubishi Sigma (GN) GL sedan]]

The GN range had a number of external trim changes over its predecessors, notably a black trim line around the base of the body, and the deletion of the wrap-round chrome strip seen on the previous model. The grille was remodelled, resembling the SE grille of the previous model, and new hubcaps were used with alloy wheels from the previous SE models optional. The largest change however, concerned the wagon models. To freshen the model before the impending release of the Magna wagon (which was being developed at that time, for a 1987 release), a new higher roof (dubbed "high roof") was developed for the car, which helped to improve the car's overall cabin space. It gave the wagon a unique appearance from its predecessors, particularly as it incorporated a roof-mounted spoiler.

Engine-wise, the GN Sigma was offered either with the ''Astron'' 2.0-litre ({{convert|70|kW|hp|abbr=on}} at 5600&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|152|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} at 2400&amp;nbsp;rpm) or the ''Astron II'' 2.6-litre ({{convert|83|kW|hp|abbr=on}} at 5200&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|200|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} at 2400&amp;nbsp;rpm) units. The ''Astron II'' had a few changes over the previous models, notably a newly designed head with [[hydraulic tappet]]s (replacing the manual [[tappet]]s in previous ''Astron''s) and flat-top [[piston]]s. The oil pressure switch was now located at the rear of the [[cylinder block]]. In December 1985, the 2.0-litre versions were dropped, as Mitsubishi did not believe it warranted the conversion to unleaded fuel. Unleaded was introduced in Australia in January 1986.

Mitsubishi launched GL Satellite limited editions of the GN series in c. October 1986, adding air conditioning, unique striping, headlamp protectors, front and rear [[mudflap]]s, tilt adjustable steering column, remote control tailgate (for wagons) and side mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/118268392 |title=Advertisement: Out of this world savings. Launch yourself into a Satellite |publisher=[[Mitsubishi Motors Australia]] |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=11 October 1986 |page=6 |access-date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "high roof" Sigma wagon was an export model for MMAL. During 1986–1987 station wagons were shipped to New Zealand, due to that market's demand for wagon models. Although they were of a previous generation to the front-wheel drive Mitsubishi Sigma sedan (which was similar, but of a narrower bodyshell to the Magna, and fitted with smaller engines) range being sold in New Zealand, they proved popular, particularly with [[fleet vehicle|fleets]].

This final generation of the Sigma ceased production in early 1987, due to the release of the Magna wagon models, completing the overall Magna range.

The '''Chrysler LeBaron''' (or '''Chrysler Imperial LeBaron''') was originally a classic luxury car of the 1930s, the body manufactured by [[LeBaron Incorporated|LeBaron]], its chassis manufactured by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]], which competed with other luxury cars of the era such as [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]] and [[Packard]]. LeBaron was purchased by Chrysler in 1953 along with its parent [[Briggs Manufacturing Company]]. The LeBaron has become one of the longest running nameplates in Chrysler history. The first LeBaron models were designated as the top-of-the-line 1957 through 1975 [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]]s. The '''Chrysler LeBaron''' was reintroduced in 1977 to add prestige to the Chrysler Division's lowest priced model, which was a mid-size entry and the name was featured on numerous Chryslers until 1995. The "LeBaron" name has since been applied to five different cars built by the Chrysler Division:
* 1977–1981 [[Chrysler M platform|M-body]] [[Mid-size]] LeBaron sedan, [[coupe]], and wagon
* 1982–1988 [[Chrysler K platform|K-body]] [[Mid-size]] LeBaron sedan, coupe, convertible, and wagon
* 1985–1989 [[Chrysler K platform|H-body]] [[Mid-size]] LeBaron GTS hatchback
* 1987–1995 [[Chrysler J platform|J-body]] [[Personal luxury]] LeBaron coupe and convertible
* 1990–1994 [[Chrysler K platform|AA-body]] [[Mid-size]] LeBaron sedan

[[LeBaron Incorporated|LeBaron]] was one of the many prominent [[coachbuilder]]s in the 1920s and 1930s to provide bodies for luxury cars.  It was founded in Bridgeport, Connecticut in 1920 by [[Hibbard &amp; Darrin|Thomas L. Hibbard]] and [[Dietrich Inc.|Raymond H. Dietrich]]. It was later purchased by the major manufacturer of bodies for Ford, Chrysler, Hudson, Packard and others [[Briggs Manufacturing Company]] of Detroit in 1926 and operated as a Briggs specialist subsidiary.

LeBaron supplied exquisite custom bodies for various car companies such as Chrysler's luxury Imperial line, [[Duesenberg]], and [[Cadillac]].
LeBaron's last projects for Chrysler were the [[Chrysler Newport]] Phaeton, a super-streamlined dual cowl phaeton with an aluminum body and the remarkable 1941 Chrysler Thunderbolt, a sleek roadster with concealed headlights (like the 1936 [[Cord 810/812]]) and a retractable metal hardtop styled by [[Alex Tremulis]], who would later style the legendary [[1948 Tucker Sedan|Tucker]] of 1948.&lt;ref name="webring1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webspace.webring.com/people/nm/michael_a_cole/hist.html |title=Chrysler LeBaron History |publisher=Webspace.webring.com |accessdate=2010-10-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825073943/http://webspace.webring.com/people/nm/michael_a_cole/hist.html |archivedate=2011-08-25 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="conceptcarz1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z17187/Chrysler-LeBaron.aspx |title=1985 Chrysler LeBaron Images, Information and History (LeBaron Town &amp; Country, LeBaron Mark Cross Convertible, T&amp;C, LeBaron GTS, LS Sedan) |publisher=Conceptcarz.com |accessdate=2010-10-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613044015/http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z17187/Chrysler-LeBaron.aspx |archivedate=2011-06-13 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coachbuilt1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coachbuilt.com/bui/l/lebaron/lebaron.htm |title=Coachbult.com - LeBaron - Le Baron - LeBaron Carrossiers - LeBaron Inc. - LeBaron-Detroit |publisher=Coachbuilt.com |accessdate=2010-10-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802122222/http://www.coachbuilt.com/bui/l/lebaron/lebaron.htm |archivedate=2010-08-02 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coachbuilt2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coachbuilt.com/bui/b/briggs/briggs.htm |title=Briggs Body Company, Brggs Mfg, Co., Walter O.

The LeBarons started in the 1930s during the automobile's Classic era and competed directly with the luxury brands of its day such as [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]], [[Cadillac]], and [[Packard]]. In the mid-1930s, Chrysler added a radical new "Art Deco" design shape, known as the Airflow Imperials, to the Chrysler line. The high-end CW series were supplied by LeBaron. The design features were considered advanced and perhaps ahead of their time. However, the shape was too radical for buyer's tastes and non-Airflow models outsold Airflows by about 3 to 1. [[Dietrich Inc.|Raymond Dietrich]], co-founder and former stylist at LeBaron, was hired in 1932 to be Chrysler's in-house stylist. Dietrich restyled the Airflow line and Chryslers moved to more mainstream styles.  As a result of the poor Airflow sales, Chrysler design actually became quite conservative for the next two decades. Auto manufacturers continued to build up their in-house styling departments and bodyworks, with the result that LeBaron became less important to most of its customers for design ideas and bodies.  Toward the late 1930s, LeBaron/Briggs built more bodies for Chrysler and fewer bodies for Ford. Chrysler became their biggest customer, with additional bodies built for [[Packard]], [[Hudson Motor Car Company|Hudson]], and [[Graham-Paige]]. During the late 1930s and early 1940s, the LeBaron name and division became less important for Briggs, although it remained a division of Briggs until the Chrysler buy-out in 1953.&lt;ref name="coachbuilt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coachbuilt2"/&gt;

LeBaron's last projects for Chrysler were two concept cars: the [[Chrysler Newport]] Phaeton, a super-streamlined dual cowl phaeton with an aluminum body and the remarkable 1941 Chrysler Thunderbolt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ftkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1930+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4m2FTsGiHYfe0QHOutj2Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCTge#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title = Special Built Cars Hint Tomorrow's Designs | magazine = Popular Mechanics | date = January 1941 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a sleek roadster with concealed headlights and a retractable metal hardtop&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janicki|first1=Edward|title=Cars Detroit Never Built: Fifty Years of American Experimental Cars|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company|location=New York, NY|isbn=0806974249|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; styled by [[Alex Tremulis]], who went on to later style part of the legendary [[1948 Tucker Sedan|Tucker]] of 1948.

The [[Chrysler]] Corporation introduced the [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]] as a separate luxury make and division in 1955.  LeBaron was designated the top of the line [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]] models from 1956 through 1975.&lt;ref name="webring1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="conceptcarz1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coachbuilt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coachbuilt2"/&gt; These cars were ''Imperials'' and did ''not'' include the "Chrysler" nameplate. Vehicles branded "LeBaron" were the top model of the Imperial line, followed by the mid-line "Crown" and a short-lived nameless base model ("Custom" from 1960–63); with "Southampton" being a sub-designation applied to all pillarless hardtops.

The Imperial LeBarons were made to compete directly with competitor's luxury brands that included [[Continental (division)|Continental]], [[Cadillac Series 70|Cadillac]], and [[Packard]], as was the case during the 1930s.

The last Imperial model was assembled in June 1975, the discontinuation resulting from dwindling sales due to a [[1973–75 recession|recession]], the effects of the [[1970s energy crisis]], and the United States Congress having passed the [[Energy Policy and Conservation Act]], establishing [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] standards.

Although the LeBaron model name had been used before on [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperials]], this was the first time the name was used as a Chrysler model. Introduced in spring 1977 as a late 1977 model, The cars used the [[Dodge Aspen]] platform (F-body), but with a different body shell known as the M-body, and their primary purpose was as a more upmarket version of the Aspen/Volare. The initial 1977 models comprised coupes and sedans, with a Town &amp; Country station wagon appearing for 1978 (using the nameplate formerly carried by full-sized C-body Chrysler wagons). The sedans and wagons, though considered M-bodies, were nearly identical to F-body Aspens and Volares except for the hoods, trunk lids, and front and rear header panels.

The coupes differed more substantially; where the F-body models utilized a 108.7 inch wheelbase coupe, M-bodies (which included the [[Dodge Diplomat]]) used a unique coupe with styling evocative of the 1930s on the same 112.7 inch wheelbase as the sedans and wagons. Engines consisted of the 225-cid Slant Six, the 318 V8, and the 360 V8. Most were equipped with the 3-speed [[Torqueflite]] automatic transmission, but a four-speed manual gearbox with an overdrive fourth gear was offered with the two smaller engines until 1981.

[[File:1980 LeBaron 5th Avenue Limited Edition.JPG|thumb|left|1980 LeBaron 5th Avenue Limited Edition; one of 654 produced]]
In 1979, the LeBaron was reskinned for the 1980 model year to gain more crisp sheet metal, gaining a waterfall grille, new headlight fascias, and more angular taillamps. The rear roofline was also made shorter and steeper. The 2-door coupe received new smooth rear sheetmetal, that replaced the old curved rear panels, and was moved to the 108.7 inch wheelbase. On the inside, enhancements were made to the interior to make it more luxurious. Also that year, a limited edition "Fifth Avenue" package was available with an altered roofline and additional content; only 654 LeBarons were produced with this package, all converted by the American Sunroof Corporation. A police package was offered for 1981, after the demise of the Volare. This was replaced by a new M-body [[Plymouth Gran Fury]] for 1982, keeping Chrysler-Plymouth dealers in the competition for law enforcement contracts.

The LeBaron model name was moved to the new [[front-wheel drive]] [[Chrysler K platform|K-platform]] for the 1982 model year. The former M-body LeBaron sedan became the [[Chrysler New Yorker]] and could still be equipped with the Fifth Avenue package. The M-body wagons and coupes were discontinued after 1981. Chrysler's M-body sedan was ultimately renamed [[Chrysler Fifth Avenue|New Yorker Fifth Avenue]] for 1983 and then just Fifth Avenue starting in 1984. M-body Fifth Avenue production continued through 1989 little changed from the 1980-vintage LeBaron sedan.

For 1982, the LeBaron moved to the [[front-wheel drive]] [[Chrysler K platform]], where it was the upscale brand's lowest priced offering. It was initially available in just [[sedan (car)|sedan]] and [[coupe]] versions. In early 1982, it was released in a [[convertible (car)|convertible]] version, bringing to the market the first factory-built open-topped domestic vehicle since the 1976 [[Cadillac Eldorado]].  

A station wagon version called the '''Town and Country''' was added as well.  A special Town and Country convertible was also made from 1983 to 1986 in limited quantities (1,105 total), which like the wagon featured simulated wood paneling that made it resemble the original 1940s [[Chrysler Town and Country (pre-1990)|Town and Country]]. This model was part of the well-equipped Mark Cross option package for the latter years. 

Despite being mechanically similar to the Aries and Reliant, its fascias closely resembled those of the larger [[Chrysler E platform|E-body]] sedans. This generation featured Chrysler's [[Electronic Voice Alert]], a computerized voice which warned drivers about various conditions with phrases such as "Your door is ajar" or "Your engine oil pressure is low".

The LeBaron was facelifted for 1986 receiving rounder front and rear ends to improve aerodynamics. Coupes and convertibles were dropped for 1987, being replaced by the all-new J-body LeBaron released that year. The sedan and wagon continued with minor change until 1988. A larger LeBaron sedan based on the Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim would arrive for the 1990 model year.

A 1983 Town and Country convertible was featured in the sixth and seventh seasons of the popular sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'', that [[George Costanza]] purchased after being told by a car salesman that it was previously owned by actor [[Jon Voight]], though it was later revealed that its previous owner was actually ''John'' Voight, a dentist that appeared in the episode "[[The Mom and Pop Store]]", where the car was first featured. In a later interview, the actor confessed that the car featured in the show wasn't actually owned by Voight himself, but by his mother, Barbara Voight.

The 1985 '''LeBaron GTS''' was a somewhat different car than the standard LeBaron and was based on the [[Chrysler H platform]]. It was available at the same time as the [[Cadillac Cimarron]] as a luxury-brand model, while offering a similar level of equipment to the small Cadillac. As a 5-door hatchback still derived from the K-car, the GTS (and the similar [[Dodge Lancer]]) was more of a performance vehicle than the softer-tuned K-car LeBaron sedan. In base configuration, the car was powered by Chrysler's 2.2 [[liter]] [[Chrysler K engine|inline-4 engine]], later replaced by a 2.5&amp;nbsp;L [[Fuel injection|TBI]] version generating {{Convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. A [[Chrysler K engine#2.2 Turbo I|turbocharged 2.2&amp;nbsp;L engine]] producing {{convert|146|hp|kW|abbr=on}} was also available. The GTS moniker was dropped for 1989, the final year of this vehicle's production, after the K-based LeBaron sedan was discontinued.  The last Chrysler LeBaron GTS rolled off the assembly line on April 7, 1989.

===Trim levels===
* ''High Line'' - 1985–1989
* ''Premium'' - 1985–1988
* ''GTS'' - 1989 (replaced "Premium" after the "GTS" was dropped from the name of the car)
*"Pacifica" 1986 (replaced by Shelby Lancer in 1987) Limited 500 run

===European market - the Chrysler GTS===
After some years of absence, Chrysler officially started offering some models under its own brand on the European market from April 1988 on. One of them was the "Chrysler GTS", which in fact was a rebadged version of the [[Dodge Lancer#European market|Dodge Lancer]] ES. Sales figures were moderate.

[[File:Chrysler-LeBaron-coupe-2.jpg|thumb|left|1987–1992 LeBaron Coupe (headlight covers open)]]

After discontinuing the first generation LeBaron coupe and convertible in 1986, Chrysler released a new LeBaron for 1987, built on the [[Chrysler J platform|J platform]] (a K platform derivative) and available as a [[coupe]] or convertible. The all-new LeBaron looked modern and aerodynamic compared to its boxy predecessor and was quite stylish for its day, featuring [[Hidden headlamps|headlights hidden]] behind retractable metal covers and a waterfall grille, steeply raked windshield, full-width taillight lenses though only the edges actually lit up, and curved ([[Coke bottle styling|Coke bottle]]) style rocker panels. The LeBaron was equipped with a trip &amp; fuel economy computer and full instrumentation. In Mexico, these models were marketed as the Chrysler Phantom. The available [[Internal combustion engine|engines]] were the stock 2.2-liter and 2.5-liter, naturally aspirated or turbocharged, and for the 1990 model year, a 3.0-liter [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]] [[V6]] became available, although the Mexican Chrysler Phantom R/T DOHC 16V also offered the same 2.2-liter turbo engine as used in the U.S. market [[Dodge Spirit R/T]].
[[File:89ChryslerLeBaronInterior.jpg|thumb|left|1989 interior]]

For 1990, the LeBaron's interior was refreshed, featuring an all new dashboard, gauge cluster, door panels, and center console design. All of the new components were designed to be smoother and more flowing than the comparatively boxy 1987-89 interior style, making it more in tune with the "aero" revolution of the early 1990s. The 1992 LeBaron coupes and convertibles could be ordered with a new "sport package", which featured a monochrome appearance including body-colored grille, accent stripe, and decklid logo. The package also included 14-inch "lace" style wheelcovers and a black strip below the taillights in place of chrome, with special blacked-out window moldings on coupe models.&lt;ref&gt;1992 Chrysler LeBaron Factory Sales Brouchure&lt;/ref&gt;

===1993 Facelift===
[[File:93-95 LeBaron convertible.jpg|thumb|left|1993–1995 Chrysler LeBaron convertible]]
[[File:94ChryslerLeBaronInterior.jpg|thumb|left|1994 interior (aftermarket radio)]]

In 1992 for the 1993 model year, the LeBaron received a slight facelift. The [[hidden headlamps]] of the 1987-1992 models were deleted in favor of less costly flush-mounted replaceable-bulb [[headlamp]]s, new [[wheel]] styles were made available, and all models got the amber rear [[Automotive lighting|turn signals]] introduced on the deluxe 1992 models. For 1994, a passenger side airbag became standard on all models. Also new for 1994 was the "Bright LX" decor package which included a "bright" chrome grille, "bright" chrome badging, and "bright" chrome molding inserts, as opposed to being body-colored on the GTC. 

The available engines were a naturally aspirated 2.5&amp;nbsp;L and a turbocharged 2.2 and 2.5&amp;nbsp;L versions of Chrysler's [[Straight-4|I4]], and the [[Mitsubishi 6G7x engine|3.0&amp;nbsp;L Mitsubishi V6]] making a {{convert|141|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in this application. The turbocharged engines were dropped from the lineup in 1992 for the 1993 model year. The coupe was discontinued after 1993. In 1994 the 3.0 was the only available engine. The convertible was discontinued after 1995, to make way for the new [[Chrysler Sebring (coupe)|Chrysler Sebring]] [[coupe]]s and [[Chrysler Sebring (convertible)|convertibles]], for 1995 and 1996 respectively.

===Trim levels: 1987–1995===

Throughout its lifetime, the LeBaron convertible/coupe was available in many trim levels. For its first year, the LeBaron was available in ''Highline'' and ''Premium'', typical Chrysler trims at the time. The number of trims grew, peaking in 1990, with six available. After that, the number decreased until just two trim levels remained for 1995.

===Racing===
Several [[Automobile Racing Club of America|ARCA]] (one tier down from ''NASCAR'' cup racing) teams built ''LeBaron'' based race cars (supported by a revitalized ''Chrysler'' Direct Connection performance parts division) and ran them from 1988 to 1998.  The cars were very competitive and won several races during those years.

The last LeBaron sedan was built on the [[front wheel drive]] [[Chrysler A platform|AA platform]], another [[Chrysler K platform|K]] derivative, as junior level sedan to the more upscale [[Chrysler New Yorker#1988–1993|New Yorker]]. It differed from the [[Dodge Spirit]] and [[Plymouth Acclaim]], as well as the [[Europe]]an [[Chrysler Saratoga]] mostly in detail and trim choices. 

Theoretically, as historically was the case in this era whenever Chrysler, Dodge, and Plymouth shared direct model variants, the Acclaim was supposed to be the more mainstream version, while the Spirit was the sportier version, and the LeBaron was the luxury version, reflecting the Chrysler brand's flagship status. In reality, however, there was considerable overlap amongst the three in available trim, equipment and features. The top-line LeBaron Landau model offered a padded vinyl half-roof with smaller "formal" backlight. All LeBaron sedans came with a standard driver's side [[airbag]], and could seat up to six passengers.

[[File:94 LeBaron LE.JPG|thumb|left|1994 Chrysler LeBaron LE]]

For 1992, the LeBaron sedan was split into three trim levels: base, LX and Landau.  The new entry model eliminated the previously standard V6 engine and landau vinyl roof while the Landau model still included the landau roof as standard.  The LX, available one year only, offered standard V6 but no landau roof.  For 1993, the LeBaron sedan received new [[Automotive lighting|rear lights]], which incorporated the reversing lamps previously located in the bumper fascia and the lineup was reduced to two trim levels with the entry model now labeled LE. The LeBaron sedan was discontinued on May 18, 1994 while the Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim continued production until December 9, 1994.  The Chrysler LeBaron was replaced by the [[Chrysler JA platform|"Cloud Car"]] [[Chrysler Cirrus]].

===Safety===
In 1994, the U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] rated the LeBaron{{Which|date=June 2011}} a 4 out of 5 for driver side and a 3 out of 5 for passenger side frontal impact occupant protection.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

==Mexican market==
M and K-platform cars were assembled in the [[Toluca, Mexico]] facility. The M-platform LeBaron was sold in Mexico from the 1977 to the 1982 model years. The K-car LeBaron was also produced in Toluca and was sold for the 1983-87 model years. There were no K-platform convertibles, at least none right from the factory.

'''Chrysler Phantom''' was the Mexican-market version of the J-Body LeBaron Coupe. There were no convertibles of the J-body 2-door for the Mexican market. Phantoms were sold with the same options as the LeBarons in the U.S., and frequently at a higher [[trim level]]. Chrysler Phantoms were marketed from 1992 to 1994, with an R/T version (similar to the American LeBaron GTC) starting in 1992.

The Mexican A-A-body Chrysler Lebaron 4-door sedan was called the New Yorker (all of them with Landau roof), and the "K" body (slightly shorter) was reserved for the 4-door LeBaron's, which were sold in two trim levels, one with Landau roof and leather, and the other one without those two options.

The '''[[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] Saratoga''' is an automobile built by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]]. Chrysler used the Saratoga nameplate from 1939 to 1952 and from 1957 to 1960 in the U.S. market, in Canada through 1965, and in Europe from 1989 to 1995.

==1939–1942==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}
The Saratoga nameplate first appeared in 1939 and was applied to Chrysler's most expensive full-size [[List of Chrysler engines|eight-cylinder]] models, above that of the [[Chrysler Imperial|Imperial]] and the [[Chrysler New Yorker|New Yorker]].  It was available as a four-door sedan and the Hayes-bodied club coupe.  Sedan prices for the 1939 C23 eight-cylinder sedans were Imperial US$1,198, New Yorker US$1,298 and Saratoga US$1,443.  Full wheel covers were standard on the Saratoga.

In 1940, Chrysler assigned the Saratoga to its Series C26 eight-cylinder models, along with the [[Chrysler Traveler|Traveler]], which replaced the Imperial, and New Yorker models. For 1940, the car was available only as a four-door sedan, and in two interior configurations, standard and sport formal.  The latter had a glass partition behind the front seat which could be lowered.  Fluid Drive was offered for the first time, mated to a three-speed manual transmission.

In 1941, the Saratoga was assigned to Chrysler's Series C30 and was demoted to the bottom of the eight-cylinder series, replacing the Traveler.  Body styles offered expanded to include a business coupe, club coupe, two-door sedan and four-door Town Sedan, as well as the six-window sedan.  This the Saratoga offered Fluid Drive and the eight-cylinder version of Vacamatic which consisted of a three-speed transmission mated to an overdrive unit.

The 1940 Saratoga models were still offered, but now under the name of Imperial Crown Special.

For 1942 the Series C-36 Saratoga was again available only with an eight-cylinder engine along with the same transmission selections as in 1941.  Selection of body styles also remained as in 1941.

==1946–1952==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}[[File:Chrysler Saratoga C55 green.jpg|thumb|right|260px| 1951 Chrysler Saratoga]]
The Saratoga nameplate returned for 1946, positioned as Chrysler’s least expensive eight-cylinder model, in a full array of body styles, and was related to the [[Chrysler Windsor]] and the [[DeSoto Custom]]. Annual styling changes were almost non-existent between 1946 and the "First Series" 1949 Chryslers. Because of government restrictions on manufacturer source goods, Chrysler offered white steel "beauty rings" on its car wheels to give the appearance of wide white wall [[tires]]. White wall tires as an option returned in 1947.  Fluid Drive continued but the four speed semi-automatic was now offered.

When the fully redesigned 1949 "Second Series" Chryslers bowed in mid-season, the Saratoga was once again regulated to two body styles, the four-door sedan and two-door club coupe, and shared the 131.5&amp;nbsp;inch wheelbase and straight-eight engine of the Chrysler New Yorker.  The semi-automatic was now called Prestomatic on Chryslers.  Saratoga production for 1949 came to 2,475 vehicles in total.

1950 models received new grilles, taillights and a larger rear window.  Production dropped to 1,300 cars.

For 1951 the Saratoga was built on the shorter 125.5&amp;nbsp;inch wheelbase but offered the Chrysler's famed [[Chrysler Hemi engine|Hemi V8]].  Also offered was Hydraguide power steering, an industry first, and Fluid Torque Drive, a true torque converter in place of Fluid Drive's fluid coupling.

Model selection also increased for 1951 with a wagon plus eight-passenger sedan and limousine on the 139.5&amp;nbsp;inch wheelbase added.  This combination of the shorter, lighter Six body and the powerful new V-8 put the new Hemi Saratoga in the same performance league as the Olds Rocket 88, but was the quicker car.  1951 proved to be a great year with 34,806 cars built.

1952 brought new taillamps while the limousine was dropped.  Due to the Korean War, production dropped to 17,401 for the 1952 model year.  A further 1,300 Saratoga models were built in Canada, the first eight-cylinder Chryslers to roll out of the Windsor plant since 1937.

For 1953 the Saratoga was renamed [[Chrysler New Yorker#1953|New Yorker]] while the old New Yorker would be New Yorker DeLuxe.  The Saratoga name would reappear for 1957.

==1957–1965==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}

===1957–1960===
[[File:1958 Chrysler Saratoga red.jpg|thumb|right|260px| 1958 Chrysler Saratoga 2-Door Hardtop]]
Chrysler reused the Saratoga nameplate in 1957 as part of its "Forward Look" styling by [[Virgil Exner]]. Again, the Saratoga was positioned between the base Windsor and top New Yorkers models, and was related to the [[DeSoto Firedome]], but received trim upgrades and better appointments inside the passenger compartment. The base V8 in the Saratoga was a cast-iron poly head block V8 shared with the Windsor.  Chrysler’s highly praised Hemi was not available as an option. Early 1957 models featured dual headlights, with quad-headlights as an option where permitted by state law. By the model year's end all Saratogas were outfitted with quad headlights.

For 1958, all Windsors were shifted to the 122&amp;nbsp;inch Dodge chassis, and used a modified front end design based in part on Dodge's front clip - this was especially evident around the Windsor's headlights. Saratogas continued to be based on the longer 126&amp;nbsp;inch wheelbase using the New Yorker body and was again available in three body styles – four-door sedan, four-door hardtop, and two-door hardtop coupe.

In Canada, the 1957–1958 Saratoga was sold as the Windsor.  The American Windsor was not sold in Canada although Windsor station wagons were imported.

In 1959, the Saratoga remained on the longer Chrysler wheelbase and in the same three models.  The Saratoga was sold as the Saratoga in Canada this year, sharing its interior with the Canadian-built DeSoto Firedome.  For 1959 the Saratoga got the new RB V8 engine, although it was the Chrysler-only 383-cid in 1959 and 1960.  Canadian-built 1959–1960 Saratogas used the B block 383 as used by Dodge and DeSoto.

In its final year in the U.S., the 1960 Chrysler Saratoga was based wholly on the New Yorker body shell, less New Yorker trimmings, and again offered in three body styles – four-door sedan, four-door hardtop, and two-door hardtop coupe.  Some 15,525 1960 Chrysler Saratogas rolled off the assembly line.

===1961–1965===
[[File:2009-0724-ChryslerSaratoga.jpg|thumb|right|260px| 1961 Chrysler Saratoga]]
[[File:Chrysler Saratoga.JPG|thumb|right|260px| 1964 Chrysler Saratoga 300]]
In 1961, Chrysler decided to release a new low-price entry-level model called the [[Chrysler Newport]] for the American market, a name which in 1961 was commonly associated with Chrysler’s expensive hardtops in the early and mid 1950s to take the market segment left open when Chrysler's [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] brand was cancelled. While the Newport took the place of the Windsor in the lineup, the company cancelled the mid-range Saratoga, and elevated the Windsor name to the mid-level position.

In Canada the Saratoga continued on through to 1965 with the Windsor line remaining on the bottom.  Thus the Canadian 1961 Saratoga was basically the U.S. Windsor with Saratoga nameplates on the 122&amp;nbsp;inch wheelbase.

For 1962 Canadians did not get the new [[Chrysler_300_non-letter_series|300]], but instead got the Saratoga.  The grille was shared with the Newport/Windsor while the side trim was from the American Newport.  The trunk lid sported New Yorker trim.  Model offering remained 4-door sedan and hardtop plus 2-door hardtop.

New bodies appeared for 1963 with the Canadian Saratoga using the same grille and trim as the U.S. 300, only with "Saratoga 300" nameplates, as the series was now called.  Body styles remained the same and this year the 300 convertible was imported.

Although the American 1964 300 continued to use the 1963 headlamp rings, the Canadian Saratoga 300 used the headlamp treatment of the Newport/Windsor, and had 300 side trim.  The American 300 convertible continued to be an import.

1965 brought completely new "C" bodies on a 124&amp;nbsp;inch wheelbase.  Again, the Canadian Saratoga 300 was identical to the U.S. 300.  This was the last year for a Saratoga sold in North America.

For 1966 the mid-range Chrysler series in Canada was sold as the 300, except it used Newport/Windsor taillamps.  The same three models continued, but this year the American 300 convertible and two-door hardtop were imported and marketed as the Sport 300.

==1989–1995==
[[Image:Chrysler AA Saratoga Spain version rear.jpg|thumb|right|260px|1992–1995 Chrysler Saratoga in Spain]]{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}[[Image:Saratoga LE.jpg|thumb|right|260px|1994 Saratoga based on the LeBaron Sedan]]
The Saratoga name was revived in 1989 when Chrysler [[Badge engineering|rebadged]] its [[Dodge Spirit]] sedan for export to Europe. Marketing of this Saratoga was officially discontinued in 1993, but the Saratoga continued being built and exported, and parts unique to it continued being catalogued through the 1995 end of [[Chrysler A platform|A-body]] production.

These export-market Saratogas were not simply Dodge Spirits with different nameplates. Differing vehicle safety regulations in [[ECE Regulations|the rest of the world]] versus North America required the Saratoga to have different [[headlamps]] and front, side, and rear [[Automotive lighting|lights and reflectors]], glass, [[Wing mirror|mirrors]], [[seat belts]], instrument clusters and radios; [[engine control unit]]s were programmed in accord with [[European emission standards]] rather than the North American standards. All Saratogas featured front bucket seats. Basic equipment included the [[Chrysler 2.2 &amp; 2.5 engine|2.5&amp;nbsp;L]] [[Straight-4|4-cylinder]] engine with [[fuel injection|throttle-body fuel injection]] and a 5-speed manual transmission; the most commonly ordered powertrain upgrade was the [[Mitsubishi 6G7 engine#6G72|Mitsubishi 3.0&amp;nbsp;L V6]] with A604 [[Ultradrive]] 4-speed automatic transmission, though the turbocharged version of the 2.5 was also available with 3-speed [[Torqueflite#A413|Torqueflite]] automatic or 5-speed manual transaxle. Starting in 1993, the Saratoga was available with leather seats and other luxury equipment not provided in the North American market. Most 1993 and later Saratogas were equipped with the V6/4-speed automatic powertrain. All Saratogas were equipped with the highest-specification suspension and brake systems made by Chrysler for the A-body.

The last Saratogas, sold in 1994 and 1995, were based on the US-market [[Chrysler LeBaron]] Sedan. They can be identified by additional fender chrome and an "LE" badge on the trunklid. These models were all equipped with the 3.0 liter Mitsubishi V6, the A604 automatic transmission, leather seats and air conditioning. Saratoga production ended on December 9, 1994.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The '''Horizon''' is a family [[hatchback]] developed by [[Chrysler Europe]] and sold in Europe between 1978 and 1987 under the [[Chrysler]], [[Simca]], and [[Talbot]] nameplates. Derivative variants of the Horizon were manufactured and marketed by Chrysler in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] as the [[Dodge Omni]] and [[Plymouth Horizon]] until 1990. After the sale of Chrysler Europe to [[Peugeot]] in 1978, the European cars were only further sold as Talbots, and though largely identically bodied as American Chryslers, the cars led relatively unrelated production lives, almost from the start, on each side of the ocean.

==Origins==
The Horizon was developed by Chrysler Europe under the codename C2. It was designed in the United Kingdom at the Whitley design studio by [[Roy Axe]] and engineered in France at Poissy by Simca as a replacement for their ageing [[Simca 1100|1100 range]]. It was introduced to market in summer 1978. In France it was initially sold under the Simca brand, whilst elsewhere in Europe it was initially badged as a Chrysler. As a result of the acquisition of Chrysler's European car division by [[Peugeot]] in 1978, both the Chrysler and Simca brands were dropped and the car was then sold under the Talbot brand in all its European markets.

[[File:Talbot Horizon (46410492254).jpg|left|thumb|Rear view of a Talbot Horizon]]

The Horizon was intended to be a "world car", meaning that it was designed for consumers on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], but in execution, the European and [[North America]]n versions of the vehicle actually turned out to have very little in common. Born largely out of the need to replace the ageing [[Simca 1100]] in France, the Horizon was essentially a shortened version of the larger [[Chrysler/Simca Alpine|Alpine]] model, giving the vehicle an unusually wide track for its length. Featuring [[Simca Poissy engine|"Poissy engine"]] of transversely mounted, Simca-designed 1.1, 1.3 and 1.5 litre [[overhead valve|OHV]] [[engine]]s, 4-speed gearbox and [[torsion-bar]] suspension, the Horizon gained praise for its crisp styling, supple ride, and competent handling.

The SX version which joined the range for the [[Paris Motor Show]], in October 1978, attracted much interest on account of its innovative trip computer.&lt;ref name=Automobilia1979&gt;{{cite journal| first = René | last = Bellu  | journal = Automobilia | ref = RB1 | title = Toutes les voitures françaises 1979 | number = 84 | page = 12 | orig-year = first published October 1978 | date = 2006 | isbn = |publisher=Histoire &amp; collections|location=Paris }}&lt;/ref&gt; The device took information from three sources, a clock, a "débitmètre" mounted on the fuel feed to the carburetor and a distance information from the feed for the [[odometer]]. Using these three pieces of information the "computer" was able to report current fuel consumption and average speeds as well as information on distances and times, in either metric or imperial units.&lt;ref name=Automobilia1979/&gt; The trip computer later became an option on lesser models such as the GLS.&lt;ref name=AC4459a&gt;{{cite magazine | ref = RH1 | magazine = [[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] | title = Talbot Horizon 1.5GLS: Economical performer | editor-first = Ray | editor-last = Hutton | publisher = IPC Business Press Ltd. | page = 38 | date = 1982-06-05 | volume = 156 | number = 4459 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1978 Chrysler Horizon GL Interior.jpg|thumb|right|Interior (1978 Chrysler Horizon GL)]]

The Horizon was voted [[European Car of the Year]] in 1979. Initially only available in LS or GL trim, its launch saw the end of the rear-engined [[Simca 1000]]. The [[Simca 1100]] remained in production in [[PSA Poissy Plant|France]] until 1981, being sold for a time as a low cost alternative to the Horizon, but the two cars competed in virtually the same segment and the older car, its model range drastically reduced, saw its sales plummet.&lt;ref name=Automobilia1979Si1100&gt;[[#RB1|Bellu]], p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; On the British market, the rear-wheel drive Avenger saloons and estates remained in production alongside it, giving British buyers a full choice of bodystyles in a market where hatchbacks still only accounted for a minority of sales. There was never a three-door version of the Horizon. To fulfill this need, the Simca 1100 remained on sale in continental Europe, while the rear-wheel drive [[Chrysler Sunbeam]] was sold alongside the Horizon in the United Kingdom until 1981.

Although it didn't officially replace any of the British Chryslers – despite being a similar size to the rear-wheel drive Sunbeam and traditional [[Hillman Avenger]] saloon and estates which had been on sale since 1970 – both of the latter finished production in 1981.

==Production life==
After Chrysler Europe collapsed in 1978 and was sold to Peugeot, the Horizon was rebadged as a [[Talbot]] in 1979.

In 1981, the revisited models were introduced with minor improvements. By then however, the Horizon was becoming increasingly uncompetitive next to rivals such as the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1|Volkswagen Golf]] (which was actually four years older), [[Opel Kadett D|Opel Kadett]]/[[Vauxhall Astra#Mark 1|Vauxhall Astra]] and the [[Ford Escort (Europe)#Third generation (1980–1986)|third generation Ford Escort]]. The unrefined overhead-valve engines which had been carried over from the Simca 1100 were largely to blame, while body corrosion was a serious issue - at least until the Series II - giving many cars a short service life.

[[File:Cuentarevoluciones.jpg|thumb|left|The LED tachometer of a series 2 Talbot Horizon]]
The series 2 Horizon launched in July 1982 had a 5-speed gearbox, and badged ''series II 5 speed''. The bumpers were painted black and the rear windscreen was smaller, because the parcel shelf was raised to increase the size of the boot. Some models had an electronic LED 'econometer' which lit up several lights around the edge of the speedometer dial. There was also an LED tachometer on the top of the range models; this was a horizontal row of green, yellow, and red LEDs positioned atop the steering column. These lit up in 250&amp;nbsp;rpm intervals.&lt;ref name=AC4459b&gt;[[#RH1|Hutton]], p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

The Horizon was then updated in 1985, with different interior trim again slight changes to instrument dials and door cards were to make the car look more modern, but along with the [[Fiat Ritmo]]/Strada, it was now the oldest mainstream family hatchback on sale in Europe, and was now faced with competition from even more new competitors.

Fewer paint colours were available and fewer models. Many of the late cars, which were built between 1985 and 1986, were painted in an unsympathetic pale green or cream. Horizons had initially been available in more adventurous colours including orange, but many of these colours had gone out of fashion after the 1970s.

A Talbot Horizon [[turbo]] concept car was produced in 1984 with a full cream leather interior and sporty body kit, the car was designed at [[Whitley plant|Whitley]], [[Coventry]]. The Turbo Horizon is very different from those models once seen out on the street and is kept at [[Coventry Transport Museum]], Coventry England.

Due to corrosion problems the Horizon is now a rare sight, with just 20 examples still on the road in the UK at the end of 2016. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.howmanyleft.co.uk/family/talbot_horizon|title=How Many Left? Talbot Horizon|accessdate=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main production lines of Horizon were [[PSA Poissy Plant|Poissy]] in France and [[Ryton-on-Dunsmore|PSA Ryton Assembly]] in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/content/articles/2006/04/18/ryton_history_feature.shtml |title=Coventry and Warwickshire - Features - The history of Ryton |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2012-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; British manufacture commenced on 4 January 1982 and soon thereafter the Ryton plant was working a full five-day week for the first time in sixteen months.&lt;ref name=AC4459a/&gt; At the time, British Horizons had 60 percent British parts content.&lt;ref name=AC4459a/&gt; It was also manufactured in [[Spain]] in [[Villaverde (Madrid)|Villaverde]] by [[Groupe PSA|PSA Peugeot Citroën's]] Spanish subsidiary and also in [[Finland]] by [[Saab Automobile|Saab]]-[[Valmet]] from 1979 onwards. The Finnish-made Talbot Horizons integrated many [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] components, especially in the interior and electrical system. The Saab-Valmet factory also made a series of 2,385 cars that ran on [[kerosene]] or [[turpentine]]. 

The Horizon was produced in France and also Britain (where production had begun in the 1980s) until June 1986, and in Spain and Finland until 1987. Its successor was the [[Peugeot 309]], a car developed in the UK and launched towards the end of 1985, originally destined to be sold as the Talbot Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curiositesautomobiles.blogspot.fr/2013/09/talbot-arizona-lhistoire-de-la-peugeot.html |title=Talbot Arizona - The history of Peugeot 309 |date= |accessdate=2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end of Horizon production early in 1987 also marked the end of the Talbot badge on passenger cars. However, the North American version of the car continued to be produced until 1990.

The PSA XUD9 diesel engine of 1905&amp;nbsp;cc [[diesel engine]] was fitted to certain models of the Horizon, which was the first example of this engine available in the UK. All UK-market diesel Horizons were made in Spain. The British Peugeot-Talbot brochure of October 1984 shows the only diesel Horizon being the LD 1.9, the XUD9 engine only available in the [[Peugeot 305]] GRD as well. The Horizon was not the first diesel in the Talbot family of cars with the [[Chrysler 180]] in Spain having been available with diesel power during the 1970s.

The Peugeot 309 made use some of the Horizon range of Simca-based engines for most of its production life, until replaced with the more modern Peugeot TU engine in 1992.

In Britain, it was seen as a modern alternative to the existing Rootes-designed [[Chrysler Avenger|Avenger]] models, offering buyers a front-wheel drive hatchback alongside the rear-wheel drive saloons and estates. The Avenger was produced alongside it until 1981, by which time the company had come under Peugeot ownership and no new models were launched to replace it, as the front-wheel drive hatchback style was becoming more popular and Peugeot already had the similar-sized 305 saloon and estates in production.

UK sales of the Horizon (which went on sale there in early 1978 and was badged as a Chrysler until 1 August 1979, when it became a Talbot) were initially acceptable, held back by the fact that it was a French import. Sales improved as manufacture was brought to the United Kingdom in 1982.&lt;ref name=AC4459a/&gt; Soon thereafter, however, it started to lose sales in a segment dominated by an increasing number of newer models including the Ford Escort Mark III, Vauxhall Astra, and Austin Metro. Foreign models like the [[Volkswagen Golf]] and [[Nissan Sunny|Datsun Sunny]] were also proving popular in the early 1980s.

The last British Horizons were sold in 1986, soon after the launch of [[Peugeot|Peugeot's]] [[Ryton-on-Dunsmore|Ryton-built]] [[Peugeot 309|309]] which had originally been intended for sale as the '''Talbot Arizona''', as a Talbot-branded successor to the Horizon, and went on sale in January 1986. The 309 continued the Simca heritage by using Simca-derived engines in its smaller models.

The Ryton factory remained open until December 2006.

==Models==
The UK Horizon was available in the following trim levels:
* 1100 LE, LS, GL, GLE
* 1300 LS, GL, LX, GLS
* 1500 LS, GL, EX, GLS, S, SX
* 1900 LD

Most models were available with 4 or 5-speed gearboxes, which were initially a carry-over of the Simca gearbox, and then later the PSA BE gearbox. Automatic transmission was available on most 1500 models, and was standard equipment on the 1500 SX model. The lowest level LE had very meagre equipment, not even being fitted with a rear parcel shelf.&lt;ref name=AC4459c&gt;[[#RH1|Hutton]], p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Some limited editions were:

* 1500 "Pullman" top of range model. This had upmarket trim and a design of alloy wheel similar to the [[Talbot Sunbeam Lotus]] and a wider tyre. The Pullman also had radio upgrade with 4 speakers, and rear seatbelts. Most had beige over brown metallic, two-tone paintwork. Around 20% of the Pullman models were two tone silver and blue.
* 1300 "Summertime Special" This had red plastic trim in place of the usual black.
* 1500/1300 "Ultra" (1985) an upmarket high-spec car in silver metallic, had its name 'ULTRA' on the front wings in black lettering. Ultra had grey velour interior with red piping. The Ultra had been sold in the Netherlands since 1983.&lt;ref name=krant&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Autovisie | date = 1983-12-24 | volume = 28 | number = 26 | publisher = Folio Groep B.V. | location = Hilversum, Netherlands | language = Dutch | title = Autokrant | trans-title = Car Gazette | editor-last = de Jong | editor-first = Nico | page = 14 | ref = krant }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1500 "Silver Fox" which had two tone paintwork half silver, half blue metallic.

==Group B Talbot Horizon==
In 1982 Talbot and [[Lotus Cars]] began work on a Group B rally car meant to succeed the [[Talbot Sunbeam Lotus]].&lt;ref name="rootes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootes-chrysler.co.uk/groupb-horizon.html|title=The Group B Horizon rally cars|work=www.rootes-chrysler.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the Talbot Horizon the car was fitted with a [[Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|mid-mounted]] Lotus [[Lotus 900 series#911|type 911]] engine driving the rear wheels.&lt;ref name="groupbshrine"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rallygroupbshrine.org/the-group-b-cars/group-b-prototypes/talbot-horizon/|title=Talbot Horizon - Group B Prototype|work=rallygroupbshrine.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was cancelled after two prototypes had been built. Peugeot subsequently began development of their [[all-wheel drive]] [[Peugeot 205#205 Turbo 16 .28T16.29|205 T16]].

==North American variants==
{{main|Dodge Omni}}
[[File:1981 Dodge Omni 1.7.jpg|thumb|left|1981 Dodge Omni]]
The North American versions of the Horizon were known as the [[Dodge Omni]] and [[Plymouth Horizon]]. Although they appeared to share the same external bodywork as the European Horizon (the panels were in fact not interchangeable), they were vastly different mechanically &amp;mdash; using a larger engine (of [[Volkswagen|VW]], then PSA origins on the early versions, replaced by Chrysler's own 2.2L OHC "Trenton" I-4 later) and [[MacPherson strut]] suspension at the front instead of the more complex torsion bar system found in the European version. They also featured larger reinforced aluminum [[Bumper (automobile)|bumper]]s to comply with stricter US [[safety]] [[legislation]]. Despite the car's European origins, then Chrysler chairman [[Lee Iacocca]] played this down, emphasizing that features such as the [[trip computer]] and electronic [[Ignition system|ignition]] were of American design.

In the US, many variants were eventually produced, including three-door coupé versions ("Charger" and "TC-3 / Turismo"), econo versions ("America", "Miser"), and powered-up versions such as the GLH, GLH Turbo, and [[Shelby GLHS]] (turbocharged, intercooled, 174&amp;nbsp;bhp). Even a small pickup truck was based on the Horizon ("Scamp" and "Rampage"). Some of these cars had successful careers in racing venues such as Auto-X, road and endurance racing, and pro rallying.

The '''Chrysler Imperial''', introduced in 1926, was [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]]'s top-of-the-line vehicle for much of its history. Models were produced with the Chrysler name until 1954, and again from 1990 to 1993. The company positioned the cars as a prestige marque to rival [[Cadillac]], [[Lincoln Mark series|Continental]], [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln]], [[Duesenberg]], [[Pierce Arrow]], [[Cord Automobile|Cord]], and [[Packard]].&lt;ref name=beaulieu&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Georgano |editor-first=Nick N. |authorlink=G.N.

In 1926, [[Walter Chrysler|Walter P.

The limo had a glass partition between the front and rear passenger compartments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1926_Chrysler/1926_Imperial_Brochure/1926%20Chrysler%20Imperial-16.html |title=1926 Imperial Brochure |page=16 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imperial's new engine was slightly larger than the company's standard straight 6. It was a {{convert|288.6|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="1928FSM"/&gt; six-cylinder with seven bearing blocks and pressure lubrication of {{convert|92|bhp|kW|0}}. Springs were semi-elliptic in the front. The car set a transcontinental speed record in the year it was introduced, driving more than {{convert|6500|mi|km|-1}} in the week. The car was chosen as the [[safety car|pace car]] for the 1926 [[Indianapolis 500]]. The model was designated E-80, the 80 being after the "guaranteed" {{convert|80|mph|0}} all-day cruising speed. Acceleration was also brisk, breaking 20 seconds to {{convert|60|mph|0}}. Four-speed transmission was added in 1930.&lt;ref name="Kimes 1996"/&gt; The attention to luxury and multiple bodystyles was a similar approach to one Mr. Chrysler used as president of the [[Buick Motor Company]], his employer from 1911 to 1919.

When the second generation Imperial was introduced in 1931, the first generation was given minor updates and was called the Chrysler Six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2014/07/22/from-the-archives-1932-chrysler-series-ci/|title=From the Archives: 1932 Chrysler Series CI – Hemmings Daily|last=Hemmings.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, Mr. Chrysler, who was working at the request of the bankers to make [[Willys]] profitable, had auto engineers Owen Skelton, Carl Breer, and Fred Zeder begin work on a new car for Willys, which was often referred to as the Chrysler Six.&lt;ref name="Chrysler connection"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kimes |first1=Beverly Rae |last2=Clark, Jr. |first2=Henry A. |title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1805–1942 (second edition) |page=[https://archive.org/details/standardcatalogo0000kime/page/292 292] |publisher=Krause publications |isbn=0-87341-111-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/standardcatalogo0000kime/page/292 |year=1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Willys encountered financial problems, Walter Chrysler and the three engineers who had been working on the Chrysler Six all moved on to [[Maxwell automobile|Maxwell]]-[[Chalmers automobile|Chalmers]] where they continued their work, ultimately launching the six-cylinder [[Chrysler]] in January 1924.&lt;ref name="Chrysler connection"/&gt; (In 1925, the Maxwell car company became the Chrysler Corporation.)

The Chrysler Imperial was redesigned in 1931. The car received a new 384.84-cubic inch (6308.85&amp;nbsp;cc)&lt;ref name="1931FSM"/&gt; [[straight-eight engine]]. Marketing materials for this generation of Imperial referred to the car as the "Imperial 8", in reference to the new in-line 8-cylinder engine. The engine would be found in many other Chrysler vehicles. The Custom Imperial, in addition to rust-proof fenders, automatic heater control, and safety glass, was fitted with fine custom bodies by several luxury car coach builders of the era.&lt;ref name="Kimes 1996"/&gt; These were custom built to specification, and were variously equipped with anything the customer desired--even a [[Dictaphone]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The redesign also saw the introduction of new wire wheels that became a standard wheel treatment until the 1940s. Stock car driver [[Harry Hartz]] set numerous speed records with an Imperial [[Sedan (car)|sedan]] at [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]. It was introduced shortly after the [[Rolls-Royce Phantom II]], [[Mercedes-Benz 770]], [[Packard Eight]], [[Duesenberg Model J]], [[Cadillac Series 355]], and [[Lincoln K-series]] appeared in the 1930s.

The 1934 to 1936 Chrysler Imperial ushered in the '[[Chrysler Airflow|Airflow]]' design, reflecting an interest in [[streamliner|streamlining]]. The car was marketed with the slogan "The car of tomorrow is here today." It featured eight-passenger seating and again an eight-cylinder engine. It was the first car to be designed in a [[wind tunnel]]. Initial tests indicated that the standard car of the 1920s worked best in the wind-tunnel when pointed backwards with the curved rear deck facing forward. It led to a rethinking of the fundamental design of Chrysler's cars. The Airflow was an exceptionally modern and advanced car, and an unparalleled engineering success. Both engine and passenger compartment were moved forward, giving better balance and ride. An early form of [[monocoque|unibody]] construction was employed, making them extremely strong. It was one of the first vehicles with [[fender skirts]].

The public was put off by the unconventional styling and did not buy the car in large numbers. The failure of the Airflow cars in the marketplace led Chrysler to be overly conservative in their styling for the next 20 years. The "standard" styling on the lower-end Chryslers outsold the Airflow by 3 to 1. Its appearance was similar to the unrelated [[Tatra 77]] which also appeared in the mid-1930s with a similar reaction to styling.

Innovations for 1937 included built-in defroster vents, safety-type interior hardware (such as flexible door handles and recessed controls on the dash&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1937_Chrysler/1937_Chrysler_Royal-Imperial_Brochure/1937%20Chrysler%20Royal%20%20amp%20%20Imperial-31.html |title=1937 Chrysler Royal-Imperial Brochure |page=31 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;), seat-back padding, and fully insulated engine mounts. Brakes were 13-inch drums, then in 1939 they expanded to 14 inches,&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1939_Chrysler/1939_Chrysler_Custom_Imperial_Brochure/1939%20Chrysler%20Custom%20Imperial-13.html |title=1939 Chrysler Custom Imperial Brochure |page=13 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but shrunk to 12-inch drums in 1940.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Front suspension was independent.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

There were three Imperial models in this generation. The '''C-14''' was the standard eight and looked much like the [[Chrysler Royal]] C-18 with a longer hood and cowl. The '''C-15''' was the Imperial Custom and the Town Sedan Limousine, with blind rear quarter panels. This model was available by special order. The third model, '''C-17''', was the designation for the Airflow model. They had a concealed crank for raising the windshield and the hood was hinged at the cowl and opened from the front; side hood panels were released by catches on the inside. An Imperial Custom convertible sedan was used as an official car at the Indy 500. The car pictured is J.G. Martin's (retired airline mechanic) 1939 C-24 7-passenger limousine, believed by him and his son Tim to be the only 1939 production 7-passenger limo still on the road.

Following an assassination attempt in 1937, an armoured Chrysler Imperial was purchased as the official car for [[António de Oliveira Salazar]], the [[Prime Minister of Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motorclassico.com/index.php?area=200&amp;lang=en&amp;edi=2007&amp;id=688 |title=Salazar's cars at Motorclássico Fair |publisher=Motorclassico.com |date=30 April 2007 |accessdate=11 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113181301/http://www.motorclassico.com/index.php?area=200&amp;lang=en&amp;edi=2007&amp;id=688 |archivedate=13 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940 the Imperial line was reduced to '''Crown Imperial''' eight-seat sedans and divided eight-seat limousines, with the new [[Chrysler New Yorker]] taking the top model position among the standard-length models. The standard Imperial line was temporarily discontinued.&lt;ref name="krause publications"/&gt; Two bodystyles were produced, an eight-passenger four-door sedan and an eight-passenger four-door limousine.

Three Imperial bodystyles were produced in 1949. The short-wheelbase Imperial was only available as a four-door six-passenger sedan. The 4-door 8-passenger Crown Imperial was available as a sedan, or as a limousine with a division window.

The new custom-built Imperial sedan was based on the [[Chrysler New Yorker]]. It shared the same trim, but had a canvas-covered roof and leather and [[broadcloth]] Imperial upholstery. These features were installed by [[Derham Body Company|Derham]], on the all new postwar [[Chrysler]] sheetmetal. Early 1949 Imperial Crowns were actually leftover 1948s. The really new models didn't arrive until March 1949. Their styling was sleeker than previous models, yet conservative. Fewer, but heavier bars were used in the cross-hatched grille. The upper and center horizontal pieces wrapped around the front fenders. Rocker panel moldings, rear fender stoneguards, full length lower-window trim, and horizontal chrome strips on the rear fenders, and from the headlights to about halfway across the front doors, were used to decorate the side body.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;

The 1950 [[Crosley]] Hot Shot is often given credit for the first production [[disc brakes]] but the Chrysler Imperial Crown actually had them first as standard equipment at the beginning of the 1949 model year. The Crosley disc was a [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] development, a caliper type with ventilated rotor, originally designed for aircraft applications. Only the Hot Shot featured it. Lack of sufficient research caused enormous reliability problems, especially in regions requiring the use of salt on winter roads, such as sticking and corrosion. Drum brake conversion for Hot Shots was quite popular.&lt;ref name="Langworth 1996"/&gt;

The Chrysler 4-wheel disc brake system was more complex and expensive than Crosley's, but far more efficient and reliable. It was built by Auto Specialties Manufacturing Company (Ausco) of [[St. Joseph, Michigan]], under patents of inventor H.L. Lambert, and was first tested on a 1939 [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]]. Unlike the caliper disc, the [[Ausco Lambert disc brake|Ausco-Lambert]] utilized twin expanding discs that rubbed against the inner surface of a cast iron brake drum, which doubled as the brake housing. The discs spread apart to create friction against the inner drum surface through the action of standard wheel cylinders.&lt;ref name="Langworth 1996"/&gt;

Chrysler discs were "self-energizing," in that some of the braking energy itself contributed to the braking effort. This was accomplished by small balls set into oval holes leading to the brake surface. When the disc made initial contact with the friction surface, the balls would be forced up the holes forcing the discs further apart and augmenting the braking energy. This made for lighter braking pressure than with calipers, avoided brake fade, promoted cooler running, and provided one-third more friction surface than standard Chrysler {{convert|12|in|adj=on}} drums. But because of the expense, the brakes were only standard on the Chrysler Imperial Crown through 1954 and the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country (1941–1988)|Town and Country Newport]] in 1950. They were optional, however, on other Chryslers, priced around $400, at a time when an entire Crosley Hot Shot retailed for $935. Today's owners consider the Ausco-Lambert very reliable and powerful, but admit its grabbiness and sensitivity.&lt;ref name="Langworth 1996"/&gt;

The 1950 Imperial was essentially a New Yorker with a custom interior. It had a Cadillac-style grille treatment that included circular signal lights enclosed in a wraparound ribbed chrome piece. Side trim was similar to last year's model, but the front fender strip ended at the front doors and the rear fender molding was at the tire top level and integrated into the stone guard. Unlike the standard Imperial, the Imperial Crown had a side treatment in which the rear fender moldings and stone guard were separate. Body sill moldings were used on all Imperials, but were of a less massive type on the more massive Crown models. A special version of the limousine was available. It featured a unique leather interior and a leather top that blacked out the rear quarter-windows. Power windows were standard on the Imperial Crown .&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;

In an unusual move for the 1950s, the 1951 Imperial had noticeably less chrome than the lower-priced New Yorker that was its base. It also had three horizontal grille bars with the parking lights between the bars and a chrome vertical center piece. Aside from its front fender nameplate, side body trim was limited to the moldings below the windows, rocker panel moldings, bright metal stone shields and a heavy horizontal molding strip running across the fender strips. Three 2-door bodystyles were added to the Imperial model in 1951: a Club [[coupe]], a [[hardtop]], and a [[convertible (car)|convertible]]. Only 650 convertibles were sold and it would be discontinued the following year.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; 1951 was also the year that Chrysler introduced its {{convert|331|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler FirePower engine|Hemihead]] [[V8 engine|V8]].&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; "Hydraguide" [[power steering]], an industry first for use in production automobiles, became available on the Imperial for an additional $226&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Flammang |first=James M. |title=Chronicle of the American Automobile: Over 100 Years of Auto History |publisher=Publications International |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-7853-0778-5 |page=[https://archive.org/details/chronicleofameri0000flam/page/261 261] |url=https://archive.org/details/chronicleofameri0000flam/page/261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was standard on the Imperial Crown.

1952 Imperials were practically identical to the 1951 models, and the most effective way to tell the difference between them is through reference to serial numbers. The convertible bodystyle was dropped in 1952. Unlike the case with Chryslers, the Imperial's taillights were not changed. Power steering was standard. The "new" Imperial Crown was also unchanged for 1952. Only 338 of these cars were made in the 1951–1952 model run, and serial numbers indicate that 205 were registered as 1952 automobiles. A minor change was a one-inch ({{cvt|1|in|cm|1|disp=out}}) reduction in the front tread measurement.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;

In 1953 the Imperial model was renamed the Imperial Custom. Although the Imperial Custom resembled the New Yorker, it had a different wheelbase, taillights, and side trim. Clean front fenders and higher rear fender stone shield set it apart from the "ordinary" Chryslers. This was also the first year for the stylized eagle hood ornament. Power brakes, power windows, center folding armrests (front and rear) and a padded dash were standard. Parking lights on all Imperials were positioned between the top and center grille moldings, a variation from the design used on other Chrysler cars. A new model was the six-passenger Imperial Custom limousine which had as standard equipment electric windows, electric division window, floor level courtesy lamps, rear compartment heater, fold-up footrests, seatback mounted clock and special luxury cloth or leather interiors. On 10 March 1953, the exclusive Imperial Custom Newport hardtop was added to the Imperial line at $325 over the price of the eight-passenger sedan. The 2-door Club coupe was discontinued. Imperial Custom sedans now rode on a wheelbase {{convert|2|in|mm}} longer than the 2-door hardtops. The eagle ornament was about the only thing new on the 1953 Imperial Crown. The nameplate was changed slightly and the limousine featured moldings on top of the rear fenders.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Imperial Crowns came with a 12-volt electrical system (Imperial Customs still had a 6-volt system)&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; and Chrysler's first fully [[automatic transmission]], called [[PowerFlite]], became available late in the model year,&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=August 1953 |title=Chrysler drops clutch pedal with new automatic transmission |journal=Popular Mechanics |volume=100 |issue=2 |page=81 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8NsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA81 }}&lt;/ref&gt; being installed in a limited number of cars for testing and evaluation. Power steering was standard on Imperial Crowns.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Also, 1953 was the first year that the Imperial had a one-piece windshield, instead of a two-piece one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1953_Chrysler/1953_Imperial_Brochure/1953%20Imperial-04-05.html |title=1953 Imperial Brochure |pages=4–5 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A padded dash was standard.&lt;ref name="krause publications"/&gt;

The 1953 Chrysler Imperial was the first production car in twelve years to actually have [[automobile air conditioning|automotive air conditioning]], following tentative experiments by [[Packard]] in 1940 and [[Cadillac]] in 1941.&lt;ref name="Langworth 1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Langworth |first=Richard M. |title=Chrysler and Imperial: The Postwar Years |publisher=Motorbooks International |year=1994 |isbn=0-87938-034-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Chrysler|Walter P. Chrysler]] had seen to the invention of [[Airtemp]] air conditioning back in the 1930s for the [[Chrysler Building]], and had ostensibly offered it on cars in 1941-42, and again in 1951-52,&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; but none are known to have been sold in the latter form until the 1953 model year. In actually installing optional Airtemp air conditioning units to its Imperials in 1953, [[Chrysler]] beat [[Cadillac]], [[Buick]] and [[Oldsmobile]] which added air conditioning as an option in the 1953 model year.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;

Airtemp was more sophisticated and efficient than the complicated rival air conditioners of 1953. It recirculated, rather than merely cooled, the air inside the vehicle, and it was also the highest capacity unit available on an automobile. It was also simple to operate, with a single switch on the dashboard marked with low, medium, and high positions, which the driver selected as desired. The system was capable of cooling a Chrysler from 120 degrees to 85 degrees in about two minutes, and of completely eliminating humidity, dust, pollen and tobacco smoke at the same time. Since it relied on fresh air, and drew in sixty percent more of it than any contemporary system, Airtemp avoided the staleness associated with automotive air conditioning at the time. It was silent and unobtrusive. Instead of plastic tubes mounted on the package shelf as on GM and on other cars, small ducts directed cool air toward the ceiling of the car where it filtered down around the passengers instead of blowing directly on them, a feature that modern cars have lost.&lt;ref name="Langworth 1996"/&gt;

In 1954 the Imperial Custom had a new grille consisting of a heavy wraparound horizontal center bar with five ridges on top and integrated circular signal lights. Its front fender nameplate was above a chrome strip, which ran the length of the front door to the front of the door opening. The rear fender stone guard was larger than in 1953, but the rocker panel molding and rear fender chrome strip style were still the same. The back-up lights were now located directly below the taillights, rather than dividing the lights as in the previous year's model. The Imperial Crown shared basic styling with the Imperial Custom. However it had center-opening rear doors and Cadillac-like rear fender taillights. Air conditioning was standard on the Imperial Crown .&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kowalke|first=Ron|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975|year=1997|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=0-87341-521-3|url=https://archive.org/details/standardcatalogo00beve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1955-1975===
Chrysler Corporation advised state licensing bureaus that beginning in 1955, the Imperial was to be registered as a separate make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Automobile Quarterly |title=The Ultimate K-car |page=45 |first=Jeffrey I. |last=Godshall |volume=43 |issue=1 |year=2003 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=liUhz-3f7PYC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=Imperial+Marque+registration |accessdate=11 March 2014|isbn=9781596130371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an attempt to compete directly with GM's Cadillac and Ford's Lincoln distinct luxury-focused marques. Frequently and erroneously referred to as the "Chrysler Imperial", these cars had no "Chrysler" badging anywhere on them until 1971 (although it was removed by 1974), and were a separate distinct marque, just as Lincoln and Cadillac were for Ford and GM. Starting with the 1974 Imperial models, the "Chrysler" badging was again removed from its car body, with only the "Imperial" nameplate appearing.

In April 1955 Chrysler and Philco announced the development and production of the world's first all-transistor car radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |title=Chrysler Promises Car Radio With Transistors Instead of Tubes in '56 |date=28 April 1955 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The radio, Mopar model 914HR, was a $150.00 "option" on 1956 [[Imperial automobile]] models. Philco began manufacturing the all-transistor car radio for Chrysler in the fall of 1955 at its Sandusky, Ohio plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hirsh |first=Rick |url=http://www.allpar.com/stereo/Philco/index.html |title=1955: Philco's All-Transistor Mopar Car Radio |publisher=Allpar.com |accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/r/philco_mopar_914_hr_ch_c_5690hr.html |title=Mopar 914-HR Ch= C-5690HR Car Radio Philco, Philadelphia |publisher=Radiomuseum.org |accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Walter P.

Chrysler's intention was to create an individual line of luxury cars, distinct from Chrysler branded vehicles. This marketing strategy suffered because the cars were rarely (if ever) sold in stand-alone Imperial showrooms. Cadillac and Lincoln did a much better job of separating their luxury marques from the lower priced cars that they sold. Imperial was instead offered at the Chrysler dealer network alongside Chrysler's offerings, and the marque was almost universally known as "Chrysler Imperial" in the public's mind for this reason, despite the fact that all existing dealerships did indeed carry separate "Imperial" dealership signs distinct from Chrysler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boguslav.com/images/plymouth_lg.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116124125/http://boguslav.com/images/plymouth_lg.jpg |archivedate=16 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1960 Imperial LeBaron (7615387292).jpg|right|thumb|1960 Imperial LeBaron]]
The Imperial automobiles continued to be retailed through Chrysler dealerships. A distinct marketing channel was not established; thus, the Imperial nameplate failed to separate itself from the other Chrysler models and become a stand-alone marque. Beginning in 1967, the Imperial Division, offering three ranges (Custom, Crown, and LeBaron), retreated from their separate body-on-frame construction and their unique body on a 129.5-inch wheelbase. From that time, Imperials used the Chrysler body. It was fitted with unique styling, and through 1973, very long hoods which accounted for the three-inch-longer (127 vs. 124") wheelbase as compared to other Chrysler sedans. They continued to use their unique front suspension with torsion bars longer than all other Chrysler products and a rubber-isolated subframe crossmember containing the torsion bar anchors, as well as full instrumentation backed up by warning lights. In 1974 and 1975, separate brochures were published and separate Imperial signs still stood above the dealerships, and the Imperial continued to feature unique features (such as hidden headlights as featured since 1969, optional antilock brakes as offered since 1971, and standard four-wheel disc brakes in both 1974 and 1975), the wheelbase was reduced to the same 124" as other big Chryslers.

Although there were no Imperials produced between 1976 and 1978, the styling that was previously used for Imperial was rebranded as the [[Chrysler New Yorker#1974–1978|Chrysler New Yorker Brougham]] during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imperialclub.com/Yr/1976/index.htm|title=1976 Chrysler New Yorker Brougham Home Page|website=www.imperialclub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rear disc brakes and optional antilock feature disappeared, but the exceptionally nice interiors, including rear reading lights with precision-ground lenses which did not shine on the windshield, and four cigarette lighters, continued mostly unchanged.

===1981–1983===
[[File:1981imperial.jpg|thumb|1981 Imperial]]
The Imperial marque was again resurrected for the model years 1981 through 1983 with a two-door coupe based on the second-generation [[Chrysler Cordoba]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.allpar.com/cars/imperial/1981.html 1981 to 1983 Imperial cars: Cordoba based luxury, www.allpar.com]. Retrieved 13 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt; All examples of the 1981–1983 Imperial used Chrysler's 318 cubic-inch V8 engine. All 1981 Imperials came standard with fuel injection.

[[File:Imperial 1992.png|thumb|left|1992 Chrysler Imperial]]
[[File:Chrysler Imperial rear.jpg|thumb|left|The 1990s Chrysler Imperial featured full-width taillights]]

The early 1990s saw a revival of the Imperial as a high-end sedan in Chrysler's lineup.&lt;ref name=beaulieu/&gt; Unlike the 1955–1983 Imperial, this car was a model of Chrysler, not its own marque. Based on the [[Chrysler Y platform|Y platform]], it represented the top [[full-size]] model in Chrysler's lineup; below it was the similar [[Chrysler Fifth Avenue|New Yorker Fifth Avenue]], and below that was the shorter wheelbase [[Chrysler New Yorker|New Yorker]].

The reintroduction of the Imperial was two years after the [[Lincoln Continental#Eighth generation (1988–1994)|Lincoln Continental]] was changed to a front-wheel drive sedan with a V6 engine. Other domestic competitors in this segment included the [[Cadillac Sedan de Ville]]/[[Cadillac Fleetwood|Fleetwood]], [[Oldsmobile 98]] and [[Buick Electra]]/[[Buick Park Avenue|Park Avenue]], all of which shared [[General Motors]]' then-flagship C platform.

Though closely related, the Imperial differed from the New Yorker Fifth Avenue in many ways. The Imperial's nose was more wedge-shaped, while the New Yorker Fifth Avenue's had a sharper, more angular profile (the New Yorker Fifth Avenue was later restyled with a more rounded front end). The rears of the two cars also differed. Like the front, the New Yorker Fifth Avenue's rear came to stiffer angles while the Imperial's rear-end came to more rounded edges. Also found on the Imperial were full-width taillights which were similar to those of the [[Chrysler TC]], as well as the early 1980s Imperial coupe, while the New Yorker Fifth Avenue came with smaller vertical taillights. On the inside, the Imperial's "Kimberly Velvet" (Mark Cross Leather was available) seats carried a more streamlined look, while the New Yorker Fifth Avenue came with its signature pillowy button-tufted seats.

Initially, the 1990 Imperial was powered by the {{convert|147|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.3 L ''[[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.3|EGA]]'' [[V6 engine]], which was rated at {{convert|185|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque. For 1991, the 3.3 L V6 was replaced by the larger 3.8 L ''[[Chrysler 3.3 engine#OHV|EGH]]'' V6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1990-to-1993-chrysler-imperial-new-yorker-fifth-avenue.htm |title=1990–1993 Chrysler Imperial/New Yorker Fifth Avenue: Overview |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120920084608/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1990-to-1993-chrysler-imperial-new-yorker-fifth-avenue.htm |archivedate=20 September 2012 |accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although horsepower only increased to {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, with the new larger 3.8 L V6 torque increased to {{convert|215|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 2750 rpm. A four-speed [[automatic transmission]] was standard with both engines.

This generation Imperial was a 6-passenger [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]] offered in either velour or Mark Cross leather. Power equipment came standard, as did automatic climate controlled [[air conditioning]], [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]], [[cruise control]], driver's side airbag, and its distinct [[Landau (automobile)|landau]] vinyl roof. The Imperial featured [[hidden headlamps]] behind retractable metal covers similar to those found on the [[Chrysler LeBaron|LeBaron]] coupe/convertible and [[Chrysler New Yorker|New Yorker]]/[[Chrysler Fifth Avenue|Fifth Avenue]]. The Imperial was available with a choice of several [[Infinity Systems|Infinity]] sound systems, all with a [[cassette player]]. Other major options included fully electronic digital instrument cluster with information center, electronically controlled air suspension system, and [[remote keyless entry]] with security alarm. Dealer-installed integrated Chrysler cellular phones and six-disc CD changers were also available.

All seventh generation Imperials were covered by Chrysler's market-leading "Crystal Key Owner Care Program" which included a 5-year/50,000-mile limited warranty and 7-year/70,000-mile powertrain warranty. A 24-hour toll-free customer service hotline was also provided.

As originally planned, this generation Chrysler Imperial was discontinued after the 1993 model year along with the similar New Yorkers.  They were replaced by the new [[Chrysler LH platform|LH platform]] sedans.  While the New Yorker name continued on for three more years, 1993 would be the last year for Imperial.  The critically acclaimed cab-forward styled [[Chrysler LHS]] replaced the Imperial as Chrysler's flagship model for 1994.

A Chrysler Imperial [[concept car]] was presented at the [[North American International Auto Show#2006|2006 North American International Auto Show]]. This concept uses the [[Chrysler LY platform]], which is an extended [[Chrysler LX platform|LX]]. It features a {{convert|123|in|0|adj=on}} wheelbase. Riding on {{convert|22|in|mm|adj=on}} wheels, the car presented "a six-figure image but at a much lower price" according to Tom Tremont, Vice President of advanced vehicle design for Chrysler. The design incorporated a long [[hood (automobile)|hood]] and front end dominated by an upright radiator and a horizontal themed [[Grille (motor vehicle)|grille]]. Brushed and polished aluminum pods evoke the free-standing [[headlamp]]s (a classical throwback favored by 1960s Chrysler chief designers [[Virgil Exner]] and [[Elwood Engel]], used commonly in 1930s Chrysler vehicles). Circular [[LED]] [[taillight]]s with floating outer rings harken to the "gun sight" taillight look of early 1960s Imperials. The roof line was pulled rearward to enlarge the cabin and to create a longer profile.
===Cancellation===
On 17 July 2007, Chrysler officially announced it would drop the production plans for the Imperial. Citing increasing fuel costs and more stringent fuel economy standards expected from Capitol Hill, Chrysler said that the Imperial project was off, as a viable business case could no longer be made for the car. The Imperial had been rumored to be based on the future Mercedes R-Class or the next generation LX-platform (LY, or a combination of components) and is suggested that all of the work done on the Imperial program will be rolled into the forthcoming LY-platform cars. These cars will include the next Chrysler 300/300C, the long-wheelbase 300/300C (Perhaps renamed New Yorker) with a much larger Imperial similar in size, but not necessarily style to the Imperial Concept of 2006.

The '''Chrysler 300 "letter series"''' are high-performance [[personal luxury car]]s that were built by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] in the U.S. from 1955 to 1965. After the initial year, which was named C-300 for its standard {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine]], the 1956 cars were designated 300B. Successive model years were given the next letter of the alphabet as a suffix (skipping "i"), reaching the 300L by 1965, after which the model sequence was discontinued.

The 300 "letter series" cars were among the vehicles that focused on performance built by domestic U.S. manufacturers after [[World War II]], and thus can be considered one of the [[muscle car]]'s ancestors, though [[Full-size car|full-sized]] and more expensive.

The automaker began using the 300 designations again for performance-luxury [[sedan (car)|sedans]], using the [[Chrysler 300M|300M]] nameplate from 1999 to 2004, and expanding the 300 series with a new V8-powered 300C, the top model of a new [[Chrysler 300]] line, a new [[rear-wheel drive]] car launched in 2004 for the 2005 model year. Unlike the first "letter series" series, the successive variants do not feature standard engines producing at least 300&amp;nbsp;hp (224 kW), except for Chrysler's current top-line 300C models.

This first of the letter series cars did not bear a letter, but can retroactively be considered the '300A'. The 'C-' designation was applied to all Chrysler models; however for marketing purposes the numerical series skipped more than 225 numbers forward in sequence in order to further reinforce the 300's bhp rating. The 300 originally stood for the {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} engine. The C-300 was a racecar aimed at the NASCAR circuits that was sold for the road for homologation purposes, with Chrysler's most powerful engine, the [[Chrysler FirePower engine#331|{{convert|331|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} FirePower]] "[[Hemi]]" V8, due to the hemispheric shape of the combustion chambers, fitted with twin 4-barrel carburetors, a race-profiled camshaft setup, solid valve lifters, stiffer suspension, and a performance exhaust system. By 1956, this would be the first American production car to top {{convert|355|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, and the letter series was for many years the most powerful car produced in the United States.

The car's "Forward Look" styling can be attributed as much to the Chrysler parts bin as designer [[Virgil Exner]]. The front clip, including the grille, was taken from the [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]] of the same year, but the rest of the car did not look like an Imperial. The midsection was from a [[Chrysler New Yorker|New Yorker]] [[hardtop]], with a [[Chrysler Windsor|Windsor]] rear quarter. Exner also included base-model Chrysler bumpers and removed many exterior elements such as back-up lights, hood ornament, side trim, and exterior mirrors. An electric clock and two-speed windshield wipers were standard.&lt;ref name="flory 50s" /&gt; There were few options available including selection of three exterior colors (red, white, and black) and only one color of tan leather interior. Power windows and power seat were available but air conditioning was not available in 1955.

Measured at {{convert|127.58|mph|km/h|2|abbr=on}} in the Flying Mile, and doing well in [[NASCAR]], the C-300 aroused interest that was not reflected in its modest sales figure of 1,725.

When the C300 competed in NASCAR, it was painted to advertise that it was the "world's fastest stock car".

The 1956 300B was fairly similar externally, distinguished by a new tailfin treatment, but with larger engines, and a choice of two versions of the {{convert|354|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler FirePower engine#354|Hemi V8]] producing either {{convert|340 or 355|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. A companion of this generation was introduced as the [[DeSoto Adventurer]] that was less luxurious, while still sharing much of the mechanicals, giving DeSoto a performance enhanced model. A total of 1,102 were sold. Performance was better than the previous year's by its top speed at almost {{convert|140|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. A 6.17 ratio rear end was also added to the options. Front leg room was 44.6 inches.&lt;ref name="flory 50s" /&gt; New was the [[Highway Hi-Fi]] phonograph player.&lt;ref name="flory 50s" /&gt;

With the optional {{convert|355|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{convert|354|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine, the 300B became the first American car to produce 1 horsepower per cubic inch, besting [[Chevrolet]] with their fuel-injected {{convert|283|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} by one year.

The engine was still {{convert|392|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}, but tuned to {{convert|380|hp|kW|abbr=on}} as standard. Thirty-five cars were built with [[fuel injection]] and delivered {{convert|390|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, but the system was troublesome and most cars soon had it replaced with the standard twin-quad carburetor setup. A 300D was driven to {{convert|156.387|mph|km/h|3|abbr=on}} at the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] that year. A total of 618 hardtops and 191 convertibles were produced, in part due to a [[Recession of 1958|recession]].

The 1960 '''300F''' introduced a new [[Chrysler RB engine#413|{{convert|413|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Wedge]] engine delivering {{convert|375|hp|abbr=on}} in standard form. To boost power at lower and mid&amp;nbsp;rpms, a special "cross-ram" intake manifold was derived. Instead of the normal [[V8 engine]] central intake manifold with [[carburetor]](s) on top, the cross-ram consisted of two pairs of {{convert|30|in|mm|abbr=on}} long tuned pipes that criss-crossed so that each set fed the opposite side of the engine. The carburetors and air cleaners hung off the sides of the engine over the fender wells. These long tubes were tuned so that resonances in the column of air helped force air into the cylinders at those engine speeds. Also new were four individual, leather bucket seats with a full length console from dash to rear seatback. Swivelling front seats were fitted as standard equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.300f.com/info.htm Chrysler 300F Information] Retrieved on 10 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

A special {{convert|400|hp|abbr=on}} "short ram" version was produced for competition; in this, the tuned portion of the stacks was only {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on}} long (though the overall tube length remained at 30"), so that the resonant effect was produced at higher engine speeds. Only 15 "short ram" cars were produced; these were also fitted with the exotic but often troublesome French Pont-a-Mousson 4-speed manual transmissions developed for the Chrysler-powered [[Facel Vega]]. Approximately 4 of these "Special GTs" are known to exist, including one convertible and one with air conditioning; it is believed that 15 were originally produced.

The bodywork was also redone for 1960, using Chrysler's new lightweight [[unibody]] construction and given sharper-edged styling with outward-tilting fins that were visually separated from sides. The "toilet seat" trunk lid contributed to a demeaning opinion of the 300F and was done away with after this one year of production.

Sales increased to 969 coupes and 248 convertibles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.300f.com/info.htm|title=300F Information|publisher=Nick's Garage|accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1961 '''300G''' saw another restyle. The grille, formerly wider at the bottom than the top, was inverted; the quad headlights, formerly side-by-side, were arranged in angled fashion, inward at the bottom,&lt;ref name="krause publications" /&gt; in a manner reminiscent of 1958-1960 [[Lincoln Continental#Third generation (1958–1960)|Lincolns]], 1959 [[Buick Electra#1959–1960|Buicks]] and the 1963-1966 [[Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud#Silver Cloud III|Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud Mulliner Park Ward]] coupe. Small parking lamps below the headlights were likewise slanted and V-shaped, and the front bumper was canted up at each end, scoop-like. At the rear, the taillights were moved from the fins to the tail below them, and the fins were made sharper-pointed. Power windows were standard.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975|publisher=krause publications|isbn=0-87341-027-0|editor=Gunnell, John A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mechanically, the cross-ram "short ram" and "long ram" engines remained the same, although the expensive French [[manual transmission]] was dropped, and replaced by a more reliable and still expensive Chrysler racing manual transmission (referred to as 'option code 281'). There are currently only five cars with this transmission. Code 281 cars may have been built for the 1961 Daytona Flying Mile, although like the 1960 F Specials, no specific records were kept by Chrysler. Unlike the 300F Specials (which were randomly pulled from the line and upgraded for the Flying Mile), the 300Gs had a specific build code (281).

From 1962s '''300H''', the fins were gone, as was the letter series' unique place in the Chrysler lineup; there was now a whole Chrysler 300 Sport Series (which included a four-door hardtop along with a two-door hardtop and convertible), along with the 300H. Externally there was little difference between the 300H and the 300 Sport Series (except for a "300H" badge on the driver's side of the trunk), and many of the 300H's features could be ordered as options on the other models. Under the hood of the 300H the cross ram engine became an option, and there was a return to the inline dual 4-barrel carburetor setup of the 300E as the base powerplant. With a slight power boost and a {{convert|300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} lighter body, the 300H was faster than the 300G, but the loss of exclusivity coupled with high prices made this the slowest-selling letter series year yet, with only 435 coupes and 135 convertibles sold. The regular 300 (non-letter) series used a [[Chrysler B engine#383|{{convert|383|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} B engine]].

All 300s for 1962 were demoted to the Chrysler Newport/Dodge 880 122-inch wheelbase body.

Further restyling for the 1963 '''300J''' (the letter "I" was skipped because people would confuse it for the numeral "1".) left the car with a smoother, more angular 1960s look. (Shared with the Newport and New Yorker series, this body design was the last one styled during Virgil Exner's term as Chrysler's styling chief.) The letter-series convertible was dropped, leaving the hardtop. The only engine available was the [[Chrysler RB engine#413|{{convert|413|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} ram-induction V8]], with an increase of {{convert|10|hp|abbr=on}} from 1962. A redesigned and more sumptuous interior featured an oddly squared steering wheel. The 300J was faster than the standard 300H of the year before, with a {{convert|142|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} top speed, 8.0 seconds 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph, and a standing quarter mile time of 15.8 seconds with a terminal velocity of {{convert|89|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Sales were especially poor, with only 400 cars produced. As for the non-letter 300, the 300 convertible was the official pace car for the 1963 Indianapolis 500-Mile Race. Power steering was standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1963_Chrysler/1963_Chrysler_Brochure/1963%20Chrysler-07.html |title=1963 Chrysler Brochure |website=oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convertible returned for the 1964 '''300K''', but the "cross-ram" engine became an extra-cost option available on the 300K only. A [[Chrysler RB engine#413|{{convert|413|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Wedge]] with a single Carter AFB 3614S 4-barrel carburetor, a regular intake manifold, and {{convert|360|hp|kW|abbr=on}} was the new standard engine.

The 1965 '''300L''' was the eleventh and final model in the traditional letter series. Like every other 1965 Chrysler, it featured a completely restyled body with the crisp lines, slab sides and a tall greenhouse that were introduced by [[Elwood Engel]], successor of Virgil Exner as Chrysler's head of styling. It was a linear look and the panoramic windshield that had been used since 1957 was abandoned. The car had grown two inches in wheelbase and three inches in overall length. Both 2-door [[hardtop]] (with crease lines in the roof sheetmetal for the then-popular "convertible look") and 2-door [[convertible]] body styles were available. The cross-ram 390&amp;nbsp;hp engine had been discontinued, leaving the [[Chrysler RB engine#413|{{convert|413|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine]] with regular inlet manifold, single 4-barrel carburetion, unsilenced air cleaner, special camshaft and dual exhaust as the only engine option. Engine output was {{convert|360|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, as in the previous year. The buyer could choose between the standard 3-speed [[TorqueFlite]] automatic and the no-cost option 4-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] with Hurst shift linkage. Every feature on the 300L could be ordered as an option on the regular 300; thus, the only difference was the 300L-exclusive ornamentation. This consisted of round "300L" medallions at the center of the die-cast grille star and in the middle of the textured aluminum applique between the taillights, a red-paint-filled full-length beltline molding, and a rectangular die-cast "300" badge on rear fenders.
Tested by car magazine [[Motor Trend]], a TorqueFlite-equipped 300L 2-door Hardtop accelerated from {{convert|0|to|60|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} in 8.8 seconds, and covered the quarter mile in 17.3 seconds with a terminal speed of {{convert|82|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="MT 300L"&gt;{{cite magazine |first=John |last=Elthridge |title=Chrysler 300-L Road Test |magazine=[[Motor Trend]] |issue=March 1965 |pages=36–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 2,405 300L hardtops and 440 convertibles were produced.&lt;ref name="flory 60s" /&gt;

The 1970 ''Hurst 300'' lacks the single-letter suffix of its forebears and appeared five years after the last Letter Series Chrysler, the 300L. Many automobile historians do not include the Hurst 300 as a Letter Series model. The concept of the car, however, does fit with the Letter Series cars, as it was a high-performance variant of the luxury 300, built with the input of aftermarket parts manufacturer [[Hurst Performance]]. Only 501 units are believed to have been built.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The Hurst 300s were all 2-door and shared a white and gold paint scheme similar to the [[Oldsmobile]] and [[Pontiac]] Hurst models of the day. The scooped hood and trunk lid (with a molded spoiler) are both fiberglass. All Hurst 300s had satin tan leather interiors that were straight out of the [[Imperial (automobile)#Fourth generation (1969–1973)|Imperial]] and could be had with column- or console-mounted 727 automatics. All came with the {{convert|375|hp|abbr=on}}  {{convert|440|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} 4-barrel ''TNT'' V8 engine.

Of the 501 units sold, one convertible is documented having been used as a Hurst promotional car and another is believed to have been dealer equipped with a {{convert|426|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Hemi, also, a convertible.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== Collectibility ==
All original letter series cars are considered collectible {{As of|2005|lc=on}}, but the early years are much more desirable. The C-300 and 300B, especially red/maroon examples{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}, are increasingly becoming some of the most valuable models of all 1950s performance cars due to their exquisite styling, high performance, and rarity.  The 300C through 300G convertibles are the most desirable price-wise due to their scarcity and low survival rates; the coming of the [[Chrysler 300 non-letter series|regular 300 series cars]] in 1962 makes the subsequent letter series seem less special and less desirable to collectors.

At an auction at the Robson Estate in [[Gainesville, Georgia]] on November 13, 2010, the sole 1960 300F convertible equipped with the factory {{convert|400|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine and the Pont-a-Mousson 4-speed sold for $437,250.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmauctions.com/auction-results-overview.cfm?SaleCode=MR10|title=CLASSIC CAR FEVER SWEEPS GAINESVILLE, GEORGIA, November 13, 2010|publisher=[[RM Auctions]]|accessdate=25 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120125529/http://www.rmauctions.com/auction-results-overview.cfm?SaleCode=MR10|archive-date=2011-01-20|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was one concept vehicle called the Chrysler 300, created in 1991. It featured a sports car body and a [[Dodge Viper|Viper]] engine. It was never produced.

The 300 letter series name was resurrected in 1999 on the [[Chrysler 300M]]; but it is the 2005 [[Chrysler 300|300C]] that is closest to the original with its rear-wheel drive, and V8 engine once again bearing the "[[Chrysler Hemi engine|Hemi]]" name.

The '''Chrysler Concorde''' is a [[Full-size car|full-size]], [[front-wheel drive|front wheel drive]] four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] that was produced by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] from 1992 to 2004. It assumed the [[Chrysler C platform|C-body]] [[Chrysler New Yorker|Chrysler New Yorker Salon]]'s position as the entry-level full-size sedan in the Chrysler brand lineup. One of Chrysler's three original [[Chrysler LH platform]] models, it used revolutionary [[cab forward]] design.

The Concorde was related to the [[Dodge Intrepid|Chrysler/Dodge Intrepid]], [[Eagle Vision]], [[Chrysler 300M]], [[Chrysler LHS]], and the eleventh and final generation [[Chrysler New Yorker]]. 

It was on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 1993 and 1994.

== Design background ==

The Concorde's design can be traced to 1986, when designer Kevin Verduyn completed the initial exterior design of a new aerodynamic concept sedan called Navajo. The design never passed the clay model stage. Also at this time, the Chrysler Corporation purchased bankrupt [[Italy|Italian]] [[sports car]] manufacturer [[Lamborghini]]. The Navajo's exterior design was reworked and became the [[Lamborghini Portofino]], released as a concept at the 1987 [[Frankfurt Motor Show|Frankfurt Auto Show]]. The Portofino was heralded as a design triumph, setting in motion Chrysler's decision to produce a production sedan with the Portofino's revolutionary exterior design, called "cab-forward". The [[cab forward]] design was characterized by the long, low slung windshield, and relatively short overhangs. The wheels were effectively pushed to the corners of the car, creating a much larger passenger cabin compared to its contemporary cars.

Design of the chassis began in the late 1980s, after Chrysler had bought another automaker, [[American Motors Corporation]] (AMC) in 1987. During this time, Chrysler began designing the replacement for the [[Dodge Dynasty]] and [[Chrysler New Yorker]], as well as a potential [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]]. The initial design of Dodge's LH bore resemblance to the Dynasty, and this design was scrapped entirely after [[François Castaing]], formerly AMC's Vice President of product engineering and development, became Chrysler's Vice President of vehicle engineering in 1988. The new design, under Castaing's leadership, began with the [[Eagle Premier]], also sold later as the [[Dodge Monaco]]. The Premier's longitudinal engine mounting layout was inherited, as was the front suspension geometry, and parts of the braking system. The chassis itself became a flexible architecture capable of supporting front or [[automobile layout|rear-wheel drive]] (designated "LH" and "LX" respectively). The transmission was inspired by the Premier's Audi and ZF automatics. Borrowing heavily from Chrysler's A604 (41TE) "[[Ultradrive]]" transversely mounted automatic, it became the A606 (also known as 42LE). The chassis design was continually refined throughout the following years, as it underpinned more Chrysler prototypes: the 1989 Chrysler Millennium and the 1990 [[Eagle Optima]]. By 1990, it was decided that the new technologically advanced car would need a new technologically advanced engine to power it. Until that time, the only engine confirmed for use was Chrysler's 3.3&amp;nbsp;L [[overhead valve|pushrod]] [[V6 engine|V6]]. The 3.3&amp;nbsp;L engine's 60° block was bored out to 3.5&amp;nbsp;L, while the pushrod-actuated valves were replaced with [[SOHC]] cylinder heads with four valves per cylinder, creating an advanced 3.5&amp;nbsp;L V6.

The appearance, still based on the cab forward exterior design of the 1987 [[Lamborghini Portofino]] [[concept car|concept]], with its aerodynamic shape, made for little wind noise inside this large car. This sleek styling gives the Concorde a low [[Automobile drag coefficients|drag coefficient]] which was ahead of its time. Although American Motors' [[Eagle Premier]] (and Dodge Monaco) was discontinued by Chrysler after the 1992 model year, the new Concorde's packaging was derived from the Premier, and all the suspension and drivetrain [[development mule]]s were Premiers.&lt;ref name="1993-1997allpar"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/model/lh2/ |title=1993–1997 Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision, and Chrysler Concorde, New Yorker, and LHS |publisher=allpar.com |accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other design features found their way into the [[Chrysler LH platform]], most notably the longitudinal engine layout, a hallmark of [[Renault]]'s front-wheel-drive designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cars.about.com/od/detoursanddiversions/ig/American-branded-Eurocars/Renault-25.htm |last=Gold |first=Aaron |title=Eagle Premier/Dodge Monaco: American-branded Eurocars |publisher=About.com Cars |accessdate=25 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101113000/http://cars.about.com/od/detoursanddiversions/ig/American-branded-Eurocars/Renault-25.htm |archivedate=1 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This design allowed engineers to lower the hoodline, made maintenance/servicing simpler, and tightened the car's turning diameter.

The first generation of the Concorde debuted at the 1992 [[North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]] as a 1993 model. It debuted as a single, well-equipped model with a base price of [[United States dollar|US$]]18,341.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/chrysler14.htm |title=How Chrysler Works: The Chrysler Concorde |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |date=1 June 2007 |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chrysler Concorde LX silver rear cz.jpg|thumb|left|First generation featured full width taillamp design]]
Out of all the LH sedans, the first generation Concorde was most closely related to the [[Eagle Vision]]. The Concorde was given a more traditional image than the Vision. The two shared nearly all sheetmetal in common with the main differences limited to their grilles, rear fascias, body side moldings, and wheel choices. The Concorde featured a modern take on Chrysler's signature waterfall grille. It was split into six sections divided by body colored strips with the [[History of Chrysler#Logos|Chrysler Pentastar]] logo on the center strip. The Concorde's rear fascia was highlighted by a full-width and full-height [[lightbar]] between the taillights, giving the appearance that the taillights stretched across the entire trunk. In keeping with its upscale position, Concorde's body side moldings incorporated bright chrome (later golden colored) work not found on its Dodge or Eagle siblings. On Concordes with gray lower body paint color, the gray came all the way up to the chrome beltline; on Visions the gray lower body paint area was smaller and much more subtle. Wheel styles, which included available aluminum wheels with a Spiralcast design, were also unique to the Chrysler LH sedans (Concorde, LHS, New Yorker); Dodge and Eagle had their own different wheel styles.

The similar Eagle Vision, featured a smaller split-grill with a large Eagle badge in the center. The Vision's taillights, although the same shape as the Concorde's were clustered differently and featured European-inspired amber turn signals. The Vision did not share the Concorde's lightbar, instead using the area as space for a trunk-mounted license plate (as opposed to rear bumper-mounted license plate on the Concorde). On the other hand, the Intrepid incorporated different headlight and taillight assemblies, and had no grille at all. The interior of the Concorde was also nearly identical to that the Vision, the main difference being the Concorde's faux wood trim and steering wheel emblem; the Intrepid's interior was substantially different from the Concorde and Vision. Concordes and Intrepids could be equipped with a front bench seat and column shifter, bringing total capacity to six. The Vision could only be equipped with front bucket seats. Unlike its Dodge and Eagle siblings, Chrysler Concordes never had the option of [[autostick]] transmission and its special instrument cluster. It was only available with an [[automatic transmission]].

The upscale Concorde models featured leather-trimmed seats, steering wheels, shift knobs and door inserts. Other interior options included rear seat vents (in the five-seater), rear center rear armrest, and eight-way [[power seat]]s for both the driver and passenger, as well as personal reading lamps. Power windows and central door locks were standard on all Concordes, as were dual airbags. Other options included [[remote keyless system]] and a choice of several [[Infinity (audio)|Infinity]] sound systems with CD, cassette with up to eight speakers and an equalizer.

The upscale LXi model was distinguishable as it did not have a retractable antenna, but a fixed antenna inside the rear passenger-side fender. Anti-lock brakes ([[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]]) were standard, with [[Traction control system|traction control]] optional.

Dual-way power sunroofs were available on this car. They were designed and installed by American Sunroof (now [[American Specialty Cars]]) from its [[Columbus, Ohio]] plant, not by Mopar itself. An installed sunroof eliminated most of the front overhead console that featured storage bins for a garage door opener and sunglasses. However, the Overhead Travel Information System (OTIS), or on-board computer with integrated map lights, was retained.

A notable achievement included the [[Center for Auto Safety]] ranking the 1993 Concorde as superior in [[crashworthiness]] after testing it at {{convert|35|mph|1}} into a wall.

=== Model year changes ===

* '''1993''': Base 3.3&amp;nbsp;L engine had {{convert|153|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and standard non-touring [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]]. A six-disc trunk-mounted [[Mopar]] CD changer with wire remote and an alarm system were dealer installed options. This was the first car, along with Intrepid and Vision, to have the 3.5&amp;nbsp;L 24-valve SOHC V6. A [[Panasonic]] cell phone with externally mounted antenna could be ordered. The split bench seat with column shift lever was not yet available, but planned from the beginning.
* '''1994''': For this year, the touring suspension became standard. Also, base engines gained {{convert|8|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. A front split bench seat with twofold-down arm rests with cup holders and column shift became available to make it a six-seater. Power steering added more assist, to reduce turning effort for parking but delivered greater feel at higher speeds. The 3.3&amp;nbsp;L engine had {{convert|153|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} from 1992 to 1993 and {{convert|161|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in the remaining years of the first generation. Both 3.3&amp;nbsp;L engines were rated at 18/21/26 MPG. Chrysler's Visorphone is offered as well as a more conventional dealer installed Chrysler car phone and the same [[Panasonic]] cell phone from 1992 launch, all shown in the 1994 model year brochure.
* '''1995''': Improvements made to the transaxle, a modification to the optional remote keyless entry system and the addition of 'thumb-touch' acceleration and cancel features, placed on the steering wheel spokes, to the [[cruise control]]. Later 1995 models were produced with sheet metal front fenders, which replaced the composite fenders on earlier models to improve structural integrity. The corporate "Pentastar" logo was replaced by the Chrysler wreath on the grille, horn pad, and various other places (except the keyless entry key fob and keys, which still had the old "Pentastar" logo). Chrysler waited until 1995 for this change on its other models with the exception of the [[Chrysler Cirrus|Cirrus]] and [[Chrysler Sebring|Sebring]], with the [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] brand getting a related new logo on all 1996 and later models. [[Dodge]] had already begun phasing out the Pentastar in 1992.
* '''1996''': The Concorde gained two distinguished trim levels for 1996: lower-level '''LX''' and higher-level '''LXi'''. Extra sound insulation and revised structural engineering promised to make the Concorde quieter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1996-Chrysler-Full-Line-Brochure/1996-Chrysler-Full-Line-12-13 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150713063703/http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1996-Chrysler-Full-Line-Brochure/1996-Chrysler-Full-Line-12-13 |archivedate=13 July 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheet metal front fenders added for 1996 and later on all models as part of the structural upgrade.
* '''1997''': The only major change for this year was that on the base '''LX''' model, the 3.3&amp;nbsp;L V6 was dropped as the standard [[internal combustion engine|engine]].

All of the first-generation 3.5&amp;nbsp;L engines were rated at {{convert|217|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with 16/24 city/hwy mpg and called for 89 [[octane]] fuel.

[[File:2004 Chrysler Concorde LXi (27855267891).jpg|thumb|left|Chrysler Concorde LXi]]

The Concorde was completely redesigned for the 1998 model year. The "Second Generation" design was introduced in 1996 as the '''Chrysler LHX''' [[concept car]]. This concept vehicle had large, 20-inch wheels, a centrally located instrument cluster, and a closed-circuit television system within the windshield pillars replacing conventional rear view mirrors. The wheelbase was expanded to {{convert|124|in|mm}} to allow for rear passenger supplement restraints, rear occupant entertainment center and storage compartment.

Despite overall length increasing by {{convert|7.5|in|mm}}, the second generation's weight dropped by nearly a hundred pounds.&lt;ref name="consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1998-to-2004-chrysler-concorde.htm |title=1998–2004 Chrysler Concorde: Overview |publisher=Consumer Guide Automotive |date=12 December 2012 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100310170102/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1998-to-2004-chrysler-concorde.htm |archivedate=10 March 2010 |accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was achieved by extensive use of aluminum for the rear suspension, hood, as well as in the two new engines. In addition the {{convert|214|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler SOHC V6 engine#3.5|3.5&amp;nbsp;L]] V6 engine, there was also a new {{convert|200|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler LH engine|2.7-liter]] V6 and {{convert|225|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler SOHC V6 engine#3.2|3.2&amp;nbsp;L]] V6.&lt;ref name="consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com"/&gt; The [[Chrysler SOHC V6 engine#3.5|3.5&amp;nbsp;L]] was redone and output upgraded to {{convert|253|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and was available on the 2002–2004 Concorde Limited (formerly LHS).

[[File:Chrysler Concorde Limited.jpg|alt=2002-2004 Chrysler Concorde|thumb|right|Facelift (2002-2004)]]

Much was done in the design process to make the second generation LH sedans look more distinct from each other. The 1998 Concorde differed far greater from the [[Dodge Intrepid]] and the new 1999 [[Chrysler 300M]] (successor to the Eagle Vision), than did the first generation models. With the exception of the doors and roof, the Concorde shared little sheetmetal with the Intrepid and 300M. The new Concorde's front end was underscored by a striking full-width grille, relocated to the front bumper to give the impression of a [[bottom breather]]. Sweeping curves and a more rounded front end also helped set the Concorde apart from the Intrepid and 300M.

As in the previous generation, six passenger seating with a front bench seat and column shifter was optional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kbb.com/kbb/comparecars/Report.aspx?CompareCarsVehicleIds=3979-3985-0-0-248573&amp;CompareCarsSelectionHistory=%24%24%24%24 "2001 Chrysler Concorde" Kelly Blue Book]{{dead link|date=July 2014}}, retrieved on 29 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Cloth seating was standard on base ''LX'' with leather seating optional. Leather was standard on upscale ''LXi'' and later ''Limited'' models.

The Concorde, 300M, and Intrepid were discontinued in 2004. The all-new, rear-wheel-drive [[Chrysler 300]] replaced the Concorde (and 300M) in late 2004 as a 2005 model.

=== Model year changes ===

* '''1998''': The Concorde was completely redesigned for the 1998 model year. Body shells were designed to be stronger and stiffer, as well as incorporating double-shear suspension mounts and integrated side impact protection.&lt;ref name="1993-1997allpar"/&gt;
* '''1999''': The Concorde's suspension system was softened to enhance ride comfort and reduce road noise. Thicker carpeting was installed inside, and a new standard [[cargo net]] went into the trunk. '''LXi''' models added a new [[CD player]] and Chrysler's Sentry Key theft-deterrent system, which disabled the ignition unless the proper key was used to start the engine.
* '''2000''': A new factory-installed power [[sunroof]] was available on both base LX and upscale LXi models. The Concorde also earned additional suspension changes designed to provide a quieter, smoother ride. Tires grew to 16 inches for the '''LX''', to match those of the LXi. The LXi edition gained standard speed-sensitive, variable-assist steering, as well as an optional 4-disc in-dash [[CD changer]].
* '''2001''': Optional front side [[airbag]]s and a 3-point safety belt for the rear seat's middle position were added. The LX's 22D option package now included alloy wheels. Also, the LXi's optional Infinity [[Sound reinforcement system|sound system]] gained steering wheel-mounted controls.
* '''2002''': Adopting the body of the discontinued ''LHS'', a new trim level was added, the range-topping '''Limited''', which featured 17-inch wheels and a "high output" 3.5&amp;nbsp;L V6 with {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. With the former ''LHS's'' shorter nose, the 2002–2004 Concorde was {{convert|1.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} shorter than 1998–2001 models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.edmunds.com/chrysler/concorde/2002/features-specs.html |title=2002 Chrysler Concorde Features and Specs |publisher=Edmunds.com |accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At midyear, Limited models got an optional Pro-Am Edition Group that included two-tone leather upholstery, unique interior trim, matching chrome-rimmed spare tire, a set of Taylor Made golf clubs (irons only), a special leather/suede Chrysler golf bag, exterior 'Pro-Am' appliques on the exterior rear windows, and a 'Pro-Am' trunk organizer for holding the clubs and accessories.
* '''2003''': No major changes were made except the optional 4-disc in-dash CD changer was replaced with the optional 6-disc in-dash CD changer.
* '''2004''': The Concorde's last year. For 2005, the Concorde was replaced by the [[Chrysler 300]]. The last Concorde was produced on August 30, 2004

The '''Newport''' was a name used by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] for both a hardtop body designation and also for its lowest priced model between 1961 and 1981. Chrysler first used the Newport name on a 1940 [[show car]], of which five vehicles were produced.

The first Newport, known as the '''Chrysler Newport Phaeton''', was produced during 1940 and 1941. It was a dual-cowl [[Phaeton body|phaeton]] that used the "Chrysler Spitfire" {{convert|143|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} [[Flathead engine|L-head]] [[straight-8]] engine with dual [[carburetor]]s coupled to a three-speed [[manual transmission]]. The Newport was based upon the [[Chrysler New Yorker]], and was designed by [[LeBaron Incorporated|LeBaron]] / [[Briggs Manufacturing Company]] designer [[Ralph Roberts (automotive designer)|Ralph Roberts]]. Only six were built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coachbuilt.com/bui/l/lebaron/lebaron.htm |title=Le Baron – LeBaron Carrossiers |publisher=Coachbuilt.com |date= |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="conceptcarz1"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z16778/Chrysler-Newport-Concept.aspx |title=1941 Chrysler Newport Concept Images, Information and History |publisher=Conceptcarz.com |date= |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actress [[Lana Turner]] owned a Newport Phaeton, as did Chrysler founder [[Walter Chrysler]], who used it as a personal car. Five are known to exist today.

The Newport Phaeton served as the [[pace car]] for the 1941 [[Indianapolis 500]] race. This [[pace car]], chassis number C7807503, was the only one that did not have hide-away headlights and became the personal property of [[Walter P. Chrysler Jr.]] after the race.&lt;ref name="conceptcarz1" /&gt; Photos of the car can be found [http://www.imperialclub.com/Yr/1941/phaetons/index.htm here].

Chrysler revived the Newport name for their new, full-size entry-level model for 1961. At a base price of [[United States dollar|$]]2,964 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2964|1960}}}} today), the Newport was the least expensive Chrysler model, intended to appeal to owners of the discontinued [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] brand. While the Newport was successful and comprised the bulk of Chrysler production, the base Newport sedans were detrimmed versions of Chrysler's traditional upscale models, featuring small [[hubcap]]s instead of full-wheel covers, plain interiors and a minimal amount of exterior trim. The perception of an inexpensive Chrysler hurt the marque in the long run by cheapening the brand's cachet.{{cn|date=September 2018}} By contrast, the next model up, the New Yorker, retailed for [[United States dollar|$]]4,870 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4870|1960}}}} today)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/default.aspx?carID=19624&amp;i=2#menu |title=1961 Chrysler New Yorker Technical Specifications and data |publisher=Conceptcarz.com |date= |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising took pains to emphasize the Newport was not a [[compact car]], describing it as "a full-size Chrysler in a new lower price range" and using "no jr. editions" as a  tagline&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|https://www.flickr.com/photos/91591049@N00/48049114753&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1961, the Newport was available as a two-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]], two-door [[hardtop]], four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]], four-door [[hardtop]] and four-door [[station wagon]]. The base engine for the Newport was the {{convert|361|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine]] rated at {{convert|265|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. Optional was the {{convert|413|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} and the {{convert|383|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} that was mostly used in the Town and Country station wagons. All Newports could have been ordered with the 413 either single or dual four-bbl carbs and most of the 300 letter car options, except the four bucket seats, center console, and tachometer. A three-speed manual transmission was standard, but seldom ordered. The dash had been designed with Chrysler's push-button controls for the TorqueFlite automatic in mind, with the gauge cluster covering the part of the steering column a column shifter would come out from under then-standard practice, so manual cars used a floor shifter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/automotive-histories/automotive-history-the-mysterious-appearance-of-floor-shifters-for-chryslers-three-speed-transmission}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Station wagons from 1961 through 1964 featured hardtop body styling, with no "B" pillar. The canted headlight approach was previously used by [[Lincoln Continental#Third generation (1958–60)|Lincoln]], and briefly by [[Buick Electra#1959–1960|Buick]], but by 1961 when this generation was introduced the feature was unique to Chrysler.

The 1962 model year Chryslers continued to use the 1961 body, but were shorn of their [[Car tailfin|tailfins]].

The Newport was restyled alongside the New Yorker and [[Chrysler 300 non-letter series|Chrysler 300]] for 1963, with this body style continuing for 1964.

The 1963 model year was a major restyle without any tail fins. The 1964s saw the return of small, chrome-topped fins.

The 1965s Newport was built on an all-new [[Chrysler C platform]], shared with the 300 and New Yorker, along with the Dodge Polara and Plymouth Fury. Styling mimicked the square lines of the Lincoln Continental and the 1964 Imperial, while wheelbases increased {{convert|2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|124|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (wagons continued on the {{convert|122|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase). All body styles were continued from 1964 including the pillared four-door sedan, four-door hardtop sedan, two-door hardtop coupe, and convertible, along with the station wagon, which was renamed the '''[[Chrysler Town and Country (pre-1990)|Chrysler Town and Country]]''' and became a separate series. A new bodystyle for 1965 (shared with other Chryslers and Dodge Polaras) was a six-window Town Sedan that included a small side-window in the pillar similar to the three-window design of 1950s cars. This design would later return in the 1970s.

The standard engine for the 1965 Newport was the {{convert|383|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with two-barrel carburetor and {{convert|270|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, designed for use of regular gasoline of 92–94 Research octane. Optionally available at extra cost was the 383 with four-barrel carburetion and {{convert|315|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with higher compression and required premium fuel of 98–100 [[octane rating]]. The standard transmission was a three-speed column shifted [[Manual transmission|manual]] and optionally available was the three-speed Torqueflite [[automatic transmission]], now featuring a column-mounted shifter replacing the pushbuttons of previous years as was changeover on all 1965 model year Chrysler Corporation cars and trucks.

Interiors featured padded instrument panels, full carpeting and choices of cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl bench seats and notchback bench seats with armrest. Newport coupes and convertibles were also offered with optional bucket seats with either a center console and floor shifter or armrest and center cushion.

[[File:1966 Chrysler Newport 4-door Hardtop Sedan, front left (Hershey 2019).jpg|thumb|left|1966 Chrysler Newport four-door Hardtop]]
The 1966 Newport received new grille work and revised taillights, but was otherwise changed very little from 1965. Engine offerings were revised with the {{convert|270|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|383|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} two-barrel continuing as standard equipment while the four-barrel 383 received a {{convert|10|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} increase to {{convert|325|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. New this year was Chrysler's {{convert|440|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 that was available in a high-output TNT version with four-barrel carburetor, dual exhausts, and dual-snorkel air cleaner. This version was rated at {{convert|365|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, about {{convert|15|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} more than the standard 440 four-barrel that was the base engine in the New Yorker and Imperial, and optional on the Chrysler 300 as well as Dodge Polaras and Monacos, and Plymouth Furys.

[[File:'67 Chrysler Newport (Auto classique Laval '11).jpg|thumb|left|1967 Chrysler Newport]]

For 1967, the Newport and other Chryslers received new sheet metal, but retained the basic 1965 bodyshell. Two-door hardtops received a new angular semi-fastback roofline featuring reverse-slant side windows while the rooflines of four-door pillared and hardtop sedans, and station wagons were unchanged. The slow-selling six-window Town Sedan was dropped this year. Engines were unchanged except for the {{convert|440|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} TNT version was increased up to {{convert|375|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.
[[File:Chrysler Newport (Orange Julep '10).jpg|thumb|left|1968 Chrysler Newport Sedan]]

New to the Newport line for 1967 was a more luxurious Newport Custom series available in four-door pillared and hardtop sedans, along with the two-door hardtop.

The 1968 Newport received only a minor facelift from its 1967 counterpart including new grilles and taillights. All body styles were carried over on both the base Newport and Newport Custom lines. The standard {{convert|383|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} two-barrel [[V8 engine|V8]] received a {{convert|20|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} increase to {{convert|290|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while the four-barrel {{convert|383|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} rating went from {{convert|325|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|330|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while the {{convert|440|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} TNT was unchanged at {{convert|375|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

A mid-year offering on the Newport hardtop coupe and convertible was the Sportsgrain option similar to the [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] exterior bodyside trim on the Town and Country station wagons of this period. The Sportsgrain Newport was intended to bring back the spirit of the late 1940s Town and Country convertibles but amounted to little more than a regular Newport as there were no other modifications and interior trims were the same as standard Newports. Production of the 1968 Sportsgrain Newports amounted to 965 hardtops and 175 convertibles. The Sportsgrain option returned for the redesigned 1969 Newport two-door hardtop and convertible; however, orders for the option were low that Chrysler did not release their production totals.

Mercury tried a similar approach to the Sportsgrain Newport in 1968 by offering woodgrain "Yacht Deck Paneling" as an option on its [[Mercury Park Lane#Second generation|Park Lane]] coupes and convertibles, which also did not experience significant consumer demand.

The Newport was completely redesigned again for 1969, and featured the distinctive "Fuselage Styling" that would become symbolic of Chrysler's full-size cars until the end of the 1973 model year. Although retaining the same {{convert|124|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase that it shared with the premium [[Chrysler New Yorker|New Yorker]], this generation Newport was longer, lower, wider, and several hundred pounds heavier than the 1965–1968 Newports.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia2006" /&gt;

Although still offered in 2-door and 4-door hardtop, 2-door convertible, and 4-door sedan models, station wagons were no longer part of the Newport series, as the [[Chrysler Town and Country (pre-1990)|Town &amp; Country]] became a separate model outright. Newport convertibles were discontinued after 1970, following a drop in sales of 48 percent that year, to 1124 convertibles; while total Newport sales were down almost 30 percent, to 110,292 units, despite the restyling.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p. 736.&lt;/ref&gt;

Available in 2- and 4-door hardtops and 4-door sedans, the Newport Custom would still be offered as the top-line Newport through the entire 1969–1973 design cycle. First appearing in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;Flory, pp. 889–90.&lt;/ref&gt; the Newport Royal was an entry-level model in the Newport Series. It borrowed the name of the entry-level Chrysler from [[Chrysler Royal|1937–50]];&lt;ref name="Flory, p.890"&gt;Flory, p. 890.&lt;/ref&gt; but the Royal name was dropped in 1972.&lt;ref name="Flory, p.890" /&gt;

For the 1971 model year, the Royal came standard with the {{convert|255|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, with optional {{convert|275|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} or {{convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|383|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engines, but not the {{convert|440|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}; the Custom was standard with the {{convert|275|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|383|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, and the {{convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|383|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} or {{convert|335|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|440|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8s as options.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p. 813.&lt;/ref&gt; For 1972, the Royal came standard with the {{convert|175|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, with larger-displacement engines unavailable, while the Custom was standard with the {{convert|190|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, and the {{convert|225|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} single- and {{convert|245|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} dual-exhaust {{convert|440|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8s were optional.&lt;ref name="Flory, p.890" /&gt; Power output would steadily decrease on all engines during this generation due to stricter emissions standards and rising fuel prices.

The Newport was redesigned for the 1974 model year, along with all other full-size [[Chrysler C platform|C-body]] cars. This generation shed the sweeping "fuselage" styling, in favor of more crisper, slab-sided styling.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia2006" /&gt; Despite losing several inches in length, 1974–1978 Newports were some of the heaviest cars ever produced by Chrysler.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia2006" /&gt; Their introduction coincided with the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 OPEC oil embargo]], and sales of all full-size cars plummeted. The Chrysler Corporation was especially hit hard, as no smaller cars were sold under the Chrysler brand.

Production of the C-body Newport ended in 1978, along with the [[Chrysler New Yorker]]. Related [[Dodge]] and [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] C-body cars, as well as C-body Chrysler Town &amp; Country station wagons had all been dropped the previous year. The 1978 Newport and New Yorker offered the [[United States|American]] car industry's last true two-door and four-door [[hardtop]]s; all four-doors and Newport coupes were hardtops, the pillared sedan also having been dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flory Jr. |first=J.

The 1979 model year saw a new downsized Newport on the [[Chrysler R platform]], a derivative of the circa 1962 [[Chrysler B platform]]. This reduced model availability to a single "pillared hardtop" 4-door sedan. While GM and Ford had downsized their big cars by engineering smaller bodies around more spacious passenger accommodations, Chrysler took a different approach. The existing [[Chrysler B platform]] was modified to improve fuel efficiency through a number of weight saving measures. Examples include plastic brake [[wheel cylinder]] pistons, which tended to swell and bind up the brakes after a some years in service. Chrome-plated aluminum bumpers were another innovation, but were replaced in 1980 with a stronger steel rear bumper. The large displacement V8 engines were dropped.

Initial 1979 sales were strong (with a large portion of Newport sales going for fleet use), but Chrysler's unsteady financial condition, combined with the 1980 addition of the [[Plymouth Gran Fury]], tightening oil and gasoline supplies hurt sales of the redesigned vehicle, and all of the R-body models were discontinued after a short run of 1981 models, as Chrysler began its shift toward smaller [[front-wheel drive]] cars.

The Newport model name nearly made a comeback in early 1984 as an addition to the M-Body (Dodge Diplomat, Plymouth Gran Fury, Chrysler Fifth Avenue) lines.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Orders were taken by Chrysler-Plymouth dealers, but at the last minute, the would-be Newport was marketed as the [[Dodge Diplomat]] SE. This model used the same waterfall grille as the Chrysler Fifth Avenue with the exception of a horizontal bar running across the center to mimic the other "crosshair" grilles in the Dodge lineup.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/17/business/new-chrysler-newport.html New Chrysler Newport (New York Times; August 17, 1983)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chrysler Airstream''' is an automobile produced by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] in 1935 and 1936. The Airstream was a conventional looking automobile that was trimmed to evoke a feeling of streamlined design, and was a smaller luxury car to the larger [[Chrysler Imperial#1934–1936|Imperial]]. A similar car, with the same [[DeSoto Airstream|Airstream]] name was also sold by Chrysler's companion brand [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] during the period.

The creation of the Airstream was an outgrowth of the unpopularity of the streamlined [[Chrysler Airflow]], which consumers failed to embrace. The Airstream was based on the 1933 Chrysler "CO" model, which was carried over into the 1934 model year as the Chrysler "CA". When the Airflow failed to capture the attention of the buying public, Chrysler retrimmed the "CA", gave the car rear fender skirts, and rolled out a model that they hoped would appeal to [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era buyers. By marketing the Airstream alongside the Airflow, Chrysler could meet the needs of the public while hoping to produce enough Airflows to offset their development.
[[File:1935 Chrysler Airstream Coupe.JPG|left|thumb|1935 Chrysler Airstream Coupe]]
During its two years of production, the Airstream outsold the Airflow five to one in its first year, and nearly nine to one in 1936.

Chrysler discontinued the "Airstream" model name for both Chrysler and DeSoto at the beginning of the 1937 model year.&lt;ref name="Kimes 1996"/&gt;

The following is a list of vehicles bearing the [[Chrysler]] brand name. Chrysler is a Mainstream brand. The list below also includes vehicles manufactured in other countries and cars designed by other independent corporations that were rebranded for Chrysler. "[[Chrysler Australia]]" was the Australian division of Chrysler, and cars made by Chrysler Australia were sold mainly in their country of origin. The same goes for cars marked "Europe" and "Canada".

[[File:Chrysler 160 post cond.jpg|thumb|250px|Interior of a Chrysler 160 fitted with manual transmission.]]
The '''Chrysler 180''' was the base name for a series of [[Executive car|large]] [[sedan (car)|saloon]] cars produced by [[Chrysler Europe]]. Resulting from joining development efforts of [[Rootes Group]] and [[Simca]], the car was produced from 1970 to 1975 in [[Poissy]], France, and later in Chrysler's subsidiary [[Barreiros (manufacturer)|Barreiros']] factory in Spain. The Chrysler 180 was also the base for the medium-sized model built by [[Chrysler Australia]], the [[Chrysler Centura]].

Depending on engine employed, the cars were marketed as '''Chrysler 160/180/2 litre''', and since 1977 in France and rest of continental Europe as '''Chrysler-Simca 1609/1610/2 litres'''. After the takeover of Chrysler Europe by [[PSA Peugeot Citroën]], the continental Europe models were renamed '''Talbot 1610/2 litres''' for 1979 and 1980 model years, after which the model was discontinued in Europe save for [[Spain]], where a [[diesel engine|diesel]] model was sold until 1982.

The large Chrysler fared quite poorly in the principal European markets. The replacement for the car was developed by Chrysler Europe under the codename ''C9'' and was finally launched by PSA as the even more ill-fated [[Talbot Tagora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootes-chrysler.co.uk/car-development/dev-tagora.html|title=Development of the Talbot Tagora cars|work=Rootes-Chrysler.co.uk &amp;ndash; Rootes Group, Chrysler Europe, SIMCA, and Talbot cars|accessdate=2007-09-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928025000/http://www.rootes-chrysler.co.uk/car-development/dev-tagora.html|archive-date=2007-09-28|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Although Chrysler gradually took financial control of both Simca and Rootes Group during the 1960s, there was little effort to coordinate the operations of both automakers. Therefore, the first common European Chrysler car was actually a result of two separate development programmes.&lt;ref name="rootes-development"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootes-chrysler.co.uk/car-development/dev-180.html|title=Development of the Simca 180 cars|work=Rootes-Chrysler.co.uk &amp;ndash; Rootes Group, Chrysler Europe, SIMCA, and Talbot cars|accessdate=2006-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rootes Group C Car ===
In 1966, under the direction of [[Roy Axe]], the Head of Design, Rootes Group team started working on what was internally named the "'''''C Car'''''" (in reference to the smaller "''B car''", which became the [[Hillman Avenger]]), a new large car for Rootes to replace the [[Humber Hawk]] (and the imported Australian [[Chrysler Valiant]], which served as a placeholder in Rootes' lineup after the Hawk's demise in 1967, without much success). In typical Rootes fashion, the plan was to market the car under three brands - the base version as [[Hillman]], a 2.0-litre one as [[Sunbeam Motor Car Company|Sunbeam]] 2000, and atop the range a Humber Hawk with a 2.5-litre engine.&lt;ref name="Zatz"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zatz|first=David|title=Chrysler 180, 160, and 160GT, Simca 1501, and Chrysler 2 Litre; and the Chrysler Centura and Barreiros|url=http://www.allpar.com/cars/chrysler/180.html|work=www.allpar.com|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further development of the C Car with a stretched platform was planned, a "''D Car''", which was to replace the [[Humber Super Snipe]].&lt;ref name="rootes-development"/&gt;

The Rootes development programme also comprised the development of a brand-new [[V6 engine]], with a 60° vee angle, with two versions of the abovementioned displacements of 2.0 and 2.5&amp;nbsp;litres. There were four (Series IV, presumably) Humber Hawk- and some Hillman Avenger-bodied prototypes built to test the new engine.&lt;ref name="Zatz" /&gt; Some other design propositions included the use of [[De Dion tube]]s for rear suspension (like in the competing [[Rover P6]]), as well as a five-speed gearbox (which would still be a rather daring proposition at that time).&lt;ref name="rootes-development"/&gt;

One of the engineers who worked on the design of the C Car was [[Tony Wheeler]], who was later the founder of the [[Lonely Planet]] travel guides.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=onAAlO6qkiIC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=tony+wheeler+chrysler&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IU6FlCWpQT&amp;sig=sg1vWcE3swmd2g6RW1Ts_pveRfk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-NWOVfjBFofaU8DZgNAJ&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCg#v=onepage&amp;q=tony%20wheeler%20chrysler&amp;f=false ''The Lonely Planet Story: Once While Travelling''], Tony Wheeler, Maureen Wheeler, Crimson Publishing, 2008, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Simca Projet 929 ===
At the same time, in France, Simca was working on '''''Projet 929''''', which would be Simca's first large car since the [[Simca Vedette|Vedette]] was cancelled in 1961, and also partially replace the [[Simca 1300/1500|Simca 1501]] in its role of the range-topping Simca. The car would not use a V6 engine, as the displacement-based ''[[tax horsepower|puissance fiscale]]'' tax system in France would make the costs prohibitive, but rather four-cylinder units of more modest specifications. There were three styling propositions prepared for the new car. The ''929 XA'' was styled by Simca's design team, featuring angular design and rather top-heavy proportions. [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]] designed the ''929 XB'', which was much more rounded and somewhat reminiscent of contemporary [[BMW]]s. Finally, the ''929 XC'' was sent straight from Chrysler's [[Detroit]] design studios, and was very American in style, resembling a smaller version of what then became the Australian [[Chrysler VE Valiant|VE Series Chrysler Valiant]].&lt;ref name="rootes-development"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rootes-929"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootes-chrysler.co.uk/simca-cars/simca-929.html|title=Projet 929|work=Rootes-Chrysler.co.uk &amp;ndash; Rootes Group, Chrysler Europe, SIMCA, and Talbot cars|accessdate=2006-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The decision ===
In early 1969, Chrysler realized that there were actually two potentially competing cars being developed and called for both the British and the French proposition to be presented before the general management of Chrysler Europe. The decision was taken to go ahead with the British C Car programme, but to develop two versions for both the UK and the French part of the concern. Chrysler funded a new plant along with a development centre for the Rootes Group at the [[Whitley plant]], [[Coventry]],&lt;ref name="Zatz" /&gt; where the development was continued. Roy Axe employed former Chrysler USA designer [[Curt Gwinn]] as project designer, and the C Car took a shape very similar to an enlarged version of Hillman Avenger. Initial designs were inspired by contemporary American Chryslers, with twin headlamps and a light bar in the rear.&lt;ref name="rootes-development"/&gt;

In 1970, however, Chrysler reviewed the programme once again and decided to trim it down to just one version, to be built in Simca's Poissy factory in France, for all markets.&lt;ref name="Zatz" /&gt; The responsibility for the programme was then passed in turn to Simca (where it became known internally as "'''Simca 1800'''"), who gave the car a different front end with rectangular single front lamps, as well as stripping the interior of some features proposed by the Rootes Group team, such as genuine wood and leather and [[air conditioning]]. Much to the shock of the British engineers, the entire V6 engine programme was scrapped, even despite, allegedly, [[Pound sterling|£]]31 million of the £38 million programme budget already having being spent, and the tooling for the new engine already installed in the Rootes' Humber Road factory.&lt;ref name="Zatz" /&gt; The car also ended up with more conventional [[coil spring|coil sprung]] rear [[live axle]] and [[MacPherson strut]]s in the front and a four-speed [[manual transmission]] (with an option of a three-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]).&lt;ref name="rootes-development"/&gt;

[[File:Chrysler 180 Barreiros 870.jpg|thumb|Spanish-built Chrysler 180]]

=== Launch ===
Following the renaming of Simca as "Chrysler France" and Rootes Group as "Chrysler UK" (which combined formed Chrysler Europe), the new large car was the first one to spearhead the concept of unifying the offerings from both sides of the Channel under the common brand. Thus, the vehicle was launched as Chrysler 160, '''160 GT''' and 180. In a fashion similar to Simca models, the designations referred to the displacement of the engines employed by the given version. The 160 employed the 1632&amp;nbsp;cc unit, while the 180 came with the 1812&amp;nbsp;cc one. A bit confusingly, the 160 GT came equipped with the larger engine.&lt;ref name="rootes-development"/&gt; The 160 has {{convert|80|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} while the 160 GT and 180 have {{convert|97|PS|kW|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="AU71"/&gt;

The three models were introduced to the public at the 1970 [[Mondial de l'Automobile|Salon International d'Automobile]] under the slogan " An American from Paris".&lt;ref name="Zatz" /&gt; The British launch took place in 1971, with only the 180 on offer. The 2.0-litre model (marketed simply as "Chrysler 2 litre") joined the lineup for 1973, unveiled at the Amsterdam Auto Show in 1972 for the first time. The 1981&amp;nbsp;cc unit was available solely with Chrysler's [[TorqueFlite]] automatic transmission (which was an option on the 180 model), and the model came with a host of features that distinguished it from the lesser versions, including a full-length [[vinyl roof]] (which became an option for the 160 and 180), bumper-mounted [[Automotive lighting#Driving lamps|auxiliary driving lights]] and a small "2L" badge adorning the C-pillar. The 160 and 180 also gained some chrome and metal trim on the outside in 1972, and since the advent of the 2.0-litre, all models featured 14-inch (rather than previous 13-inch) wheels and new [[hubcap]]s. The 160 GT was cancelled at the same time.&lt;ref name="rootes-development"/&gt;

=== Press reaction ===
A  Chrysler 180 saloon tested by the British [[The Motor (magazine)|Motor magazine]] in April 1971, a few months after the model's UK launch, had a top speed of {{convert|101.0|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and could accelerate from 0-{{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 12.4 seconds. An overall fuel consumption of {{convert|21.7|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus}} was recorded. The test car was offered at £1498 including taxes.  For all three of these measurements, the car was ranked third out of five UK market competitor vehicles: competitors  identified by the journal,  included the [[Ford Cortina|Ford Cortina Mk III 2000 GXL]] and the [[Vauxhall Victor|Vauxhall VX 4/90]].  The overall tone of the road test, written at a time when new models were generally greeted with uncritical enthusiasm by UK motoring journalists, is summed up in its description of the Chrysler 180 as a "very pleasing car that only just falls short of being a luxury sporting saloon".&lt;ref name=Motor1971&gt;{{cite magazine | authorlink = Unsigned |title = Road Test Chrysler 180|magazine=[[The Motor (magazine)|The Motor]]| volume = | pages = 23–27|date=April 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Barreiros ===
[[File:Chrysler 180 estate Spain.jpg|right|thumb|A Spanish Chrysler 180 converted to estate]]
When it became apparent that the model was far less than a market hit, Chrysler decided to move the assembly lines from the Poissy factory to the Villaverde plant of its Spanish subsidiary, [[Barreiros (manufacturer)|Barreiros]]. Barreiros had been assembling many Simca and Chrysler models previously for the protected Spanish market, but for the first time it would become the sole supplier of the entire model line for all markets. The vehicle became reasonably popular in its new home market, and local [[coachbuilder]]s even created [[estate car|estate]] and [[Limousine#Stretch limousines|stretched]] versions of the car. The lineup remained for the most part unchanged in most markets, although the 160 was not offered in Spain, which in turn received a new [[diesel engine|diesel]] model, powered by the Barreiros 2.0-litre diesel engine (not offered in other European markets).&lt;ref name="rootes-barreiros"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootes-chrysler.co.uk/chry-barr.html|title=Barreiros|work=Rootes-Chrysler.co.uk &amp;ndash; Rootes Group, Chrysler Europe, SIMCA, and Talbot cars|accessdate=2006-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chrysler 180 Diesel ====
The engine was a traditional four cylinders diesel with [[indirect injection]]. It was mated to the four-speed manual transmission and delivered 48&amp;nbsp;kilowatts (65&amp;nbsp;hp). The diesel model was fitted with the most basic 160 [[dashboard]]. An important change to the Spanish lineup was forced by the November 1977 change of the Spanish taxation system, similar to France's ''puissance fiscale'' - a new ''13 CV'' tax band was introduced, which attracted the very high rate of 35%, and encompassed both the petroleum and diesel 2.0-litre models. While the petroleum 2.0 Litre model was simply replaced by a 180 automatic, the diesel engine had to be modified for 1978 to avoid increased taxation. The displacement was decreased from 2007&amp;nbsp;cc to 1917&amp;nbsp;cc (without a drop in actual maximum power or speed), just below the border of the ''13 CV'' tax band, which stood at 1920&amp;nbsp;cc.&lt;ref name="rootes-barreiros"/&gt;

=== Later model life ===
In 1977, the car was for the first time officially badged as Chrysler-Simca in continental Europe (the Simca badge appeared on the bootlid, while the stylized Chrysler plate continued to adorn the front end). The individual models were renamed to be in line with the newly launched [[Simca 1307|Simca 1307/1308]] series. While the first two digits in this model naming system stood for the base engine's displacement (1.6 in case of the Chrysler 160), the latter two represented the French fiscal class in which the car slotted. Thus, the 1.6-powered model became the '''Chrysler-Simca 1609''', as it fitted in the French ''9 CV'' tax band (even though this model actually was cancelled from the French market lineup), and the 1.8, slotting one class higher, became the '''Chrysler-Simca 1610''', and was fitted with the vinyl roof and extra driving lamps from the 2.0-litre model. However, in the UK, where only the 180 was on offer, it retained its name. To add to the confusion, the 2.0-litre retained its name in all markets.&lt;ref name="rootes-development"/&gt;

==== PSA takeover ====
In 1979, the large Chrysler saw the sale of its parent company, [[Chrysler Europe]], to the French [[PSA Peugeot Citroën|PSA]] concern, due to Chrysler's financial difficulties. Some minor reshuffles in the range were made. The 1.8-litre engine was cancelled—in France, the 1610 got the 2.0-litre engine (which made it technically a "11 CV" car, but the name was not changed), while in Britain the 180 model was simply dropped, with the 2.0-litre now being offered with either the manual or automatic transmission to mirror the continental lineup. A minor rehash of the exterior decals also occurred. From 1 August 1979, PSA decided to rename all previous Chrysler Europe cars as [[Talbot]]s (and Talbot-Simcas in case of the French models, to capitalize on the established brand), and hence the Chrysler-Simca 1609 and 1610 became the '''Talbot Simca 1609''' and '''1610''', and in Britain, the car became the '''Talbot 2 litre'''. The range was sold for only one year with the new names, as for 1981 PSA presented a replacement, the brand-new [[Talbot Tagora]].&lt;ref name="rootes-development"/&gt; Peugeot had originally intended to replace it with the Solara, the saloon version of the Alpine, which was launched in April 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootes-chrysler.co.uk/car-development/dev-alpine.html |title=Development of the Chrysler - Talbot Alpine cars |publisher=Rootes-chrysler.co.uk |date=1976-04-02 |accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of petrol-engine Talbot 1610 stopped at the Barreriros plant, but diesel versions continued under the Talbot badge until 1982 for the Spanish market.&lt;ref name="rootes-barreiros"/&gt;

== Lack of market success ==
The Chrysler 180/2-litre probably found its best market in Spain, albeit only after production had been transferred there in the later 1970s: Spain was effectively closed off to any competitor product not assembled in Spain.   The only significant locally assembled competitor here was the [[SEAT 132|Seat 132]].

The car was not received too well either in France or in the UK. Its mixed pedigree and exotic brand did not fit in well with the expectations of more nationalistic buyers and reviewers, and there was little that would make the car stand out among the crowd of similar cars, many of which already had an established position in the class. By 1976, with the number of cars sold in the UK not yet up to 10,000, British sales had settled down at the annual rate of about 2,000 which was seen to be below the company's expectations, but UK sales were more impressive than those in France.&lt;ref name=Autocar197608&gt;{{cite magazine| authorlink =Ray Hutton (ed)| title =Buying Secondhand: Chrysler 180|magazine=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] | volume = | pages =16–18|date = 14 August 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In France, the sales of the Chrysler were so disappointing that the old Simca 1501 was offered again for 1974 (it remained in production sometime after the Chrysler's launch for export markets mostly, in order to use up the remaining parts).&lt;ref name="rootes-development"/&gt;

The German ''Auto Katalog'' remarked that the car bore resemblance to the [[Opel Rekord Series C|Opel Rekord C]] (which can perhaps be said not only of its styling, but also of almost identical dimensions and similar engine selection), yet it also pointed out that the Rekord in question was a four-year-old car at that time (and was subsequently replaced by [[Opel Rekord Series D|a new model]] in 1971).&lt;ref name="Auto Katalog2"&gt;{{cite book | title=Auto-Modelle : Katalog | publisher=[[:de:Motor Presse Stuttgart|Vereinigte Motor Verlage Stuttgart]] | year=1970–1971 | issn= 0463-6589 |page=108|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the British market the car's chances against rivals, such as the successful [[Rover SD1]], were also hampered by the lack of engines larger than the 2.0-litre, as the competitors offered six- or even eight-cylinder units, being unhampered by the French tax regulations.&lt;ref name="rootes-development"/&gt;

Moreover, Chrysler seemed not to support the model after the launch. Advertising was scanty and updates scarce and rather limited in scope. Chrysler did not bother to fit the supposedly upmarket model with such features as [[power windows]], [[central locking]], even though they were all available in the smaller Simca 1307, launched around the time when the 180 was in mid-life.&lt;ref name="rootes-development"/&gt; It did receive a low fuel warning lamp which would come on when a couple of gallons of fuel was left in the tank, a then-unusual fitment.

==Chrysler Centura==

{{Main|Chrysler Centura}}
A variant of the Chrysler 180 was produced in [[Australia]] from 1975 to 1978 by [[Chrysler Australia]] as the [[Chrysler Centura]]. The Centura was offered with a choice of 4-cylinder and 6-cylinder engines mated to a [[manual transmission|manual]] or [[automatic transmission]] and was fitted with a modified front radiator grille to allow more airflow to the radiator, and four round headlamps to complete the makeover. The Centura had limited market success in Australia.

The '''Chrysler Sunbeam''' is a small [[Supermini car|supermini]] three-door [[hatchback]] manufactured by [[Chrysler Europe]] at the former [[Rootes Group]] factory in [[Linwood, Renfrewshire|Linwood]] in Scotland, from 1977-81. The Sunbeam's development was funded by a UK Government grant with the aim of keeping the Linwood plant running, and the small car was based on the larger [[Hillman Avenger]], also manufactured there. After the takeover of Chrysler's European operations by [[PSA Peugeot Citroën|PSA]], the model was renamed '''Talbot Sunbeam''' and continued in production until 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Robson, A-Z of Cars of the 1970s, 1990, page 38&lt;/ref&gt;  A Talbot Sunbeam Lotus version was successful in [[rallying]] and won the [[World Rally Championship]] [[List of World Rally Championship Constructors' Champions|manufacturers' title]] for Talbot in [[1981 World Rally Championship season|1981]].

== Background ==
In the mid-1970s, the British automotive industry was in crisis, marred by bad management, frequent strikes and decreasing competitiveness compared to the increasingly successful Japanese automakers. It took its toll on Chrysler UK, which was the name given to the former Rootes Group after its takeover by the American-based [[Chrysler Corporation]]. In particular, the Linwood facility was generating losses due to many reasons, including underutilised capacity.&lt;ref name="rootes-sunbeam"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aronline.co.uk/cars/chrysler-talbot/sunbeam/|title=Chrysler/Talbot Sunbeam (R424)|work=AROnline |accessdate=2020-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, the infamous [[Ryder Report (British Leyland)|Ryder Report]] led to the effective [[nationalisation]] of Chrysler UK's major competitor, [[British Leyland Motor Corporation|British Leyland]]. Chrysler management decided that the company should therefore also benefit from state aid, and pressed the government for it by threatening to close the UK operations. The government agreed to a state grant reported at £55,000,000 &lt;ref name=AutoMotoruSport197719/&gt; to fund the development of a small car, to be developed in Chrysler's UK facilities and manufactured in Linwood.&lt;ref name="rootes-sunbeam"/&gt;

== Development ==
The development of the new car started in January 1976, under the codename ''Project R424''. The technical side was the responsibility of the engineering team in Ryton, while the styling was the responsibility of Chrysler's [[Whitley plant|Whitley design studio]] in [[Coventry]], led by [[Roy Axe]] (who left the UK for Chrysler's headquarters in the US before the car was launched). Many constraints, such as a very tight schedule, low budget and the need to use as many British components as possible, led to the decision to use the [[rear-wheel drive]] [[Hillman Avenger]] as the base for the new vehicle, rather than the more trendy [[front-wheel drive]] constructions of Chrysler's French subsidiary, [[Simca]]. The Sunbeam was, unlike the larger Horizon and Alpine models which were launched by Chrysler in the mid to late 1970s, never sold in France as a Simca.&lt;ref name="rootes-sunbeam"/&gt;  Although it was targeted at the supermini size class, the Sunbeam's Avenger underpinnings meant that it was slightly larger than its intended rivals, and overlapped with the Horizon model.  For this reason, the Sunbeam was only available as a three-door derivative.

Basing the car on the Avenger's platform allowed for the car not only to use as many existing components as possible, but also to put it in production in Linwood quickly and at minimal investment. The Avenger's wheelbase was shortened by {{convert|3|in|mm}}, and some modifications were made to accommodate the 928&amp;nbsp;cc [[Coventry Climax]]-derived engine, an enlarged version of the 875cc unit used in the rear-engined [[Hillman Imp]], also made in Linwood. Other than that, most components were identical to those of the Avenger.&lt;ref name="rootes-sunbeam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rootes-imp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aronline.co.uk/cars/hillman/imp/|title=Hillman Imp (Apex)|work=AROnline|accessdate=2020-03-20|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car took its steering wheel and instrument pod from Chrysler's recently launched [[European Car of the Year#Results: 1964–2009|award-winning]] [[Simca 1307|Simca 1307/Chrysler Alpine]].&lt;ref name=AutoMotoruSport197719/&gt;

On the outside, with the exception of the doors, which were straight from the two-door Avenger, the R424 was given an all-new body, styled very much in line with Chrysler's new, angular "international" style, conceived by Axe, which was first presented with the debut of the 1975 [[Simca 1307|Simca 1307/Chrysler Alpine]], and was later also represented by the 1977 [[Chrysler Horizon|Simca/Chrysler Horizon]] (''Project C2''). This ensured that the R424 fit in well with the new Chrysler lineup and came across as fairly modern. Nevertheless, a constraint in the development process took its toll on the initial look of the car - as the C2's (Horizon's) headlamps were not available at the planned launch time of the R424, the small car was given the lamps of the prefacelift Hillman Avenger, which required the characteristic recessed mounting in the front fascia.&lt;ref name="rootes-sunbeam"/&gt; The GLS version had a [[vinyl roof]] as standard.

There was only one body style for the Sunbeam, that of a three-door [[hatchback]]. The car was literally a hatchback, with the rear hatch formed out of a single piece of glass as seen previously on the Hillman Imp. This required a high rear sill to provide some structural rigidity and which consequently made the loading and unloading of luggage rather difficult. Although it was a good looking car with clean modern lines, the tricky luggage compartment and the lack of alternative bodystyles - the reasoning being that the [[Chrysler Avenger|Avenger]] range already offered saloon and estate variants - ultimately compromised the car's appeal in the UK market. The Sunbeam's main competitor in the UK, the [[Vauxhall Chevette]] was produced in different body styles,   two- and four-door saloons and an estate,  to cater for a broader range of customers.

On the interior side, the "GL" version was the first car to sport printed "melded" fabric from Cambrelle on its seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Society of Dyers and Colourists|first=|title=The International Dyer, Textile Printer, Bleacher and Finisher |year=1991 |publisher=Heywood &amp; Co. |id=}}, page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; These have been considered similar to the Avenger in their comfort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carsurvey.org/review_26604.html Chrysler Sunbeam review at Carsurvey.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the R424's launch, most Chrysler UK products were sold in export markets under the [[Sunbeam Motor Car Company|Sunbeam]] brand of the former Rootes portfolio. Chrysler, however, was striving to cut down on the Rootes brand palette (which at that time existed solely by means of [[badge engineering]]) and introduce a pan-European image using the Chrysler brand as the only one for the whole range. The result was naming the car, "Chrysler Sunbeam", and the Sunbeam brand was discontinued, with the remaining Rootes Group models also rebranded as Chryslers in 1976.&lt;ref name="rootes-sunbeam"/&gt;

== Launch ==
After a remarkably short development period of 19 months, the Chrysler Sunbeam was launched on July 23, 1977, to a quite positive reception by the British automotive press. An advertising campaign featured [[Petula Clark]] singing "''...put a Chrysler Sunbeam in your life.''" There were initially three engine sizes; 0.9, 1.3 and 1.6 litres, and three trim level available - base "LS", better-equipped "GL" and the most expensive "S". To reduce in-house competition, the more basic versions of the two-door Avengers were dropped at the same time in the UK market, and the Chrysler Horizon was only available in five-door form. The Sunbeam sold well, but was not a runaway success.&lt;ref name="rootes-sunbeam"/&gt;

In spite of the ability to keep the UK business afloat, Chrysler was still making losses both in Europe and at home, and, facing the possibility of complete bankruptcy, decided to sell Chrysler Europe to PSA. The French company took control of the former Chrysler Europe effective January 1, 1979, and in the course of the year announced all former Chrysler Europe products would be rebranded to [[Talbot]]s starting August 1, 1979. The Sunbeam was simply rebadged in the strictest sense of the word, with the Chrysler badge on the [[hood (vehicle)|bonnet]] replaced by one that read "Talbot", but retaining its grille with a prominent [[Chrysler#Logos|Chrysler pentastar]] until 1981.&lt;ref name="rootes-sunbeam"/&gt;

== Sunbeam Ti and Sunbeam Lotus ==
[[File:Talbot Sunbeam Lotus first reg August 1980 2172cc.JPG|thumb|Talbot Sunbeam Lotus in typical black and silver]]
[[File:Talbot Sunbeam Lotus - Race Retro 2008 01.jpg|thumb|left|Sunbeam Lotus at the Race Retro 2008]]
In order to boost the Sunbeam's image, a "[[hot hatch]]" version of the Sunbeam was launched at the 1978 [[British International Motor Show]] and [[Paris Motor Show]], called "Sunbeam Ti".&lt;ref&gt;''Autocar'' 28 October 1978 p 35&lt;/ref&gt; On sale in the UK from June 1979 priced at £3,779, it was based on the former Avenger Tiger (itself hailing back to the [[Sunbeam Tiger]]), a sporty version of the Avenger. The 1.6-litre (1,598cc) engine fitted to the Sunbeam with twin [[Weber carburetor]]s delivered {{convert|100|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. It featured sporty two-tone paint and body kit, and was very sport-oriented, being stripped of equipment that would have compromised its performance (and image). It proved quite popular with reviewers and enthusiasts, and helped to emphasize the advantages of the Sunbeam's rear-wheel drive against more trendy (and spacious) front-wheel drive rivals.&lt;ref name="rootes-sunbeam"/&gt;

[[File:Tony Pond - 1979 Manx International Rally.jpg|thumb|Tony Pond driving his Talbot Sunbeam Lotus at the 1979 Manx International Rally]]
Chrysler had also commissioned the sports car manufacturer and engineering company [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]] to develop a strict rally version of the Sunbeam. The resulting "Sunbeam Lotus" was based on the Sunbeam 1.6&amp;nbsp;GLS, but fitted with stiffer [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], a larger [[anti-roll bar]] and a larger transmission tunnel. The drivetrain comprised an enlarged, 2,172&amp;nbsp;cc, version of the Lotus 1973&amp;nbsp;cc 907 engine, a [[multi-valve|16V]] [[straight engine|slant four engine]] (the Sunbeam version being [[Lotus 900 series#Type 911|type 911]], similar to the "[[Lotus 900 series#Type 912|Lotus 912]]"), along with a [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF gearbox]], both mounted in the car at [[Ludham]] Airfield, close to the Lotus facility in [[Norfolk|Hethel, Norfolk]], where the almost-complete cars were shipped from Linwood. Final inspection, in turn, took place in [[County of the City of Coventry|Stoke, Coventry]].&lt;ref name="rootes-sunbeam"/&gt; In road trim, the type 911 engine produced {{convert|150|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 5,750rpm and {{convert|150|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,500rpm.&lt;ref name="Adcock, Ian 1995, p. 42"&gt;Adcock, Ian. ''Lotus Heritage''. Osprey Automotive, 1995, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In rallying trim this was increased to {{convert|250|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Adcock, Ian 1995, p. 42"/&gt;

The Sunbeam Lotus was unveiled at the [[Salon International de l'Auto|Geneva Motor Show]] in April 1979, but the road-going version of the rally car was not ready for deliveries to the public until after the rebranding, and thus became the "Talbot Sunbeam Lotus". At first these were produced mostly in black and silver, although later models came in a moonstone blue and silver (or black) scheme. The car saw not only enthusiastic press reviews, but also much success in the World Rally Championship - in [[1980 World Rally Championship season|1980]], [[Henri Toivonen]] won the [[Rally GB|29th Lombard RAC Rally]] in one, and, in 1981, the Sunbeam Lotus brought the entire manufacturer's championship to Talbot.&lt;ref name="rootes-sunbeam"/&gt;
{{-}}

== Talbot era ==
After the takeover, PSA decided that keeping Linwood running would remain unprofitable in the long run and that the facility would have to be closed. This would also mean the end of the Avenger and Sunbeam model lines. The Sunbeam also overlapped in size with the Simca-based Chrysler Horizon,  while the Avenger upon which it was based overlapped with the [[Peugeot 305]], both of which were launched in 1977 and were newer, front wheel drive designs.  The decision was quite reasonable, given the advanced age of the former and the fact that the "C2-short", in development, was to be launched. Even though the C2-short programme was eventually scrapped, PSA did prepare their own version, the [[Talbot Samba]] (based on PSA's own front-wheel drive supermini, the [[Peugeot 104]]). The Samba was launched in 1981, signalling the time the Sunbeam would take its final bow.&lt;ref name="rootes-sunbeam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rootes-samba"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aronline.co.uk/cars/chrysler-talbot/samba/|title=Talbot Samba (T15)|work=AROnline|accessdate=2020-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the end was looming, the Sunbeam was afforded a facelift for its final 1981 model year, finally gaining flush headlamps along with an entire new front end, featuring the Talbot logo in lieu of the pentastar, which made it look completely in line with the new Talbot lineup. Until the time production ended, about 200,000 Sunbeams were made.&lt;ref name="rootes-sunbeam"/&gt;

The '''Chrysler Executive''' was a car offered by the American automobile producer [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] from 1983 through 1986. The Executive was a stretched version of the [[Chrysler LeBaron]] aimed at the then booming market segment of [[limousine]]s. 

The Executive and [[Cadillac]]'s [[Cadillac Series 75|Series 75]] were the only factory-offered limousine models during the mid-1980s.  The two original 1982 Chrysler Executive prototypes were finished in dark red with matching vinyl tops, and red cloth interiors.  Although fully functional, these two vehicles were for promotional use only and were used in various car shows.

==History==
All Executives were built by conversion specialist [[American Specialty Cars|ASC]] near [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and began as standard LeBaron coupes. Standard front doors (from LeBaron sedans) were utilized, while the rear doors were individually fabricated using the rearward-half of the coupe door.  Interiors were available in navy blue cloth or leather (available at extra charge), or powder gray cloth.  1983 interiors were only available in "Kimberly" cloth (a short-nap velour) upholstery, leather upholstery was an option starting in 1984.  Limited colors were available for 1983.  For 1984 and on, standard exterior colors were black, medium blue, dark blue, white, charcoal (discontinued after 1984) and silver.  Standard vinyl roof coverings matched the body color, while the interior panels were all covered in cloth - even if leather seating was ordered.

Power came from the [[Mitsubishi]]-sourced 2.6 L [[Mitsubishi Astron engine|G54B]] I4 engine in 1984 and 1985; for 1986 Chrysler's own turbocharged 2.2 L four-cylinder engine was used. Both engines were only available with a 3-speed automatic transmission.

The Executive Sedan was, simply, a stretched LeBaron that held a center console between the front seats.  The console held duct work for the two rear seat air conditioning vents.  The Executive Limousine (option code A-89) had a thick center divide behind the front seats that held a glass divider with power sliding center panel (controlled from the passenger-side switch panel), two upholstered jump seats (without seat belts), five air conditioning vents (with flow controlled by a switch on the rear passenger-side door), an illuminated storage compartment with a flip-down door, and an AM/FM stereo with cassette (separate from the driver's sound system) controlling the four rear speakers.  Above the divider glass was a "glamour module" lighting unit - with overhead lights for the console, as well as individual reading lamps for the two jump seats.  Once the rear doors were closed, the lamps located in this overhead console would slowly theatre-dim before turning off.  Executive Sedans had a similar lighting feature, in the form of a small single lamp located above each rear door.  Both Sedan and Limousine models had adjustable rear-seat headrests, two-position foot rests, rear quarter reading lamps, and pillar mounted assist straps.

For 1983, the Executive used the standard LeBaron grille (as shown on the 1982 prototype models as well), while 1984 and 1985 utilized a slightly more vertical waterfall grill (borrowed from the New Yorker) that featured a heavier cap and narrow chrome extensions running beneath the headlights.  1984 and 1985 models also received wrap-around tail lamps (from standard LeBaron models), versus the envelope styling on the 1983.  For Executive's final year, the 1986 models used the re-designed LeBaron tail end, featuring new tail lamps and deck lid.  Up front, Executive still utilized the New Yorker grille but the front fender-mounted cornering lamps were discontinued.

There were two distinct Executive models on different wheelbases:
*Four-door, five-seat '''Executive Sedan''' on a wheelbase of 124" (1983 and 1984 only), and
*Four-door, seven-seat '''Executive Limousine''' riding a wheelbase of 131" (model years 1983 to 1986).

==Sales==
1,700 Chrysler Executive Limousines and Sedans were produced including two prototype cars in 1982.

'''Nassau''' is the name used by several vehicles made by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]]. The name was first used as a trim level in the mid-1950s, denoting the high-line coupe of the [[Chrysler Windsor]] series. More recently, two different concepts by the manufacturer bear the Nassau nameplate.

==2000 Nassau==
The first Chrysler Nassau concept was a styling exercise penned in 2000 by Chrysler designer Robert Hubbach. The resulting vehicle became a working model used by engineers and stylists to eventually create the [[Chrysler 300|300]] [[sedan (car)|sedan]], introduced in 2005. As with many recent models from Chrysler, very few exterior details were lost in the translation from concept car to production vehicle. One notable exterior difference between the Nassau and 300 are taillamps that wrap over the rear fenders, similar to the treatment on [[Cadillac CTS]] [[sports car|sport]] [[sedan (car)|sedan]].

The 2000 Nassau styling mule is currently housed in the Walter P. Chrysler Museum.

In late 2006, [[Chrysler|DaimlerChrysler]] announced that it would show another [[concept car]] carrying the Nassau name, this time at the 2007 [[North American International Auto Show]]. Described by Chrysler as a 'four-door [[coupe]]' (however, it is a [[shooting-brake]]), it was speculated to be a design exploration for the next-generation Chrysler 300 and [[Dodge Magnum]]. The concept was equipped with a 425&amp;nbsp;hp (315&amp;nbsp;kW) 6.1&amp;nbsp;L V8.  It was designed in Chrysler's Pacifica Advanced Design Studio in southern California by Alan Barrington (exterior) and Ben Chang (interior).

The '''Chrysler Drifter''' is an automobile which was produced by [[Chrysler Australia]] from 1977 to 1978. It was offered in [[panel van]] and [[coupé utility]] body styles.

Chrysler Australia added a [[panel van]] to their [[Chrysler CL Valiant]] range in April 1977,&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Tuckey and Ewan Kennedy, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, page 152&lt;/ref&gt; and a few weeks later they introduced the "Drifter Pack" as an option on that body style.&lt;ref name=unique&gt;[http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_chrysler_valiant_cl_drifter.htm Chrysler Valiant CL Panel Van, Drifter and LeBaron at www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au] Retrieved on 14 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Drifter Pack included a [[Chrysler Charger]] grille, quartz halogen high beam headlights, a sports steering wheel, radial ply tyres, styled wheels and special exterior paint and decal treatment with colour-coded bumpers.&lt;ref name=unique/&gt; The 4.3 litre Hemi 265 engine and a four speed floor shift manual transmission were standard on the Drifter.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Tuckey and Ewan Kennedy, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, page 164&lt;/ref&gt;
In spite of its option pack status, Chrysler marketed the model as the Chrysler Drifter without using the name "Valiant".&lt;ref name=Drifter&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.186715871353758.45577.171701622855183 Valiant Van, Valiant Sports Van and Drifter Van brochure] Retrieved on 14 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5yf5FHmLi?url=http://i.ebayimg.com/00/$(KGrHqEOKiME1zS1WeQFBNp(PnmsEg~~_12.JPG Chrysler Drifter sales brochure cover] Retrieved on 14 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Drifter pack was also available on the Chrysler Valiant Utility, which was also marketed as the "Chrysler Drifter".&lt;ref name=Tuckey163&gt;Elisabeth Tuckey and Ewan Kennedy, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, page 163&lt;/ref&gt;

The Drifter styles of the panel van and utility body ended when Chrysler Australia discontinued the CL series. The 1978 CM Valiant range did not include these styles.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Tuckey and Ewan Kennedy, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, page 172&lt;/ref&gt; The brief life of the Drifter was marked by low sales as competition from comparable offerings from [[Ford]] and [[Holden]] was stiff.

Chrysler Australia also used the Drifter name on a special edition [[Chrysler Valiant Charger#CL Charger|Charger Drifter]], released in 1978.&lt;ref name=Tuckey163/&gt;

The '''Chrysler 300M''' is a full-size luxury sedan that was produced by [[Daimler AG|DaimlerChrysler]] from 1999 to 2004. It is a [[front-wheel drive]], {{convert|255|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} [[V6 engine]]d car using the [[Chrysler LH platform]]. It was {{convert|10|in|mm|0|}} shorter than the [[Chrysler Concorde]] to make it exportable to Europe as a sports sedan, and was priced above the Concorde. The 300M was positioned just below the flagship [[Chrysler LHS|LHS]] (1999–2001), and Concorde Limited (2002–2004).

==Design==
[[File:1999 Chrysler 300M (14925409587).jpg|thumb|right|1999 Chrysler 300M]]

Chrysler redesigned the [[Chrysler LH platform|LH-cars]] in 1998. The [[Eagle Vision]] filled the "import-fighter" segment and its second-generation replacement was benchmarked against the BMW 5 Series.&lt;ref name="katz"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/reviews/300m.html |title= 2000 Chrysler 300M car reviews |first=David |last=Zatz |date=December 2011 |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the entire Eagle line was dropped by Chrysler. The automaker brought back the "300" model name, although the cars were not rear-wheel-drive, nor did they have engines rated at 300 horsepower as did the historic models.&lt;ref name="katz"/&gt; It also didn't feature the traditional "cross-hair" grille of previous 300 models, as by the mid-1980s it had been adopted by sister division [[Dodge]] for its entire model line.

Had the [[Eagle (automobile)|Eagle]] brand not been dropped, the 300M would instead be sold as a redesigned Vision.&lt;ref name="katz"/&gt; Test cars, factory manuals, and design images were prepared for the second-generation Vision featuring a prominent Eagle badge on the grille.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ign8btHPbvMC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=A+rendering+of+the+original+proposal+for+the+second+generation+Eagle+Vision |page=122 |title=Chrysler 300 series: pedigree, power and performance since 1955 |first=Robert C |last=Ackerson |publisher=Veloce |year=2005 |isbn=9781904788904 |accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 300M was similar in exterior and almost identical in the interior as the Concorde. The 300M also fit the [[Europe]]an "5 metre" (16.4&amp;nbsp;ft) size class for exports to Europe,&lt;ref name="katz"/&gt; unlike the substantially similar, yet larger [[Chrysler LHS]]. It had the same wheelbase as the [[Dodge Intrepid]], Eagle Vision, and pre-2002 Chrysler Concorde, reducing its length by cutting front and rear overhangs.

==Powertrain==
Only one engine was available, the Chrysler-engineered [[Chrysler SOHC V6 engine|3.5 L V6]], initially created for [[Chrysler LH platform#First generation (1993-1997)|first-generation LH vehicles]] and revamped for the newer LH line. It was shared with the [[Plymouth Prowler]] and a [[Special edition|limited edition]] [[R/T]] variant of the [[Dodge Intrepid#Second generation (1998–2004)|second-generation Dodge Intrepid]]. The engine was shared with the LHS and rebadged Concorde (2002–2004). For 1999, it was rated at {{convert|253|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|255|lb.ft|N·m|0|abbr=on}} of torque. It was connected to the 42LE, a four-speed [[automatic transmission]] with [[Autostick]], which allowed manual selection of gears. Standard gear ratio on the 300M was 3.66:1.

==Year-to-year changes==
[[File:300M Special 06-25-2019 2.jpg|alt=2002-2004 Chrysler 300M Special photographed in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada|thumb|Chrysler 300M Special]]
In 1999, automatic headlamps were added, and the Handling Group removed the speed limiter. In 2000, an interlock was added to prevent shifting the transmission from Park unless the brake pedal was pressed; and tether anchors were added to the rear shelf for child seats. The 2001 model year brought more changes, with an optional luxury group that included an automatic dimming driver-side mirror and supplemental side airbags. A more advanced EVIC (trip computer) was made optional. The 300M also received new jeweled taillights.

In 2002, electronic brake distribution was added to the antilock brakes; a new computer combined engine and transmission controls; latch tethers were now built-in; and “natural” evaporative emission monitoring was added. The 300M Special was offered beginning midyear 2002. It featured a {{convert|255|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 3.5 liter engine designed to use premium (91+ octane) gasoline and producing {{convert|258|lb.ft|N·m|0}} of torque, with a 3.89 final drive ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/chrysler-300m-special-short-take-road-test |title=Chrysler 300M Special |date=April 2002 |first=Ron |last=Kiino |journal=Car and Driver |accessdate=8 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance-type dual exhaust, high-performance brakes, and 18-inch Z-rated tires were standard, with Michelin Pilot Sport 245/45R18 performance tires optional. Other standard features of the Special included premium "Waterfall" leather seats, signal mirrors, body cladding, and slightly lower ride height. This model also included high-intensity discharge headlamps and imitation-carbon-fiber interior trim panels that replaced the standard woodgrain trim panels.&lt;ref name="allpar"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/cars/chrysler/300M.html |title=Chrysler 300M cars: big, luxury-tinged sporty sedans |publisher=Allpar.com |date= |accessdate=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A limited number of 300M "Pro-Am" models were marketed during 2002. These versions included an Infinity audio system with subwoofers as well as two-toned leather interiors. The Pro-Am also came with a set of limited edition golf clubs and a holder for a golf bag in the trunk. In 2003, new colors were added, a six-disc CD changer replaced the four-disc changer, and the changer controls were added to the stereo.

2004 brought optional [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] and an optional stereo with DVD-based GPS navigation.&lt;ref name="allpar"/&gt; For the 2004 model year, Chrysler offered the Platinum Series 300M to coincide with the company's 20th anniversary of Chrysler's original minivan (Dodge Caravan/Chrysler Town &amp; County/Plymouth Voyager). In addition to the 300M, five other vehicles were offered as Platinum Series: the Sebring Convertible, PT Cruiser, Sebring Sedan, Sebring Coupe, and Town &amp; Country. The Platinum Series 300M was available only in three exterior colors: Graphite Metallic, Bright Silver Metallic, or Brilliant Black Crystal. Other features included: deep slate/light taupe two-tone interior, chrome door handles, deep gloss black turn signal mirrors with a reverse gear auto pivot feature, and 17-inch chrome wheels. A 360-watt Infinity II Cassette/CD player, and a no-charge SIRIUS satellite radio system with a one-year SIRIUS subscription were also included.  Additional features include leather seats, satin silver bezels, chrome or platinum clad wheels, and other unique interior features. These models have a special Platinum Series badging on the C pillars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.motortrend.com/auto_news/112_new030814_plat/index.html |title=Chrysler Introduces Limited Edition Platinum Series for 2004 |journal=Motor Trend |date=February 2009 |accessdate=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2005, both the 300M and the Concorde were replaced with the [[Chrysler 300]].

The '''Chrysler 300''' (Chrysler 300 Non-Letter Series) was a [[full-size]] automobile produced by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] from 1962 until 1971.  It was the replacement for the 1961 [[Chrysler Windsor]], which itself filled the place in Chrysler's line previously occupied by the [[Chrysler Saratoga|Saratoga]] just the year before that (1960). At the time, it was considered a luxurious "[[muscle car]]", with all the performance of the Dodge and Plymouth products of the time, but with the luxury features expected of the Chrysler name.

The 300 was positioned as a cheaper rendition of the [[Chrysler 300 letter series|300 "letter series"]], and a sporty variant of a full-size automobile, adding 4-door hardtop version and running alongside that model until its discontinuation in 1966. It became the sole 300 model until 1971, when production ended. The 300 name returned to the Chrysler line in 1979 as an option package on the [[Chrysler Cordoba|Cordoba]] coupe.

In 1966, the Chrysler 300 letter series was discontinued, the 440 V8 replaced the 413 V8, and there was a mild facelift.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allpar.com/model/chrysler-c.html Chrysler C Bodies: The Big Guys]. Allpar.com. Retrieved on 2013-05-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

1967 brought makeovers which changed front and rear styling extensively.  The 4-door sedan was dropped from lineup (leaving the 4-door hardtop), the 440 V8 became standard and only available powerplant in two guises: base and more powerful TNT. 1968 facelifting brought concealed headlamps which were to be 300 trademark until 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chrysler300site.com/cgibin/history.cgi?1967 Chrysler 300 History and Gallery] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717000849/http://www.chrysler300site.com/cgibin/history.cgi?1967 |date=2012-07-17 }}.

The 300 name returned to the Chrysler line in the spring of 1979; this time based on the [[Chrysler Cordoba|Cordoba]] coupe. The 300 was a $2,040 option package featuring special emblems and traditional "cross-hair" 300-style grille.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1979-1982-chrysler-cordoba-300-cordoba-ls.htm |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1979-1982 Chrysler Cordoba 300/Cordoba LS |date=16 July 2007|publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was available in Spinnaker White (perhaps 30 were painted Rallye Red) with a red-leather interior and red pin stripes. The model came with the code E58 {{convert|195|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, featuring a four-barrel carburetor, a performance camshaft, and dual exhausts. Other features included police-spec suspension with 15"x7" wheels, heavy duty torsion bars/leaf springs/shocks, front and rear sway bars, and a 3.23 rear gear ratio. The deteriorating U.S. domestic economic conditions that led to the [[early 1980s recession]] reflected in low demand and less than 2,900 were built. The 300 model was planned for the 1980 model year using the new 2nd-generation Cordoba (based on the downsized [[Chrysler J platform]]), but was instead called the "LS".

'''Chrysler's TC by Maserati''' was a "Q" body based on a modified second generation [[Chrysler K platform]] jointly developed by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] and [[Maserati]] as a [[grand tourer]] and introduced at the [[Los Angeles Auto Show#1986|1986 Los Angeles Auto Show]]. After two years of development delays, the TC became available in late-1988 and a total of 7,300 units (the minimum required under the contract) were manufactured in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] through 1990.  All cars sold as 1991 models were manufactured in 1990.

==Development==
[[Lee Iacocca]] started a friendship with the late [[Alejandro de Tomaso]] while at [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], which led to the [[De Tomaso Pantera]]. During the 1980s, Iacocca headed Chrysler while De Tomaso was owner of the historic Maserati brand. In 1984, both companies signed a memorandum of understanding to create a sport coupe, which ultimately became the TC. Chrysler also became an investor in Maserati during that period. In 1985, Lee Iacocca stated that the planned "Q-coupe" would be the prettiest Italian to arrive stateside since his mother immigrated.&lt;ref name="l'automobile"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Nouveautés | journal = L'Automobile Magazine | page = 23 | issn = 0758-6957 |date=January 1986 | language = French | publisher = Societé des Editions Techniques et Touristiques de France }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1989 TC used a slightly detuned {{convert|160|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} &lt;ref name="maserati-alfieri.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maserati-alfieri.co.uk/alfieri33.htm|title=Chrysler's TC|accessdate=2012-05-24|work=maserati-alfieri.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daytona-spec [[turbocharged]] 2.2&amp;nbsp;L [[Inline-four engine|straight-4]]. This intercooled version, known as the Turbo II, was coupled to an A413 three-speed automatic transaxle. The Turbo II was replaced by a [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]]-sourced 3.0&amp;nbsp;L {{convert|141|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} &lt;ref name="maserati-alfieri.co.uk"/&gt; [[V6 engine]] for the 1990 and 1991 model years, with the automatic transaxle being upgraded to a four-speed A604 unit.

500 cars were built with an optional drivetrain consisting of a [[Getrag]] [[manual transmission]] and a 16-valve head version of the 2.2&amp;nbsp;L. This engine is often called the "Maserati" engine because it was built by Maserati and has a Maserati-branded cast valve cover.

The {{convert|200|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 16-valve 2.2&amp;nbsp;L "Maserati" engine's cylinder head was cast in [[England]] by [[Cosworth]] and finished in [[Italy]] by Maserati. The pistons came from [[Mahle GmbH]] in [[Germany]]. The camshafts were designed by [[Florida]]-based Crane Cams and were manufactured by Maserati in [[Modena]]. The "Maserati" engine used a specially-made 2.2 block, upgraded crankshaft and rods. A [[Japan]]ese [[turbocharger]] was sourced from [[IHI Corporation|IHI]]. The rest of the engine used common [[Chrysler K engine#2.2 Turbo II|Turbo II]] parts made in the [[United States]].

The TC's platform was based on a shortened [[Dodge Daytona]] chassis with [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] and axles from the original model (except for the 5 speed Getrag with "Maserati" engine). The bodywork was produced by De Tomaso subsidiary [[Innocenti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Heitz |editor-first=Rudolf |title=Auto Katalog 1988 |publisher=Vereinigte Motor-Verlage |location=Stuttgart |page=125 |volume=31 |language=German |year=1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[strut]]s and [[shock absorber]]s were specially designed for the car by Fichtel and [[ZF Sachs|Sachs]], and a Teves [[anti-lock braking system]] was standard. The special wheels were made in Italy by the [[Formula One]] supplier [[Fondmetal]].

Bob Lutz, Chrysler executive, said the TC cost Chrysler close to $600M.&lt;ref&gt;"Your Guide to Shady Deals", Road &amp; Track July 2019&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, the cost to produce each of the 7300 TC was about $80K in 1990 dollars.

==Features==
[[File:1989 Chrysler TC by Maserati, rear left.jpg|thumb|Rear view of 1989 Chrysler TC by Maserati]]

The TC featured a detachable [[hard top]] with circular, beveled-glass [[opera window]]s with a six-point latching system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chrysler Highlights |journal=Automotive Engineering |date=1988 |page=34 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=15cqAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=TC+by+Maserati+opera+window |publisher=Society of Automotive Engineers |accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cars |journal=Vanity Fair |date=1988 |volume=51 |page=108 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=a-tNAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=etched-glass+opera+windows+(with+the+Chrysler+“+pentastar%22+logo+enveloping+the+Maserati+trident) |accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a manually operated cloth lined convertible top that was available in either tan or black. For the 1989 model year, interior leather colors were ginger or bordeaux. Available exterior colors were yellow, red, or cabernet. The bordeaux interior was only available with the cabernet exterior, both of which were dropped in 1990 when black and white exterior colors were added along with a black leather interior.

The TC's dash, door panels, seats, armrest, and rear fascia panels were covered in hand-stitched Italian leather. Inside doorjambs were finished with stainless steel panels and sill plates. The convertible boot, over which the hardtop rests, is a body colored metal panel. A special interior storage compartment came with an umbrella, tool kit, and small spare tire that allowed the use of the full-sized trunk even with the top down. Standard equipment included a 10-speaker [[Infinity (audio)|Infinity]] AM/FM cassette stereo, power windows, 6-way power seats, power door and trunk locks, map lights, puddle lamps, cruise control, and tilt steering wheel.

The only extra cost option available for the TC was a CD player that was a plug-in attachment to the standard Infinity AM/FM cassette stereo. All drivetrain alternatives were no-cost options.

The rarest TC built was a "special order" at the end of the production run for a Chrysler executive.  It was white with a bordeaux interior and the Maserati 16V engine, the only 1991 car to have that color interior or engine.

==Production and prices==
[[File:Chrysler TC by Maserati.jpg|thumb|Chrysler TC by Maserati with the standard hardtop fitted|alt=|left]]

Total production and base price for each model year. The TC was sold by only 300 select Chrysler dealers.&lt;ref name=hydebook&gt;{{cite book|last=Hyde | first=Charles K. |title= Riding the Roller Coaster: A History of the Chrysler Corporation |publisher=Wayne State University Press |year=2003 |page=272 |isbn=978-0-8143-3091-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition==
During the TC's three-year run, General Motors was offering as many as two luxury roadsters.  The [[Cadillac Allanté]] (1987-93), which was priced significantly higher than the TC, and the [[Buick Reatta]] (1990-91) which was priced similarly to the TC.  The Allanté was also Italian-designed and partially hand-built.

The Allanté was powered by a {{convert|200|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 4.5&amp;nbsp;L V8 engine during the years the TC was sold (1989-91) with final assembly in the U.S., after the bodies built in Italy were shipped via special air cargo, while the Reatta was a {{convert|170|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6-powered roadster.

==Criticism and aftermath==
The original idea of combining a Chrysler engine with a Maserati body was viewed by some automotive journalists as simply "taking the worst from each partner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ingrassia | first=Paul |last2=White |first2=Joseph B. |title=Comeback:The Fall and Rise of the American Automobile Industry |publisher=Touchstone |year=1995 | page=186 |isbn=978-0-684-80437-8 |quote=Iacocca and De Tomaso agreed to mate a Maserati body with a Chrysler engine, which was taking the worst from each partner. |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_x8Uj5WLzqEC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=Chrysler+body+with+a+Maserati+engine |accessdate=11 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The press was critical of the Chrysler TC, observing its similarity to the [[Chrysler LeBaron]] GTC convertible that cost much less.&lt;ref name=hydebook/&gt; Lee Iacocca was a proponent of the new model "to change the way the world looked at Chrysler" and to create a new image for the automaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Richard A. |title=Six Men Who Built the Modern Auto Industry |publisher=MBI Publishing |year=2005 |page=[https://archive.org/details/sixmenwhobuiltmo00rich/page/253 253] |isbn=978-0-7603-1958-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/sixmenwhobuiltmo00rich/page/253 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the TC was expected to achieve annual sales between 5,000 and 10,000 units, it sold very poorly due its high price tag among other factors such as the lack of exterior color choices and undistinguished performance. In contrast, the LeBaron GTC had more color choices and exactly the same features at a considerably cheaper price.&lt;ref name=hydebook/&gt; One expert about the Chrysler TCs claims that the automaker under Iacocca invested millions into Maserati, "but the Italian firm just did not deliver as promised" and the automobile marketplace had changed by the time the cars were delivered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hemmings.com/hmn/stories/2014/08/01/hmn_feature3.html |title=1989-1991 Chrysler's TC by Maserati - Chrysler's classy answer to the Cadillac Allanté never found its niche |publisher=Hemmings Motor News |date=August 2014 |first=Mark J. |last=McCourt |accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to TC production, Chrysler and Maserati eventually had common corporate ownership, following [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles|Fiat's]] takeover of Maserati in 1993, followed by its takeover of Chrysler in 2009.

The '''Chrysler Pacifica''' is a [[mid-size car|mid-size]] [[crossover (automobile)|crossover]] produced by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] from 2003 to 2007, for the [[model year]]s 2004 to 2008.

The Pacifica was the first jointly engineered product of the 1998 [[DaimlerChrysler]] "merger of equals."

In January 2016, the ''Pacifica'' name was revived for a  2017 model year [[Chrysler Pacifica (RU)|minivan]], which debuted at the [[North American International Auto Show]] as a replacement for the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Can 2017 Pacifica minivan re-energize Chrysler?|url = http://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/detroit-auto-show/2016/01/11/2017-chrysler-pacifica-minivan-monumental-leap/78336620/|website = Detroit Free Press|access-date = 2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chrysler aims to debut the sexy minivan in makeover|url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2016/01/10/chrysler-aims-debut-sexy-minivan-makeover/78588008/|website = USA TODAY|access-date = 2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model year changes==

===2004===
Initially, the Pacifica came in just one trim level.

===2005 and 2006===
Starting in 2005, the Pacifica was expanded into four trim levels: ''Base'', ''Touring'', ''Limited'', and a special-edition ''Signature Series''.&lt;ref name="wheels1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wheels.ca/article/2802 |title=Second-Hand: Chrysler Pacifica |publisher=Wheels.ca |date=2006-11-25 |accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The interior was also slightly restyled. Faux wood trim came standard in Pacifica Touring and Limited models, while the base-model "Pacifica" (later Pacifica LX), offered interior colored plastic trim. Signature Series models had metal clad interior trim and two-tone leather seats.

===2007===
[[File:Chrysler 016.jpg|right|thumb|2008 Pacifica ''Limited'' (US; facelift)]]
[[File:Chrysler Pacifica 4.0L AWD Facelift Heck.JPG|thumb|left|Chrysler Pacifica 4.0L AWD (Europe; facelift)]]
The Pacifica's exterior was slightly restyled for 2007, including its headlights, hood, fenders, grille, front fascia and wheels. The brand new 4.0&amp;nbsp;L [[Chrysler SOHC V6 engine#4.0|SOHC V6 engine]] was added, to complement the standard 3.8 L ''[[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.8|EGH]]'' V6. With the addition of the new engine and transmission, Dual Exhaust was added. New options included a rearview camera incorporated into the [[automotive navigation system|navigation system]], stain, odor, and static-resistant seat fabric and new wheel options.

===2008 (discontinuation)===
Chrysler announced on November 1, 2007 discontinuation of the Pacifica,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071101/AUTO01/711010385/1148 |title=Day of pain: Downsizing aims to return Chrysler to profitability |publisher=The Detroit News |date=2007-10-30 |accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; producing the last Pacifica that same month. The final Pacifica rolled off the assembly line on November 23, 2007.

==Description==

===Powertrain===
{{Or|date=July 2010}}
The Pacifica [[crossover (automobile)|crossovers]] were equipped with "Autostick" transaxles, [[Chrysler (automobile)|Chrysler]]'s version of a [[Kick-down|manually controlled automatic transmission]]. Other features include five-link rear suspension, self-leveling rear shock absorbers, and variable assist rack-and-pinion steering. The Pacifica offered a towing capacity of {{convert|3500|lb}}.

At first, Pacifica was powered by a 3.5-liter V6 with {{Convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|250|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque. Reviewers faulted the gruff engine, which was barely up to the task of battling the Pacifica's formidable mass, especially on fully loaded all-wheel-drive models. The 3.5-liter V6 with {{Convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|250|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} was standard on all but the base front-wheel-drive model in 2005 using the 3.8-liter V6. The 3.8-liter V6 with 210 horsepower and {{Convert|240|lbft|Nm}} was eliminated for 2006, leaving the 3.5-liter unit as the sole available engine. For 2007, the 3.8-liter engine returned in the base front-wheel-drive model, this time rated at {{Convert|200|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, and a new 4.0-liter V6 replaced the 3.5-liter V6 in all other models. The 4.0-liter engine produced {{Convert|255|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|265|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} and was mated with a new six-speed automatic transmission (the base engine continued with the four-speed unit) which allowed a respectable 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph time of 7.4 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2007-chrysler-pacifica-1.htm |title=2007 Chrysler Pacifica Road Test - Consumer Guide Automotive |publisher=Consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com |date=2006-10-24 |accessdate=2011-11-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201072016/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2007-chrysler-pacifica-1.htm |archive-date=2012-02-01 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety===
In 2006 the Chrysler Pacifica won an award from the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] as the "best pick frontal". In 2007, the Pacifica won a five star front and side crash test rating. The Pacifica received this award for being equipped with traction control, four wheel disc brakes with anti-lock braking system, all-row side curtain air bags, Electronic Stability Program, and tire pressure monitoring system.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}.

===Features===
During the first model year, Pacificas were equipped lavishly and were expensive as a result, as they included costly but mostly unnecessary features such as a navigation system, DVD entertainment system, and a load-leveling suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krebs |first=Michelle |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40610F93F5E0C708DDDAB0894DD404482 |title=Ford Enters the Crossover Bake-Off - NYTimes.com |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |date=2005-02-13 |accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later model years, additional trim and equipment levels were added.

Third row seating was standard on all but the entry-level Pacificas released after 2004. Front row seats featured an eight-way [[power seat|power driver seat]] and four-way power passenger seat on all standard Pacificas. The ''Limited'' and ''Touring'' included a ten-way power seat for the driver. The Pacifica could be optioned with a seating preference memory system that also controlled mirrors and pedals. Seats were available with stain and odor resistant fabric or leather on all seats and six different fabric designs. Cargo space was {{convert|79.5|cuft|L}} with the second and third rows folded.

All Pacifica models came with [[AM radio|AM]]/[[FM radio]] along with [[CD player]] and a seven speaker, 200-watt Infinity audio system. ''Limited'' models came with a year subscription of [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius]] satellite radio, 6-disc [[DVD player]] capable of playing [[MP3]], [[DVD]] audio, DVD video, [[DVD-R]] and [[DVD-RW]] discs, and an available eight-speaker 385-watt Infinity "Intermezzo" audio system with subwoofer. Standard models included dual-zone manual temperature control while the ''Limited'' and ''Touring'' offered [[air conditioning|automatic temperature control]] system.

==Reception==
The Pacifica was the first jointly engineered product of the 1998 Chrysler-DaimlerBenz "merger of equals."
&lt;ref name="edmunds"/&gt; Chrysler developed the vehicle in 30 months at a cost below $1 billion.&lt;ref name="global"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="pacifia2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/ed/2003/pacifia.html |title=Lessons from slow sales of the Chrysler Pacifica, August 2003 |publisher=Allpar.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parent DaimlerChrysler's other entry in the luxury SUV market, the [[Mercedes-Benz M-Class|M-Class]] (badged as the ML) appeared to be a rushed engineering job from the [[Mercedes-Benz]] truck division yet it was a great success, leading to the second-generation M-Class that used a [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover]] instead of a light truck platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/cars/Preview+2012+Mercedes+Benz+Class/5173954/story.html |title=Preview: 2012 Mercedes-Benz M-Class |publisher=Nationalpost.com |date=2011-07-28 |accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DaimlerChrysler heavily touted the Pacifica as the next "big thing" in the fledgling crossover market, forecasting sales of 100,000 per year. These estimations proved to be wildly optimistic, as sales never came close to expectations.&lt;ref name="pacifia2003"/&gt; There was stiff competition from other luxury crossovers like the [[Lexus RX]] and [[BMW X5]]; the RX was the volume leader and widely considered the benchmark for the class. Despite the Mercedes-like interior and other Mercedes-derived technologies, however, the Pacifica may have been overpriced for its marque, as general public perception did not consider Chrysler a luxury brand like BMW, Lexus, and Mercedes-Benz. Indeed, DaimlerChrysler was reluctant to heavily promote the fact that the Pacifica (as well as several other jointly engineered vehicles such as the [[Chrysler Crossfire|Crossfire]] and [[Chrysler 300|300]]) featured technologies from its Mercedes division due to fear of cannibalization, as Benz vehicles had much higher prices and profits than their Chrysler equivalents.&lt;ref name="pacifia2003"/&gt; A three-year, multimillion-dollar contract was signed with singer [[Celine Dion]] in 2003, with advertisements designed to reposition Chrysler as a premium marque. However, the promotional campaign was widely considered a flop and so DaimlerChrysler ended it just one year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DTNB&amp;s_site=detnews&amp;f_site=detnews&amp;f_sitename=Detroit+News%2C+The+%28MI%29&amp;p_multi=DTNB&amp;p_theme=gannett&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=10123730AE072067&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Newspaper Archive |publisher=Nl.newsbank.com |date=2004-03-04 |accessdate=2009-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ending up, however, DaimlerChrysler lost money on every Pacifica sold, as it used a modified minivan platform, but it didn’t have any interior commonality with other Chrysler, Dodge or Jeep vehicles.&lt;ref name="thetruthaboutcars1"/&gt;

Positioned as a large [[crossover (automobile)|crossover]], the Pacifica was designed to combine the convenience of a [[minivan]], the elevated position of an [[sport utility vehicle|SUV]], and the handling of a [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]], as the [[minivan]]'s popularity was being eclipsed by the [[sport utility vehicle|SUV]] which in turn lost favor due to high gas prices.&lt;ref name="wheels2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wheels.ca/article/2802 |title=Second-Hand: Chrysler Pacifica |publisher=Wheels.ca |date=2006-11-25 |accessdate=2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to traditional (light truck-based) [[luxury vehicle|luxury]] [[sport utility vehicle|sport utility vehicles]] such as the [[Lincoln Navigator]], the Pacifica had less heavy cargo-hauling and towing capacity but otherwise it was superior in handling, comfort, interior, and amenities. Crossovers with three-row seating tend to be inferior to minivans in passenger room; the Pacifica was no exception as its third-row seats were considered too small compared to that of the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] which was less expensive and more fuel-efficient. However other luxury automakers have no minivans in most of their lineups which avoids cannibalization of the sales of their large crossovers, so it didn't help that the Pacifica inevitably drew comparisons to the Town &amp; Country.&lt;ref name="edmunds1"/&gt; Furthermore, DaimlerChrysler was unable to convince the public that the Pacifica was a pioneer of new category of vehicle, as consumers preferred more traditional SUV-style crossovers, and they faced the same problem with the release of the 2006 [[Mercedes-Benz R-Class]] in 2005. Like the Pacifica the R-Class is supposed to share the attributes of the minivan, SUV, and a wagon, and despite the R-Class being more upscale and sophisticated (based on a rear-wheel drive platform) with a better executed launch (while the Pacifica was plagued with production and marketing flaws),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bob English |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/auto/article922798.ece |title=Not an SUV, van or wagon: a class all its own |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date= |accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has sold poorly compared to the [[Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class|GLK]] and [[Mercedes-Benz M-Class|M-Classes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autos.ca/first-drives/first-drive-2011-mercedes-benz-r-class |title=First Drive: 2011 Mercedes-Benz R-Class |publisher=Autos.ca |date=2010-07-05 |accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pacifica was widely praised for its carlike ride and handling, as its sophisticated suspension soaked up the bumps well, while the steering was fairly crisp and linear.&lt;ref name="wheels2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="edmunds1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/chrysler/pacifica/ |title=Chrysler Pacifica |publisher=Edmunds.com |date=2010-08-11 |accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the 2004-06 model years of the Pacifica were fuel thirsty and vastly underpowered considering its hefty weight, with its weak 250&amp;nbsp;hp 3.5-liter V6 and aging four-speed automatic transmission, which gave poor performance considering the price of this vehicle.&lt;ref name="wheels1"/&gt; This was only rectified in 2007 with a new V6 engine and a new six-speed automatic which was nonetheless too late to salvage sales. Throughout its lifetime there were few engine options, yet despite client requests there was never an available Hemi or SRT version like the 2005 Chrysler 300.&lt;ref name="pacifia2003"/&gt;

===Reliability===
The initial production models of the Pacifica gave the nameplate a bad reputation, due to poor mechanical reliability of the transmission and engine, liner and interior flaws, electrical glitches, and low build quality.&lt;ref name="wheels1" /&gt; Furthermore, Chrysler was slow to react in fixing these problems.&lt;ref name="pacifia2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thetruthaboutcars1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2009/06/the-parting-shot-the-chrysler-pacifica/ |title=Review: Last Call: Chrysler Pacifica |publisher=The Truth About Cars |date= |accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chrysler Voyager''', or '''Chrysler Grand Voyager''' (since 2011 re-badged as '''Lancia Voyager''' in most of Europe), is a [[minivan]] manufactured by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]]. For most of its existence, vehicles bearing the "Chrysler Voyager" nameplate have been sold exclusively outside the United States, primarily in Europe, Asia, and Oceania.

The Voyager was introduced in Europe in 1988 as a [[badge engineering|rebadged]] version of the [[Dodge Caravan]] and [[Plymouth Voyager]] sold in the United States, and has evolved with the [[Dodge Caravan|Caravan]], [[Plymouth Voyager]], and [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] since. Vehicles bearing the Chrysler Voyager nameplate were marketed in the United States from 2001 to 2003 as a rebadged version of the short-wheelbase (SWB) variant of the Plymouth Voyager following the 2001 folding of the [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] division of [[Daimler AG|DaimlerChrysler AG]].

Together with its nameplate variants, the Chrysler minivans have ranked as the 13th [[List of bestselling vehicle nameplates|bestselling automotive nameplate]] worldwide, with over 12 million sold.&lt;ref name="autonews"&gt;{{cite web|title= Chrysler LLC Celebrates 25th Anniversary of the Minivan |publisher=Autonew24h.com |url= http://www.autonews24h.com/Auto-Industry/Chrysler/2885.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Chrysler Voyager was first released in 1988, nearly identical to its American counterpart, the Plymouth Voyager; the only visual differences between the two were the head/taillights and grille. Besides the slightly different appearance, the European Voyagers were sold with different engines, including [[diesel engine]]s, which are popular in Europe; and the trim was different. They were also available with manual transmission and a foot-operated emergency brake.

The last European Chrysler Grand Voyagers are very similar to the 2008 and later [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] cars, and were sold only in the long-wheelbase version (as in North America).

Although now produced solely in [[Ontario]], Canada, the Grand Voyagers were still available with diesel engines as standard. These diesel engines are based on a modern double overhead cam common rail design from [[VM Motori]] of [[Italy]].

Following the fifth generation, the Grand Voyager nameplate was discontinued in all markets. However, in 2019, FCA announced that the Voyager nameplate will return for the 2020 model year as a separate nameplate for low-end [[Chrysler Pacifica (minivan)|Pacifica]] models, and that it would replace the long-running [[Dodge Caravan|Dodge Grand Caravan]] as FCA's lower-end minivan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a28207234/2020-chrysler-voyager-photos-info/|title=The 2020 Chrysler Voyager Is a Budget Version of the Pacifica Minivan|work=Car and Driver|access-date=2019-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dodge Grand Caravan Production Coming to an End|publisher=Car and Driver|first=Colin|last=Beresford|date=February 28, 2020|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a31156055/dodge-grand-caravan-end-production/|accessdate=February 28, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1988–1990 models sold in Europe were [[Dodge Caravan]]s rebranded as Chryslers. In America, the [[Dodge Caravan|Caravan]] was sold alongside a similar Plymouth Voyager counterpart. Europe's Chrysler Voyager was nearly identical to the American Dodge Caravan except that a turbocharged four-cylinder engine and the 3.3 L Chrysler ''[[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.3|EGA]]'' V6 were never made available.

Introduced for the 1991 model year, the Chrysler Voyager in Europe continued to be identical to the [[Dodge Caravan]] in the United States except that the 3.8 L V6 was not available for the Chrysler Voyager. This would be the final generation available with a [[manual transmission]]. A 2.5 L turbo diesel four-cylinder engine produced by [[VM Motori]] was made available beginning in 1994.  There were also military modifications available for the Voyager in South Africa, which included large fuel tanks available in 240 and 360 liter capacities.

The 1996–1999 models in [[Mexico]] are rebadged [[Dodge Caravan]]s, although the Caravan was sold alongside the Voyager.  For 2000, the Chrysler Voyager was identical to the [[Plymouth Voyager]] except that the 3.8 L V6 was not available. Base models of the Voyager were offered in most states with either a 2.4&amp;nbsp;L [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]] or a 3.0&amp;nbsp;L Mitsubishi V6 engine, except in California and several northeastern states, where the Mitsubishi V6 didn't meet emissions standards. In those locales, the 3.3&amp;nbsp;L [[Internal combustion engine|engine]] was offered instead.
For the European market, Voyagers continued to be rebadged Caravans. Unique to this market were 2.0 L [[Straight-4]] SOHC and DOHC engines and 2.5 L turbo diesel produced by VM Motori. European market vans also came with manual transmissions and in a six-passenger model with six captains chairs, not available elsewhere.

According to EuroNCAP crash test results, the 1999 model Chrysler Voyager did so badly in the frontal impact that it earned no points,&lt;ref name="euroncap.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroncap.com/tests/chrysler_voyager_1999/56.aspx|title=Chrysler Voyager 1999|accessdate=2015-08-01|work=euroncap.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the worst of the group. The body structure became unstable and the steering column was driven back into the driver's chest and head'. The 2007 model Chrysler Voyager fared little better, achieving just 19% in the frontal impact test, with an overall score of 2 stars out of a possible 5.&lt;ref name="www.euroncap.com"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.euroncap.com/tests/chrysler_voyager_2007/277.aspx |title=Chrysler Voyager 2007|accessdate=2015-08-01|work=www.euroncap.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, chest compression measurements on the test dummy 'indicated an unacceptably high risk of serious or fatal injury. As a result, the final star in the adult occupant rating is struck-through'.

Despite the bad results in the Euro NCAP crash tests, statistics from the real world indicate that this is not the whole picture. [[Folksam]] is a Swedish insurance company that in May 2009 published a report on injuries and survivability of 172 car models.  The 88–96 generation got a real world rating of "Average", and the 96-00 generation got a rating called "Safest" (at least 30% safer than the average car.)

From 2001 to 2003, the Voyager was offered in the SWB model only, replacing the SWB Plymouth Voyager. It resembled the [[Chrysler Town and Country|Town and Country]] more than the previous generation, the only major cosmetic difference besides the trim (where the Town and Country's is fancier) was the placement of the Chrysler emblem on the grille. After the 2003 model year, the Voyager was discontinued (United States market) and replaced by the Chrysler Town and Country, SWB model. The SWB Town &amp; Country continued under the Voyager name in the Mexican market.

===Year to year changes===
*'''2000''': The Voyager is sold as a Plymouth and as a Chrysler, with the same options and features, however the Chrysler versions have sticker prices of about US$500 more.
*'''2001''': The Chrysler Voyager was completely redesigned for this year as were the other Chrysler minivans. It was now only sold under the Chrysler [[marque]]; no "Grand" LWB versions are sold. Some new features include side airbags and an optional navigation system.
*'''2002''': Either a [[VCR]] or a DVD-based rear-seat entertainment system was a new option available for dealer installation on all 2002 Voyagers. A high-value entry-level model, the ''eC'' was offered this year along with the base and ''LX'' models. All 2002 Voyagers now used a four-speed [[automatic transmission]].
*'''2003''': Power-adjustable brake and accelerator pedals were available on 2003 Voyagers. [[Anti-lock brakes]] remained optional for the upscale ''LX'', but were no longer available for base Voyagers. The Voyager was discontinued after this year and was replaced by the little-changed SWB Town and Country.

In Europe Chrysler began offering the Voyager with the first generation, followed by the second generation model in 2001, with a new engine range – including larger, more economical diesel engines (2.5 L and for 2005 – the 2.8 L 4 cylinder from [[VM Motori]]) and more fuel-efficient petrol engines (I4 and V6).

The fourth generation Grand Voyager continued production for the Chinese market alongside the [[Dodge Grand Caravan]] until late 2010. Both models were built by [[Soueast]] in China, using a Town &amp; Country production line relocated from Taiwan, and were powered by [[Mitsubishi 6G7x engine|Mitsubishi 6G72]] engines.

Chrysler introduced the new Grand Voyager for 2008 and successfully positioned it in the automotive market as a luxury MPV suited for large families. The Grand Voyager is visually identical to the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] which is sold in the North American and South American markets. In similar fashion to the other large [[multi-purpose vehicle]]s ([[Minivan|MPV]]s) on the market the Grand Voyager is sold with a standard diesel engine in Europe.

However, the seating is arranged in the 2–2–3 (front to rear) layout common in North America, rather than the 2–3–2 layout often seen in SUVs and MPVs in Europe. On right hand drive (RHD) models the gear shift lever is placed on a floor-mounted console between the seats, in contrast to the instrument panel positioning found on LHD models.

All engines are paired with Chrysler's 62TE 6-speed automatic transmission with variable line pressure (VLP) technology (See [[Ultradrive#62TE|Ultradrive]]).

===Lancia Voyager===
All Voyagers sold since October 2011 in continental Europe are sold under the [[Lancia]] brand.

The Chrysler-branded variant continues to be sold in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Russia, Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, South Korea, Singapore, and China, as Lancia does not have sales operations in those markets. Voyager become the successor to previous unrelated series of minivans produced by Lancia, the last of which is the [[Lancia Phedra|Phedra]].

However, the parent company [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]] under the leadership of CEO [[Sergio Marchionne]] has decided to shut down both Chrysler and Lancia brands out of its European market (with the exception of keeping one model of Lancia available for sale in Italy). Therefore, it appears Voyager too is on its way out of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jalopnik.com/lancia-dying-a-slow-painful-death-will-only-sell-yps-1580677716|title=Lancia, Dying A Slow, Painful Death, Will Only Sell Ypsilons in 2016|first=Aaron|last=Foley|date=|website=Jalopnik|access-date=April 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27, 2019, FCA announced that the low-end ''L'' and ''LX'' models will be separated from the Pacifica nameplate and sold under the Voyager nameplate starting with the 2020 model year. This marks the return of the Voyager nameplate to the Chrysler model lineup, in which it was last used in 2016, and the North American market, in which it was last used in 2003 and 2007 in the United States and Mexico, respectively. In addition to the ''L'' and ''LX'' trim levels, an ''LXi'' model will be available to fleet customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a28207234/2020-chrysler-voyager-photos-info/|title=The 2020 Chrysler Voyager Is a Budget Version of the Pacifica Minivan|work=Car and Driver|access-date=2019-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2020 Voyager went on sale in the U.S. in the fall of 2019 with base prices ranging from $26,985 for the entry ''L'' model to $32,995 for the fleet-only ''LXi'' model.  Seven-passenger seating, six-speaker sound system with Active Noise Cancellation, [[CarPlay|Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]] are standard on all models.  Among the available options is the SafetyTec Group which includes rear park assist, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross path detection. The '''LX''' adds [[SiriusXM]] [[Satellite Radio]] and seventeen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels. The fleet-only '''LXi''' adds easy-clean leatherette-trimmed seating surfaces and dual heated front bucket seats. '''LX''' and '''LXi''' models offer a single-screen rear DVD entertainment system as on option. All Voyagers will be powered by the same 3.6L [[Pentastar]] V6 gasoline engine with [[Variable Valve Timing]] (VVT) that powers the [[Chrysler Pacifica]], producing 283 horsepower and 262 lb. ft. of torque, mated to the [[ZF]]-manufactured [[948TE]] nine-speed automatic transmission controlled by a rotary control knob mounted in the Voyager's center console. Unlike the [[Chrysler Pacifica]], which will be available with either Front Wheel Drive (FWD) or All Wheel Drive (AWD) for the 2021 [[model year]], the Voyager will remain available exclusively with Front Wheel Drive (FWD).

The Voyager will take the place of the [[Dodge Grand Caravan]] in [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]] (FCA)'s U.S. and Canadian lineup, as the Grand Caravan will be discontinued after the 2020 [[model year]]. Production of the Grand Caravan is slated to end in May of 2020.

==Seating features==
The Chrysler Voyager has incorporated various seating systems for their minivans to enhance interior flexibility.

===Integrated child safety seats===
In 1992, Chrysler introduced a second row bench seat integrating two child booster seats. These seats continued as an available option through fifth generation until they were discontinued in 2010.

===Easy Out Roller Seats===
In 1996, Chrysler had introduced a system of seats to simplify installation, removal, and re-positioning— marketed as ''Easy-Out Roller Seats''.  The system remained in use throughout the life of the ''Chrysler Voyager''.

When installed, the seats are latched to floor-mounted strikers. When unlatched, eight rollers lift each seat, allowing it to be rolled fore and aft. Tracks have locator depressions for rollers, thus enabling simple installation. Ergonomic levers at the seatbacks release the floor latches single-handedly without tools and raise the seats onto the rollers in a single motion. Additionally, seatbacks were designed to fold forward.  Seat roller tracks are permanently attached to the floor and seat stanchions are aligned, facilitating the longitudinal rolling of the seats. Bench seat stanchions were moved inboard to reduce bending stress in the seat frames, allowing them to be lighter.

When configured as two- and three- person benches, the Easy Out Roller Seats could be unwieldy.  Beginning in 2001, second and third row seats became available in a 'quad' configuration – bucket or captain chairs in the second row and a third row three-person 50/50 split "bench" — with each section weighing under {{Convert|50|lb|abbr=on}}.

===Stow'n Go seating===
In 2005, Chrysler introduced a system of second and third row seating that folded completely into under-floor compartments – marketed as ''Stow 'n Go'' seating and exclusively available on long-wheelbase models.

In a development program costing $400 million,&lt;ref name="ameinfo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chrysler extends leadership in Mideast minivan segment with 'Stow 'n Go' |work=Ameinfo.com |url=http://www.ameinfo.com/53687.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325175844/http://www.ameinfo.com/53687.html |archivedate=March 25, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; engineers used an [[erector set]] to initially help visualize the complex interaction of the design&lt;ref name="pressrel1"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Chrysler Group Brings Minivan Segment's Only Stow 'n Go Seating And Storage System to Market in Just 18 Months |publisher=Chrysler Press Release |url= http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/01-05-2004/0002083064&amp;EDATE=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and redesigned underfloor components to accommodate the system — including the spare tire well, fuel tank, exhaust system, parking brake cables, rear climate control lines, and the rear suspension.&lt;ref name="pressrel1"/&gt; Even so, the new seating system precluded incorporation of an AWD system, effectively ending that option for the Chrysler minivans.

The system in turn creates a combined volume of {{convert|12|cuft|L}} of under-floor storage when second-row seats are deployed. With both rows folded, the vans have a flat load floor and a maximum cargo volume of {{convert|160.7|cuft|L}}.&lt;ref name="ameinfo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stowngopressrelease"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=129|title=FCA US Media - Stow ’N Go™ Seating and Storage System Solidifies Dodge Caravan as the Leader in Minivan Sales and Innovations|author=|date=|website=media.fcanorthamerica.com|access-date=April 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stow 'n Go system received ''Popular Science'' Magazine's "Best of What's New" for 2005 award.&lt;ref name="autointell"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stow 'n Go Minivan Technology Awarded Popular Science Magazine's "Best of What's New" for 2005 |work=Autointell.com |url= http://www.autointell.com/News-2004/November-2004/Nov-2004-3/Nov-17-04-p3.htm|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stow 'n Go system is not offered on the [[Volkswagen Routan]], a [[badge engineering|rebadged nameplate variant]] of the Chrysler minivans.

===Swivel 'n Go seating===
Chrysler introduced a seating system in 2008, marketed as ''[[Swivel seat|Swivel'n Go]]''.  In the seating system, two full-size second-row seats swivel to face the third row. A detachable table can be placed between the second and third row seats.  The Swivel'n Go seating system includes the third-row seating from the Stow'n Go system.

These Swivel 'n Go seats are manufactured by Intier Corp. a division of Magna. The tracks, risers and swivel mechanisms are assembled by Camslide, a division of Intier. The swivel mechanism was designed by and is produced by [[Toyo Seat]] USA Corp.

The system is noted for its high strength.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} The entire load of the seat in the event of a crash is transferred through the swivel mechanism, which is almost twice as strong as the minimum government requirement.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The swivel mechanism includes bumpers that stabilize the seat while in the lock position. When rotated the seat comes off these bumpers to allow easy rotation.

The seat is not meant to be left in an unlocked position or swiveled with the occupant in it, although this will not damage the swivel mechanism.

==Production worldwide==
[[File:Lancia Voyager 2.8 MultiJet 16v Gold – Frontansicht, 10. März 2012, Düsseldorf.jpg|thumb|European Lancia Voyager in Germany]]
In the early years of its marketing, the Voyagers were produced in North America and were exported to Europe (1988–1991).

In 1991, the first Voyagers were produced in [[Austria]], at the [[Eurostar Automobilwerk|Eurostar]] plant nearby [[Graz]]. Eurostar was a joint venture between [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] and the Austrian company [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=diepresse.com article, Austrian newspaper|publisher=|date=December 3, 2007|url=http://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/economist/347092/index.do|accessdate=2008-01-22}}. Eurostar was a Joint-Venture&lt;/ref&gt; It was later acquired by [[DaimlerChrysler]] and finally the plant was sold to [[Magna Steyr]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=handelsblatt.com article, German newspaper|publisher=|date=February 15, 2002|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/archiv/chrysler-group-verkauft-eurostar-an-magna-steyr;503202|accessdate=2008-01-22}}. Chrysler is selling Eurostar to Magna Steyr&lt;/ref&gt; The minivan production ended there at the end of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=diepresse.com article, Austrian newspaper|publisher=|date=June 4, 2008|url=http://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/economist/388420/index.do|accessdate=2008-01-22}}. Voyager production ended in 2007 in Austria.&lt;/ref&gt; Units produced in Austria were marketed in Europe, Asia and Africa. They were built with gasoline and [[diesel engine]]s, with [[manual transmission]] version, in short-wheelbase (SWB) and long-wheelbase versions, and in right and left-hand drive versions (all sold as Chrysler Voyager).

From 2008 to 2010, the fourth generation Grand Voyager was produced in China by [[Soueast]] using a relocated Taiwanese Town &amp; Country assembly line.

The fifth generation Voyagers (2008–2011) have been exported to Europe from [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], Canada, where they are produced. Beginning in October 2011, they were exported and sold as the Lancia Voyager in most European markets, as Chrysler operations were merged with those of Lancia in many European countries. In the United Kingdom, only the Grand Voyager is marketed.

Since 2011, the Voyager is sold under the [[Lancia]] badge in Europe to strengthen the Chrysler-Lancia integration, though it remains branded as the '''Chrysler Voyager''' in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]]. In March 2015, Fiat Group announced that in 2017, Chrysler would be discontinued in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.whatcar.com/car-news/chrysler-brand-axed-uk-2017/1338450 |title=Chrysler brand to be axed in the UK in 2017 |website=What Car? |date=17 March 2015 |accessdate=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was removed from Chrysler UK's website in January 2016.

The '''Chrysler Airflow''' is a [[full-size car]] produced by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] from 1934 to 1937. The Airflow was one of the first [[full-size car|full-size]] [[United States|American]] [[car|production car]] to use [[streamliner|streamlining]] as a basis for building a sleeker automobile, one less susceptible to [[drag (physics)|air resistance]]. [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] made a significant effort at a fundamental change in automotive design with the Chrysler Airflow, but it was ultimately a commercial failure.

Chrysler also marketed a companion model under the [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] brand, the '''[[DeSoto Airflow]]'''.

==Genesis of the Airflow project==

[[File:'34 chrysler airflow interior.JPG|thumb|Interior of a '34 Airflow.]]

Carl Breer, along with fellow Chrysler engineers [[Fred Zeder]] and [[Owen Skelton]], began a series of [[wind tunnel]] tests, with the cooperation of [[Orville Wright]], to study which forms were the most efficient shape created by nature that could suit an automobile. Chrysler built a wind tunnel at the [[Highland Park, Michigan|Highland Park]] site, and tested at least 50 scale models by April 1930. Their engineers found that then-current [[Three-box styling#Two-box design|
two-box automobile design]] was so aerodynamically inefficient, that it was actually more efficient turned around backwards. Applying what they had learned about shape, the engineers also began looking into [[unibody]] construction to achieve rigidity with less weight than could be achieved with the conventional separate frame and body.  The strengthening was demonstrated in a publicity reel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uaw-chrysler.com/resources/VideoDetail.cfm?VAID=82 |title=Contemporary reel showing the Airflow being crashed |publisher=Uaw-chrysler.com |accessdate=2010-11-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717131617/http://www.uaw-chrysler.com/resources/VideoDetail.cfm?VAID=82 |archivedate=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The car thus represented a breakthrough in lightweight-yet-strong construction as well as increasing the power-to-drag ratio as the lighter, more streamlined body allowed air to flow around it instead of being caught against upright forms such as radiator grilles, headlights and windshields.

Traditional automobiles of the day were the typical two-box design, with about 65% of the weight over the rear wheels. When loaded with passengers, the weight distribution tended to become further imbalanced, rising to 75% or more over the rear wheels, resulting in unsafe handling characteristics on slippery roads. Spring rates in the rear of traditional vehicles were, therefore, necessarily higher, and passengers were subjected to a harsher ride.

Innovative weight distribution on the new Chrysler Airflow stemmed from the need for superior [[Car handling|handling dynamics]]. The engine was moved forward over the front wheels compared with traditional automobiles of the time, and passengers were all moved forward so that rear seat passengers were seated within the [[wheelbase]], rather than on top of the rear axle. The weight distribution had approximately 54% of the weight over the front wheels, which evened to near 50-50 with passengers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=H. Eugene|title=Chrysler, Ford, Durant, and Sloan|year=2003|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-7864-1611-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and resulted in more equal spring rates, better handling, and far superior ride quality.

==The Airflow debuts==
Prior to the Airflow's debut, Chrysler did a publicity stunt in which they reversed the axles and steering gear of a conventional 1933 model, which allowed the car to be driven "backwards" throughout Detroit. The stunt caused a near panic, but the marketing department felt that this would call attention to the poor aerodynamics of current cars, and send a hint that Chrysler was planning something big.{{citation-needed|date=March 2018}} The car that emerged was like no other American production car to date.

The Airflow, which was heavily influenced by the [[Streamline Moderne|streamlining design movement]], was sleek and low compared to other cars on American roads. The car's grille work cascaded forward and downward forming a waterfall look&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; where other makes featured fairly upright radiators. Headlights were semi-flush to areas immediate to the grille.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; The front fenders enclosed the running surface of the tire tread. In the rear, Airflows encased the rear wheels through the use of [[fender skirts]].

Instead of a flat panel of glass, the windshield comprised two sheets of glass that formed a raked "vee" both side to side,&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; and top to bottom. All the windows were made of safety glass.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1934_Chrysler/1934_Chrysler_Imperial_%20Airflow_Limo_Brochure/1934%20Chrysler%20Imperial%20Airflow%20Limo-06.html&lt;/ref&gt; Passengers were carried in a full steel body (at a time when automakers like [[General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and even Chrysler itself continued to use wood structural framing members in their car bodies) that rested between the wheels instead of upon them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1934_Chrysler/1934_Chrysler_NY_Auto_Show%20_andout/1934%20Chrysler%20NY%20Auto%20Show%20Handout-08.html |title=Directory Index: Chrysler_and_Imperial/1934_Chrysler/1934_Chrysler_NY_Auto_Show _andout |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front seat was wider than in other cars and the rear seat was deeper. Overall, the car possessed a better [[power-to-weight ratio]], and its structural integrity was stronger than other like models of the day.

The car was introduced months (in January, 1934)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Curves of Steel|year=2009|publisher=Couchbuilt press|isbn=978-0-9779809-6-3|editor=Stein, Jonathan A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  before it was put in production, and production peaked at only 6,212 units in May 1934 — very late in the year and barely enough to give every dealer a single Chrysler Airflow. The factory had not accounted for significant manufacturing challenges and expense due to the unusual new Airflow design, which required an unprecedented number and variety of welding techniques. The early Airflows arriving at dealerships suffered from significant problems, mostly the result of faulty manufacturing. According to Fred Breer, son of Chrysler Engineer Carl Breer, the first 2,000 to 3,000 Airflows to leave the factory had major defects, including engines breaking loose from their mountings at {{convert|80|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.

===1934===

For 1934, both Chrysler and its junior running mate, [[DeSoto Airflow|DeSoto]], were scheduled to offer the Airflow. DeSoto was assigned to offer nothing but Airflows; Chrysler, however, hedged its bets and continued to offer a [[Inline-six engine|six-cylinder]] variant of its more mainstream 1933 model cars. The Airflow used a [[flathead engine|flathead]] [[Straight-8|I8]] engine and was produced in both 2-door [[coupe]] and 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] variants.

Chrysler of Canada produced an Airflow Six, model CY, which was basically a DeSoto Airflow with a Chrysler grille, bumpers, instrument panel and emblems. A total of 445 were built. The Airflow Six was dropped at the end of 1934. The appearance was also used for commercial trucks as the Dodge Airflow.

The Chrysler line of eight-cylinder Airflows included model CU Airflow Eight ({{convert|123.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase), model CV Airflow Imperial Eight ({{convert|128|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase), model CX Airflow Custom Imperial ({{convert|137.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase). At the very top was the model CW Airflow Custom Imperial with a body built by LeBaron on a {{convert|146.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase. The CW had the industry's first one-piece curved windshield on a production automobile.

Within six months of the Airflow's introduction, the vehicle was a sales disaster. Adding insult to injury, General Motors mounted an advertising campaign aimed at further discrediting the Airflows. Most automotive historians, though, agree that the Airflow was shunned in large part because buyers did not like its looks. The hood, [[waterfall]] [[grille]], [[headlamp]]s, and [[Fender (vehicle)|fenders]] were all merged into one continuous form that was interpreted as an "anonymous lump". While thoroughly modern, the public was slow to embrace the Airflow. At the depth of the [[Great Depression]], the car seemed to be too advanced, too different for many consumers. While Airflows sold in respectable numbers in its first year, Chrysler's traditional sedans and coupes far outsold the Airflow by 2.5 to one, with first year Airflow sales at 10,839 units.

DeSoto fared far worse than Chrysler for 1934. Without any "standard" car to sell, DeSoto's sales numbers plunged. And while the Airflow design looked somewhat sleek on the Chrysler's longer wheelbase, the DeSoto appeared to be short and stubby.

Rumors also persisted that the "new-fangled" body was unsafe, which was mostly untrue. In one widely distributed advertising film shown in movie theatres, an empty Airflow was pushed off a [[Pennsylvania]] cliff, falling over {{convert|110|ft|m|abbr=on}}; once righted, the car was driven off, battered, but recognizable.

===1935===
Stung by the lack of consumer interest in the car, Chrysler responded by making modifications to the body that brought the front of the car more in line with public taste. Foremost of 1935 changes was the placement of a slightly peaked grille that replaced the waterfall unit of 1934.&lt;ref name="Cheetham"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cheetham|first1=Craig|title=Vintage Cars - The Finest Prewar Automobiles|date=2004|publisher=Grange Books|location=Rochester, United Kingdom|isbn=1840136359|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Airflow models offered for 1935 were the same as in 1934, with the exception of the Airflow Eight two-door sedan, which was dropped. Chrysler Airflow production dipped below 8,000 units for 1935, with roughly four Airstreams produced for every Airflow.

===1936===
For 1936, the Airflow surrendered its smooth backside when a trunk was tacked onto the body of the car.&lt;ref name="Cheetham" /&gt; The grille also became more pronounced. Only one Airflow body style, the four-door '''Imperial''' sedan (C-10) broke the 1,000 unit mark with 4,259 units built. Otherwise, total Airflow production sank to 6,275 units compared to the concurrent Airstream models, which sold more than 52,000 units for 1936. 1936 would be the last year that Chrysler's premium Imperial model range would carry the Airflow. Lifeguard tires were introduced, which had two tubes inside the tire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1936%20Chrysler/1936%20Chrysler%20Airflow%20Brochure/1936%20Chrysler%20Airflow-17.html |title=Directory Index: Chrysler_and_Imperial/1936 Chrysler/1936 Chrysler Airflow Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1937===
[[File:1937ChryslerAirflow.jpg|thumb|1937 Chrysler Airflow]]

In its final year, the Airflow was reduced to one model, the Airflow Eight, offered as a two-door coupe and four-door sedan. A total of 4,600 units were produced before the program was cancelled.&lt;ref name="Cheetham" /&gt; Flat dashboards with recessed controls, soft door handles, and padding on the back of the front seats were new safety features.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1937_Chrysler/1937_Chrysler_Brochure/1937%20Chrysler-08-09.html |title=Directory Index: Chrysler_and_Imperial/1937_Chrysler/1937_Chrysler_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was in this year that an Airflow Custom Imperial, model CW*, limousine became the official car of Philippine president [[Manuel L. Quezon]]. The historic vehicle was restored in 1978 and is on display in [[Quezon City]], [[Philippines]] Another major restoration was conducted in 2009 by Alfred Nobel Perez of the Vintage Car Club of the Philippines in time for the 131st birth anniversary of Quezon. It was first displayed at Doña [[Aurora Quezon]] replica house corner of San Luis and Rizal Streets, Poblacion, [[Baler, Aurora]], Philippines. It later became part of the [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]] collection for its [[Presidential Car Museum]] inaugurated on August 19, 2018 in partnership with the [[Quezon City]] government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1045326|title=Presidential car museum opens in Quezon City|first=Ma. Teresa|last=Montemayor|work=Philippine News Agency|date=19 August 2018|access-date=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another 1937 Airflow Custom Imperial, model CW*, limousine was owned by radio personality [[Major Edward Bowes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imperialclub.com/Yr/1937/specs.htm#CW |title=1937 C-14, C-15, C-17 and CW Chrysler Imperial Specifications, Equipment and Options |publisher=Imperialclub.com |date=2002-05-08 |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysler was one of Bowes' radio show sponsors. The two Airflow Custom Imperials were actually leftover 1935 models and only the two were built for 1937; Imperials and Custom Imperials built for the U.S. market in 1937 were conventionally styled, and priced below and above the Airflow, respectively. The cars have a 140-inch wheelbase.

==After effects==
[[File:Toyota Model AA.jpg|thumb|220px|right|[[Toyota AA]], 1936. Influenced by the Chrysler Airflow via [[DeSoto Airflow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=1934 De Soto Airflow Series SE |url=http://www.toyota.co.jp/Museum/collections/list/data/0020_DeSotoAirflowSeriesSE.html |author= Toyota Automobile Museum |accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
[[File:Carioca.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Volvo PV 36 Carioca]]]]

While the Airflow may have signaled [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]]'s attempt to set itself apart from other manufacturers, the failure of the car in the marketplace caused the company to take a more conservative path with its future models. Until the debut of [[Virgil Exner]]'s "[[Forward Look]]" cars of 1955, Chrysler's corporate styling was conservative and mainstream.

It is rumoured that [[Ferdinand Porsche]] imported an early Airflow [[coupe]] into [[Germany]], and using this model for "inspiration", designed the first [[Volkswagen Beetle]]. The similarities between early Volkswagen Beetles and the Airflow [[coupe]]s could be a testimony to this hypothesis.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}. However, the general lines of the KDF-Wagen were drawn as early as 1932, and the Czech [[Tatra T97]] and the [[Tatra 77]] are far more likely inspirations{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}.

Regardless of any effect it may or may not have had with Dr. Porsche, the revolutionary benefits of the design were immediately evident to designers the world over. U.S. designers could not and did not ignore the benefits of all steel construction, aerodynamics and a rear seat forward of the rear axle. [[General Motors]] was quick to respond with all-steel " Turret Tops", and other manufacturers either followed suit or went out of business.

In other countries, where gasoline was more expensive and practical considerations were therefore more important than styling, the flattery-by-imitation was even more sincere. [[Volvo]] was one of the first to get a smaller copy of the Airflow into production. The [[Peugeot 202]] would become a major sales success (to Chrysler's chagrin), and imitating the Airflow would be the secret of the success of a brand-new venture in the auto business called [[Toyota]].

===Art===
The Airflow was the inspiration for [[Claes Oldenburg]]'s print/sculpture ''Profile Airflow'', featuring a [[lithograph]] of the car beneath a superimposed aquamarine resin relief. The initial resin in the initial printing faded to an [[olive green]] colour and was thus recalled by Claes Oldenburg and Gemini G.E.L., the printmaking studio which fabricated ''Profile Airflow''.

''Profile Airflow'' is especially significant because it revolutionized the idea of a print, expanding it to include serialized sculpture.

The '''Chrysler PT Cruiser''' is a front-engine, front-wheel drive, [[small family car]]/[[compact MPV]] manufactured and marketed internationally by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] in 5-door [[hatchback]] (2000–2010) and 2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]] (2005–2008) body styles—over a single generation, with an intermediate facelift for [[model year]] 2006.

Noted for its exterior recalling styling of the 1930s, the PT Cruiser was designed by [[Bryan Nesbitt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bob Lutz's hits and misses at GM | newspaper=Los Angeles Times |first=Dan |last=Neil |url= http://www.latimes.com/classified/automotive/highway1/la-hy-neilblog-lutz-pg,0,3025510.photogallery?index=6 |accessdate=31 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The interior packaging was noted for its high-roof, high [[h-point]] seating, and flexible cargo and passenger configurations—a multi-level cargo shelf as well as fold, tumble and removable rear seating.

== Overview ==
The PT Cruiser is a [[front-wheel drive]] 5-passenger vehicle, classified as a truck in the US by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|NHTSA]] for [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy|CAFE]] [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] calculations but as a car by most other metrics. Chrysler specifically designed the PT Cruiser to fit the NHTSA criteria for a light truck in order to bring the average fuel efficiency of the company's truck fleet into compliance with CAFE standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.brakeandfrontend.com/tech-spec-retro-work-service-tips-for-the-pt-cruiser/ |title=Tech Spec: Retro Work – Service Tips for the PT Cruiser|last=Brake and Front End Staff|date=September 19, 2011 |access-date=December 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} A [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] GT model was introduced for the 2003 model year. A [[convertible (car)|convertible]] was introduced for the 2005 model year.

The PT Cruiser was manufactured at [[Toluca Car Assembly]] in [[Toluca]], [[Mexico]]. On March 8, 2006, [[DaimlerChrysler]] announced that it had built 1,000,000 PT Cruisers at the Toluca plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.allpar.com/i/jan-april99.html |title=Allpar News Archives, 1999 |date=14 February 2000 |publisher=Allpar com | accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final PT Cruiser built rolled off the assembly line there on July 9, 2010. A Chrysler spokesperson said the last model was Stone White and was destined for a U.S. dealership. In all, a grand total of 1,050,281 PT Cruisers were sold in the United States.
[[File:Chrysler PT Cruiser 2429cc registered March 2006.jpg|thumb|right|European Chrysler PT Cruiser]]
The PT Cruiser was also assembled at the [[Eurostar Automobilwerk]] in [[Graz]], [[Austria]], for global markets (outside North America) in 2002, using the production code PG. European PT Cruisers built in 2001 or from 2003 onwards were built in Mexico under the PT production code. The US version came standard with a 2.4&amp;nbsp;L four-cylinder [[Four-stroke cycle|gasoline engine]]. In addition to this standard model, a 2.2&amp;nbsp;L [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] [[diesel engine]] built by [[Mercedes Benz]] was also available in Europe, Asia, and [[South Africa]]. A 2.0&amp;nbsp;L engine ([[Chrysler 1.8, 2.0 &amp; 2.4 engine|D4RE]]) was also available outside the US. It produced {{convert|140|hp|0|abbr=on}} SAE at 6500&amp;nbsp;rpm with {{convert|130|lb·ft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4800&amp;nbsp;rpm.
In July 2000, the PT Cruiser replaced the [[Chrysler Neon|Neon]] in Japan as their small car offering. Chrysler sold over 10,000 PT Cruisers in Japan. Both the five door hatchback and the two door convertible, and the GT turbo engine package were sold in Japan in right hand drive configurations. Japanese versions were manufactured at the Austrian factory and were equipped very similar to European specifications.

From 2002 until 2007, the PT Cruiser was used in the city of [[Urayasu]], [[Chiba Prefecture]] by the Maihama Resort Cab company to serve as a taxi in the vicinity of [[Tokyo Disneyland]] because of its fun, retro appearance. The PT Cruiser taxis augmented the [[Maihama Resort Line]] service to Tokyo Disneyland. Unfortunately, the PT Cruiser wasn't built for the rigors of taxi service, and the fleet became expensive to maintain, with eventual retirement in 2007. The PT Cruiser was offered in Japan until April 2010, when it was replaced by the [[Dodge Caliber]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In 2001 ''[[Car and Driver]]'' acknowledged the PT Cruiser on its [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] and the PT Cruiser also won the [[North American Car of the Year]]. In 2013, ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' named the PT Cruiser Convertible as the worst car of the last twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Gear|url= http://www.topgear.com/uk/photos/TopGear-magazine-20th-anniversary-special-2013-09-10 |publisher=TopGear}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
The PT Cruiser was originally conceived as before Chrysler's merger with [[Daimler-Benz]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} At the time, Chrysler had planned a new look for Plymouth, previewed by the [[Plymouth Prowler]] "[[hot rod]]". Styling cues from the Prowler, particularly the grille, were used to create the [[Plymouth Pronto]] [[concept car]] in 1997. The look was refined, and in 1998, another Plymouth concept called the [[Chrysler Pronto Cruizer|Pronto Cruizer]] directly previewed the styling of the PT Cruiser. The Pronto Cruizer was designed as a modern interpretation of the [[Chrysler Airflow]] with [[Dodge Neon]] components, but the final design used a separate platform. After the new DaimlerChrysler discontinued the Plymouth marque, the PT Cruiser was marketed as a Chrysler model.

The PT Cruiser also resembles the 1997 [[Chrysler CCV]] prototype – which would evolve into the styling of the PT Cruiser.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Intended to evoke a 1930s look, the 2000 PT Cruiser grew out of a collaboration with [[Bob Lutz (businessman)|Robert A. Lutz]], who was an executive at Chrysler at the time, Dr. [[Clotaire Rapaille]] and [[Bryan Nesbitt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Patton |first=Phil |url= http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/27/pt-cruiser-from-hero-to-zero/ |title=PT Cruiser: From Hero to Zero |newspaper=The New York Times |date=27 February 2009 |accessdate=16 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who went on to design the [[Chevrolet HHR]].

== Updates ==
[[File:Chrysler PT Cruiser Convertible rear 20080517.jpg|thumb|right|Chrysler PT Cruiser convertible]]
[[File:2006 Chrysler PT Cruiser (PG MY06) Limited hatchback (2015-06-15) 02.jpg|thumbnail|right|Chrysler PT Cruiser Classic hatchback (Australia)]]
PT Cruiser models included the Classic Edition, Limited Edition, Touring Edition, "Dream Cruiser", "Street Cruiser", "Pacific Coast Highway Edition" and PT Cruiser GT. Non-GT Turbo (180&amp;nbsp;hp) edition models (introduced in 2004) were identified by a "2.4L Turbo" badge on the lower right hand corner of the rear lift-gate. The GT model (introduced in 2003) has a "2.4L Turbo High Output" badge on the right hand corner of the lift-gate indicating the 215-230&amp;nbsp;hp engine version.

The PT Cruiser was updated for 2006 to include scalloped headlights, a revised grille no longer extending below the "bumper", new lower front fascia which eliminated the patented brake cooling ducts and available round fog lamps and redesigned taillights. Interior updates included a revised interior with an updated dash with an analog clock in the center stack. The audio system featured a line-in jack for [[MP3 player]]s integrated into the dash. Features such as [[satellite radio]], a premium sound system by [[Boston Acoustics]] with external [[amplifier]] and [[subwoofer]], and U Connect hands-free [[Bluetooth]] for compatible [[cell phone]]s also became available in 2006. The standard audio system now included an A/M-F/M stereo with single-disc [[CD player]] and 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input jack with six speakers, replacing a [[cassette player]] and four speakers. The turbocharged 2.4&amp;nbsp;L [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder engine]] was available in {{convert|180|hp|0|abbr=on}} or "High-Output" {{convert|230|hp|0|abbr=on}} versions. A "[[Mopar]]" cruise control unit became available as an after market unit on 2007 models. Also in 2007, Chrysler dealers were permitted to order vehicles with separate options (un-bundled options from option packages) such as [[anti-lock brakes]] and Side Impact Airbags. [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] also became an option that could be installed as a dealer option with a factory appearance (i.e. roof mount satellite antenna).

For 2010, the last year of production for the PT Cruiser, there was only one trim level available: the PT Cruiser Classic. It included a 2.4L Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine producing 150 horsepower, a standard four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive, an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD player, 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input jack and six speakers, a rear-mounted spoiler, standard air conditioning, standard cruise control, standard tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS), standard front and front and rear side SRS airbags, standard keyless entry with two remotes and panic alarm, standard ABS anti-lock brakes, standard sixteen-inch alloy wheels, and more. Optional features included leather seating surfaces, a power front driver's bucket seat, an engine block heater, a power tilt-and-sliding sunroof, and heated dual front bucket seats. Exterior color options were Bright Silver Metallic, Brilliant Black Crystal Pearl Coat, Deep Water Blue Pearl Coat, Inferno Red Crystal Tinted Pearl Coat, Silver Steel Metallic, and Stone White Clear Coat. The only interior color option was Pastel Slate Gray.

== Safety ==
In 2002 [[Euro NCAP]] gave the PT Cruiser a three (out of five) stars rating. The car received bad results in the frontal impact test (6 out of 16 possible points). The height of the seats and side airbags helped to attain a maximum score of 16 points in the side impact test. The low frontal scores are in part explained by the cushioning near the knees, designed to protect unbelted occupants, which is not a factor in the EU where passengers must wear seat belts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.euroncap.com/tests/chrysler_pt_cruiser_2002/138.aspx |title=Euro NCAP Crash test|publisher=Euroncap.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2008, the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] gave the PT Cruiser the highest rating of ''Good'' overall for occupant protection in frontal crashes and the lowest overall rating of ''Poor'' for side crashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iihs.org/ratings/ratingsbyseries.aspx?id=641 |title=IIHS |publisher=IIHS |accessdate=2010-07-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100407191526/http://www.iihs.org/ratings/ratingsbyseries.aspx?id=641 |archivedate=2010-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the only small car to not offer [[electronic stability control]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iihs.org/news/rss/pr121708.html New crash tests of small cars], Insurance Institute for Highway Safety&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JPiihs"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://jalopnik.com/5112624/iihs-pt-cruiser-most-dangerous-new-small-car-in-america |title=IIHS: PT Cruiser Most Dangerous New Small Car In America |accessdate=2008-12-17 |last=Hardigree |first=Matt |coauthors= |date=2008-12-17 |work=Jalopnik }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== PT Cruiser GT ==
The '''PT Cruiser GT''' (also known as the GT Cruiser) is a high output [[turbocharged]] [[hot hatch]] variant of the PT Cruiser introduced as a 2003 model. The engine is upgraded over the standard PT, including: stronger crank case webbing, a thicker deck with 11&amp;nbsp;mm head bolts (vs 10&amp;nbsp;mm), an oil drain back for the turbo, a cast aluminum structural oil pan, a higher capacity oil pump, a crankshaft of higher hardness steel, improved machining of bearing journals, oil squirters (to cool underside of pistons), eutectic aluminum alloy pistons made specially by Mahle, and forged connecting rods with cracked caps and 9&amp;nbsp;mm bolts. The cylinder head was also different for turbo engines, from naturally aspirated. The turbo version was used by both the PT Cruiser GT and [[Dodge Neon SRT-4]] with larger diameter valves and seats, exhaust valves made of Inconel, improved cooling and larger oil drain back passages, different camshafts. The PT Cruiser Turbo engine package differs from the SRT-4 because the intake manifold, turbocharger plumbing and intercooler are different. Upgrades such as MOPAR Stage 1 and supporting turbo components were available from the manufacturer. Many of the performance parts from the SRT-4 are compatible with the PT Cruiser GT.

The '''Chrysler New Yorker''' is an [[automobile]] model which was produced by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] from 1940 to 1996, serving for several years as the brand's [[flagship]] model. A trim level named the "New York Special" first appeared in 1938 and the "New Yorker" name debuted in 1939. The New Yorker name helped define the Chrysler brand as a maker of upscale models, priced and equipped above mainstream brands like [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Chevrolet]]/[[Pontiac]], and [[Dodge]]/[[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]], but below full [[luxury car|luxury]] brands like [[Cadillac]], [[Lincoln automobile|Lincoln]] and [[Packard]]. During the New Yorker's tenure, it competed against upper level models from [[Buick]], [[Oldsmobile]] and [[Mercury automobile|Mercury]]. Until its discontinuation in 1996, the New Yorker had made its mark as the longest-running American car [[Nameplate (automotive)|nameplate]].

The New York Special model was originally introduced as a distinct sub-series of the 1938 [[Chrysler Imperial]]. It was available in 1938 as a four-door sedan with a 298.7&amp;nbsp;CID [[straight-eight engine]] and a generous amount of comfort and space for the passengers (series C19).&lt;ref&gt;[[#SCClee|Lee]], p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; For 1939 it was expanded with two more coupe versions and a two-door sedan and a larger, more powerful engine. Now the C23 series, it took on the "New Yorker" name, dropping the "Special" tag.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SCClee|Lee]], p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

The first convertibles were introduced with the all-new body-design of the 1940 models. This, the C26 series, was the first New Yorker to be considered a standalone model rather than as an Imperial version.&lt;ref name=Lee147&gt;[[#SCClee|Lee]], p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; It also saw the introduction of [[Fluid Drive]], a fluid coupling between the engine and the clutch. The only transmission available was the basic three-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]. There was also the "New Yorker Highlander", a special version with [[tartan]] seats and other interior elements.&lt;ref name=Bonhams&gt;{{Cite book| title = Greenwich Concours d'Elegance Auction | publisher = Bonhams &amp; Butterfields Auctioneers | type = Auction Catalogue | id = Sale Number 21153 | publication-place = New York, NY | chapter = 356 | pages = 150–151 | date = 2013-06-02 | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:'41 Chrysler (Déjeuner sur l'herbe VAQ '12).jpg|thumb|left|1941 Chrysler New Yorker convertible coupé]]
Lightly redesigned bodies were introduced for 1941, with the business coupe now being a three window design. The bodies were all marginally wider and lower, with increased glass surface. Another new model was the Town Sedan with the rear doors having the hinges at the forward edge of the doors. This year, the [[Vacamatic]] was made available, although unlike the version sold on six-cylinder models, the Saratoga/New Yorker version was a three speed transmission with overdrive.

With America entering World War II on 7 December 1941, all automobile production came to an end at the beginning of February, 1942. Thus, the 1942 model year was roughly half the normal length. Cars built after December 1941 had blackout trim.&lt;ref name=Lee147/&gt; The 1942s were quite modern, of a design which was heralding the post-war ponton style with fenders more incorporated into the bodywork. The grille consisted of five horizontal chrome bars which wrapped around the front, reaching all the way to the leading edge of the front wheelhouses. Some 12,145 New Yorkers of the C36 series were built this year.&lt;ref name=Lee147/&gt; Chrysler would produce and experiment with engines for tanks and aircraft during [[World War II]]. One post-war application of this would lead to the creation of the first generation [[Hemi]] of the 1950s.

After the war, the New Yorker became a separate series. Unlike most car companies, Chrysler did not make major changes with each model year from 1946 through 1948. Thus models for 1946 through 1948 Chryslers have the same basic appearance, noted for their 'harmonica' grille, based on the body introduced with the 1941 models. 1947 saw a minor redesign in tires, trim, and instrument panel, while the first 1948s were just 1947s with no visible changes. Postwar Chryslers continued to offer Fluid Drive, with the New Yorker now offering the true four speed semi-automatic transmission.

The 1949 New Yorker used Chrysler Corporation's new postwar body also shared by Dodge and DeSoto with [[Ponton (automobile)|ponton]], [[Three-box styling|three-box]] styling. The engine continued to be the 323.5-cid straight eight coupled to Fluid Drive and the Prestomatic four-speed [[Semi-automatic transmission|semi-automatic]]. Body styles were reduced to club coupe, four-door sedan and convertible. Wheelbase on the New Yorker was increased to {{convert|131.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} from the {{convert|127.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} frame introduced in 1941. The previous design had been carried through early 1949, with the new (C46) series having been delayed due to a strike in late 1948.&lt;ref name=Lee157&gt;[[#SCClee|Lee]], p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; A padded dash board was optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---Oct/1949-Chrysler-Prestige-Brochure/1949-Chrysler-Prestige-15 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181006194647/http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---Oct/1949-Chrysler-Prestige-Brochure/1949-Chrysler-Prestige-15 |archive-date=2018-10-06 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1950 New Yorker was the more deluxe of the regular eight-cylinder Chryslers (Saratoga being the eight with plainer trim) with cloth upholstery available in (unusual for 1950) several colors, {{convert|135|hp|abbr=on}} Spitfire straight-eight engine and roomy interior featuring "chair height" seats. The "Prestomatic" fluid drive transmission had two forward ranges, each with two speeds. In normal driving, high range was engaged using the clutch. The car could then be driven without using the clutch (unless reverse or low range was required); at any speed above {{convert|13|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, the driver released the accelerator and the transmission shifted into the higher gear of the range with a slight "clunk". When the car came to a stop, the lower gear was again engaged. The big news for 1950 was the two-door hardtop, or Special Club coupe as Chrysler called it, in the New Yorker series. The model was called the Newport in sales literature. Also, Chrysler added foam rubber padding on the dashboard for safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1950_Chrysler/1950_Chrysler_Brochure/1950%20Chrysler-09.html |title=Directory Index: Chrysler_and_Imperial/1950_Chrysler/1950_Chrysler_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrysler introduces the {{convert|180|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler Hemi engine#331|FirePower Hemi]] engine for 1951.&lt;ref&gt;http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---July/1951-Chrysler-New-Yorker-Brochure/1951-Chrysler-New-Yorker-02-03{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine becomes a popular choice among hot rodders and racers alike, a trend that continues to thrive today with its namesake second generation model. The FirePower Hemi equipped cars could accelerate 0 to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 10 seconds, faster than the [[Oldsmobile 88]] Rocket engine of that time.

The New Yorker also offered Fluid Torque Drive, a true torque converter, in place of Fluid Drive. Cars with Fluid Torque Drive came only with Fluid Matic [[semi-automatic transmission]] and had a gear selector quadrant on the steering column. Power steering, an industry first, appeared as an option&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1951_Chrysler/1951_Chrysler_Power_Steering/1951%20Chrysler%20Power%20Steering-08.html |title=Directory Index: Chrysler_and_Imperial/1951_Chrysler/1951_Chrysler_Power_Steering |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Chrysler cars with the Hemi engine. It was sold under the name Hydraguide.

A station wagon was offered for 1951, with only 251 built. Its {{convert|131.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase is the longest ever used on a station wagon.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

1952 saw a small redesign on taillights with the backup lights in the lower section. This was the last year for the {{convert|131.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase chassis for the New Yorker.  Also in 1952, Harold A. Clark used a New Yorker as the base for a full-size sports car called the "Clark Cyclonic". The price was approximately $15,000 and Clark planned to produce 48 during the first year. Whether this car ever reached production is not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jNwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA104 |title=Spacious Sports Car - The Cyclonic |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=September 1952 |pages=104–105 |volume=98 |issue=3 |accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1953 New Yorker had a less bulky look with the wheelbase reduced to {{convert|125.5|in|mm|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1953"/&gt; a one-piece curved windshield&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1953_Chrysler/1953_Chrysler_Foldout/1953%20Chrysler%20Foldout-05.html |title=Directory Index: Chrysler_and_Imperial/1953_Chrysler/1953_Chrysler_Foldout |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rear fenders integrated into the body. Wire wheels were now an option. The Saratoga of 1952 became the New Yorker for 1953 while the former New Yorker was now the New Yorker DeLuxe. The convertible and Newport hardtop were available only in the New Yorker DeLuxe while the base New Yorker offered a long wheelbase sedan and a Town &amp; Country wagon. The convertible was New Yorker's costliest model on the {{convert|125.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} chassis for 1953 at $3,980 – only 950 were built. Also new were pull-style exterior door handles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1953_Chrysler/1953_Chrysler_Foldout/1953%20Chrysler%20Foldout-06.html |title=Directory Index: Chrysler_and_Imperial/1953_Chrysler/1953_Chrysler_Foldout |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1954 was a premium version of a standard 1950s size body. Chrysler's interest in [[Straight-six engine|six cylinder]] vehicles began to wane in favor of the popular FirePower Hemi [[V8 engine|V8]]. The New Yorker was priced a little more affordably, at $3,230 for the standard and $3,400 for the DeLuxe. The standard model had a mild {{convert|195|hp|abbr=on}} output while the DeLuxe was used as a testbed of the engine's capabilities by outputting {{convert|235|hp|abbr=on}}. (Such power was unheard of in 1954 from its competitors.) Although introduced very late in the 1953 model year, all 1954 New Yorkers were available with the new two speed Powerflite [[automatic transmission]]. Fluid Torque Drive and Fluid Matic were dropped. 1954 was the last year the long wheelbase sedan was offered by Chrysler.

In 1955, Chrysler did away with the out of fashion high roofline designs of K.T. Keller and came out with a new sedan that borrowed styling cues from [[Virgil Exner]]'s custom 1952 [[Chrysler Imperial Parade Phaeton|Imperial Parade Phaeton]]. The [[Chrysler Hemi engine|hemi engine]] produces {{convert|250|hp|0|abbr=on}} this year. The result would become an ongoing trend for increasing engine output throughout the next two decades with Chrysler and its rival competitors. The Powerflite transmission was controlled by a lever on the instrument panel.

The base model was dubbed the New Yorker DeLuxe, with the "plain" New Yorker name dropped. The club coupe was replaced by the Newport two-door hardtop, and a new, higher priced St. Regis two-door hardtop filled the spot of the former Newport. The sedan, convertible and Town &amp; Country wagon were still offered.

[[File:1956 Chrysler New Yorker Town &amp; Country fR.jpg|thumb|left|1956 Chrysler New Yorker Town &amp; Country]]
Chrysler christened the 1956 model year's design "PowerStyle," a product of prolific Chrysler designer [[Virgil Exner]]. The New Yorker gained a new mesh grille, leather seats, pushbutton PowerFlite selector, and a 354 cubic inch Hemi V8 with {{convert|280|hp|0|abbr=on}}.
Also new for 1956, Chrysler introduced an under-dash mounted 16 2/3 rpm record player, dubbed the “Highway Hi-Fi”, manufactured by CBS Electronics. A two way switch in the dash changed the input for the speaker from the all transistor radio to the 7 inch record player. The St. Regis two-door hardtop gave a unique three-tone paint job for a higher price and the Town and Country Wagon model was Chrysler's most expensive vehicle of 1956 at $4,523. This was the first year for the New Yorker four-door pillarless hardtop. Only 921 convertibles were made.

1957 Chrysler cars were redesigned with Virgil Exner's "[[Forward Look]]" at the cost of $300 million. The 1957 New Yorker had a powerful {{convert|392|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Hemi V8 engine rated at {{convert|325|hp|abbr=on}}. This stylish car sold well with 10,948 built, but only 1,049 convertible models. The 1957 models also came with the [[TorqueFlite]] 3-speed [[automatic transmission]] and a [[Torsion bar]] suspension called Torsion-Aire that gave smoother handling and ride quality to the car. The New Yorker also sported fins that swept up from just behind the front doors.

Early model year production had single headlamps with quad headlamps optional where state regulations permitted them. The single headlamps were dropped later in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Flammang|first=James M.|title=Cars of the Fabulous 50's|publisher= Publications International Ltd.|isbn=0-7853-4375-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forward Look remained intact for 1958 but with new body-side trim, shrunken taillights and {{convert|345|hp|abbr=on}}.
The convertible model was still available, with only 666 made and only 15 working convertibles were known to still exist as of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesandiegocollection.com/cgi-bin/showroom/detail.cgi?id=2192|title=Showroom|publisher=San Diego Auto Collection|quote="Chryslers sales were strong although only 666 1958 Chrysler New Yorker Convertibles were built.

The car's reputation was also tainted due to rust problems caused by rushed production and testing.

The biggest news from Chrysler in 1958 was the introduction of a cruise control system called "Auto-Pilot"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1958_Chrysler/1958_Chrysler_Auto-Pilot_Brochure/1958%20Chrysler%20Auto-Pilot%20Brochure-03.html |title=Directory Index: Chrysler_and_Imperial/1958_Chrysler/1958_Chrysler_Auto-Pilot_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Yorkers in 1959 had a new {{convert|413|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|350|hp|0|abbr=on}} Golden Lion [[V8 engine|V8]], new tailfins, new front end, and no Hemi. The FirePower (1G) Hemi ended production and was replaced by the less expensive and lighter wedge head engine. The Hemi would never return to the New Yorker and slowly ended its image as a performance car and re-branded it as a luxury car, ushered in with styling similar to the [[Imperial (automobile)#1958|Imperial]] of 1958. The Hemi engine itself would not return to Mopar cars until 1964 with the second generation [[426 Hemi]].

The New Yorker entered 1961 with a new grille, slanted headlights, a continental kit on the trunk lid. The 413 CID "RB" Golden Lion V-8 continued. This is the last of the "Forward Look" models. Chrysler built 2,541 New Yorker two-door hardtops this year, the last until 1964 in Canada and 1965 in the U.S.

The classic Chrysler fins no longer existed for 1962 and now only four-door models were offered as wagons sedans, and hardtops.
The finless car was considered bizarre by many critics and sales were slow compared to its entry level sister car, the Newport which was identical in body style and offered a convertible model.
The New Yorker was the last Chrysler to have a {{convert|126|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flammang|first=James M.|title=Cars of the Sizzling 1960s|publisher=Publications International Ltd.|isbn=0-7853-4487-X|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/carsofsizzling6000auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 413 RB had a 4.1875 in (106&amp;nbsp;mm) bore and was used from 1959-1965 in cars. During that period, it powered all Chrysler New Yorker and Imperial Custom, Crown, and Le Baron models, and was also available on the lesser Chryslers, as well as Dodge's Polara and Monaco, and the Plymouth Fury as an alternative to the 383-cubic-inch B series engine and/or the 318 Poly. With a compression ratio of 10:1, it developed {{convert|340|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|470|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque in 1X4-Bbl trim.

Chrysler got a boost in sales in 1963 with the introduction of a five-year/50,000-mile warranty, a business practice that was unheard of by its competitors in the 1960s. The New Yorker used Chrysler's completely redesigned body with only the windshield showing traces of the previous Forward Look designs, although, under the skin, platform changes were near zero, with only a change from 12" Total Contact to Bendix 11" Duo-Servo brakes. A new, more luxurious Salon four-door hardtop was added at midyear as a trim package. Engine output was {{convert|340|hp|0|abbr=on}} and the wheelbase was now {{convert|122|in|mm|abbr=on}}.

[[File:1964 Chrysler New Yorker.jpg|thumb|left|1964 Chrysler New Yorker 4-door hardtop]]
Changes for 1964 included a new grille, larger rear window and small tailfins giving the car a boxier look from the side. Canadians were given the choice of a new two-door hardtop, while Americans got the Salon option on the four-door hardtop and post.

All Chryslers (as well as large Plymouth and Dodges) were now built on an all-new C-body unibody platform which featured a bolt-on, rubber-isolated front sub frame. [[Elwood Engel]] designed the 1965 New Yorker (and all Chrysler models) with styling cues from his 1961 [[Lincoln Continental]] — square side view with chrome trim along the top edges of the fenders. The styling began to share some visual similarities with the premium luxury sedan [[Imperial (automobile)#1964|Imperial]] which received an all-new appearance in 1964.

The standard engine was a {{convert|340|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} Firepower [[Chrysler RB engine#413|{{convert|413|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}]] V8, with single 4-barrel carburetion. As an option the buyer could order high-performance 413 from that year's [[Chrysler_300_letter_series#1965_300L|Chrysler letter car]], which came with an unsilenced air cleaner, dual breaker ignition, special camshaft and dual exhaust, and was rated at {{convert|360|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. In any case the engine was paired with the 3-speed ''[[TorqueFlite]]'' [[automatic transmission]]. 1965 was the last year for the 413, as it would be phased out for the new 440 the next model year.

For 1965 the New Yorker was offered as a 4-door sedan, 2- and 4-door hardtop, and as Town &amp; Country 2- or 3-seat station wagon. The 4-door sedan was a six-window body style touted Town Sedan, also available in the Newport line and in Dodge form as the Custom 880 4-door Sedan. A 4-door, four-window sedan body style was produced but not offered in New Yorker guise. The two-door hardtop was now sold in the United States. While the 300 and Newport 2-door hardtops shared a rounded, convertible-styled roof, the New Yorker had a unique roofline, resembling that of the 4-door hardtops. The more formal and squared off lines were highlighted by a  padded vinyl covering on the parallelogram-shaped rear pillar. The wheelbase of the New Yorker models, except the wagon, was {{convert|124|in|mm|abbr=on}}. The Town &amp; Country wagon was on the Dodge's {{convert|121|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase as all C-body wagons shared the same basic body. Factory options for 1965 included a vinyl rear roof pillar insert, Saginaw-sourced Tilt 'N Telescopic steering wheel, air conditioning and power options (windows, antenna and steering).

The 1965 Chryslers were well received by the public, and the division's sales shoot up nearly 40% compared to 1963, to 204,002. 49,871 of those were New Yorkers, a 62% year-on-year increase.&lt;ref name="flory 60s" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

For 1966 styling was an evolution of the 1965 themes. Changes included new grille, tail lamps and revised side trim. The biggest news was the adoption of the new Firepower [[Chrysler RB engine#440|440 V8 engine]]. In standard form it produced {{convert|350|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}; the optional, high performance ''440 TNT'' was equipped with a twin snorkel, silenced air cleaner and dual exhausts, and put out {{convert|365|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. The New Yorker line-up lost a model for 1966, as the Town &amp; Country wagon was now marketed as a series on its own. The 4-door, six-window Town Sedan, and 2- and 4-door hardtop body styles were continued.

1966 was another good sales year for the Chrysler division overall, with a nearly 29% increase in production and sales to 262,495. Despite this the New Yorker numbers went down somewhat to 47,579.

[[File:1967 Chrysler New Yorker (21485893938).jpg|thumb|1967 Chrysler New Yorker 4-door Sedan]]
1967 brought a complete redesign of all sheetmetal below the belt line. The most recognizable new styling features were wraparound parking lights at the front and taillights at the rear. A new fasttop design for the two-door hardtop replaced the more formal look of 1965–66. The four-door sedan reverted to the four-window style as used on the Newport line.

Sales fell 20%, the company's lowest in five years due to an economic slump that year.
{{clear}}

Styling changes for 1968 included new grille, bumpers, front sheetmetal, rear fenders and rear deck. Although the Newport and 300 four-door hardtops received a new, sportier roofline shared with Dodge and [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]], the New Yorker continued with the roofline first introduced for 1965. Main exterior features distinguishing the New Yorker from the other Chrysler lines were a full-width grille with a rectangular pattern, repeated at the rear by the full-width deck trim, and continuous lower bodyside molding.

Chrysler production rebounded with the year setting a record at 264,863 cars built, 48,143 of which were New Yorkers.&lt;ref name="flory 60s"&gt;{{cite book |last=Flory |first=J.

For 1969, Chrysler's full-size cars received a major reworking with curved sides and a higher belt line. The previous generation's underpinnings remained. The new look was called "Fuselage Styling" and was shared with the restyled [[Imperial (automobile)#Fourth generation (1969–1973)|Imperial]]. The two-door hardtop received a new look harking back to the club coupes of the 1940s.

The 1970 Chryslers received minor styling changes to the grille, taillamps and trim. The small vent windows on the front doors were dropped on the two-door hardtops.

Due to lower-than-expected sales, the facelift scheduled for 1971 was put off until 1972. Thus the 1971 models only received new grilles and taillamps. Ventless front-door windows on the four-door sedan and hardtop were new this year.

For 1972, engine power dropped to meet stricter emissions standards and rising gas prices. Chryslers received a new 'split grille' somewhat similar to the Dodge Chargers of 1971-1974. This would be the last year for the 'loop'-style front bumpers on Chryslers.

1973 was the final year for the distinctive Chrysler "Fuselage Styling"; only the grille was changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1973_Chrysler/1973_Chrysler_Full_Line/1973-Chrysler-Full-Line-04-05 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181006195206/http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1973_Chrysler/1973_Chrysler_Full_Line/1973-Chrysler-Full-Line-04-05 |archive-date=2018-10-06 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1974, the so-called "fuselage" styling featured on all full size Chrysler products remained relatively unchanged until the introduction of the 1974 models which featured a far more massive slab sided effect. This generation introduced covered headlights, and a more prominent "waterfall" style grille, reflecting popular styling appearances, primarily used on the [[Lincoln Continental#Fifth generation (1970–1979)|Lincoln Continental]]. These 1974 models timed to coincide precisely with the [[1973 OPEC oil embargo]], and were a significant part of Chrysler's economic woes in the late 1970s. The 1974 models were the last full-size models Chrysler designed from the ground up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1974_Chrysler/1974_Chrysler_Brochure/1974%20Chrysler-07.html |title=Directory Index: Chrysler_and_Imperial/1974_Chrysler/1974_Chrysler_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two New Yorker trim levels were offered in 1974, the base New Yorker and an upgraded New Yorker Brougham. A new St. Regis option package was added mid-year.

For 1975, the New Yorker received a slightly revised grille and New Yorker Brougham became the sole trim designation. The St. Regis package, introduced in mid-1974, returned for its first full year.

In 1976, the New Yorker inherited the front and rear end styling of the discontinued [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]], and its interiors as well, especially, covered headlights. The Imperial styling gave the New Yorker an unforeseen boost in sales, as the car looked distinctly different from the lower priced Newport. The styling cues formerly used on the 1974 and 1975 New Yorkers in turn were passed on to the base Chrysler Newport.

In 1977, the standard 440-cid V8 engine was now computer-controlled with a new "lean burn" system allowing for more responsive acceleration and performance.

The 1978 New Yorker Brougham was available in 2-door and 4-door [[hardtop]] body styles. Both were the last U.S.-built true pillarless hardtop models along with featuring frameless door glass and fully opening windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flory Jr. |first=J.

In 1979, the R-body series was a "Pillared Hardtop."  It now used the 318 [[V8 engine|V8]]; the 360 engine was optional through 1980. While shorter and much lighter than the previous generation, these cars still had a big car look and ride. Hidden headlamps and full-width taillights distinguished it from its R-body siblings [[Chrysler Newport|Newport]], [[Dodge St. Regis|St. Regis]] and [[Plymouth Gran Fury|Gran Fury]].  A new "Fifth Avenue" trim package was offered.

For 1980, in addition to last year's "Fifth Avenue" package, a limited production "Fifth Avenue Limited Edition" package was also offered featuring brushed stainless steel roof treatment and exclusive mahogany metallic paint.

Finally, a bold new grille, with simple vertical ribs, appeared for 1981.  The “Fifth Avenue” option package was again available plus a new "Carriage Roof" package was added. This package was available fully loaded with few options and was available only in nightwatch blue or mahogany metallic.

In an effort of downsizing, the 1982 Chrysler New Yorker (and the Fifth Avenue trim) moved to the corporate [[Chrysler M platform|M-body]]. In turn, the [[Chrysler LeBaron]], which had previously used the M-body, moved to the [[Chrysler K platform|K-body]] this year. The 1982 New Yorker was not a completely new vehicle. It was essentially a restyled and upgraded version of the LeBaron which had been produced since 1977. This M-body New Yorker used Chrysler's [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine|slant-six engine]]. The [[Chrysler LA engine#318 V8|318&amp;nbsp;in³ engine]] was optional. The 1982 New Yorker was available in two trims: Base and Fifth Avenue. Both used the formal roof treatment. The Fifth Avenue package gave buyers a choice of pillowed "Corinthian" leather or Kimberley velvet seats while base models had cloth or optional leather seats. This car became the "Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue" for 1983, and for 1984 the "New Yorker" prefix was dropped altogether; becoming the '"Chrysler Fifth Avenue".

In 1983, the New Yorker name was used on two different models.  The M-body car was now the "[[Chrysler Fifth Avenue#1982.E2.80.931989: The M-body years|New Yorker Fifth Avenue]]" a name which changed to simply "Fifth Avenue" from 1984 to 1989. The other was an all new K-car based New Yorker, which used the [[front-wheel drive]] [[Chrysler E platform]], the beginning of the extended K-car years. The E-platform New Yorker came with state-of-the-art 1980s technology, including a digital dashboard and [[Electronic Voice Alert]], which spoke notifications such as "A door is ajar"; "Please fasten your seat belts"; "Don't forget your keys"; "Thank you" (after fastening seat belt, closing the door tightly or removing the key from the ignition switch); "Your engine oil pressure is low - prompt service is required".  Also standard was a Landau vinyl roof with electroluminescent opera lamps.  This was the only Chrysler New Yorker generation with an [[inline-four engine]]. 1983 was a limited production year for the FWD New Yorker. When introduced in 1983, it shared many elements with the [[Chrysler E-Class]] and had a waterfall grille that was slightly different from the 1984-1988 versions. 

For 1984, restyled wraparound taillights and a revised front grille, were among the cosmetic changes.  A 2.2 L I4 turbo engine was now an option and new electronic instrumentation featured a digital speedometer and odometer.  Pillowed velvet seats replaced deep-nap cloth seats as standard. 

In 1985, the standard engine switched from 2.2 L I4 to Mitsubishi-sourced 2.6 L I4.  New standard interior features included overhead storage console with reading lamps, rear seat headrests, and power windows.

In 1986, a Chrysler-built 2.5 L I4 replaced 2.6 L I4 as standard engine.  Also new was an automatic load leveling suspension.  Cosmetically, rear deck lid panels, moldings and taillights were redesigned.  Interior changes included a new forward console and revised electronic instrumentation and an AM/FM stereo and deluxe intermittent wipers were now standard. 

In 1987, hood vents were eliminated on the turbo models, as were fender louvers on all models.  A new six-speaker Infinity sound system was optional.  As with other Chryslers, the steering wheel was redesigned. This was the best-selling and last full model year for the E-platform New Yorker. 

Although a new thirteenth generation New Yorker was introduced for 1988, the twelfth generation continued for one more abbreviated model year as the 1988 New Yorker Turbo.  As the model name suggested, the 2.2 L I4 [[turbo]] was now the standard and only available engine.  In addition to the turbo engine, previously optional yet commonly ordered equipment like automatic temperature control air conditioning, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, rear window defogger, and power door locks became standard. While previous model year New Yorkers equipped with the optional turbo engine were also commonly referred to as a "New Yorker Turbo" and wore "Turbo" badges, only the 1988 model had it as its official model name.

[[File:1989-1993_New_Yorker.JPG|thumb|left|1992 Chrysler New Yorker Salon]]

The redesigned New Yorker for 1988 was bigger (see [[Chrysler C platform]]) and bore no resemblance to the E-body model it replaced although many underbody and suspension components were carryover. It shared similar upright body styling with the newly introduced [[Dodge Dynasty]]. This new version had a [[V6 engine]] — a Mitsubishi-sourced 3.0 [[liter]] powerplant, and optional [[anti-lock brakes]]. Base and Landau trim choices were offered, the latter of which carried a rear-quarter vinyl top. Hidden headlamps, a feature lost when the R-body cars were discontinued, made a return with this redesign. All thirteenth generation New Yorkers, as well as the reintroduced flagship [[Chrysler Imperial#1990–1993|1990-1993 Imperial]], were covered by Chrysler's market-leading "Crystal Key Owner Care Program" which included a 5-year/50,000-mile limited warranty and 7-year/70,000-mile powertrain warranty.  A 24-hour toll-free customer service hotline was also provided.

For 1989, the 3.0 liter V6 engine had a slight horsepower increase and was now mated to a new 4-speed [[Ultradrive]] automatic transmission.  This year also marked the 50th anniversary of the "New Yorker" name.  Although no special anniversary edition or recognition was offered at the time, it turned out to be the most popular New Yorker of the model run with over 100,000 units produced that year.

In 1990, a new base model New Yorker called "Salon" was added. The Salon was a rebadged Dodge Dynasty with exposed headlamps, horizontal taillights, and grille similar to the Dodge.  The Salon was sold in Canada as the Chrysler Dynasty. All models carried a new Chrysler-built 3.3 L V6 engine that year.  Minor changes to the interior included a more contemporary contoured dash.  A driver's side air bag was now standard.

The Landau model was dropped for 1991 but Salon was upgraded and now came with more standard equipment, hidden headlights, vertical taillights, and a traditional Chrysler grille.

A styling update for 1992 produced a more rounded appearance front and rear.  A padded landau roof, similar to one previously featured on the "Landau" model, was now an option on the Salon.

Last year's restyle carried into 1993. The last thirteenth generation New Yorker rolled off the assembly line on May 28, 1993.

===New Yorker Fifth Avenue===
{{Main article|Chrysler Fifth Avenue#1990.E2.80.931993: The Final Fifth Avenues|l1=1990-1993 Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue}}

In 1990, a new stretched-wheelbase version of the New Yorker was offered carrying the additional moniker of Fifth Avenue from the just-departed M-body platform.  Although officially sold as the New Yorker Fifth Avenue, it was sometimes referred to as simply "Fifth Avenue."  This model was discontinued in 1993.

[[File:Chrysler New Yorker LH.jpg|thumb|left|1994–1996 Chrysler New Yorker]]

The final generation of the New Yorker continued with front-wheel drive on an elongated version of the new [[Chrysler LH platform]] and was shown at the 1992 [[North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]]. It was released in May 1993 along with the nearly identical '''Chrysler LHS''' as an early 1994 model, eight months after the original LH cars: the [[Chrysler Concorde]], [[Dodge Intrepid]], and [[Eagle Vision]], were introduced. The New Yorker came standard with the 3.5&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Chrysler SOHC V6 engine#3.5|EGE]]'' which produced {{convert|214|hp|abbr=on}}.  Chrysler gave the New Yorker a more "traditional American" luxury image, and the LHS a more European performance image (as was done with the [[Eagle Vision]]). Little separated New Yorker from LHS in appearance, with New Yorker's chrome hood trim, body-color cladding, standard chrome wheel covers and 15" wheels, column shifter and front bench seat, being the only noticeable differences. An option provided for 16" wheels and a firmer suspension type ("touring suspension"). This option eliminated the technical differences between New Yorker and LHS. LHS came with almost all of New Yorker's optional features as standard equipment and featured the firmer tuned suspension, to go with its more European image.

During the 1994 model run, various changes were made to the New Yorker.  On the outside, New Yorker was switched to new accent-color body cladding, whereas LHS received body-color cladding. This change aligned New Yorker with the [[Chrysler Concorde]] which also had accent-color cladding. Instead of standard 15" and optional 16" wheels, for the sake of enhanced stability 16" wheels became standard and the 15" wheels were dropped. Likewise, the touring suspension option available on early 1994 New Yorker models was discontinued, leaving only "ride-tuned" suspension. This resulted in a permanent technical difference with LHS.

For 1995, the New Yorker received Chrysler's revived blue ribbon logo (which was last used in the 1950s) on its grille, which replaced the pentastar which had been used on models beginning in 1980.

The 1996 model featured additional sound insulation and revised structural engineering to give it a quieter ride. A new built-in transmitter replaced the remote garage door opener. The antenna was now integrated in the rear window. Due to similarities between the New Yorker and LHS, and the LHS's strong sales, the New Yorker name was dropped after a short 1996 production run. Despite being far more contemporary and monochromatic in design compared to previous models, the traditional New Yorker with its two-tone cladding and chrome trim still did not follow the modern, monochromatic styling trend of the division's other vehicles in 1996.

===LH design background===
The fourteenth, and final, generation New Yorker's design can be traced to 1986, when designer Kevin Verduyn completed the initial exterior design of a new aerodynamic concept sedan called ''Navajo''. The design never passed the clay model stage.

It was also at this time that the Chrysler Corporation purchased bankrupt [[Italy|Italian]] [[sports car]] manufacturer [[Lamborghini]]. The ''Navajo's'' exterior design was reworked and became the [[Lamborghini Portofino]], released as a concept at the [[Frankfurt Auto Show#1987|1987 Frankfurt Auto Show]]. The Portofino was heralded as a design triumph, setting in motion Chrysler's decision to produce a production sedan with the Portofino's revolutionary exterior design, called "cab-forward". The [[cab forward]] design was characterized by the long, low slung windshield, and relatively short overhangs. The wheels were effectively pushed to the corners of the car, creating a much larger passenger cabin than the contemporaries of the time.

Design of the chassis began in the late 1980s, after Chrysler had bought another automaker: [[American Motors Corporation]] (AMC) in 1987. During this time, Chrysler began designing the replacement for the [[Dodge Dynasty]] and [[Chrysler Fifth Avenue]] as well as a potential [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]]. The initial design of Dodge's LH bore resemblance to the Dynasty, and this design was scrapped entirely after [[François Castaing]], formerly AMC's Vice President of product engineering and development, became Chrysler's Vice President of vehicle engineering in 1988. The new design, under Castaing's leadership, began with the [[Eagle Premier]], also sold later as the [[Dodge Monaco]]. The Premier's longitudinal engine mounting layout was inherited, as was the front suspension geometry, and parts of the braking system. The chassis itself became a flexible architecture capable of supporting front or [[rear-wheel drive]] (designated "LH" and "LX" respectively). The chassis design was continually refined throughout the following years, as it underpinned more Chrysler prototypes: the 1989 Chrysler Millennium and 1990 [[Eagle Optima]].

The transmission was inspired by the Eagle Premier's ZF automatic. However, it borrowed heavily from Chrysler's A604 (41TE) "[[Ultradrive]]" transversely mounted automatic, it became the A606 (also known as 42LE). This [[Ultradrive]] transmission however was not without critics as ''The New York Times'' reported on January 25, 1991 that Consumers Union would publish in the February 1991 issue of the magazine [[Consumer Reports]] a warning for consumers to ''not'' purchase a vehicle with this "Ultradrive" transmission citing poor reliability and safety hazards. By 1990, it was decided that the new technologically advanced car would need a new technologically advanced engine to power it. Until that time, the only engine confirmed for use was Chrysler's 3.3&amp;nbsp;L [[pushrod engine|pushrod]] [[V6]], which would be used in the three original LH cars, the Intrepid, Vision, and Concorde, in base form. The 3.3&amp;nbsp;L engine's 60° block was bored out to 3.5&amp;nbsp;L, while the pushrod-actuated valves were replaced with [[SOHC]] cylinder heads with four valves per cylinder, creating an advanced 3.5&amp;nbsp;L V6 optional in the three smaller cars, but standard in LHS and New Yorker.

The general LH appearance, still based on the cab forward exterior design of the 1987 [[Lamborghini Portofino]] [[concept car|concept]], with its aerodynamic shape, made for little wind noise inside this large car. This sleek styling gives the LH cars a low [[Automobile drag coefficients|drag coefficient]] which was ahead of its time. The New Yorker featured a more monochromatic design inside and out (but less so than its LHS sibling, which had very little chromed trim), and aluminum wheels with a Spiralcast design. The single color motif was more pronounced on models without the grey lower cladding.

Upscale New Yorker models feature leather-trimmed seats, steering wheel, shift knob and door inserts. Passenger comforts include rear center rear armrest, and 8-way [[power seat]]s for both the driver and passenger, as well as personal reading lamps. Power windows and central door locks were standard, as was climate control with air conditioning, and cruise control. [[Remote keyless system|remote keyless entry]] available as an option, as was a remote activated alarm, an overhead console with computer, power moonroof and alloy wheels. The best stock audio options found in New Yorker are the [[Infinity (audio)|Infinity]] sound systems having eight speakers positioned throughout the cabin along with an equalizer. Head units include a radio with either cassette or CD playback, and up to a five-band adjustable graphic equalizer, with joystick balance and fade control. Standard safety features included dual front airbags, anti-lock brakes ([[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]]), and [[Traction control system|traction control]].

Dual-way power sunroofs were available on this car. They were designed and installed by American Sunroof Corp. (now ASC Global) from its Columbus, Ohio plant, not by Mopar itself. An installed sunroof eliminated most of the front overhead console that featured storage bins for a garage door opener and sunglasses. However, the Overhead Travel Information System (OTIS), or onboard computer with integrated map lights, was retained.

===LHS===
{{Main article|Chrysler LHS}}
[[File:1995-1997 LHS.png|thumb|right|Chrysler LHS]]
The five-passenger Chrysler LHS was differentiated from its New Yorker counterpart by a floor console and shifter, five-passenger seating, lack of chrome trim, an upgraded interior and a sportier image. After a short 1996 production run the New Yorker was dropped in favor of a six-passenger option on the 1996-1997 LHS. The LHS received a minor face change in 1995 when the corporate wide pentastar emblem was replaced with the revived Chrysler brand emblem.

The '''Chrysler Valiant Charger''' was a two door hardtop [[coupe]] introduced by [[Chrysler Australia]] in 1971. It was a short [[wheelbase]] version of the concurrent Australian [[Chrysler Valiant]] sedan. Introduced within the VH Valiant series, it continued as a variant through the subsequent VJ, VK and CL series, until production ceased in 1978. It was marketed and badged as the Valiant Charger in the VH and VJ series and as the Chrysler Charger in the later VK and CL series.

While still based on the US Chrysler A-body platform, with virtually identical front suspension, the fenders were widened, and a wider rear axle fitted, so that the track, front and rear, was considerably wider than any US A-body, this also allowed wheels much wider than a US A-body. The Australian Chargers also used a 5-on-4.5" wheel bolt circle (still 7/16" studs), while the US cars did not go to "big bolt pattern" until 1973.

The Charger was extraordinarily popular in Australia during the VH series. At one point Charger production totalled 80% of all Australian Valiant production.

The VH Valiant Charger achieved critical acclaim, winning the 1971 Australian [[Wheels Car of the Year]] Award. It was also popular in New Zealand where they were assembled from imported kits.

The sporty image of the Charger faded through the VJ range of cars and was neutered altogether by 1975 release of the VK series.

During the seven years of production, the Charger carried many variations of essentially two basic powerplants, based on the [[Chrysler Hemi-6 Engine]] and versions of the [[Chrysler LA engine]] [[V8 engine|V8]].

The Chrysler VH Valiant Charger range, introduced in 1971, consisted of Charger, Charger XL, Charger 770 and Charger R/T (Road/Track) models.

The R/T version carried on Chrysler's performance image from the [[Chrysler Valiant#VG Series|VG series Valiant Pacer]], and soon became the platform for Chrysler's participation in production car racing in Australia. The range of cars was broad-based to appeal to all manner of people:

The Charger R/T option E37 featured a tuned "Six Pack" version of the engine characterised by triple sidedraught Weber carburettors, formed the basis of Chrysler's touring car racer for 1971. This engine could also be ordered as an option on all models

The Charger R/T E49 engine produced remarkable torque on a seven bearing configuration which enabled considerable power development previously unobtained from 6-cylinder engines and not surpassed until the Porsche Turbo 911 (300) release of 1975&lt;ref name="HeyCharger"&gt;{{cite book | last = Farmer | first = Gavin |author2=Bridger, Gary | title = Hey Charger: the sensational Chrysler Valiant Chargers of Australia | publisher = Reed Publishing | year = 2003 | location = Auckland, New Zealand | isbn = 0-7900-0938-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Charger 770 SE''' (Special Edition) featured the E55 option; which was the 340ci 4bbl V8 engine, many motoring journalists correctly reported at the time as being imported by Chrysler for an aborted racing touring car [[homologation]] exercise. Chrysler Racing Manager John Ellis stated at the time that a ute fitted with the 340ci V8 (and the same wheelbase as the R/T Charger) was track tested at the [[Mallala Motorsport Park|Mallala circuit]] in [[South Australia]] by racing driver [[Leo Geoghegan]] (and on local roads by Leo and his brother [[Ian Geoghegan|Ian]]), but was found to be 2–3 seconds slower around Mallala than the E49 (the heavier V8 at the front caused severe understeer and required earlier braking than the Hemi six). Despite the slower lap times at Mallala, it was expected that the extra power of the 340ci V8 would have worked better on the long straights and uphill runs at Bathurst where there were few heavy braking or tight corners. John Ellis then incorrectly stated that the 340ci engines were not imported for Bathurst and that an R/T 340 Charger was not being considered.&lt;ref name="Great_Ideas"&gt;{{Citation | author1=Farmer, Gavin | title=Great ideas in motion: Chrysler's Australian history 1946–1981 | publication-date=2010 | publisher=Ilinga Books | isbn=978-0-9805229-1-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

336 340ci engines plus 4 speed gear boxes were imported by Colin Adey under direct instructions from Chrysler Chief Engineer Walt McPherson.  Chrysler General Manager David Brown and Walt McPherson had discussed the short comings of the E49 265ci and decided the 340ci was to be the next R/T Touring Car.  This information never filtered down to John Ellis.&lt;ref name="Great_Ideas"/&gt;

Due to bad press coverage at the time the 340ci program was aborted and Chrysler did the only thing it could do which was to recoup the cost outlay by selling the stocks of the imported 340ci engines.  The engines were sold off in the upmarket 770 SE (Grand Tourer) Charger.&lt;ref name="Great_Ideas"/&gt;

The SE was fitted with an imported 'Torqueflite' 727 transmission, Chrysler further watered down engine performance by using a single pipe exhaust system. Apart from its unique engine, the Charger 770 SE featured other signature details such as combination black and white vinyl trim and one with single colour Maroon vinyl trim, turned metal dash facia, and it was only available in three body colours, namely Vintage Red (Bright Red), Limelight (green), and Sunfire (yellow metallic). Production records indicate that Chrysler manufactured a total of 125 VH Valiant Charger 770 SE cars, two of which varied from standard specification in being painted White and one Deep Maroon.

[[File:Chrysler Valiant VJ Charger Sportsman.jpg|thumb|Chrysler VJ Valiant Charger Sportsman]]

In March 1973 the VH range was superseded by the VJ series. The VJ featured changes to the cowl, grille, lighting and rear quarter feature panel,&lt;ref name="VBook"&gt;{{cite book | last = Davis | first = Tony | title = The Valiant book: a history of Chrysler Australia's Valiant, 1962–1981 | publisher = Marque Publishing Company | year = 1987 | location = Hurstville, New South Wales | isbn = 0-947079-00-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; with notably 7" round headlights replacing the previous rectangular units. Significantly, this new model range saw the end of the Charger R/T, which pretty much coincided with Chrysler having officially withdrawn from participation in Australian touring car racing at the end of the 1972 season. However, the essential elements of the Six Pack E37 engine option were carried over into the VJ series, now referred to as the E48 engine option.

* option E48: Street tune "Six Pack" {{convert|265|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine with three two-barrel Weber carburettors and four-speed manual gearbox.
* option E55: 4bbl {{convert|275|bhp|abbr=on}} {{convert|340|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 (1.88" valve heads).&lt;ref name="VBook"/&gt;

* option A23: VJ Charger Sportsman

'''VJ Charger 770''' (with option E55)
When specified with the E55 340ci V8 engine option, such VJ-series cars were no longer tagged as a special edition Charger 770 "SE". This meant that a variety of colour and trim combinations are featured in E55 optioned VJ Chargers such that the only external distinguishing features were the "340 4BBL" badges on the front guards. Most, but not all, of the VJ-series E55 option cars also featured the W35 option seven inch wide alloy wheels that were a signature item for all prior E38, E49, and E55 option VH-series Chargers.

There was an improvement to the motor in this model, as opposed to the previous VH-series. The introduction of "Electronic Ignition" replaced the use of points ignition. This greatly improved the car for normal use making cold starts easier, and no longer requiring the ignition to be tuned every 10,000&amp;nbsp;km or so.

The Carter ThermoQuad was used in this series as well, however not from the start, or at least not all the cars left the factory with one. Some still had the previous models AVS carburettor. When the carburettor change was implemented is unknown, with some examples having the Thermoquad and later builds still keeping the AVS. There is considered to be an improvement to engine performance as the flow in the carburettor was increased from 625 cfm to 800 cfm for the Thermoquad.

During this option's life, there were other engine variations, e.g. the motors also had a change in the cylinder heads. According to the service manuals, early VJ models maintained heads with 2.02" inlet valves, whereas later heads had a decrease in inlet valve size which saw a reduction to 1.88", again, when this was implemented is not truly known and some early build cars have the smaller valves whereas some later builds have the larger valves.

It seems that most E55 versions of the VJ Charger were manufactured during the latter half of 1973. When remaining stocks of the {{convert|340|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 depleted, Chrysler ceased manufacturing cars with option E55 and in late 1974 extended availability of the lazy {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 (from the prestige Chrysler by Chrysler sedan) to the Charger 770 by way of option E57.

'''VJ Charger Sportsman''' (option A23)
In August 1974, a limited edition Charger Sportsman was released, based upon the Charger XL. Built to a quantity of 500 units, all Sportsman cars were painted an exclusive combination of Vintage Red and white, with a combination black and white interior featuring specific cloth trim. These cars were powered by the standard 265ci engine and four speed manual transmission.

== VK Charger ==
[[File:Chrysler VK Charger 770 360.JPG|thumb|Chrysler VK Charger 770]]
The mildly revised VK series Charger was released in October 1975 in only two variants:&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Tuckey and Ewan Kennedy, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, pages 140–141&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Charger XL''': {{convert|3.5|L|cuin|1|abbr=on}}, 3spd manual ({{convert|4|L|cuin|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|4.3|L|cuin|1|abbr=on}}litre engine options)
* '''Charger 770''': {{convert|4|L|cuin|1|abbr=on}}, 3spd manual ({{convert|4.3|L|cuin|1|abbr=on}}, {{convert|5.2|L|cuin|1|abbr=on}} V8 and {{convert|5.9|L|cuin|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine options)

The introduction of the VK series saw the demise of the "Six Pack" engine E48 option package, such that only a basic specification {{convert|4.3|L|cuin|1|abbr=on}} engine remained.

The Charger was now marketed as the Chrysler Charger rather than as the Chrysler Valiant Charger &lt;ref name="ACars"&gt;{{cite book | last = Davis | first = Tony | title = Aussie cars | publisher = Marque Publishing Company | year = 1987 | location = Hurstville, New South Wales | isbn = 0-947079-01-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Chrysler script badging having replaced Valiant badging front and rear. Some further changes with the VK model included 'white-out' grille treatment, revised rear light clusters, and revised 'C' pillar ornamentation utilising extended fibreglass panels in black, incorporating XL or 770 badge identification. Inside, wiper and windscreen washer controls were now integrated into the indicator stalk and there were also some trim revisions that included bold Boca-Raton cloth seat inserts for the Charger 770.

In June 1976, ADR 27A (an updated emissions regulation) was implemented for all Australian market motor vehicles, which resulted in both the {{convert|3.5|L|cuin|1|abbr=on}} engine and the {{convert|5.9|L|cuin|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine being dropped from all relevant vehicles in Chrysler's VK series range.

[[File:White Knight Special.jpg|thumb|right|White Knight Special owned by Kevin Johnson-Bade]]

'''VK Charger White Knight Special''' (option A50): Following July 1976, Chrysler released 200 limited edition Charger XL cars that were principally a cosmetic treatment inside and out, and featuring a front body spoiler. Half of the production run were painted Arctic White and the other half were painted Amarante Red, with bumpers and grille painted to match. These cars featured the {{convert|4.3|L|cuin|1|abbr=on}} six-cylinder engine, with a choice of manual or automatic transmission, and interiors were trimmed to a specific combination of white vinyl with red accents.

== CL Charger ==
[[File:Chrysler Charger - CL.jpg|thumb|Chrysler CL Charger 770]]
The CL series Charger was introduced in late October 1976 and was the last Charger model made in Australia, it featured new front bodywork and was expected to be designated as the VL series, but Chrysler decided to rename it CL to reflect the corporate Chrysler name which was now being applied over the whole range of cars sold in Australia.

The Charger XL variant was deleted (except for police duties) such that the CL series offered only the Charger 770 for public sale.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Tuckey and Ewan Kennedy, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, page 165&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CL Charger Drifter''' (A34, A49 options): Late in the life of the CL Charger, Chrysler introduced the Drifter Pack option which was made available in four body colour choices, namely Spinnaker White (A34), Impact Orange (A49), Sundance Yellow (A49), and Harvest Gold (A49). This was basically a cosmetic option inspired by features found on the [[Chrysler Drifter]] panel van. These cars were available in a choice of {{convert|4.3|L|cuin|1|abbr=on}} or {{convert|5.2|L|cuin|1|abbr=on}} engines, but only with 4-speed manual transmission.

Chrysler's manufacturing production of the Charger ceased on 16 August 1978.

[[File:Leo's Valiant Charger.jpg|thumb|right|Leo Geoghegan's Chrysler VH Valiant Charger.]]

The Valiant Charger was raced in Australia in an official capacity during 1971 and 1972, with most effort concentrated upon the annual Bathurst 500 mile touring car event. Chrysler Australia employed the services of racing driver [[Leo Geoghegan]] to assist in the development of the Charger as a touring car racer. The Charger won the first race in which it was entered, the Toby Lee 100 at Oran Park, driven by Doug Chivas. In the [[1972 Hardie-Ferodo 500]] at [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Bathurst]], a VH Charger R/T E49 driven by [[Doug Chivas]] placed third outright behind a [[Ford XY Falcon GTHO]] and a [[Holden Torana GTR XU-1]]. They were comprehensively beaten by the XY Falcon GTHO, lapping some 6 seconds per lap slower due to brake pad supply issues. A rumour may exist, even if only on this page, that the order from Sydney for the Chrysler team and others was allegedly misplaced on the Saturday night before Sunday's race. The rumour further claims that Holden and Ford played a hand, or teams of the two major makers in Australia, played a part. Seems far more likely wishful thinking of fans of the less liked Chrysler brand in Australia at the time. This rumour is unsubstantiated by even a mention anywhere of missing brake pads. But the rumour does display the militant rivalry of the 3 brands in Australia and epitomises the sentiments of the various fans at major race days, especially Bathurst. Generally the opinions of enthusiasts of the three major makes, Ford, Holden (GMH) and Chrysler, Chrysler was generally regarded as the ugly bridesmaid, with Ford second, and Holden enjoying its place ensconced in the illusion that it was more Australian.
         
In New Zealand, where the touring car rules were less open, the Charger proved to be unbeatable from 1971 through to 1979 at the famous B&amp;H 500 mile (later 1000&amp;nbsp;km) series held at [[Pukekohe Park Raceway]]. The most successful of New Zealand drivers were Leo Leonard and Jim Little.

[[Allan Moffat]], driving the [[Ford XY Falcon GT]]HO, was comprehensively beaten by the Charger in New Zealand. Moffat proclaimed the winning car as "The Fastest Charger in the World".

The '''Chrysler Valiant''' was a [[full-size car]] which was sold by [[Chrysler Australia]] between 1962 and 1981. Initially a rebadged locally assembled [[Plymouth Valiant]] from the United States, from the second generation launched in 1963, the Valiant was fully manufactured in Australia. It was sold locally but also in New Zealand and South Africa, with smaller numbers also exported to South-East Asia and the United Kingdom.

Parent company [[Chrysler]] made a substantial investment in Australian manufacturing facilities, by establishing operations in [[South Australia]] with an assembly plant at [[Clovelly Park|Tonsley Park]] in 1964&lt;ref&gt;New Plant Built in Record Time, The Advertiser, Friday, 2 October 1964, page 26&lt;/ref&gt; and an engine foundry at [[Lonsdale, South Australia|Lonsdale]] in 1968. The Valiant thus established its position as the third of the "Big 3" Australian-made vehicles behind the [[Holden Kingswood]] and [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]].

The Australian Valiant was built on the North American A-body platform but with many parts and components from Australian suppliers. Apart from a sedan and wagon body style, 1965 saw the introduction of a commercial [[coupe utility|utility]] that was badged the '''Wayfarer''' and later exported to South Africa as the '''Rustler'''. In September 1969 the two-door Hardtop was released and in 1971 the [[Chrysler Valiant Charger|Charger]].

Greater differentiation from the donor car creeped in over time, particularly since the VE series, which was embraced by the Australian motoring press and won the 1967 ''[[Wheels magazine|Wheels]]'' magazine [[Car of the Year]] award. The VF series of 1969 and the VG of 1970 departed even further from its North American donor both in terms of styling and performance—with the latter series introducing the ''[[Hemi-6]]'' engine that replaced the ''Slant-6''. Moreover, Australia continued to produce a station wagon model, called the '''Safari''', even after this body style being discontinued for North America.

Beginning in 1971, the VH series saw Chrysler Australia develop the entire lineup locally until the CM series of 1979, which marked the end of local production in 1981, after the [[takeover]] of operations by [[Mitsubishi Motors Australia]].

==First generation==

===RV1 (R Series)===
{{main|Chrysler Valiant (RV1)}}
[[File:1962 Chrysler Valiant (RV1) sedan (2015-07-15) 01.jpg|thumb|left|RV1 Valiant sedan]]
[[File:1962 Chrysler RV1 Valiant (R series) (4990129686).jpg|thumb|right|RV1 Valiant sedan]]

After the [[Plymouth Valiant]] turned out to be a success in the United States (starting with its 1959 introduction), [[Chrysler]] released Australia's first locally assembled Valiant, the RV1 (R-series). It was officially unveiled by South Australia's Premier, Sir Thomas Playford, in January 1962 {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} and was assembled at Chrysler's [[Mile End, South Australia|Mile End]] facility.&lt;ref&gt;Motor Manual, September 1984, page 74&lt;/ref&gt;

The RV1 (or R Series) Valiant was an instant success. Not everyone was taken instantly by the car's styling, but the general consensus{{Vague|date=February 2011}} was that the car had a modern, almost space age quality about it.

Also notable was the Valiant's performance with {{convert|145|bhp}} from the [[Chrysler Slant 6 engine|225 ''Slant-6'']] engine. This was a lot of power compared to the competing Holdens and Fords, which offered only {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|90|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} SAE respectively.

Standard transmission in the RV1 was a floor-shifted three-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] with a non-synchro first gear. A pushbutton-operated three-speed [[TorqueFlite]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]] was  optional.&lt;ref name=Tuckey13&gt;Elisabeth Tuckey and Ewan Kennedy, R Series Valiant brochure, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, page 13&lt;/ref&gt; Other options included a heater-demister unit, as well as a "Moparmatic" deluxe pushbutton [[transistor]] [[radio]].

The RV1 Valiant was the first Australian car to come with an [[alternator]] instead of a generator, and instead of coil springs, the Valiant came with [[torsion bar]] suspension. Brakes were hydraulic {{convert|9|in|mm|abbr=on}} [[drum brake|drums]] front and rear. The RV1 had a simulated spare wheel outline on the bootlid, but the spare wheel was actually under the floor of the boot.

The base model sold for [[Australian pound|£]]1299.

===SV1 (S Series)===
{{main|Chrysler Valiant (SV1)}}

[[File:1962 Chrysler Valiant (SV1) sedan (25009598684).jpg|thumb|right|SV1 Valiant sedan]]
In March 1962, Chrysler replaced the American 1961-model R Valiant with the American 1962 SV1 (S Series) Valiant. The SV1 used the same body shell as the RV1, with cosmetic changes including the deletion of the simulated spare wheel on the bootlid, and round [[Automotive lighting|tail lamps]] replacing the R-model's cat-eye shaped ones. There was a revised radiator grille and new exterior trim.

Mechanical changes included relocation of the manual transmission shifter to the steering column, new ball joints, and a new gear-reduction [[Automobile self-starter|starter motor]].

10,009 SV1 Valiants were sold, of which 5,496 were automatics and 4,513 were manuals.

==Second generation==

===AP5 Series===
{{main|Chrysler Valiant (AP5)}}
[[File:1964 Valiant AP5 Regal==.JPG|thumb|left|AP5 Valiant Regal sedan]]
[[File:1964 Chrysler AP5 Valiant Regal sedan (15029224143).jpg|thumb|right|AP5 Valiant Regal sedan]]
On 30 May 1963, [[Chrysler Australia]] produced the first fully Australian manufactured Valiant, the '''AP5'''. In February of that year,&lt;ref name=Advertiser&gt;New plant built in record time, ''The Advertiser'', Friday, 2 October 1964, p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysler Australia had begun work on its new $36 million [[Tonsley Park]] facility in South Australia,&lt;ref&gt;Australian Motor Manual, October 1966, p.39.&lt;/ref&gt; where it could boost annual production to 50 thousand cars. The new plant produced its first Valiants on 31 March 1964.&lt;ref name=Advertiser/&gt;

The AP5 ("AP" for ''Australian Production''&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;Davis, Tony: ''The Valiant Book'' {{ISBN|0-947079-00-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an entirely new design with only the four doors, windscreen, and front guards shared with its North American counterpart. Initial cars retained the left-hand-drive wiper pattern but this was soon changed to a RHD layout. The ''Slant-6'' driveline was retained, but the AP5 was considerably more straightforward in styling than its R- and S-model antecedents. With high [[Protectionism|local content]] and specifications optimised for local conditions, this new Valiant strengthened the brand's position in the marketplace. A new upmarket '''Regal''' version was included in the range. In November 1963 an AP5 '''Safari''' [[station wagon]] was released. 
Total production of the AP5 range amounted to 49,440 vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Davis, Aussie Cars, 1987, page 88&lt;/ref&gt;

===AP6 Series===
{{main|Chrysler Valiant (AP6)}}

[[File:1965 Chrysler Valiant AP6 Safari Wagon (16919719098).jpg|thumb|right|AP6 Valiant Safari Wagon]]
In March 1965, the AP5 was supplanted by the '''AP6'''. The body shell was the same, but there was a new grille on the theme of the 1964 North American [[Plymouth Barracuda]], and there was new trim inside and out. The automatic transmission was no longer controlled by pushbuttons, but instead by a conventional shift lever.&lt;!--floor or column?--&gt; The AP6 also included other new features such as self-adjusting brakes and [[acrylic enamel]] paint, at the time the most advanced auto finish available. The AP6 model range included the '''Valiant Wayfarer''', the first Valiant-based [[coupe utility]] to be built by Chrysler Australia.

The AP6 was the first Australian-built Valiant to be offered with a V8 engine — the {{convert|273|cuin|L|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler LA engine|LA V8]], introduced in American Valiants in 1964, and released in Australia in August 1965. The engine developed {{convert|180|bhp}} and pushed the Valiant to a top speed of {{convert|109|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.

The V8 was only available as a model in its own right, the V8 Valiant, which had a vinyl-covered roof, individual bucket seats, floor console mounted automatic shift lever and two-tone steering wheel.

The ''Slant-6'''s [[camshaft]] was also slightly upgraded for improved torque by dint of increased duration and lift.

Chrysler Australia had difficulty meeting demand, with the Valiant being built at Tonsley Park at a maximum rate of 200 cars per eight-hour shift. Customers had to wait up to four months for delivery of a new AP6. Prices ran from $2,500 to $3,650.

===VC Series===
{{main|Chrysler Valiant (VC)}}

[[File:Chrysler Valiant VC Regal (23194895400).jpg|thumb|right|VC Valiant Regal sedan]]

The VC Valiant was introduced in March 1966 and, although underneath it was basically the same car as the preceding AP6 Series, the body was extensively restyled giving the illusion of being longer and lower.

The modern new design was highlighted by sharp, squared-off edges and corners clearly influenced by Chrysler in the United States. The front now had a full-width horizontal grille while the rear was also much squarer with vertical taillights.

The range of models again consisted of the Valiant standard or Regal sedan, standard or Safari Regal wagon and Wayfarer utility. They featured higher standard equipment levels as well as new safety features, such as optional disc brakes on V8 models, which were named 'Valiant V8/Safari V8' and were essentially Regal models.

The VC Series was built both for its major market, Australia, but also for export to the United Kingdom, as announced at the October 1966 [[London Motor Show]], based on the following range of uniquely named models (brackets indicate the equivalent Australian nameplate):

* Medium Saloon (Valiant equivalent)
* Medium Safari Estate Car  (Valiant Safari wagon equivalent)
* Regal Highline Saloon Automatic  (Valiant Regal equivalent)
* Regal Highline Safari (Valiant Safari Regal wagon equivalent)
* Premium V8 Saloon  (Valiant V8 equivalent)
* Premium Safari Estate Car  (Valiant Safari V8 wagon equivalent)

In total, Chrysler Australia built 65,634 VC Series models.

==Third generation==

===VE Series===
{{main|Chrysler Valiant (VE)}}

[[File:Dodge VE utility.jpg|thumb|right|Dodge utility, a lower-priced version of the VE Valiant utility]]

This Valiant was an all-new design introduced in October 1967, based on the North American platform, which had a {{convert|108|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase. The bonnet and guards were shared with the also-new 1967 North American [[Dodge Dart]], with other styling cues otherwise inherited from the North American Valiant. The car feature slightly larger body dimensions and greater interior space than the preceding VC Series. The roofline was also flattened out and the rear window was given a concave profile.

Higher levels of standard equipment were featured and two engine options became available. The basic ''Slant-6'' was retained with its {{convert|145|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} rating, but a new 2-barrel carbureted version was released with output of {{convert|160|bhp|kW|abbr=on}}. The 273 V8 was also improved and made available across the entire Valiant range.

Other upgrades included the introduction of a larger {{convert|64|l|adj=on}} fuel tank, shorter gear lever throw on the manual gearbox, relocation of the dipswitch from under the brake pedal to the high left of the firewall, and the windscreen wiper motor was relocated to the engine side of the firewall — greatly reducing wiper noise. All models benefited from additional safety features (some compulsory under new Australian Design Rules, or ADRs) such as dual circuit brakes with a tandem master cylinder, double sided safety rims, front seat belts and front power disc brakes on V8 models.

The VE range consisted of Valiant &amp; Valiant Regal sedans, Valiant Safari &amp; Valiant Regal Safari station wagons and Valiant,  Valiant Wayfarer &amp; Dodge utilities, the latter being a lower-priced version of the Valiant utility. The flagship model followed on from the AP6 and VC V8 theme, being similarly equipped with bucket seats, floor shift automatic, and vinyl roof all standard, but was given the new name "VIP" to distinguish it from other models, since the V8 engine option was made available across the range. It also shared the 3 'sergeant stripes' of the VC V8 on the rear quarter panel.

The biggest accolade for the VE Valiant was [[Wheels (magazine)|''Wheels'']] "Car of the Year" in 1967 — the first for Chrysler Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chargerclubofwa.asn.au/media-detail.asp?iMediaID=4 Road Test – Valiant VE (Wheels Car of the Year 1967) in ''Wheels'' magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

68,688 VE Valiants were built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/valiant_ve_technical_specifications.htm Valiant VE Technical Specifications] Retrieved from www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au on 22 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===VF Series===
{{main|Chrysler Valiant (VF)}}

[[File:Chrysler VF Valiant Regal 770 Hardtop.JPG|right|thumb|VF Valiant Regal 770 hardtop]]
[[File:Chrysler VF Valiant Pacer.JPG|thumb|VF Valiant Pacer]]

In March 1969, the VE was replaced by the '''VF''' model. The new car shared its middle section with the previous VE Valiant, but there was new front and rear styling. The new front end featured a horizontally convex grille, replacing the VE's concave design. The front indicators were placed at the top leading edge of the front guards rather than in a more conventional location in the grille or front bumper. This allowed the VF's front bumper to be thinner and less prominent, which made the single round [[Headlamp|headlights]] look larger, and the front end appeared more aggressive as a result.

Valiant and Valiant Regal models were once again available, and the VF range also saw the introduction of the '''Valiant Regal 770''' and an upgraded VIP model. The VF VIP was introduced two months after the Valiant range and was no longer a Valiant V.I.P. but was now marketed as a '''[[Chrysler VIP]]''', in sedan form only. It offered a stretched ({{convert|112|in|mm|disp=or}}) wheelbase, with longer rear doors than the Valiant. As with previous model changes, the VF boasted even more safety features including a padded instrument panel and energy absorbing steering column.

A larger {{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} version of the LA V8 replaced the 273, taking the V8's top speed to {{convert|109|mph|abbr=on}}. Transmission options remained the same: three-speed manual or three-speed TorqueFlite automatic.

The most significant introduction to the VF range was the all new two-door Valiant Hardtop — essentially, a North American [[Dodge Dart]] coupé with the Australian Valiant front sheetmetal and interior trim. At over {{convert|5,000|mm|abbr=on}}, it is the longest coupe ever built in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_chrysler_valiant_vf.htm Chrysler Valiant VF, www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au] Retrieved on 17 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  Released six months after the other VF Valiants in September 1969, it was available in Valiant, Valiant Regal and Valiant Regal 770 models.

In mid 1969, Chrysler released a fast four-door named '''Valiant Pacer'''. A low-cost, high-power version of the bread-and-butter Valiant sedan, the Pacer featured a high-performance six-cylinder engine and three-speed manual gearbox with floor shifter. Despite a lack of exterior chrome, the VF Pacer stood out with its red and black grille, simulated-[[mag wheel]] hub caps, special body striping, 'Pacer 225' decals, and choice of "Wild Blue", "Wild Red", or "Wild Yellow" exterior colours. The sparsely trimmed interior featured high back bucket seats, and distinctive black on white instrument dials with a dash-top-mounted [[tachometer]]. Although lacking the V8 of its rivals, the Pacer could reach almost {{convert|180|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} and, at $2798, was $400 cheaper than the base GTS Monaro. The Pacer was powered by a special version of the trusty 225 ''Slant-6''. With two-barrel carburettor, high-flow exhaust system, and 9.3:1 [[compression ratio]], it produced {{convert|175|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Standard brakes were finned, servo-assisted drum brakes all round, although most buyers opted for the optional front discs.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Underneath was Valiant's basic torsion bar suspension, lowered by {{convert|125|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} to improve handling and with a front anti-sway bar fitted. A 'Sure-Grip' [[limited-slip differential]] with either 3.23:1 or 2.92:1 ratios was optional.

Contemporary road testers were mostly full of praise for the Pacer, noting there were few cars that could match it on a performance for price basis.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} ''Modern Motor'' (May, 1969) took a VF Pacer sedan to {{convert|60|mph|abbr=on}} in a respectable 10.5 seconds, the {{convert|1/4|mi|m}} in 17.5 seconds and topped out at {{convert|111|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.

In 1969, Chrysler's market share reached 13.7%. In total, 52,944 VF Valiants were built.

===VG Series===
{{main|Chrysler Valiant (VG)}}

[[File:1971 Chrysler Valiant (VG) Regal Safari station wagon (2015-07-10) 01.jpg|thumbnail|VG Valiant Regal Safari station wagon]]
August 1970 saw the introduction of another facelifted version of the VE/VF bodystyle in the '''VG''' Valiant. The VG's most noticeable difference was the use of rectangular [[headlamp]]s instead of the traditional round ones (except on VIP models, which used quad round headlamps). The guard-top indicator location was carried over from the VF. The grille was a horizontal, single-plane item, and the taillamps were revised and wrapped around to the body side. Sedan, Wagon, Ute and Hardtop body styles were offered once again as well as the same luxury levels as before.

The biggest announcement to come with the VG Valiant was of the all new ''[[Chrysler Hemi-6 Engine|Hemi-6 engine]]'', replacing the ''Slant-6''. The new engine was introduced as a {{convert|245|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} unit with quasi-hemispherical combustion chambers. The "''Hemi''" name was already legendary in America with Chrysler's use of the ''[[Chrysler Hemi engine|Hemi V8]]'', hence Chrysler Australia's marketing leverage for its 6-cylinder offering. The 1-barrel version of the 245 produced {{convert|165|bhp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|235|lbfft|Nm|abbr=on}}.

The sporty Pacer sedan was available again, but whereas the VF Pacer was only offered with the one power output, the new VG Pacer offered 3 different versions of the new 245 ''Hemi-6'' engine, though Chrysler Australia didn't publish any power output figures for the Pacers. The standard Pacer had a 2-barrel carburettor and produced {{convert|185|bhp|kW|abbr=on}}. '''Option E31''' produced {{convert|195|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} and included a two-barrel carburettor,  higher-performance camshaft, smaller fan, and [[windage tray]]. '''Option E34''' produced {{convert|235|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} and included a 4-barrel carburettor, high-performance camshaft, dual-plate clutch, manual choke, modified instrument cluster, torque-limiting engine mount strut, larger radiator, smaller fan, windage tray, premium engine bearings, [[Shot peening|shot-peened]] [[crankshaft]] and [[connecting rod]]s, and high-capacity oil pump. '''Option E35''' included a 4-barrel carburettor, high-performance camshaft, heavy-duty engine bearings, a dual-plate clutch, torque-limiting engine mount strut, and the ordinary Pacer-spec transmission.

The VG series Pacers were also the first and last to be offered in the Hardtop body style, of which three were optioned with the E31 package and three were optioned with E35 package. No VG Pacer Hardtops were available with the E34 option. Due to Chrysler Australia's policy (local content law/government law) of using only locally produced components, and the unavailability of a local four-speed gearbox, the Pacer was offered with only a three-speed floor shift manual transmission.

A total of 46,374 VG Valiants were built.

==Fourth generation==

===VH Series===
{{main|Chrysler Valiant (VH)}}

[[File:VH Valiant.jpg|thumb|VH Valiant station wagon]]

Chrysler released the VH Valiant range in June 1971. The VH was the first fully Australian-designed Valiant and was a major change from the preceding VG range — these were larger cars, styled to look even larger than they were. The grille treatment on the new VH range was a direct design descendant from the US [[Mopar]]s with the central recessed area for grille and headlamps, surrounded by uninterrupted trim on the outer leading edge of the whole assembly. The rectangular headlamps were carried over from the VG model.

The model range of the VH Valiant was quite extensive, starting with the new entry-level Valiant Ranger, and progressing to Valiant Ranger XL, Valiant Pacer, Valiant Regal, and Valiant Regal 770.

Carried over from the VG range, the basic ''Hemi-6'' 245ci engine was standard equipment for Ranger XL and Regal, but a new {{convert|265|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} version offered {{convert|203|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} and was standard equipment for the Regal 770.  The ''Fireball'' 318 V8 engine was still an option, but only available on the Regal 770 sedan. The basic Ranger sedan featured a new low compression ''Hemi-6'' 215ci engine that operated on Standard grade petrol. This engine was not available on the other sedan cars in the VH range.

Unlike the VG range, Valiant Pacer was now only available in 4-door sedan form. Apart from vivid paint colours, optional bonnet blackouts and striping, the new Pacer featured a higher performance version of the 265ci engine, with {{convert|218|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} at 4,800 rpm and {{convert|273|lbfft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 3,000 rpm. The Pacer could run the quarter-mile in 15.9 seconds, get to 100&amp;nbsp;km/h in 7.6 seconds and reach a top speed of 185&amp;nbsp;km/h.

[[File:Valiant VH Hemi Pacer.JPG|thumb|VH Valiant Pacer]]

In fact, at its release, the VH Valiant Pacer set the record for being the fastest mass-produced four-door sedan with a six-cylinder engine manufactured in Australia, a record which stood for 17 years.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

The Pacer's days as the VH performance model were numbered, because that same year saw the announcement and introduction of what was to become Chrysler Australia's most recognised new car — [[Chrysler Valiant Charger|the Valiant Charger]]. In total, only 1,647 VH Valiant Pacer sedans were produced.

The new Valiant Charger was unlike anything that had come before and it had the Australian motoring press calling it, "...the most handsome car Chrysler has ever produced, and probably the best looking car ever produced by an Australian manufacturer".{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} A short-wheelbase, fastback coupe with an aggressive wedge-like stance, the Charger's design gave the effect of speed, even when it was standing still.

Chrysler's TV campaign for the Charger featured the young adults at whom it was targeted, waving at one as it swept by them and shouting "Hey, Charger!" — one of the more memorable TV ads of the time, it created a cliché that haunts today's owners. Charger won ''Wheels'' magazine's Car of the Year award for 1971 and was widely acclaimed by others in the motoring press, as well as the public.

The Valiant Charger came in four model guises, closely mirroring the existing sedan range — Charger, Charger XL, Charger 770, and Charger R/T. The first of the serious "track pack" R/T Chargers had option E38. Despite being hampered by a three-speed gearbox, it still drew favourable comments from ''Wheels'': "We achieved a time of 14.8 seconds for the quarter-mile — on smoother surfaces the Charger galloped away so easily that a best of 14.5 seconds is within reach".{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Being a three-speed gearbox, these quarter-mile runs took only one gear change.

[[File:Chrysler VH Valiant Charger R-T HEMI Six-Pack 1.jpg|thumb|VH Valiant Charger R/T ''Six Pack'' coupe]]

The most recognised performance Chargers were the '''Six Pack''' cars. The term ''six pack'' denoted the triple side-draught Weber 2BBL carburettors with which the 265 ''Hemi-6'' engine – in option E37, option E38, and later option E49 – produced levels of power unheard of on a naturally aspirated six-cylinder at the time. The triple carburettors also made for a distinctive throaty note when under acceleration.

E38 versions of the Charger R/T featured a 265 ''Hemi-6'' which produced {{Convert|280|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} while the E37 was the street tune option made available on Charger 770 and Charger R/T. E38 was a race-ready Charger R/T with the additional A84 Track Pack option, which included a {{convert|35|impgal|l|adj=on}} fuel tank. There was also an A87 Track Pack option that included all the race track goodies, but for the larger fuel tank.

In mid-1972, the E38 option was superseded by the more powerful and greatly refined four-speed transmission E49 option. This drew comments from ''Wheels'' such as, "The raw quivering power is instantaneously on tap and with a ratio for every conceivable situation the Charger just storms through. It would take a Ferrari Daytona with racing driver Jackie Ickx at the wheel to stay with one".{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} All E49s came with a Track Pack, 21 of which featured the huge fuel tank with dual fillers. The E49 six pack engine came with a baffled sump, tuned length headers, special shot-peened crankshaft, connecting rods, pistons, rings, cam, valve springs, a twin plate clutch and of course the triple 45&amp;nbsp;mm dual throat Weber carburetors. Chrysler quoted this engine as producing {{convert|302|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} which, in a {{convert|1372|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} car, made for rapid acceleration.

The R/T E49 was the ultimate Valiant Charger, and with only 149 built the E49s are still widely considered today as one of the greatest Australian "muscle" cars ever produced.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Road tests of the era recorded quarter-mile times of between 14.1 and 14.5 seconds. 0 to {{convert|100|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} in 14.1 seconds was the norm. This compares to times of 14.6 for the next quickest accelerating Australian muscle car, the Ford XY Falcon GT-HO (Phase III).

Although the Six Pack Chargers were the dominant performance players in the VH range, there was another Charger, the {{convert|275|bhp|kW|abbr=on}}, {{convert|340|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 powered E55, that came close. Option E55 was applied to the new Charger 770 SE in August 1972, and this car could reach {{convert|60|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} in 7.2 seconds and complete the quarter-mile in 15.5 seconds — all topped off by a top speed of {{convert|122|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.

A batch of several hundred VH Charger 770 318 V8s were exported to Japan along with CH sedans. The Chargers had a CH-like nose with VH sheet metal surrounding the CH four headlights and grille, a combination that NZ assembler Todd Motors would later use to create its unique VJ Valiant Regal 770 sedan. The Japanese cars also had air conditioning, side marker lights and separate white reversing lights as well as mirrors conforming to Japanese market regulations.

Overall, Chrysler Australia manufactured 67,800 VH Valiant cars.

New Zealand distributor Todd Motors had assembled the Valiant sedan from CKD kits since the AP5, mostly following the Australian range though with fewer variants and engine choices plus local upholstery. For the VH, it was a little more adventurous, launching a unique-to-NZ Ranger XL sedan as the base model with a two-barrel carburetor version of the 245ci ''Hemi-6'' engine, no tail lamp trim surrounds or door window brightwork, unique seats and upholstery, and manual or automatic, column-shift transmission. The Regal 770 had the 265ci ''Hemi-6'', floor-console automatic shifter, round dials with wood trim in place of the strip speedo and its own unique front bucket seats and trim. The 318ci V8 was optional and a vinyl roof was standard but could be deleted to order. Todd's sole locally built Charger model was also to '770' trim with the 265ci ''Hemi-6'' six and three-speed floor shift auto and did not have the bumper overriders standard in Australia. Early runs had one-piece front door glass and hinged opening rear side windows but, due to problems with water leaks and excessive wind noise, this was soon changed to opening front quarterlights and fixed rear side glass. Wagons were imported from Australia, to Australian specification.

===CH Series===
{{Main|Chrysler by Chrysler}}
[[File:Chrysler CH Hardtop.JPG|thumb|CH Chrysler hardtop]]
The VH model range also saw the introduction of the new luxury class vehicles, the '''CH''' range. The CH was a further {{convert|4|in|mm}} longer in the wheelbase than the VH Valiant — {{convert|115|in|mm|abbr=on}} — with a total length of {{convert|197|in|mm|abbr=on}}. It featured quad round headlamps and a different rear end treatment, and had quieter suspension and higher equipment levels.

The CH (or "Chrysler by Chrysler", as it is commonly referred to) was a four-door luxury model intended to compete with the [[Ford Fairlane (Australia)|Ford Fairlane]] and [[Holden]]'s [[Statesman (automobile)|Statesman]] models in the luxury car market in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Tuckey &amp; Ewan Kennedy, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, page104&lt;/ref&gt;

Also released in October 1971 was a two-door version of the CH which was called the Chrysler Hardtop, and shared the same wheelbase as the four-door Chrysler, along with the front and rear end treatment.

===VJ Series===
{{main|Chrysler Valiant (VJ)}}

[[File:Chrysler VJ Valiant Regal Hardtop.jpg|thumb|right|VJ Valiant Regal hardtop]]
May 1973 saw the introduction of the next model in the new All-Australian designed Valiant — The '''VJ'''. Although essentially a facelifted version of the VH Valiant before it, the VJ's subtle changes made enough of an impact on the buying public to make it the biggest selling Chrysler Valiant model of all, with 90,865 units being sold.

Externally the VJ Valiant continued on with the VH series body styles, though the VJ reverted to single 7" round headlamps and a new 8-segment grille. VJ sedans also received new horizontal taillights. Although the physical changes were few, many other new features were introduced in the VJ Valiant range, such as [[electronic ignition]], rustproofing and floor-mounted shifters as standard features. Chrysler upgraded equipment levels in July 1974 with front disc brakes, door reflectors, lockable glovebox and retractable [[seatbelt]]s all as standard features.

While the VJ range still offered sedan, wagon, ute, hardtop and coupe variants, the performance-oriented Pacer sedans and Charger R/T coupes were deleted from the new range. However, a variation of the E37 Six Pack engine (now with four-speed manual transmission) was made available, in the form of option E48, with most of the cars bearing this option ending up being base model VJ Charger coupes. Four VJ Charger coupes were built by special order featuring the VH series option E49 engine. The other carry-over performance variant was option E55, with the 340ci V8 engine option officially remaining as restricted to Charger 770 coupe application only.

In August 1974, a special run of 500 Sportsman coupes were released, based upon the Charger XL model. They were only available in Vintage Red with white body accents. These cars also had a unique white interior with plaid cloth seats and featured a standard 265 engine with a choice of either manual or automatic transmissions.

In New Zealand, Todd Motors was even more adventurous with the VJ. The base Ranger XL and Charger were updated, as in Australia, with similar NZ-only variations as the VH but the VJ Regal 770 was something of a 'parts bin special' and essentially a merger of a VJ Regal with a CH Chrysler. The nose - also used for several hundred VH Chargers built for the Japanese market - combined the CH's four headlamps and grille with VH Valiant sheetmetal (retaining the older, larger, clear park/indicator lamps) while the rest of the body was as per Australian VJ. Inside, new front seats were CH style, with individual chairs forming a bench shape, and a column automatic shifter was now used. Earlier cars had all-vinyl upholstery but cloth was fitted as standard later. New Zealand VJ Regals also had a vinyl roof in black or beige and the panel between the tail lights was also trimmed in vinyl to match - the vinyl trim could be deleted to order.

===CJ Series===
{{Main|Chrysler by Chrysler}}
The Chrysler was given a facelift in May 1973 to become the CJ Series. The two-door hardtop was dropped leaving only the four-door sedan to carry on the fight against its Ford and Statesman luxury competitors. The related Valiant hardtop's production continued.

===VK Series===
{{main|Chrysler Valiant (VK)}}
[[File:Chrysler VK Valiant Regal Sedan 01.jpg|thumb|VK Valiant Regal sedan]]
[[File:1976 Chrysler VK Charger 770 coupe 01.jpg|thumb|VK Charger 770 coupe]]
In October 1975 the VK Valiant was released with few external changes from the previous VJ model. The Ranger now had an argent version of the VJ Charger grille, the Charger XL had a white version and the Charger 770 also had the argent grille. The VK Valiant Regal featured a "grille within a grille".&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Tuckey and Ewan Kennedy, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, page 137&lt;/ref&gt; The Ranger sedan, Regal sedan, and Charger all now shared the same tail-light treatment, using a horizontal layout with four chrome contours to keep air flow away and keep the lenses clean. The Chargers were not called Chrysler Valiant Chargers any longer; with the 'Valiant' name being dropped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_chrysler_valiant_vk.htm Chrysler Valiant VK] Retrieved from Unique Cars And Parts on 4/8/2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The VK Regal also had blinker repeaters housed in small chrome boxes which sat on top of both front guards. Another unusual option was the '''Fuel Pacer''' option from the Chrysler US parts bin which detected low engine vacuum – as under hard acceleration – and illuminated the driver side guardtop blinker repeater to indicate wasteful driving. Inertia-reel seatbelts and slightly different heater controls were introduced on the VK, as well as a combination control stalk for the lights and wipers from the [[Mitsubishi Galant]]. The Ranger also got full-length door trims, and carpet was now standard.

VK six-cylinder series engines were the same as the VJ's, and the 245 ''Hemi-6'' now featured a two-barrel carburettor like the 265 variant. The V8s were mainly {{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} units, though the {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} remained an option across the entire range. It was not very popular as the mid 1970s saw the trend towards smaller cars with smaller motors. While the "three on the tree" column shift manual gearbox was still available, it was rarely specified (although still popular on Utes) and the three-speed floor change was now gone too. Buyers seeking floor-shift manual could choose the four-speed, which was available on all models but could only be had with a ''Hemi-6'', not with a V8.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Late in the VK model run a limited edition Charger called the White Knight Special (option A50) was offered with a factory-fitted front air dam. The changes were mainly cosmetic with running gear being largely stock. There were 200 White Knight Specials made – 100 Arctic White and 100 Amarante Red. 120 were automatics and 80 were four-speeds.

20,555 VK Valiants were produced and production ceased in June 1976. This was because [[Australian Design Rules|ADR]] 27A for [[Automobile emissions control|exhaust emission control]] became effective on 1 July 1976, and all the car manufacturers used that date as the introduction of a new model to comply with the new standard.

VK assembly did not begin in New Zealand until nearly a year after Australian launch because a 60% sales tax levied on large engine cars, introduced during the 1973-4 oil crisis, drastically slowed VJ sales. The model range in New Zealand was pared down to Regal and Regal 770 editions.

===CK Series===
{{Main|Chrysler by Chrysler}}
The Chrysler was given a slight a facelift in October 1975 to become the '''CK''' series.&lt;ref name=Tuckey&gt;Elisabeth Tuckey &amp; Ewan Kennedy, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, pages 145–149&lt;/ref&gt; Production ceased just one year later in October 1976&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; when the Chrysler was replaced by the Chrysler Regal SE, a prestige version of the CL Series Valiant.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Davis, Aussie Cars, 1987, page 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===CL Series===
{{main|Chrysler Valiant (CL)}}
[[File:Chrysler Charger - CL.jpg|thumb|CL Charger 770 coupe]]
[[File:Chrysler Drifter rear.jpg|thumb|right|1976-1978 [[Chrysler Drifter|CL Drifter van]]]]
The CL Series Valiant was introduced in November 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/valiant_cl_technical_specifications.htm Valiant CL Technical Specifications] Retrieved on 16 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Although it used the same bodyshell as the previous VK range, the front and rear ends were restyled. The front end used horizontally arrayed quad round [[headlamp]]s flanking a central grille. The front guards and bonnet were also reworked accordingly. The new bootlid's curved leading edge flowed down to new [[Automotive lighting|taillights]] that sandwiched a simple centre garnish panel. The bumpers, however, were the same units as had been used on the 1969 VF series Valiants.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The Ranger name was dropped; the base model CL was simply called ''Valiant'', and the long-wheelbase "Chrysler by Chrysler" was replaced by the ''Regal SE''. The CL series Regal was marketed as the '''Chrysler Regal''',&lt;ref&gt;"Chrysler Regal", sales brochure for CL series Chrysler Regal, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the Valiant Regal name used from the AP5 series&lt;ref&gt;"Valiant by Chrysler", sales brochure for AP5 series Valiant by Chrysler, Valiant Regal section, pages 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; through to the recently superseded VK Series.&lt;ref&gt;"Chrysler Valiant Regal", sales brochure for VK series Chrysler Valiant Regal, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; The CL series was the last to include a Charger model, which — like the previous VK model — was badged and sold as a ''Chrysler'', not as a ''Valiant'' submodel. The CL Charger was generally available in only one trim level, the '''Charger 770''', though a '''Charger XL''' was made available to police departments. The CL series also saw the arrival of the panel van variant to compete with similar offerings from rival makers.

Interiors carried over largely unchanged from the VK range, though the Regal SE offered luxurious buttoned-leather seating as an option. Base Valiants continued with the previous Ranger style strip [[speedometer]], while the Regal dash featured recessed circular gauges and clock with a woodgrain finish. The Charger 770 dash was similar to that of the Regal, except it was finished in black and had a [[tachometer]] instead of a clock.

The {{convert|215|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Hemi-6'' and {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} V8 were dropped, and the only engine options were low- and high-compression versions of the {{convert|245|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Hemi-6'' and the {{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} V8. The CL's introduction had closely coincided with that of the strict [[Automobile emissions control|exhaust emission]] regulations contained in ADR 27A. With the 318 engine, a new emissions control system was introduced:  '''[[Lean burn#Chrysler Lean Burn computer|Electronic Lean Burn]]'''.

Transmission options were 3-speed manual with floor or column shift, four-speed manual with floor shift, and three-speed [[Torqueflite]] automatic with floor or column shift. The automatic was standard equipment with the 318 V8, and optional with a 6-cylinder. The 4-speed was optional for six- and eight-cylinder models. The floor-shift auto option was fitted to most Regals and all Regal SE's.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

In 1978 Chrysler released a limited edition run of 400 special '''Regal Le Baron''' models (option A17). The Le Baron was available only in Silver, with red or blue interiors. The 265 ''Hemi-6'' was standard, and the 318 V8 was optional.

Valiant and Regal sedans also benefited from the 1978 introduction of ''Radial Tuned Suspension'' in response to Holden's having marketed their suspension as particularly suited to radial tyres. RTS improved the car's handling and roadholding significantly, and "Modern Motor" magazine proclaimed that the Valiant offered a better drive than the Holden.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The last special option in the CL range was the $816 '''Drifter''' package, available on the Charger. The Drifter package included Impact Orange, Sundance Yellow, Spinnaker White or Harvest Gold body paint, and large side and rear stripes. Drifters in white had additional "strobe stripes" on the bootlid. Engine options were again the 265 six or 318 V8, but the 4-speed manual was the only transmission option. A [[Chrysler Drifter|Drifter Pack]] was also offered on the Valiant Panel Van and on the Utility.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Davis, Chrysler Valiant : the 1970s : from VH to CM, 1994, pages 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallery.oldholden.com/Jason1973/Car+Ads/Drifter02_20sm.jpg.html Drifter Pack options] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816234953/http://gallery.oldholden.com/Jason1973/Car+Ads/Drifter02_20sm.jpg.html |date=16 August 2011 }} Retrieved on 16 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

36,672 CL Valiants — including the last-ever Chargers — were built.

The CL was the last Valiant series assembled in New Zealand – by now the Chargers and Ranger were gone and the Regal and the Regal SE, replacing the 770, were the only models. The Regal SE was the first car to be assembled in the country with standard air conditioning.

===CM series===
{{main|Chrysler Valiant (CM)}}

[[File:Chrysler Valiant GLX (CM).JPG|thumb|CM Valiant GLX sedan]]
The CM was released in November 1978, and was little changed bodywise from the CL model. Only sedan and wagon models were produced.

A sports sedan called the GLX (option A16) was released as a replacement for the discontinued Charger and earlier the Pacer. Its features included a Charger grill and dashboard, special cloth trim, Cheviot Hotwire mag wheels and black door frames. It was advertised as the car "For People Who Like Their Cars Rare", as it was the last of the sports models and the jewel in the CM series.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The GLX could be optioned with a {{convert|265|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Hemi-6'' or {{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} V8.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The computer-controlled Electronic Lean Burn system continued giving favourable fuel economy; when ''Wheels'' performed an economy test in 1979, they found the ELB-equipped Valiant {{convert|245|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} used less fuel than a {{convert|2.0|L|cuin|abbr=on}} [[Ford Cortina]]. A Valiant achieved better than {{convert|30|mpgimp|L/100 km}} in the Total Oil Economy Run.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Production of this car continued after Mitsubishi's takeover of Chrysler's Australian operations. Mitsubishi could build the car profitably even in small numbers due to its high 97% level of local Australian content and amortised tooling. However, the car was still badged as the ''Chrysler'' Valiant, not as a Mitsubishi.&lt;ref name="Extra Lemon!"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Tony|title=Extra Lemon!|publisher=Bantam|year=2005|pages=116–119|isbn=1-86325-550-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The profit from the sale of one Valiant was equal to the profit from 3 Mitsubishi Sigmas- by this time the Company's main seller.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Valiant production ended in August 1981 with production of the CM reaching 16,005 units out of 565,338 units of all models.&lt;ref name="Extra Lemon!" /&gt; Full-sized Chryslers were not marketed again in Australia until the 2005 release of the [[Chrysler 300#300C|Chrysler 300C]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Motorsport==
Although the Charger is arguably the best remembered Valiant in Australian motorsport, earlier models achieved class wins at the annual "[[Bathurst 500]]" production car race, something that the Charger never did. A [[Chrysler Valiant (AP5)|Valiant AP5]] won Class D at the [[1963 Armstrong 500]], a VC Valiant V8 won Class D at the [[1966 Gallaher 500]] and a VG Valiant Pacer won Class D at the [[1970 Hardie-Ferodo 500]].
Chargers were raced in the Hardie-Ferodo 500 at Bathurst in 1971 and 1972 with factory support. They gained a best placing of third outright and second in class in 1972. Chrysler's policy was to race "Australian made" product, which meant the race cars ran {{convert|265|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} six-cylinder engines equipped with triple Weber [[carburettors]] and 3-speed [[Manual transmission|gearboxes]]. Even skilled driving and good engineering could not defeat Ford's legendary Falcon GTHO Phase III with its {{convert|351|cuin|L|abbr=on}} V8. In New Zealand, however, the Chryslers proved to be virtually unbeatable from 1971 to 1979 at the famous B&amp;H 500-mile (later 1000&amp;nbsp;km) series at [[Pukekohe]] Park Raceway. The most successful drivers were Leo Leonard and Jim Little, who still races his Valiants (mostly pre-65 class).{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The '''Chrysler Centura''' is a midsize car which was produced by [[Chrysler Australia]] between 1975 and 1978. It was based on [[Chrysler Europe]]'s [[Chrysler 180]] model, but was also available with larger Australian-made [[Chrysler Hemi-6 Engine|Hemi Six]] engines. 19,770 Centuras were built.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, 2010, page 413&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Engineers from Chrysler Australia and Simca considered modifying the body of a Chrysler 180 sedan and shortening the drive train so they could place the Australian 6-cylinder Hemi engines further back in the body but instead decided to lengthen the nose, as Chrysler Australia apparently felt this created a more aggressive and better-looking car. It also meant fewer changes were needed to "Australianise" the car, making it economical to assemble. Additional, largely cosmetic changes included a new grill, headlights, bonnet and rear panel and taillights.

A brake proportioning valve was fitted to all Centuras from factory to compensate for weight transfer during braking. When the car "nose-dived" under heavy braking, a mechanical link connected to the proportioning valve reduced the brake pressure on the rear wheels, to prevent them from locking up and causing the back of the car to slide around. This was typical of many European cars of the time but uncommon in Australian cars.

Chrysler also experimented with fitting a 5.2-litre (318 ci) American-made V8 but decided that the body lacked the rigidity to cope with the larger engine; the V8 version never went into production.

==KB Centura==

[[File:1976 Chrysler Centura (KB) GL sedan (20840059774).jpg|thumb|Chrysler Centura (KB) GL]]

The KB Centuras sold and assembled in Australia not only had a 1981&amp;nbsp;cc version of the four-cylinder [[Simca Type 180|Simca engine]] but were also available with Australian-made 6-cylinder [[Overhead valve|pushrod]] 3523/4014&amp;nbsp;cc [[Hemi engine|hemi]] engines and [[BorgWarner]] 3-speed automatic and 3- or 4-speed manual gearboxes. The four offered 122&amp;nbsp;hp ([[Horsepower#Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE]]), the sixes 142/167&amp;nbsp;hp (SAE) respectively.&lt;ref name=TAM78&gt;{{cite book | title = Speciale Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 77/78 | publisher = Editoriale Domus S.p.A | year = 1977 | page = 134 | location = Milano }}&lt;/ref&gt; The KB series was sold in XL and GL trims, the latter having more equipment, including tachometer, clock, low fuel light (rare for 1975), rear bumper overriders, console (no storage) and optional vinyl roofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zatz|first=David|title=Chrysler 180, 160, and 160GT, Simca 1501, and Chrysler 2 Litre; and the Chrysler Centura and Barreiros|url=http://www.allpar.com/cars/chrysler/180.html|work=www.allpar.com|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were no rear demister fitted, although a Smiths unit was fitted by some dealers. The KB model's European pedigree was obvious, with instrumentation in the opposite order and steering column controls on opposite sides. All KB GL spec cars came equipped with a tachometer, however it was optional on XL spec cars (whereas later KC cars only gained a tachometer through special order, or as part of the Sports option package) Interior flow ventilation was improved over the larger Valiant models, as the Centura had two face-level ventilation outlets. Although the A55 6 cylinder Centura Sports Package was fitted to some vehicles ( included body stripes, styled wheels, woodgrain instrument cluster with tachometer, clock and Boca Raton cloth trim), it was common to see dealer fitted options including the styled road wheel option, and stencilled side stripes and bonnet black outs. The sixes also came with larger brakes (60&amp;nbsp;mm ventilated front discs and 25.4&amp;nbsp;mm rear finned drums) and a tandem brake reservoir. The six-cylinder Hemi cars used a 5-stud wheel bolt pattern, and the early four-cylinder cars used a 4-stud wheel bolt pattern and only featured solid unventilated brake discs. Later four-cylinder cars shared the same brakes and stud pattern as the sixes, and thus the same wheels. All Centura models were factory fitted with rack-and-pinion steering, however there was no power steering option. Steering could be heavy, so correct tyre fitment and pressures were a must. Factory / dealer fitted air, with the unit located below the heater controls was available but seldom optioned. Very few Centura's left the dealership with e33 engine code although a few examples do exist.{{clarify|Is this the AC code?|date=February 2020}}

===Problems===
Early KB Centuras also experienced quality issues with interior fixtures, with door trims cracking, and torn vinyl trim near stitching lines not uncommon. A story going around is that no Centura models were fitted with starter motor relays, which simply put the load onto the ignition switch when cranking instead, which reduced the ignition switch life in some cars. The starter motor relay is attached to the firewall above the starter motor in all models. Traction in wet weather proved to be poor, with an open differential, relatively large six-cylinder Hemi engine and very light weight over the rear wheels.

The importation of the bodies from France into Australia was complicated in 1973 by industrial action, with dockside unions protesting against [[France and weapons of mass destruction|French Pacific island nuclear testing]]. The union bans lasted 2 years. There was a myth that many early KB bodies spent months on wharfs exposed to salt air, creating corrosion problems later in these cars' lives. This was not the case. The main problem this caused was to delay the car's initial release onto the market.

These vehicles are generally not rust-prone compared to contemporary vehicles of the time, however rust tends to occur in the usual places where moisture and mud tend to accumulate. Areas to check are below the windscreen on both sides of the car, the firewall where the heater is mounted, and the lower sills, especially behind the back wheels and below the front doors. The vinyl roof cover which was a popular and standard fitment on GL models (delete option only) was also a source of water entrapment, creating the possibility of rust in the "A" pillars and gutters. KC models were more prone to rusting than KB models. This can be attributed to the KC panels being made in Australia from different steel than the KB's imported panels.

In addition to the union bans on French imports, parts supply and local Chrysler support for used vehicles also became more complicated when in 1978, Chrysler Europe went bankrupt and was taken over by Peugeot. This Peugeot takeover was soon followed by several French Peugeot/Talbot factory strikes worsening the problems in sourcing parts in Australia. The mix of metric and imperial fasteners used on the 6-cylinder cars is not anything unusual as many contemporary cars such as [[Holden Commodore]]s had the same mix. The combination of French and Australian parts can make them challenging vehicles to maintain, however most wearing components are readily available from spare-parts suppliers. From the early 1980s parts became difficult to source, with existing stocks being used up and with the wait for French parts sometimes a long one. In the early 1990s Mitsubishi ceased supporting these vehicles with spare parts. Existing stocks of spare parts were auctioned off, and all stock which wasn't sold was disposed of.

===In the market===
Six-cylinder cars sold four-to-one in the Australian market over the four-cylinder cars. They had a reputation for providing reasonably decent handling, good torque and outstanding acceleration.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Sports options available on Centura models included dealer-fitted stenciled sports stripes (bonnet and sides), special 'Boca-Raton' striped cloth seats and styled steel or alloy wheels. Most of the interior and exterior dealer options from the larger Valiant models were applicable to the Centura, from the dealership.

The Centura's main competitors in Australia were four- and six-cylinder Australian-made versions of the Ford Cortina and General Motors' LH, LX and UC Holden Torana and Sunbird. The Centura had much more interior room and boot space than these main rivals, along with a more favorable power-to-weight ratio. Centuras were also seen to compete to a lesser extent with larger-bodied Australian Holdens, Chrysler Valiants (including the sporting Charger coupe) and Ford Falcons. Most competitors, although often lacking the fierce acceleration of the six-cylinder Centura,{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} proved less rust-prone and generally had more modern styling. In retrospect the rather compact Centura was not a typical 1970s medium-sized car. It wouldn't be until after the cancellation of the Centura, when Holden released the [[Holden Commodore#First generation|Commodore]] in October 1978, for the market to have a vehicle with similar internal dimensions to the Centura.

Chrysler Australia was being starved of funds by its troubled American parent at this time, leaving the larger Valiant sedans persisting with the same chassis platform and basic body shape and interior (Valiants did not have face-level flow-through vents, unlike those in the Centura) for many years. This created an old-fashioned image of the Australian Chrysler-Valiant brand that may have also adversely impacted Centura sales.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} The Chrysler 180 design was also rather dated by the time the cars arrived in the Australian market (later than intended), further adding to the old-fashioned image of the brand. The bigger Valiants were still popular with rural Australians, who seemed to prefer large, powerful American-style cars, but the Centura didn't have the size or style to meet the needs of that market, either.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==KC Centura==
[[File:Chrysler Centura (16769747057).jpg|thumb|left|Chrysler Centura (KC) GL]]
[[File:Chrysler Centura KC GL (16927664286).jpg|thumb|Chrysler Centura (KC) GL]]

The KC model (from June 1977 to the end of 1978) series dropped the 2.0 and 3.5 engines, but retained the 4.0-litre. The 4.0-litre comprised a low-compression (7.6:1) Hemi engine which ran on standard-grade fuel and aided fuel economy, and a high-compression two-barrel (9.0:1) version of the Hemi for greater performance and towing ability. The KC also featured greater Australian content, using VDO gauges, a Valiant-style steering wheel, steering column and various other parts from the larger Australian Valiant lineup. The KC was offered in GL or upscale GLX trims, along with the addition of sports package options.

KC models could be differentiated by the use of capitalised and [[serif]]ed typeface for the "Centura" badge (the KB had this in [[cursive]]) and a silver grille insert (KBs had a black grille with a silver border and highlights).

By 1979, the Centura had been replaced by the four-cylinder [[Chrysler Sigma]], of [[Mitsubishi]] origins.&lt;ref name=salon79/&gt;

==Centuras today==
Centuras are now very rare on Australian roads, although they appear more common in South Australia. This is probably due to an enduring loyalty to the Chrysler brand, as they had a manufacturing plant in that state before selling it to Mitsubishi in 1980. The [[France and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear ban's]] impact on production and parts supply, subsequent rust problems, extremely light weight over the rear of the car, and difficulty early in the cars' used sales life in getting parts from France were probably all factors that contributed to their relatively rapid disappearance from Australian roads.

The '''Chrysler Turbine Car''' is an [[automobile]] powered by a [[gas turbine|turbine engine]] which was produced by [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]] from 1963 to 1964. Its [[List of auto parts#Body and main part|body]] was made by the Italian design studio [[Carrozzeria Ghia|Ghia]], and Chrysler completed its assembly in [[Detroit]]. The [[Chrysler turbine engines|Chrysler turbine engine program]] that produced the Turbine Car began during the late 1930s, and created multiple prototypes that successfully completed numerous long-distance trips in the 1950s and early 1960s.

The A-831 engines that powered the Ghia-designed Turbine Car could operate on many different fuels, required less maintenance, and lasted longer than conventional piston engines, although they were much more expensive to produce. A total of 55 cars were built: five [[prototype]]s and a limited run of 50 cars for a public user program. The car's design was created by [[Elwood Engel]] and the Chrysler studios. A two-door [[hardtop]] [[coupé|coupe]], it featured [[power brakes]], [[power steering]], and a [[TorqueFlite]] transmission, and was coated with a metallic, [[root beer]]-colored paint known as "turbine bronze".

After testing, Chrysler conducted a user program from October 1963 to January 1966 that involved 203 individual drivers in 133 different cities across the United States cumulatively driving more than one million miles (1.6 million km). The program helped the company determine a variety of problems with the cars, notably with their complicated starting procedure, relatively unimpressive [[acceleration]], and sub-par [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] and noise level. The experience also revealed key advantages of the turbine engines, including their remarkable durability, smooth operation, and relatively modest maintenance requirements.

After the conclusion of the user program in 1966, Chrysler reclaimed all of the cars and destroyed all but nine of them; Chrysler kept two cars, five are displayed at museums in the United States, and two are in private collections. Chrysler's turbine engine program ultimately ended in 1979, largely due to the failure of the engines to meet government [[emission standard|emissions regulations]], relatively poor fuel economy, and as a prerequisite of receiving a government loan in 1979.

==Background==
Chrysler began researching [[gas turbine|turbine engines]] for aviation applications during the late 1930s, led primarily by executive engineer [[George Huebner]]. After World War II, Huebner was part of a group of engineers who began exploring the idea of powering a car with a turbine.{{sfn|Lehto|2010|pp=2–3}} Other members of the secretive Chrysler research team which worked on automotive turbines included fellow engineers [[Bud Mann]] and [[Sam B. Williams]].{{sfn|Lehto|2010|pp=4–7}} The concept intrigued them, largely because turbine engines have fewer moving parts than their [[reciprocating engine|piston-powered counterparts]] and can run on a variety of fuels.&lt;ref name="Lehto Road &amp; Track"&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a33239/that-time-the-president-of-mexico-rode-in-a-turbine-chrysler-fueled-by-tequila/ |title = That Time the President of Mexico Rode in a Turbine Chrysler Fueled by Tequila |last = Lehto |first = Steve |date = April 17, 2017 |work = [[Road &amp; Track]] |access-date = June 21, 2017 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170622181133/http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a33239/that-time-the-president-of-mexico-rode-in-a-turbine-chrysler-fueled-by-tequila/ |archive-date = June 22, 2017 |url-status = live |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Charles K.

The Chrysler Turbine Car is powered by the A-831, Chrysler's fourth-generation turbine engine. The most notable difference from its predecessor, the CR2A, was its use of twin regenerators (one mounted on either side of the [[gasifier]]) instead of a single top cover-mounted heat exchanger.{{sfn|Norbye|1975|p=283}} This design helped the A-831 trim {{convert|40|lbs|kg}} from the CR2A's weight,{{sfn|Norbye|1975|p=284}} reducing it to a relatively-light {{convert|410|lbs|0|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Lehto|2010|p=31}} Huebner described the turbine as similar to a [[jet engine]], noting that it had only one [[spark plug]] and about 80 percent fewer parts than a typical automotive piston engine.&lt;ref name="TucsonPreview"/&gt; Due to their construction, the engines did not require [[antifreeze]], a cooling system, a [[radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]], [[connecting rod]]s, or [[crankshaft]]s.&lt;ref name="Turbine Cars Due in 1963"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedlander"&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/29/archives/gas-turbines-present-and-future-father-of-the-turbine-sluggish-and.html |title = Gas Turbines: Present and Future |last = Friedlander |first = Paul J.

==Design==
The Turbine Car was designed in the Chrysler studios under the direction of [[Elwood Engel]], who had worked for the [[Ford Motor Company]] before moving to Chrysler.{{sfn|Hyde|2003|p=204}}{{sfn|Lehto|2010|pp=22, 40}} Due to its resemblance to the Engel-designed [[Ford Thunderbird]], the car is occasionally called the "Englebird".{{sfn|Hyde|2003|p=204}}{{sfn|Norbye|1975|p=293}}{{sfn|Lehto|2010|pp=22, 40–41}} According to Huebner, the design was intended to compete with the [[Chevrolet Corvette]] in addition to the Thunderbird.&lt;ref name="Olmsted Public Sees Turbine Cars"/&gt;

The car's bodies were handmade by Italian design studio [[Carrozzeria Ghia|Ghia]], which had built a number of [[concept car]]s for Chrysler (including an [[Chrysler Imperial|Imperial]] limousine and the [[Chrysler Norseman|Norseman]]).{{sfn|Lehto|2010|p=41}}&lt;ref name="Hayes"/&gt; The mostly completed Turbine Car bodies, which were assembled, painted, trimmed, and upholstered by Ghia in Italy, were shipped to Chrysler's Greenfield Road turbine facility in Detroit for final assembly; this consisted of installing the turbine engines, [[TorqueFlite]] transmissions, electrical wiring, and components such as [[vehicle audio|radios]] and heaters.{{sfn|Lehto|2010|pp=42, 111}} Building an individual car may have cost as much as between $50,000 to $55,000 ({{Inflation|US|50,000|1964|fmt=eq|r=-3}} to {{Inflation|US|55,000|1964|fmt=eq|r=-3}});{{sfn|Lehto|2010|pp=44–45, 124}} Virgil Exner, Jr., estimates that the bodies themselves cost about $20,000 ({{Inflation|US|20,000|1964|fmt=eq|r=-3}}), although Chrysler never revealed the cost of each turbine engine.{{sfn|Lehto|2010|pp=44–45}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}

The first five cars were completed in early 1962 as [[prototype]]s used for troubleshooting; each was slightly different from the others, varying in exterior color, interior upholstery, and roof material.{{sfn|Lehto|2010|p=42}} Early problems discovered from the prototypes included sluggish acceleration (attributed in part to the relatively heavy hand-built bodies) and vibration, ultimately determined to be caused by the tire treads and noticeable due to the unusual smoothness of the turbine engine.{{sfn|Lehto|2010|pp=43–44}}

Forty-five of the cars were burned and crushed at a [[Wrecking yard|scrapyard]] south of Detroit, and the other was destroyed at Chrysler's Chelsea Proving Grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13418404/fred_olmsted_world_of_wheels/|title=Chrysler Corp. will chop|last=Olmsted|first=Fred|date=April 15, 1966|work=Detroit Free Press|access-date=August 29, 2017|via=Newspapers.com {{open access}}|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830103923/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13418404/fred_olmsted_world_of_wheels/|archivedate=August 30, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lehto|2010|p=122}} A widely circulated explanation was that the cars were destroyed to avoid a substantial tariff on the imported Ghia bodies, although author Steve Lehto claims that this has been "largely discredited."{{sfn|Lehto|2010|p=121}} The destruction of the cars was in line with the automobile industry's practice of not selling non-production or prototype cars to the public. According to Lehto, the decision was influenced by Chrysler's [[public relations]] concerns: the potential difficulty of keeping the cars running and fears that owners would replace the turbine powerplants with piston engines.{{sfn|Lehto|2010|p=121}} A Chrysler executive was quoted in ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'': "Our main objective is research, and we did not want turbines turning up on used-car lots."{{sfn|Lehto|2010|p=121}} A similar practice was later used by General Motors with its [[General Motors EV1|EV1]] when it terminated the program and destroyed most of the cars in 2003.{{sfn|Lehto|2010|p=169}}

Chrysler's development of turbine engines continued from the late 1960s into the 1970s, resulting in the creation of fifth- and sixth-generation engines. The turbines ultimately failed to meet government [[emission standard|emissions regulations]] and had relatively poor [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]], despite promising early results and a $6.4 million contract from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]].&lt;ref name="Friedlander"/&gt;{{sfn|Hyde|2003|p=206}}&lt;ref name="Norbye and Dunne September 1973"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last = Norbye |first = Jan P. |last2 = Dunne |first2 = Jim |date = September 1973 |title = For the Gas Turbine Car, It's Now or Never |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=scA6lVmzQA8C&amp;pg=PA56 |journal = [[Popular Science]] |pages = 56–59 |via = Google Books |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180206115852/https://books.google.com/books?id=scA6lVmzQA8C&amp;pg=PA56 |archivedate = February 6, 2018 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Charles K.

The '''Chrysler 200C''' is a [[plug-in hybrid]] [[electric car|electric]] [[concept car]] built by the U.S. automaker [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]].

==Overview==
The vehicle was based on the shortened [[Chrysler LX platform]].

The [[rear-wheel-drive]] [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]] includes gasoline engine rated {{convert|268|bhp|abbr=on}} and a {{convert|74|bhp|abbr=on}} lithium ion battery rated {{Convert|400|mi|km|abbr=}} ({{Convert|40|mi|km|abbr=}} in battery only mode), P245/45R20 front and P245/45R20 tires. The car has {{convert|0|-|100|km/h|abbr=on}} acceleration of approximately 7 seconds, with top speed of over {{convert|120|mph|abbr=on}}.

The interior incorporates uConnect features controlled via a panoramic multimedia touch screen. It includes a "teen mode" which warns of erratic driving or going out of a specified range, and limits the maximum speed.

The vehicle was unveiled in 2009 [[North American International Auto Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramsey |first=Jonathon |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/01/11/detroit-2009-chrysler-200c-concept-what-the-sebring-should-hav/ |title=PRESS RELEASE, Chrysler 200C EV Concept: Contemporary design, Range-extended Electric Vehicle drive system and platform for future connectivity |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=2009-01-11 |accessdate=2010-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The exterior design was led by Nick Malachowski. The interior was designed by Chrysler LLC's Advance Interior Design Studio, led by Ryan Patrick Joyce. The vehicle flooring was inspired by a Zen rock garden.

The '''Chrysler Cordoba''' was an intermediate [[personal luxury car|personal luxury]] coupe sold by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] in North America from 1975 to 1983. It was the company's first model produced specifically for the personal luxury market and the first Chrysler-branded vehicle that was smaller than full-size.

==History==
In the early 1960s, when other upmarket brands were expanding into smaller cars with such models as the [[Mercury Comet]] and [[Buick Skylark#1961–1963|Buick Skylark]], Chrysler very publicly declared that there would "never" be a smaller Chrysler. Indeed, the 1963 Chrysler deluxe catalog says of the New Yorker, "This is no jr. edition car."  The 1962 deluxe catalog goes even further, proclaiming on the rear cover: "there's not a jr. edition in the whole family!".

The Cordoba name was used in the spring of 1970 as a specially trimmed individual model based on the [[Chrysler Newport#1969–1973|Chrysler Newport]] [[hardtop]] (two-door and four-door).&lt;ref name=70cordoba&gt;{{cite journal|title=The new Chrysler Cordoba (advertisement) |journal=Ebony |pages=84–85 |date=April 1970 |volume=25 |issue=6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k0SaFPIrCVkC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=Chrysler+Cordoba+collector+car |accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[full-size car|full-size]] model was a "limited edition luxury car, designed to introduce you to Chrysler" and consisted of an exclusive "Cordoba Gold" paint with matching wheels, [[Hubcap|wheel covers]], and side molding with vinyl inserts.&lt;ref name=70cordoba/&gt; Chrysler described this model's textured antique gold all-vinyl interior, matching [[vinyl roof]] cover, and the [[hood ornament]] with an [[Aztec]] eagle as "quiet Spanish motif".&lt;ref name= 70cordoba/&gt; Included in the $4,241.65 price was the {{convert|383|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|290|bhp|abbr=on}} two-barrel [[carburetor]] [[V8 engine]], [[automatic transmission]], power steering, H78x15 fiberglass-belted [[whitewall tire]]s, and a "golden tone" [[AM broadcasting|AM]] radio.&lt;ref name=70cordoba/&gt;

Originally designed by Chrysler to be the all new Plymouth Sebring for 1975 which was to share bodies with the Dodge Charger SE, a decision was made to introduce this car as the first small Chrysler. The smaller Cordoba was introduced as a contender in the personal luxury market that was powered by smaller, more economical engines than other Chryslers, and riding on a {{convert|115|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} [[wheelbase]], {{convert|9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} less than the traditional models at the time.&lt;ref name=hyde&gt;{{cite book|last=Hyde |first=Charles K. |title=Riding the Roller Coaster: A History of the Chrysler Corporation |publisher=Wayne State University Press |year=2003 |page=223 |isbn=978-0-8143-3091-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQhTq18vi7AC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=Chrysler+Cordoba+history| accessdate=22 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This single body style coupe was one of Chrysler's few genuine hits of the 1970s. At a time when the automaker was [[History of Chrysler#The 1970s|teetering on bankruptcy]], demand for Cordobas actually exceeded supply for its first couple of years, with production of over 150,000 units for the inaugural 1975 models, and the most built in 1977, with 183,000 units.&lt;ref name=hyde/&gt; Half of Chrysler division production during this period (and occasionally more) was composed of Cordobas, and they helped to revive the division.&lt;ref name=hyde/&gt; All Cordobas were built in [[Windsor, Ontario]].

Although [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] is the name of a city in [[Spain]], the car's emblem was actually a stylized version of the [[Argentine real#Coins|Argentine cordoba coin]]. Either way, the implication was Hispanic, and this theme was carried out with somewhat baroque trim inside the vehicle.  Although the first spokesperson for the car was [[Richard Basehart]],  Chrysler famously secured  movie and television actor [[Ricardo Montalbán]] as the car's advertising spokesman through its entire run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Novas |first=Himilce| title=Everything you need to know about Latino history: 2008 edition |year=2008 |publisher=Penguin Group|isbn=978-0-452-28889-8 |pages=330–33 1|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zZhjWwXS2X8C&amp;pg=PA331&amp;dq=Montalban+Chrysler+Cordoba+history |accessdate=22 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable was his eloquent praise of its "rich &lt;!--do not change "rich" to another adjective; see the linked commercial where he clearly says "rich"; see discussion on Talk Page before making changes--&gt;[[Corinthian leather]]" &lt;ref&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7ylbDGbR0Q &lt;/ref&gt; interior&lt;ref name="'70s"&gt;{{cite book|title=How We Got Here : The 70's--The Decade that Brought You Modern Life--For Better or Worse|last=Frum|first=David|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-04195-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/25 25]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Cordoba was introduced by Chrysler for the 1975 model year as an upscale personal luxury car, competing with the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]], [[Buick Regal]], and [[Mercury Cougar#Third generation (1974–1976)|Mercury Cougar]]. The Cordoba was originally intended to be a Plymouth—the names [[Dodge Mirada|Mirada]], [[Eagle Premier|Premier]], [[Chrysler Sebring|Sebring]], and Grand Era were associated with the project; all except Grand Era would be used on later Chrysler, Dodge, and Eagle vehicles, though only the [[Dodge Mirada]] would be related to the Cordoba. However, losses from the newly introduced full-size C-body models due to the [[1973 oil crisis]] encouraged Chrysler executives to seek higher profits by marketing the model under the more upscale Chrysler brand. 

The car was a success, with over 150,000 examples sold in 1975, a sales year that was otherwise dismal for the company. Gauges, except the tachometer, were standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1976_Chrysler/1976_Chrysler_Owners_Manual/1976%20Chrysler%20Manual-15.html |page=15 |title=1976 Chrysler Owners Manual |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 1976 model year, sales increased slightly to 165,000. The mildly revised 1977 version also sold well, with just under 140,000 cars. The success of using the Chrysler nameplate strategy is contrasted to sales of its similar and somewhat cheaper corporate cousin, the [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Dodge Charger]] SE.{{cn|date=October 2017}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/cars/dodge/charger/sales.html|website=applar.com|title=Dodge Charger Sales and Production|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interiors were more luxurious than the Dodge Charger SE and much more than the top-line standard intermediates (Plymouth Fury, Dodge Coronet) with a velour cloth notchback bench seat and folding armrest standard. Optionally available were bucket seats upholstered in [[Corinthian leather]] with a center armrest and cushion, or at extra cost, a center console with floor shifter and storage compartment. The dashboard and door panels featured simulated burled elm trim and metal stampings in 1975, while 1976–1979 models featured simulated rosewood trim. A 60/40 bench seat was introduced in 1976 and other seating/upholstery options were added each year through 1979.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

The original design endured with only small changes for three years before a variety of factors contributed to a decline in sales. For 1978, there was a modest restyling with the then popular rectangular headlights in a stacked configuration (the Dodge Charger SE kept its round headlamps for 1978 rather than rectangular stacked of the Cordoba). A Chrysler designer, Jeffrey Godshall, wrote in ''Collectible Automobile'' magazine that this restyling was viewed as "somewhat tacky" and eliminated much of the visual appeal that the 1975 to 1977 Cordobas had been known for. The restyle also made the car appear heavier than its 1975–1977 predecessor at a time when other cars in this class were being downsized to smaller dimensions such as the Ford Thunderbird in 1977 and Chevy Monte Carlo and Pontiac Grand Prix in 1978.

The Cordoba's sales decline in 1978 and 1979 could also be attributed to the introduction of the smaller [[Chrysler LeBaron#1977–1981|Chrysler LeBaron]] in mid-1977 that was available in both sedan and coupe models, and offered similar personal-luxury styling and options. At the same time, Chrysler's financial position and quality reputation was in steady decline. Rising gas prices and tightening fuel economy standards made the Cordoba's nearly {{convert|3700|lb|kg|abbr=on}} weight with {{convert|360|CID|L|abbr=on}} or {{convert|400|CID|L|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine]]s obsolete. For 1979 a $2,040 "300" option package was offered on the Cordoba, featuring an all-white exterior, "[[Chrysler 300 non-letter series|Chrysler 300]]"-style grille and a four-barrel 360 V-8 engine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1979-1982-chrysler-cordoba-300-cordoba-ls.htm 1979-1982 Chrysler Cordoba 300/Cordoba LS, auto.howstuffworks.com] Retrieved 4 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cordoba was downsized for the 1980 model year. The smaller, second-generation model used the [[Chrysler J platform|J-platform]] dating to the 1976 F-body [[Plymouth Volaré]], along with its [[badge engineering|rebadged]] variant, the [[Dodge Mirada]]. Chrysler also revived the [[Imperial (automobile)#1981–1983|Imperial]] for 1981 as a third variant of the J-platform.

The Cordoba and Mirada now had a standard [[Straight-6|six-cylinder]] engine (the [[Chrysler Slant 6 engine|225 Slant Six]]) that, while very reliable, did not seem to be suitable power (95&amp;nbsp;hp) for these slightly upmarket coupes. The much-detuned {{convert|318|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} 120&amp;nbsp;hp V8 was an option (standard on the Imperial, with EFI), as was the performance oriented code E58 {{convert|360|CID|L|abbr=on}} 185&amp;nbsp;hp V8, though it would be dropped off the option list for 1981 and on.&lt;ref name=moparautos1980&gt;{{cite web |url=http://moparautos.com/cordoba78-80.htm |title=1978-1980 Chrysler Cordoba |publisher=Moparautos.com |accessdate=22 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316135154/http://moparautos.com/cordoba78-80.htm |archivedate=16 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:'80-'81 Chrysler Cordoba LS (Orange Julep).jpg|thumb|left|1981 Chrysler Cordoba LS]]
The 1980 and 1981 '''LS''' model (which was originally intended to be the "300") featured an aerodynamic-appearing nosecone (nearly identical to that on the ''Mirada'') with a "crosshair" grille. Other features of this model were the deletion of the [[vinyl roof]] cover and a monotone color exterior.

The second-generation Cordoba's styling did not attract the praise of the original, and sales were off substantially. The industry downsizing of vehicles also affected the personal luxury models. Both the [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] in 1978 and the 1980 [[Ford Thunderbird]] shrank in size and sales simultaneously. However, those models eventually recovered as their makers moved to correct their cars' flaws, while the smaller Cordoba never did. Chrysler was increasingly concentrating on its [[compact car|compact]], [[front wheel drive]] models with four and six-cylinder engines, and management stopped producing the Cordoba in 1983.

===Powertrains===
With fewer than 100 cars equipped with the E58 {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} 185&amp;nbsp;hp V8, the engine option was discontinued after the 1980 model year due to low demand.&lt;ref name=moparautos1980 /&gt; Only two engines were available with the Slant-6 being standard and the {{convert|318|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 optional for the 1981–1983 model years.

==NASCAR==
Both the first generation and second generation Cordobas made appearances in [[NASCAR]]. Ed Negre campaigned one occasionally in 1979–1980 seasons, and [[Buddy Arrington]] ran a second generation car in the 1982–1984 seasons, alternating with [[Dodge Mirada]]s and [[Imperial (automobile)|Chrysler Imperials]]. The Cordoba was no more aerodynamic than the other Mopars and never finished higher than 15th in any race entered.

==Collectibility==
Today the "'Doba", as it is known to its fans, maintains a fairly loyal owner base and some models are considered collectible. The very early production 1975s, particularly with the optional four-barrel carburetor, and the rare Cordoba-based 300 of 1979 are the most valuable. The second generation Cordoba has attracted little interest in the collector market so far. 

Regarding the 300 version, ''Consumer Guide'' said in 2007 "the '79 could become a minor collectible in the distant future, but LS prospects seem slim to non-existent at this time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1979-1982 Chrysler Cordoba 300/Cordoba LS |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1979-1982-chrysler-cordoba-300-cordoba-ls.htm |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |date=16 July 2007 |accessdate=22 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chrysler VIP''' is an automobile which was produced by [[Chrysler Australia]] from 1969 to 1971. It is an extended wheelbase, luxury variant of the [[Australia]]n developed [[Chrysler Valiant]].

==Chrysler VE Valiant V.I.P.==
Prior to the introduction of the Chrysler VIP, [[Chrysler Australia]] had used the VIP name on the Chrysler Valiant V.I.P.,&lt;ref name=Tuckey56&gt;Elisabeth Tuckey and Stewart Wilson, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, page 56&lt;/ref&gt; introduced in 1967 as the top model in its [[Chrysler Valiant (VE)|Valiant VE Series range]].&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Tuckey and Stewart Wilson, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, page 47&lt;/ref&gt; The Valiant V.I.P. was offered in both 4 door sedan and Safari station wagon body styles and was fitted with a {{convert|273|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine]].&lt;ref name=Tuckey56/&gt; The VE Valiant V.I.P. replaced the outgoing top of the range [[Chrysler Valiant (VC)|VC Valiant V8]], however with the V8 engine now optional across the VE model range and no longer reserved for the top specification, the change of name was instigated. VE VIP sedans and wagons used the same three horizontal chrome stripes on the rear guards as the VC Valiant V8 sedan

Power disc brakes and power assisted steering were standard equipment on both body styles of the VE VIP. Additionally the Safari station wagon received an electrically operated tailgate window.

==Chrysler VF VIP==
[[File:1969 Chrysler VF VIP.jpg|thumb|left|Chrysler VF VIP]]
The VF series Chrysler VIP was introduced in May 1969 and was marketed as the “VIP by Chrysler”,&lt;ref name=Davis108&gt;Tony Davis, Aussie Cars, 1987, page 108&lt;/ref&gt; without the Valiant name. It was intended to fill a gap in [[Chrysler Australia]]’s lineup between the [[Chrysler Valiant]] and the [[Dodge Phoenix]] and it would compete directly against two other Australian designed luxury vehicles, the [[Ford Fairlane (Australia)|Ford Fairlane]] and the [[Holden Brougham]].&lt;ref name=Davis108 /&gt; Although based on the [[Chrysler VF Valiant|VF series Chrysler Valiant]], the VIP had a wheelbase which was 100mm longer at 2850mm.&lt;ref name=UniqueVF&gt;[http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_chrysler_valiant_vf.htm Chrysler Valiant VF] Retrieved from www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au on 14 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It was also bigger, more expensive and more luxurious than the older model.&lt;ref name=Davis108 /&gt; Visual differences when compared to the VF Valiant sedan included four headlights rather than two, different rear lights, a unique rear window and a heavily padded vinyl roof.&lt;ref name=Davis108/&gt; Unlike its predecessor, the VF VIP was available only as a 4 door sedan.&lt;ref name=UniqueVF/&gt;

The VIP was offered with the buyer's choice of a {{convert|225|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine|Slant-6]] or a {{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} “Fireball” [[Chrysler LA engine|LA-series V8]] engine. Chrysler's [[Torqueflite]] 3-speed automatic transmission was standard equipment with either engine.&lt;ref name=UniqueVF /&gt; Coaxial power steering and front disc brakes were optional with the six and standard with the V8.&lt;ref name=UniqueVF/&gt;  
{{-}}

==Chrysler VG VIP==
[[File:Chrysler VG VIP.jpg|thumb|left|Chrysler VG VIP]]
A facelifted VG series Chrysler VIP was introduced in 1970, replacing the VF model.&lt;ref name=UniqueVG&gt;[http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_chrysler_valiant_vg.htm Chrysler Valiant VG] Retrieved from www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au on 14 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A {{convert|245|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler Hemi-6 Engine|Hemi-6]] replaced the {{convert|225|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Slant-6 and the {{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} “Fireball” V8 remained an option.&lt;ref name=Davis112&gt;Tony Davis, Aussie Cars, 1987, page 112&lt;/ref&gt; The VG VIP was the first Australian made car to be fitted with [[air conditioning]] as standard equipment.&lt;ref name=Davis112/&gt;
{{-}}

==Replacement==
The VG series Chrysler VIP was replaced by the [[Chrysler by Chrysler]] in November 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_chrysler_by_chrysler_ch.htm Chrysler by Chrysler CH] Retrieved from www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au on 14 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chrysler Sebring''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|iː|b|r|ɪ|ŋ}} {{respell|SEE|bring}}) is a line of [[mid-size car|mid-size]] [[automobiles]] that was sold from 1995 through 2010 by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]]. Three generations of convertibles, two generations of sedans, and two generations of coupes were produced. Although the coupe shared the same name and some styling cues, it was mechanically unrelated to the other Sebring models.

The Sebring line was introduced in 1995 with the Chrysler Sebring coupe. It was the replacement for the [[Chrysler Lebaron#1987.E2.80.931995 coup.C3.A9.2Fconvertible|Chrysler LeBaron coupe]]. In 1996 the convertible was introduced, replacing its [[Chrysler Lebaron#1987.E2.80.931995 coup.C3.A9.2Fconvertible|LeBaron counterpart]] as well. For 2001, both body styles were redesigned and a sedan version was offered, replacing the [[Chrysler Cirrus]]. The coupe was discontinued after 2005 with no replacement model planned.

The redesigned sedan was introduced for 2007, and a convertible the following year. New options included all-wheel drive on sedans and a hardtop for the convertible. All Sebring models were replaced by the [[Chrysler 200]] for the 2011 model year.

The Chrysler Sebring was introduced as a [[coupe]] for 1995, and as a convertible in 1996, both models replacing the [[Chrysler LeBaron]] convertible and coupe. The convertible was built off the [[Chrysler JA platform]] also used for the [[Chrysler Cirrus|Cirrus]] sedan, while the coupe was based on the [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]]. The Chrysler Sebring was named after [[Sebring, Florida]], the site of the renowned endurance car race called the ''[[12 Hours of Sebring]]''. The name was first used by Chrysler Corporation's [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] division trim line of the [[Plymouth Satellite|Satellite]] [[mid-size]] [[coupe]] of the 1970s.

===Coupe (1995–2000)===

[[File:1995-1996 Chrysler Sebring LX coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1997–2000 Chrysler Sebring coupe]]

The 1995 through 2000 '''Chrysler Sebring''' [[coupe]] was the successor to the [[Chrysler LeBaron]] coupe.

The first generation Sebring coupe was introduced in April 1995, several months after the related [[Dodge Avenger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allpar.com/model/sebring.html "The First Generation Chrysler Sebring and Dodge Avenger coupes" Information courtesy of Chrysler, allpar], retrieved on 2012–07–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its similarities to the Avenger, the Chrysler's suspension was tuned slightly on the softer side compared to Dodge's stiff suspension. Although the Sebring did not really offer true "off-the-line" muscle, it did handle well over long, curvy roads, offering minimal body roll. LXi models further benefited from rear sway bars, a slightly different tuned fully independent suspension, along with 17-inch wheels wrapped with Goodyear Eagle performance tires. Recorded slalom speeds proved to be impressive for a car of its class, and were a result of Sebring's 4-wheel double wishbone suspension and variable speed rack and pinion steering; both of which were key contributors to the car's road manners.

The coupe version of the Sebring had seating for five and was considered to be one of the larger, more roomy coupes on the market. Trunk capacity was similar to that of many mid-size cars, capable of handling more than one  set of golf clubs. At the time of its introduction, the Sebring sported a crosshair grille, reminiscent of the original [[Chrysler 300 letter series]]. The grille was non-functional, with the lower half under the bumper used for air flow intake in a "[[bottom breather]]" function.

Although said to be built on a stretched [[Eagle Talon]] platform (which is not entirely untrue), it is more accurate to say that their platform was based on the four-door [[Mitsubishi Galant]] platform.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} However, these cars do share a great deal with their Talon sibling, including much of their dash and instrument panel along with select suspension and steering components.

[[File:1997-2000 Chrysler Sebring LXi coupe -- 03-21-2012 2.JPG|thumb|left|1997–2000 Chrysler Sebring coupe]]

The Sebring underwent a minor facelift for 1997. Its grille was replaced with a slightly larger black grid. The facelift also made the Sebring the first car to use Chrysler's "wings" logo. The 1997 restyle also saw the addition of ribbed lower body cladding and new wheel styles. Features offered on Sebring coupes included 4-wheel disc brakes with ABS, adaptive automatic transmissions and fully independent suspensions, along with a host of power operated features. Sebring also offered variable speed rack and pinion steering, 17&amp;nbsp;inch aluminum wheels with GoodYear Eagle tires, 4-wheel double wishbone suspension, one-touch power windows, one-touch moonroof, electrochromic mirror with compass, power accessory delay ignition (which allowed occupants to operate power window switches when ignition is turned off), and Homelink universal transmitter, among other options.

Sebring coupe received a 5-star frontal safety rating, the highest rating possible.

First generation bodystyle coupes continued to be sold past the 2000 model year to select export markets.

[[File:Chrysler Sebring Convertible rear 20081218.jpg|thumb|left|Chrysler Sebring convertible]]

The Sebring convertible was launched in 1996 alongside the Sebring coupe, replacing the LeBaron convertible. The convertible didn't share any sheetmetal with the coupe and was instead based on the [[Chrysler Cirrus]] sedan. Consequently, both the Cirrus and Sebring convertible were sold in Europe as the Stratus. All Stratus convertibles were sourced from Mexico. The Chrysler Stratus convertible was actually available in Mexico, but the sedan version was not. The Sebring convertible was sold alongside with the Chrysler Stratus convertible in Mexico. In Mexico, a rare turbocharged 2.4 L DOHC I4 engine was optional.

The Sebring name was then used on three different cars for 2001: the coupe was based on the [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]], while the [[sedan (car)|sedan]] and [[convertible (car)|convertible]] were [[Chrysler JR platform]] successors to the [[Chrysler Cirrus]]. The 2004 Chrysler Sebring had received minor tweaks to its front-end: a redesigned grille, re-worked headlights, and a Chrysler winged emblem placed in the center on the rear deck; furthermore, after the 2004 Chrysler Sebring sedan had seen a mild cycle refresh, the company discontinued the Chrysler Sebring coupe after model year 2005. And outside of the United States, and Canada, over into Mexico, the Sebring was sold as the '''Chrysler Cirrus'''. Exclusive for the Cirrus was the availability of Chrysler's turbocharged 2.4 L DOHC engine. The Cirrus available as a sedan, and convertible body-styles.  Models with this engine are identified with a "High Output" badge on the back of the vehicle. Also unique to the Cirrus was the number of trim levels; the sedan was offered in two while the convertible was only offered in one.  All were equipped with an automatic transmission.

The [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] gives the 2001–2006 Sebring an ''Acceptable'' overall rating in frontal crash tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=30 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Dodge Stratus |publisher=Iihs.org |date=2006-03-29 |accessdate=2009-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the side impact test, a ''Poor'' overall rating was given to models without side airbags.  The IIHS did not test the Sebring with side airbags since Chrysler declined another test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=281 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Dodge Stratus |publisher=Iihs.org |date=2006-03-03 |accessdate=2009-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2001, the Sebring Convertible was redesigned. It now closely resembled the [[sedan (car)|sedan]], though it still differed greatly from it and the coupe. The front fascia and most of the interior were the only features that these cars had in common. Many interior and exterior components were carried over from the first-generation car, though the body shell underneath is significantly different. The Sebring received minor styling revisions (mostly the appearance of the nose) for the 2004 [[model year]].

===Coupe===
[[File:04-05 Chrysler Sebring coupe.jpg|thumb|left|2003–2005 Chrysler Sebring coupe]]
A redesigned Sebring Coupe was introduced for the 2001 model year, based on the third generation Mitsubishi Eclipse. Like the previous generation, the coupe shared very little in common with the sedan or the convertible, other than the name and a few exterior styling cues to help market all three vehicles together as one model.

The Sebring Coupe received a minor facelift for 2003, and was discontinued after the 2005 model-year. The redesigned 2008 Chrysler Sebring convertible was considered the replacement for the Sebring coupe.

===European versions===
[[File:Chrysler Sebring LX (JR) – Frontansicht, 12. Juli 2014, Düsseldorf.jpg|thumb|left|Chrysler Sebring 2.7 LX sedan (European model)]]
[[File:Chrysler Sebring LX (JR) – Heckansicht, 12. Juli 2014, Düsseldorf.jpg|thumb|left|Chrysler Sebring 2.7 LX sedan (European model)]]

Chrysler also manufactured export versions of the 2001-2006 Sebring sedan and convertible for the mainland European market. Front and rear lights are to European standards, different from the USA &amp; Canada in that turn-signal indicators are orange, with additional side-turn repeaters on the front fenders. The rear bumper has a larger recess for the longer European-size license plates, and two rear fog-lamps are fitted; one on each side of the license plate. The LHD headlamps incorporate Euro-type H4 bulbs, together with three-way up and down beam-level adjustment via a dash-mounted switch to the left of the steering wheel. Emissions controls are to the EURO 3 standard; later versions are compliant with EURO 4. Engine ranges offered were the 2.0&amp;nbsp;L DOHC 16V inline 4-cylinder (later replaced by the 2.4L unit in some countries), and the 2.7&amp;nbsp;L DOHC 24V 6-cylinder unit. The 2.0 and 2.4L engines are available with the 5-speed manual or four-speed 41TE auto transmission (depending on country); the six-cylinder engine is automatic only.

The Canadian-market 240&amp;nbsp;km/h-160&amp;nbsp;mph speedometer (with km/h predominant) is fitted to the European models. Odometer and tripmeter are in kilometres. As the 2001-2006 Sebring sedan and convertible were made in left-hand drive only, they were not sold in the UK and Ireland. Chrysler UK did however, import 50 convertibles with the 2.7L engine in 2001/2002, and these were sold though selected dealers. Being non-standard in Chrysler's UK range at the time though, no more were imported.

Trim levels offered in Europe were LE (equivalent to North American market LX) and LX (equivalent to North American market LXi). From 2004, ''Touring'' and ''Limited'' versions started to replace the LE and LX designations respectively.

Lack of a diesel engine and right-hand drive availability prevented this Sebring from being a true pan-European model unlike other Chryslers such as the Chrysler 300M, PT Cruiser and Voyager. In addition, the model was dropped from Chrysler's lineup in some countries, notably France, before production ended in 2006. In France, the three domestic car-makers PSA-Peugeot, Citroen and Renault dominate the new car market, which meant very low sales of the Sebring there. As a result, the sedan was only imported by Chrysler France in 2001 and 2002. The 2003 and facelifted 2004–2006 year models were not. The convertible was only sold until 2004. The 2005 and 2006 models were likewise not imported.

Despite not being available in the UK and Ireland, some Sebring convertibles have been bought in from the U.S. as grey-imports. Some Euro-spec models have also been privately imported, mostly from Germany. The European versions are easier to re-register in the UK as they have EU-type approval. The dual km/h-mph speedo-display and twin rear foglights mean only headlamp beam-aim adjustment for left-hand traffic is necessary. The sedan is much rarer in the UK though; a few EU models have been imported, but most are likely to be North American 'grey-imports'.

In 2006, the license, tooling and assembly line for the second-generation Chrysler Sebring/Dodge Stratus sedan was sold to Russian firm [[GAZ]] for about [[USD|US$]]151 million (€ 124 million). After some minor modifications the vehicle was renamed the [[Volga Siber]]. It went into production in March 2008 at the [[Gorky Automobile Plant]] in [[Nizhny Novgorod]], Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |script-title=ru:В названии новой модели "ГАЗа" сохранится слово "Волга" |language=Russian |publisher=[[Lenta.Ru|auto.lenta.ru]] |date=2008-05-15 |url=http://auto.lenta.ru/news/2008/05/15/volga |accessdate=2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the [[Great Recession]] sales were not as expected and production ended in 2010 after 9,000 examples were built.

The Sebring was replaced with a new model based on the [[Mitsubishi GS platform|JS platform]] for the 2007 model year. The third-generation Sebring was assembled in [[Sterling Heights, Michigan]], containing over 82% of parts sourced in North America. Since no 2007 convertible was offered, the 2006 Sebring convertible was left to fill the void, remaining in showrooms and on the company's website until the 2008 model's release. The third-generation Sebring borrowed many styling cues from the 2003 [[Chrysler Airflite]] [[concept car|concept]]. It also has several Chrysler-signature styling cues, several of which were borrowed from the [[Chrysler Crossfire]]. The Sebring sedan and convertible were also sold in right-hand drive through Chrysler's UK and Ireland dealer network.

The IIHS gave the 2010 Models a G for good in the frontal crash test, the side impact test, and the roof strength test, giving the 2010 Sebring a ''Top Safety Pick''.

[[File:Chrysler Sebring convertible (third generation - JS) top down white 2of3.jpg|thumb|left|2008-2010 Chrysler Sebring]]

For the 2008 model year, the Sebring convertible was redesigned with hood strakes recalling the [[Chrysler Crossfire]]. The new convertible body style debuted at the 2007 [[Los Angeles International Auto Show]] as an early-2008 model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061129/FREE/61127022/1064/cara_submit|title=Threefold Drop-Top|work=AutoWeek|accessdate=November 29, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929143552/http://autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20061129%2FFREE%2F61127022%2F1064%2Fcara_submit|archive-date=September 29, 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the bestselling four-place open-top cars in the United States, trailing only the Ford Mustang convertible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2008-chrysler-sebring-sebring-convertible-review |title=2008 Chrysler Sebring / Sebring Convertible What's new, trim levels, optional equipment, and safety info for the 2008 Chrysler Sebring |date=May 2008 |publisher=Car and Driver |accessdate=December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new convertible offered both a [[retractable hardtop]] and soft tops, with the Sebring's roofs manufactured by [[Karmann]]. A vinyl top came on the base LX model, a cloth roof on the Touring and Limited models with the option of a retractable metal hardtop. The convertible top retracts into the trunk with a power [[Convertible#Tonneau covers|tonneau cover]] and a luggage protector for the top. The top can also be retracted with the remote keyless entry, meaning the top can be stowed without being inside the car or starting the engine.

The LX model included a new 2.4 L I4 engine, the Touring version came with a retuned version of the 2.7 L V6, while the Limited featured a new 3.5 L V6. Unlike the Sebring sedan, the convertible was not available in [[all-wheel drive]].

===Chinese versions===
[[File:Chrysler Sebring JS China 2016-04-08.jpg|left|thumb|Chrysler Sebring JS]]
Production of the Chrysler Sebring sedan for the China market began in 2007 at the  Beijing-Benz DaimlerChrysler Automotive Co. (BBDC) in Beijing. BBDC is a joint venture between the [[Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Corporation|Beijing Automotive Industry Holding]] and Chrysler.

Production of the Sebring leveraged assembly capacity for the new BBDC plant which also built the Chrysler 300C, the [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class]] and Mitsubishi Outlander.
Four-cylinder World Engines for the Sebring were built at the [[Global Engine Manufacturing Alliance]] (GEMA) plant in Dundee, Michigan for export to China. GEMA began as a joint venture of Chrysler, [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]], and [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]]. Since 2009, GEMA is wholly owned by Chrysler.

===European version===
Chrysler introduced this generation Sebring to Europe (including right-hand drive markets) as their first competitor in the [[D-segment]].  It received a generally unfavorable reception from European motoring journalists.

===Mid-cycle refresh and replacement===
{{main|Chrysler 200#First generation (2011–2014)}}
The Chrysler Sebring was extensively refreshed in 2010, but was [[badge engineering|rebadged]] as the [[Chrysler 200]]. The [[Mitsubishi GS platform|JS platform]] and bodyshell had been retained, but there were extensive cosmetic and powertrain changes to the vehicle. The name change helped distance the vehicle from the Sebring's reputation for quality issues and fleet pervasiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2011/autos/1111/gallery.chrysler_fiat_success.fortune/4.html |title=How Chrysler keeps killing it - Chrysler 200 (4) |publisher=Money.cnn |date=10 November 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111112185012/http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2011/autos/1111/gallery.chrysler_fiat_success.fortune/4.html |archivedate=12 November 2011 |accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first generation Chrysler 200 was a restyled, [[badge engineering|rebadged]] and re-engineered version of the third generation [[Chrysler Sebring]] that began production in 2006. Although the [[Mitsubishi GS platform|JS platform]] had been retained, there were many cosmetic and powertrain changes to the 200.

Chrysler's new Pentastar [[Chrysler Pentastar engine|3.6&amp;nbsp;L]] V6 engine was also offered with a six-speed automatic transmission, generating {{convert|283|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|260|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. A flex-fuel version of the 3.6&amp;nbsp;L Pentastar engine was also available. Other changes included stiffer body mounts, revised suspension geometry with a softer ride rate, a new rear sway bar, and upgraded tires. The 200 was also more highly equipped than the Sebring. Chrysler added features such as [[LED]] lighting, thicker seat cushioning with higher quality materials, along with new measures to decrease [[noise, vibration, and harshness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.automoblog.net/2010/10/13/chrysler-adds-200-sedan-for-2011/ |title=Chrysler Adds 200 Sedan for 2011 |first=Chris |last=Nagy |date=13 October 2010 |publisher=Automoblog.net |accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chrysler 200 was manufactured at [[Sterling Heights Assembly]] ([[Sterling Heights, Michigan]]) and arrived at dealers in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.leftlanenews.com/new-car-buying/chrysler/200/ |title=Chrysler officially replaces Sebring with 2011 200 sedan |publisher=Leftlanenews.com |date= |accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2-door convertible model was added in early 2011 with the same engine choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=10467&amp;mid=2 |title=The new Chrysler 200 Drops its Top – Introducing the 2011 Chrysler 200 Convertible |publisher=media.fcanorthamerica |date=11 January 2011 |accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 200 and its platform mate, the [[Dodge Avenger]], were ranked the "Most American Made" sedans and convertibles by The Kogod Made in America Auto Index in 2013.&lt;ref name="kogodnow.com/autoindex/"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kogodnow.com/autoindex/ |title=New Auto Index Redefines "American Made" Cars |year=2013 |work=Hogod Now |accessdate=19 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403060112/http://kogodnow.com/autoindex/ |archive-date=3 April 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Edmunds' Acevedot, "by changing the name, Chrysler was able to let its midsize offering ride the coattails of the [[Chrysler 300]] and to encourage consumers to think of the 200 as the younger brother of the flagship 300"; as an all-new generation of the 300 was released at the same time. Acevedot also noted that the name change has the added benefit of distancing itself from its predecessor, a vehicle notorious for quality issues and fleet pervasiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2011/autos/1111/gallery.chrysler_fiat_success.fortune/4.html |title=How Chrysler keeps killing it - Chrysler 200 (4) |publisher=Money.cnn |date=10 November 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111112185012/http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2011/autos/1111/gallery.chrysler_fiat_success.fortune/4.html |archivedate=12 November 2011 |accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2013, Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne announced that the first generation model will be short lived and a redesigned next generation model would appear in auto shows January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.autoblog.com/2013/03/18/chrysler-200-replacement-coming-in-january/ |title=Chrysler 200 replacement coming in January |first=Zach |last=Bowman |publisher=autoblog |date=18 March 2013 |accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes===

====2013====
[[File:21Chrysler 200LX.JPG|thumb|Interior]]

The 2013 Chrysler 200 Convertible featured revised suspensions. Prior to the 2013 model year, the suspension on convertibles was largely shared with the Sebring that preceded it. The softtop convertible now matches the sedan's revised suspension. The retractable-hardtop could not fully accommodate the changes because the stiffer suspension would have made the ride too harsh.&lt;ref name="CandD-November-2012"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2013-chrysler-200-convertible-v-6-test-review |title=2013 Chrysler 200 Convertible V-6 - Instrumented Test |first=Jeff |last=Sabatini |publisher=Car and Driver |date=November 2012 |accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The retractable-hardtop version was also updated to the steering rack and rear toe link that the softtop received.&lt;ref name="CandD-November-2012"/&gt;

In 2013 the S trim was removed and became two appearance options, S Interior and S Exterior options - that could be added to other 200 models. The two exceptions to this was the 200 S Special Edition and 200 Super S.

Mid-year in the 2013 model year, Chrysler unveiled the 2013.5 Chrysler 200 S Special Edition, made in conjunction with Carhartt. It was offered in sedan form only, and had a suggested retail price of $28,870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://newsroom.carhartt.com/2013-03-21-Legendary-Detroit-Companies-Carhartt-and-Chrysler-Team-Up-to-Introduce-a-Car-that-Personifies-Hard-Work-and-Rugged-Perseverance-the-2013-5-Chrysler-200-S-Special-Edition-Mid-size-Sedan |title=Legendary Detroit Companies Carhartt and Chrysler Team Up to Introduce a Car that Personifies Hard Work and Rugged Perseverance – the 2013.5 Chrysler 200 S Special Edition Mid-size Sedan |website=Carhartt MediaRoom |accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car featured unique Mopar parts and suspension that were not offered previously, which lowered the car and stiffened the suspension. It also featured custom Carhartt embroidery atop the most premium interior options for the 200.

The 200 S Special Edition evolved into the 200 Super S the following year, with additional performance improvements.

====2014====
The limited edition 2014 Chrysler 200 Super S was a Mopar modified version and included two stages. Stage One enhancements include a chin spoiler, mesh upper and lower grilles with the upper grille finished in gloss black, as well as satin chrome grille and fog light trim. Side sills are included with gray or hyper black 18-inch wheels, while black chrome badges and satin chrome side molding differentiate the Super S. Additional satin chrome finishes include the rear light bar, as well as a new trunk lid spoiler and a matte black diffuser.

Stage Two enhancements are mechanical. A cold-air intake is fitted under the hood while a cat-back exhaust replaces the stock setup. A coil-over suspension provides a lowered ride height and a lower center of gravity.

===Lancia Flavia===
[[File:Lancia Flavia 2.4 16v – Frontansicht, 9. Juni 2012, Düsseldorf.jpg|thumb|right|Lancia Flavia 2.4 16v convertible]]

In Europe between 2012 and 2014, the 200 Convertible was rebranded and marketed under the Italian [[Lancia]] marque. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inautonews.com/chrysler-200-lancia-flavia-europe |title=Chrysler 200 to be Lancia Flavia in Europe |publisher=Inautonews.com |date=17 January 2011 |accessdate=19 December 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192442/http://www.inautonews.com/chrysler-200-lancia-flavia-europe |archive-date=2 January 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lancia Flavia was only available in [[Right- and left-hand traffic|left-hand drive]] markets, and thus not sold in the [[United Kingdom]] or [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. 

Chrysler discontinued exports in September 2013.

[[File:2015 Chrysler 200 Limited 2.4L rear 8.31.18.jpg|thumb|Rear view of a 2015 Chrysler 200 Limited]]
The 2015 model year Chrysler 200 debuted on January 13, 2014 at the 2014 North American International Auto Show in [[Detroit]], Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/14/automobiles/autoshow/the-chrysler-200-gets-a-reboot.html?hpw&amp;rref=automobiles&amp;_r=0 |title=The Chrysler 200 Gets a Reboot |first=Jerry |last=Garrettjan |newspaper=The New York Times |date=13 January 2014 |accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the [[Fiat Compact platform]], FCA (Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) used the long wheelbase version dubbed CUSW (Compact US Wide) for the second generation Chrysler 200. It is offered in four trim levels, LX, Limited, S as well as C &amp;mdash; and is positioned as a mid-size entry intended to compete with [[Toyota Camry]], [[Nissan Altima]], [[Honda Accord]], [[Mazda6]], [[Volkswagen Passat]], [[Chevrolet Malibu]], and [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Bill |last=Visnic |url= http://www.edmunds.com/auto-shows/detroit/2014/2014-detroit-auto-show-2015-chrysler-200-faq.html |title=2014 Detroit Auto Show: 2015 Chrysler 200 |publisher=Edmunds.com |date=12 January 2014 |accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Becoming available in mid-2014 as an early 2015 Model Year vehicle, the second generation debuted at the 2014 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, and became available in dealership showrooms shortly after.

The second-generation 200 also had the best V6 horsepower&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chrysler 200 Homepage|url= http://www.chrysler.com/en/200/ |website=Chrysler.com|publisher=FCA USA LLC|accessdate=24 July 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160723231924/http://www.chrysler.com/en/200/|archive-date=23 July 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; the lowest drag-coefficient,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Giles|first=Ralph|title=FCA Executive, Chief of SRT Division|url= https://www.instagram.com/p/BAHZx0FI3Dn/ |website=Instagram}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first car in its segment to have a dial-based gear shift. {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The second generation is only offered in sedan form. Chrysler noted the declining demand for convertibles, and high costs to create a convertible version using the all-new platforms, as reasons for not offering a convertible version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Noah |last=Joseph |url= http://www.autoblog.com/2014/02/23/chrysler-200-convertible-dodge-avenger-cancelled-report/ |title=Chrysler killing off 200 Convertible, Dodge Avenger |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=23 February 2014 |accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Matt |last=Keegan |url= http://www.autotrends.org/2014/10/21/coupe-convertible-chrysler/ |title=No Coupe or Convertible for Chrysler |publisher=Autotrends.org |date=21 October 2014 |accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Models===
At its launch, the 200 was available in base ''LX'', ''Limited'', sporty ''200S'', and top-of-the-range ''200C'' trim levels. Midway through the 2016 model year, new ''Touring'', ''Limited Platinum'', and ''200C Platinum'' trims were added in place of the previous Limited and 200C.

===Production===
The 200 continued in production at [[Sterling Heights Assembly]] with the plant's paint shop received upgrades to facilitate production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Brent |last=Snavely |url= http://www.freep.com/article/20130716/BUSINESS0103/307160088/chrysler-200-sterling-heights |title=Chrysler's new Sterling Heights paint shop will open in early |newspaper=Detroit Free Press |date=16 July 2013 |accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2015 Chrysler 200 production assembly began in May 2014, a month prior to going on sale. The vehicle had a base price of $21,700 excluding a $995 destination charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.autoweek.com/article/20140116/CARNEWS/140119884 |title=New 2015 Chrysler 200 pricing, details and specifications |publisher=Autoweek |date=16 January 2014 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140119212818/http://www.autoweek.com/article/20140116/CARNEWS/140119884 |archivedate=19 January 2014 |accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 200 is equipped with either a 2.4&amp;nbsp;L TigerShark (184-hp and 173-lb ft) or 3.6&amp;nbsp;L [[Pentastar]] engine (295-hp and 262-lb ft) both matched to a 9-speed automatic transmission. An [[all wheel drive]] system is available with the 3.6&amp;nbsp;L engine, including a fully disconnecting rear drive axle to improve fuel efficiency. The system detects adverse road conditions and engages, sending power to all 4 wheels. The system disengages when increased traction is no longer needed. The 200 would also offer a stop/start system to aid fuel efficiency with the 2.4&amp;nbsp;L TigerShark engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodwin |first=Antuan |url= http://reviews.cnet.com/sedan/2015-chrysler-200-sedan/4505-10865_7-35834116.html |title=The 'most improved' car at the Detroit auto show is the redesigned 2015 Chrysler 200 |publisher=CNET Reviews |date=13 January 2014 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140116003432/http://reviews.cnet.com/sedan/2015-chrysler-200-sedan/4505-10865_7-35834116.html |archivedate=16 January 2014 |accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production of the Chrysler 200 ended on December 2, 2016 at [[Sterling Heights Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/chrysler/2016/12/01/chrysler-production/94783580/ |title=Chrysler 200 production ends Friday in Sterling Heights |date=1 December 2016 |first=Michael |last=Wayland |newspaper=Detroit News |accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysler restructured the 200's final model lineup to add new models and packages with fewer options for 2017. The new models debuted midyear 2016 as 2016.5 models. The new models included '''Touring''', '''Limited Platinum''', '''200S Alloy Edition''', and '''200C Platinum''', which replaced the '''Limited''' (Touring) and '''200C''' (200C Platinum) models respectively. The 2017 [[model year]] production run was exactly four months, with enough dealer supply to last through midyear 2017.

=== Infotainment Features ===

The all-new 2015 Chrysler 200 offered four different [[Uconnect]] [[infotainment]] systems:

* The base 2000 '''LX''' trim featured the Uconnect 3.0 (RA1) radio. This was a basic A/M-F/M only radio with [[USB]] and auxiliary audio inputs with a three-inch monochrome non-[[touchscreen]] [[LCD]] display screen. This radio featured a four-speaker audio system.

* All 200 trims aside from the base '''LX''' trim featured the Uconnect 3 5.0BT (RA2) touchscreen radio. This system featured an A/M-F/M radio, [[Uconnect]] [[Bluetooth]] hands-free calling and wireless streaming stereo audio via [[A2DP]], with USB and auxiliary audio inputs with a five-inch color LCD touchscreen display. Standard on '''200S''' and '''200C''' trims, and available on the '''Limited''' trim was [[SiriusXM]] [[Satellite Radio]] with a one-year trial subscription. All audio and Bluetooth telephone features of the system could be controlled via the integrated voice controls. The system was also available on the base '''LX''' trim level. This system also featured a six-speaker audio system. A rearview backup camera system was standard on most models equipped with this radio, and available on lower trim levels.

* Available on all 200 trims aside from the base '''LX''' trim was the Uconnect 3C 8.4A (RA3) touchscreen [[infotainment]] system. In addition to the features available on other radios, this system also integrated a [[3G]] [[CDMA]] [[modem]] with service provided by [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] and a six-month trial subscription to Uconnect Access, as well as an 8.4-inch full-color LCD touchscreen display, and voice control for most vehicle features, including audio, climate, and Bluetooth telephone. [[GPS]] navigation, provided by [[Garmin]], could be added onto this system by the dealership for an additional fee, although [[3-D computer graphics|3D]] mapping capabilities and SiriusXM Travel Link service were not included as part of the package. A rearview backup camera system was standard on models equipped with this system, and a six-speaker audio system was standard equipment (as was SiriusXM Satellite Radio with a one-year complimentary trial subscription), with a nine-speaker, 506-watt [[Alpine Electronics|Alpine]] premium amplified surround-sound audio system available as an option on the '''200S''' and '''200C''' trims. 

* Available only on the up-level '''200S''' and '''200C''' trims was the Uconnect 3C 8.4AN (RA4) touchscreen infotainment system. Virtually identical to the Uconnect 3C 8.4A (RA3) system, this system also included an integrated the GPS navigation system provided by Garmin, with a one-year trial subscription to Uconnect Access, as well as a five-year trial subscription to [[SiriusXM]] Travel Link service, and a one-year trial subscription to SiriusXM Satellite Radio. The Garmin GPS navigation software also featured [[3-D computer graphics|3D]] mapping capabilities. A rearview backup camera system was included on models equipped with this system, and a nine-speaker, Alpine premium amplified surround-sound audio system was also included with this system. This was also the only system to offer built-in [[HD Radio]] capabilities.

=== Discontinuation ===
After its first year in production, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles CEO [[Sergio Marchionne]] said the Chrysler 200 would "run its course" under the current Compact US Wide architecture, pointing to the car being discontinued. While in his initial announcement of this news, he criticized the car's rear-door entry - some have argued this may not be due to the car's quality or success&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1102305_will-tighter-cafe-rules-bring-more-trucks-fewer-small-cars |title=Will Tighter CAFE Rules Bring More Trucks, Fewer Small Cars? |first=John |last=Voelcker |date=10 February 2016 |publisher=Green Car Reports |accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; - particularly as the second-generation Chrysler 200 has been a high volume seller for FCA.

Instead, more evidence points to FCA's stronger sales in trucks and SUVs being a primary reason for discontinuation. FCA also discontinued the Dodge Dart, FCA's other CUSW car&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://fcauthority.com/2016/07/dodge-dart-to-be-discontinued-in-september/ |title=Dodge Dart To Be Discontinued In September |first=Sam |last=McEachern |date=15 July 2016 |publisher=Fiat Chrysler Authority |accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; - while maintaining production of the Jeep Cherokee SUV, and Chrysler Pacifica minivan, which are mechanically similar to the Chrysler 200, share a platform and many parts.

Marchionne had said that he would be willing to continue production of the Chrysler 200, if another automaker continued it - though he did not specify if he was seeking another manufacturer to produce the 200 as-is, or as a captive import of another vehicle. Either solution would not impact FCA's CAFE margins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.christopherprice.net/dear-mitsubishi-fca-please-revive-diamond-star-motors-dsm-3496.html |title=Dear Mitsubishi, FCA – Please Revive Diamond-Star Motors / DSM |date=12 July 2016 |first=Christopher |last=Price |publisher=christopherprice.net |accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus allowing it to continue selling the cars while existing as primarily a truck manufacturer in the United States.

On July 26, 2016, FCA announced that Chrysler 200 production at the Sterling Heights plant would end in December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FCA earmarks $1.5 billion to build Ram 1500 pickups at Chrysler 200 plant|url= https://www.autonews.com/article/20160726/OEM01/160729899/fca-earmarks-1-5-billion-to-build-ram-1500-pickups-at-chrysler-200-plant |publisher=Automotive News |first=Larry P. |last=Vellequette |date=26 July 2016 |accessdate=24 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a short run as a 2017 model, production of the Chrysler 200 ended on December 2, 2016.

At the 2017 [[North American International Auto Show|Detroit Auto Show]], Marchionne explained the decision to end production, and not offer a replacement for the US or Canada: "I can tell you right now that both the Chrysler 200 and the Dodge Dart, as great products as they were, were the least financially rewarding enterprises that we've carried out inside FCA in the last eight years," adding "I don't know one investment that was as bad as these two were."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stocksdale |first=Joel |title=Marchionne says the Chrysler 200 and Dodge Dart were terrible investments for FCA |url= https://www.autoblog.com/2017/01/09/why-chrysler-200-dodge-dart-were-discontinued/ |website=Autoblog |date=9 January 2017 |accessdate=24 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This strategy positions FCA in the US as largely a manufacturer of SUVs and trucks. The company had to find additional capacity for Jeep and Ram. FCA plans to move production of its Ram pickup to [[Sterling Heights Assembly|Sterling Heights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Thibodeau |first=Ian |title=FCA moves Ram Heavy Duty production to Mich., gives $2K bonuses |url= https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/chrysler/2018/01/11/fca-ram-heavy-duty-pickup-production-michigan-mexico/109373632/ |work=Detroit News |date=11 January 2018 |accessdate=24 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing and sales==
===Marketing===
For [[Super Bowl XLV]], Chrysler purchased [[Born of Fire|a 2-minute-long advertisement]] featuring [[Eminem]] with the motto ''Imported from Detroit''. Chrysler was thinking about using the [[Chrysler 300]] in the advertisement, since it had a higher retail price than the 200 and also enjoyed better press-reviews, but quickly rejected the idea since the 300 is not manufactured in the United States, but in Ontario, Canada and would not fit the company's new branding. This commercial enjoyed great popularity among viewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mlive.com/tv/index.ssf/2011/12/born_of_fire_chrysler_200_ad_s.html |title= 'Born of Fire' Chrysler 200 ad featuring Eminem was simply the best of 2011 |last=Woods |first=Ashley C.|date=23 December 2011 |work=mlive.com |accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the term "Chrysler 200" being the second most-searched term on Google the day after the Super Bowl and search traffic for the vehicle going up by 685 percent on ''AOL Autos''. Shortly after being uploaded to YouTube after the Super Bowl, the ad quickly received over 5 million views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.autoblog.com/2011/02/08/chrysler-eminem-super-bowl-ad/ |title=The Inside Story: Chrysler's Risky Eminem Super Bowl Commercial |publisher=Autoblog.com |accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chrysler 200 also featured heavily in the London-based ''[[24: Live Another Day]]'' spinoff series of ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/225040/bauer-drives-chrysler-200-in-foxs-24-live-anoth.html |title= Bauer Drives Chrysler 200 In Fox's '24: Live Another Day' |publisher=MediaPost.com |accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is despite the fact that the vehicle was never sold in the UK. A legally required front numberplate is not present, the rear numberplate details are for a [[Ford Mondeo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_712814-Chrysler-200-UF-2015.html#Comment1924257 |title= 2015 Chrysler 200 [UF] in 24: Live Another Day, TV Series, 2014 IMDB Ep. 1.07 - Comment1924257 |publisher=IMCDB.org / user 'dsl' |accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 300 debuted as a [[concept car|concept]] at the [[New York International Auto Show#2003|2003 New York International Auto Show]] with styling by Burke Brown and production starting in January 2004 for the 2005 model year. The Chrysler 300 was designed as a modern interpretation of the [[Chrysler C-300]] (and the letter series Chryslers that followed), featuring a large [[grille (car)|grille]], long [[hood (car)|hood]] and low roofline that was prominent on those vehicles. The styling retained many elements of the 1998 [[Chrysler Chronos]] concept car, such as chrome interior accents and [[tortoiseshell]] finishings on the steering wheel and shifter knob.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.allpar.com/cars/lx/300.html |title=The Chrysler 300 and 300C |work=Allpar.com |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chrysler 300 is based on the [[automobile layout|rear-wheel drive]] [[Chrysler LX platform]] with components derived from the Chrysler LH architecture. 
&lt;ref name="Allpar.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Burke Brown, LX Car Leader, on the 300C, Magnum, Charger, Challenger, and Hemi|url= http://www.allpar.com/history/interviews/burke-brown-lx.html |publisher=Allpar.com|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Model range ===

==== Base ====
The basic '''300''' (or 300C in some countries) comes with standard 17-inch wheels, wheel covers, four-wheel disc brakes, single disc MP3 player, auxiliary input jack, power driver seat and a four-speed [[automatic transmission]]. It uses a {{convert|2736|cc|L cuin|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler LH engine#2.7|EER]] V6 making {{convert|190|hp|0|abbr=on}}. In Canada, it comes standard with the '''Touring''' model's [[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.5|{{convert|3518|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} V6]] engine. The vehicle comes with standard rear wheel drive and available all wheel drive. The basic 300 model was renamed to '''LX''' for 2008 and remains as the code-name for the platform.&lt;ref name="2006specs"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.media.chrysler.com/dcxms/assets/specs/2006Chrysler300Specifications06_2005.pdf |title=2006 Chrysler 300 |publisher=|work=media.chrysler |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Touring ====
The '''Touring''' model uses a [[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.5|{{convert|3518|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} V6]], producing {{convert|250|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|250|lb·ft|0|abbr=on}} of torque, either a 4 or 5spd transmission depending on the year and drive configuration, and comes with 17-inch aluminium wheels, AM/FM radio with CD player and auxiliary audio jack, [[Electronic Stability Program|Electronic Stability Program (ESP)]], remote keyless entry, leather trimmed seats, and [[SIRIUS]] [[satellite radio]]. This model was renamed '''Touring Plus''' for the 2009 and 2010 model years.&lt;ref name="2006specs"/&gt;

==== Limited ====
The '''Limited''' model included the Touring model's 3.5&amp;nbsp;L V6 engine, generating {{convert|250|hp|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|250|lb·ft|0|abbr=on}} and either a 4 or 5 speed transmission depending on the year and drive configuration. Additional features included 18-inch chrome-clad aluminium wheels, anti-roll bars.

==== 300C ====
{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width =
| image1 = Chrysler 300C .jpg
| image2 = 09 Chrysler 300C (8731398851).jpg
| caption2 = Chrysler 300C
}}

The top-of-the-line '''300C''' version uses a 5.7&amp;nbsp;L (345&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in) [[Chrysler Hemi engine#5.7|Hemi]] V8.&lt;ref name="2006specs"/&gt; Using the Multidisplacement System (MDS), this engine can run on four cylinders when less power is needed in order to reduce total fuel consumption. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|USEPA]]-rated fuel consumption of the 300C is: {{convert|15|mpgus }} city, and {{convert|23|mpgus }} highway. When all eight cylinders are needed, the 300C can produce {{convert|340|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|390|lb·ft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. It uses a five-speed automatic transmission and comes standard with 18-inch chrome-clad alloy wheels, Chrysler's ''MyGIG Infotainment System'' in 2008 and SIRIUS Satellite Radio and ''[[SIRIUS#Sirius Backseat TV|Backseat Television]]'' in 2008. The HEMI cylinder heads necessitate the use of a double rocker arm shaft configuration, with a cam-in-block, overhead valve (OHV) pushrod design. There are two [[dual ignition|spark plugs per cylinder]] to promote efficient fuel/air mixture burn and thereby reduce emissions. In 2009–2010 power output was increased to {{convert|360|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.

==== SRT-8 ====
[[File:Chrysler 300C SRT8 6.1.jpg|thumb|left|Chrysler 300C SRT-8]]
The '''SRT-8''' model was equipped with a 6.1-liter [[Chrysler Hemi engine#6.1|Hemi]] engine producing {{convert|425|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 6,200 rpm and {{convert|420|lb·ft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,800 rpm. The SRT8 can accelerate from 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph (97&amp;nbsp;km/h) in 4.9 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=St. Antoine |first=Arthur |url= http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/sedans/112_0502_muscle_car_comparison/viewall.html |title=2005 Cadillac CTS-V vs. Chrysler 300C SRT8 vs. Pontiac GTO |journal=Motor Trend |date=February 2005 |accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

=== Other variants ===

==== Station wagon ====
[[File:2010 Chrysler 300C CRD Automatic 3.0 Estate Rear.jpg|thumb|right|2010 Chrysler 300C Touring]]
The 300C was sold in [[European Union|Europe]], [[Australia]], and [[Japan]] as both a four-door [[notchback]] sedan and a five-door station wagon. The five-door station wagon was sold as the '''300C Touring''' (not to be confused with the [[North America]]n notchback sedan's "Touring" trim level), which shared much of its sheet metal aft of the [[Pillar (car)|C-pillar]] and wheel designs with the [[Dodge Magnum]]. The base Chrysler 300 was not sold in [[Europe]], instead all cars came with the 300C body style/interior and a choice of either V6 diesel or V8 gasoline powerplants. The economical Mercedes-based V6 diesel was popular in Europe, where gasoline prices are high. All 300C Touring models, along with European 300C sedans and right-hand drive models were assembled by [[Magna Steyr]] in [[Graz]], [[Austria]] beginning in June 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases-test/chrysler-group-and-magna-steyr-enter-agreement-for-chrysler-300c-production-75013402.html |title=Chrysler Group and Magna Steyr Enter Agreement for Chrysler 300C Production |publisher=PRNewswire |date=27 October 2005 |accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steyr insisted on upgrading suspension components to suit European tastes. Dodge Charger/Magnum wheels with Chrysler center caps were used instead of the distinct wheels used on Canada-assembled models. The five-door station wagon bodystyle was discontinued after the first generation.

====Diesel (2006–2011)====
In Europe and Australia, the 300C was available with a [[Mercedes-Benz]] 3.0 L [[Diesel engine|diesel]] [[V6 engine]] (internal code [[Mercedes-Benz OM642 engine|OM642]]) rated {{convert|218|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} at 3800 rpm and {{convert|376|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 1600 rpm. Fuel economy for the 300C diesel is rated at {{convert|26.2|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} City, {{convert|42.8|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} Highway and {{convert|34.9|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} on the combined cycle. It can accelerate from 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph (97&amp;nbsp;km/h) in 7.9 seconds while the top speed remains the same as the gasoline V6 ({{convert|140|mph|0|abbr=on}}).

The 2008 UK models included the 300C SRT-Design model in sedan or Touring body, which included SRT 20-inch alloy wheels and wheel arch spats, chrome mesh grille, MyGIG satellite navigation, SRT-8 steering wheel, SRT-8 leather sports seats and carbon fiber interior details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.worldcarfans.com/10802252129/official-chrysler-300c-srt-diesel-announced |title=Official: Chrysler 300C SRT Diesel Announced |first=Grant |last=Edwardson |publisher=Worldcarfans |date=25 February 2008 |accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ASC Helios 300 ====
[[American Specialty Cars|ASC]] created a convertible version of the Chrysler 300C, dubbed the ASC Helios 300, and unveiled it at the [[North American International Auto Show]] in early 2005. Despite rumours, Chrysler confirmed that the vehicle would not be produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Vance |first=Brian |title=Chrysler 300C Convertible - ASC Helios - First Drive &amp; Road Test Review |url= https://www.motortrend.com/cars/chrysler/300/2005/chrysler-300c-convertible/ |website=Motor Trend |date=30 March 2005 |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ASC Helios 4-door Convertible |url=https://www.automobilemag.com/news/asc-helios/ |website=Automobile Magazine |date=10 January 2005 |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Executive Series 300 ====
The '''Walter P. Chrysler Executive Series 300''' was an extended wheelbase version shown at the 2006 [[New York International Auto Show|New York Auto Show]]. It added 6 inches (152&amp;nbsp;mm) to the rear passenger compartment.

The Chrysler 300C Heritage Edition debuted in 2006 and was a performance oriented trim that used the 5.7 Hemi and had styling cues from the Chrysler 300 "letter series" of the 1950s and the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.leftlanenews.com/chrysler-announces-300c-heritage-edition.html |title=Chrysler announces 300C Heritage Edition |date=21 December 2005 |website=leftlanenews.com |last=Aziz |first=Nick |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reception and legacy ===
In the USA, the 300C enjoyed a wave of popularity in the [[2000s (decade)|mid-2000s]], aided by celebrity owners (including US President [[Barack Obama]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/02/obamas-old-car-fails-to-s_n_1250034.html?1328205022 |title=Obama's Old Car Fails To Sell On eBay: $1 Million Asking Price Too High? |work=The Huffington Post |date=February 2, 2012 |accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and appearances in music videos. In 2004, rapper [[Snoop Dogg]] famously called then-Chrysler CEO, [[Dieter Zetsche]], asking for his own 300C; he later appeared in a commercial for the car alongside [[Lee Iacocca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.autoinfluence.com/chrysler-300-celebrity-owners-promoters/ |title=Chrysler 300:The Celebrity Owners and Promoters |last=Dayton |first=Dalia |work=Autoinfluence.com |date=February 19, 2015 |accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 300C was ranked #12 in a [[Complex.com]] article, "The 25 Most Iconic Hip-Hop Cars" due to its popularity in many hip-hop music videos following its introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.complex.com/sports/2011/08/gallery-the-25-most-iconic-hip-hop-cars/chrysler-300c |title=The 25 Most Iconic Hip-Hop Cars |author=Matias, Carlos |work=Complex.com |date=August 5, 2011 |accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysler 300 designer Ralph Gilles reflected on the vehicle's success in 2008, saying that the "300 turned out to be a bit of an icon for Chrysler".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ralph Gilles, Vice President of Design, Chrysler, Jeep and Truck division |url= http://autos.ca/articles/cc/gilles.htm |date=4 March 2008 |first=Chris |last=Chase |website=Canadian Driver |accessdate= 23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' team described the 300C as "something different with a bit of kitsch gangster cool". They praised the spacious and well-equipped interior and the low price while criticizing the quality of materials, ride, steering and low engine torque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.topgear.com/uk/chrysler/300c/road-test/crd-auto |title=Car review: Chrysler 300C CRD Auto Car Review BBC Top Gear |publisher=BBC Top Gear |date=October 2005 |accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first generation model was popular with British buyers who regarded it as the "poor man's [[Bentley]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url= http://europe.newsweek.com/hot-wheels-chryslers-poor-mans-bentley-127607?rm=eu |title=Hot Wheels: Chrysler's 'Poor Man's Bentley'|date=30 May 2004 |magazine=Newsweek |accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Hip-hop artist Drake's album ''[[Views (album)|Views]]'', the song "Keep The Family Close" references the Chrysler 300 with the lyrics: "Always saw you for what you could've been / Ever since you met me / Like when Chrysler made that one car that looked just like the Bentley".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Singleton |first=Micah |title=Drake levels Chrysler for making a knockoff Bentley |url= https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/29/11538250/drake-chrysler-bentley-views-twitter |date=29 April 2016 |website=The Verge |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes==
The VH Valiant featured an entirely new body which was larger and more roomy than that of its VG series predecessor. The VH Hardtop models used body panels that were made entirely in Australia, unlike the previous VG Hardtops which had used imported sheet metal for all panels rear of the windscreen.&lt;ref name=Unique&gt;[http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_chrysler_valiant_vh.htm Chrysler Valiant VH at www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au] Retrieved on 4 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The hardtops now rode on a 115-inch wheelbase, 4 inches longer than that on sedans and wagons.&lt;ref name=UniqueSpecs&gt;[http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/valiant_vh_ch_technical_specifications.htm Valiant VH/CH Technical Specifications at www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au] Retrieved on 4 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Valiant Charger]], which made its debut as part of the VH series used a 105-inch wheelbase.&lt;ref name="TuckeyCH"/&gt;
From 1973 Australian regulations required amber turn signals be fitted to the front of all passenger vehicles, as well as the rear. This meant the combined park light/turn signals with clear lenses fitted to the VH were no longer legal. As a result 1973 build VH series cars were fitted with amber turn signals in place of the clear lenses, and park light were relocated to the panel below the front bumper.

==Engines and transmissions==
Chrysler Australia’s “Hemi 6” [[straight six engine]] was offered in three displacements, 215 cid (3.5 litre), 245 cid (4.0 litre) and 265 cid (4.3 litre).&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; and a 318 cid [[V8 engine|V8]] was also available.&lt;ref name="TuckeyCH"/&gt; A 340 cid V8 was fitted to the Charger 770SE E55 model which was released in October 1972.&lt;ref name=Davis123&gt;Pedr Davis, Aussie Cars, 1987, page 123&lt;/ref&gt; 3 speed manual and 3 speed automatic transmissions were offered initially&lt;ref name="TuckeyCH"/&gt; with a 4 speed manual available on Charger models from June 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas In Motion, 2010, pages 217-218&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|ZA|South Africa|Dodge SE}} South African production==
VH Valiants were assembled at Silverton, near [[Pretoria]] in [[South Africa]] using Australian bodies, electrics and trim and locally sourced mechanical components including a 225 cid engine.&lt;ref name=Farmer197&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas In Motion, 2010, page 197&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1971 South African Valiants had been sourced from [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=Farmer197/&gt; Local versions were sold as the Chrysler Valiant Rebel, Rebel 660, Regal, Charger Coupé, and Chrysler VIP. Station wagons were also available of the Rebel and Regal. For 1973 the '''Dodge SE''' (for "Special Edition") appeared, a luxury version with different front and rear treatment, vinyl roof, full equipment and a {{convert|142|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} version of the [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine|slant-six engine]].&lt;ref name=zaCARnov72&gt;{{cite magazine | magazine = CAR (South Africa) | title = Dodge "SE" for 1973 | editor-last = Wright | editor-first = Cedric | volume = 16 | number = 11 | date = December 1972 | ref = DNLCV | page = 17 | publisher = Ramsay, Son &amp; Parker (Pty) Ltd. | location = Cape Town, South Africa }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the six-cylinder engine, the Dodge SE was very similar to the Australian-market [[Chrysler by Chrysler]].

==Production and replacement==
A total of 67,800 VH Valiants were built&lt;ref name=UniqueSpecs/&gt; prior to its replacement by the [[VJ Valiant]] range in 1973.&lt;ref name=Tuckey&gt;Elisabeth Tuckey &amp; Ewan Kennedy, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, pages 145-149&lt;/ref&gt;

The VJ Valiant models featured new grilles, round headlights and revised tail lights,&lt;ref name=Unique/&gt; along with improved trim and a larger range of colours.&lt;ref name=UniqueSpecs/&gt; A new electronic ignition system was introduced on some models, the first time that this feature had been offered in an Australian built car.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Davis, Aussie Cars, 1987, page 133&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of models offered was significantly reduced with Ranger XL, Hemi Pacer, Regal 770 and Charger R/T not carried across from the [[VH Valiant]] into the new series.&lt;ref name=Unique/&gt; Equipment levels were raised in July 1974 with power assisted front brakes, retractable front safety belts, improved sound deadening, a lockable glovebox and a front stabiliser bar now available on all models other than the utilities.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, A History of Chrysler in Australia 1946-1981, page 197&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model range==
The VJ Valiant was introduced in April 1973&lt;ref name=UniqueSpecs&gt;[http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/valiant_vj_cj_technical_specifications.htm Valiant VJ/CJ Technical Specifications at www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au] Retrieved on 18 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and was offered in 4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]], 5-door [[station wagon]], 2-door [[hardtop]], 2-door [[coupé]] and 2-door [[coupé utility]] body styles in the following models:

* Chrysler Valiant sedan&lt;ref name=UniqueSpecs/&gt;
* Chrysler Valiant Ranger sedan&lt;ref name=UniqueSpecs/&gt;
* Chrysler Valiant Ranger wagon&lt;ref name=UniqueSpecs/&gt;
* Chrysler Valiant Regal sedan&lt;ref name=UniqueSpecs/&gt;
* Chrysler Valiant Regal wagon&lt;ref name=UniqueSpecs/&gt;

==Production and replacement==
A total of 90,865 VJ Valiants were built, more than any other Australian Valiant series.&lt;ref name=Farmer418&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, A History of Chrysler in Australia 1946-1981, page 418&lt;/ref&gt; Production consisted of 49,198 sedans, 15,241 wagons, 10,509 Chargers, 1,067 hardtops and 14,856 utilities.&lt;ref name=Farmer418/&gt; The VJ Valiant was replaced by the [[VK Valiant]] in October 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Tuckey and Ewan Kennedy, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, page 135&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Africa==
Sold as the Valiant J series, the South African assembled Chrysler Valiant lineup included the Rebel, Rebel 660, Regal, Regal Safari, and the VIP. During 1975 the "J½ series" appeared, first as the VIP only but gradually spreading down the range.&lt;ref name=SAMotor&gt;{{cite journal | ref = SAM1275 | journal = SA Motor | title = News Models | page = 59 | editor-last = Howard | editor-first = Tony | publisher = Scott Publications | location = Cape Town, South Africa | date = December 1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sound deadening was improved, while the Regal sedan also received a new "iso-clamp" rear axle insulator. The Regals also received new seats, while all J½ series Valiants could be recognized by the ventless front door windows.&lt;ref name=SAMotor/&gt;

The '''Chrysler Royal''' is an automobile which was produced by [[Chrysler Australia]] from 1957 to 1963. After investing in tooling to stamp body panels for the 1954 P25 series Plymouth locally, and with Chrysler headquarters in Detroit unwilling to assist in the costs of retooling for the new US models, Chrysler Australia made the decision to develop their own range, using as much of the existing tooling as possible, whilst also realising that the new car had to appear as different as possible. The doors and basic structure of the P25 sedan was retained, and with input from Australian and American Chrysler designers, the 1955 US Plymouth front sheetmetal was adapted to the P25 body and the rear quarter panels redesigned. They also added a wraparound rear windscreen, which caused development problems with Pilkington Glass, the Australian suppliers, who struggled to get the correct curved shape.&lt;ref name="Great Ideas In Motion"&gt;"Great Ideas In Motion, A History of Chrysler In Australia 1946-1981 by Gavin Farmer"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1957 Chrysler AP1 Royal sedan (6334126656).jpg|thumb|left|Chrysler AP1 Royal]]
The first version of the Chrysler Royal, the AP1, was introduced in May 1957.&lt;ref name="Great Ideas In Motion"/&gt; It was a development of the American Plymouth P25 design &lt;ref name=Farmer_29&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas In Motion, A History of Chrysler In Australia 1946-1981, page 29&lt;/ref&gt; of 1954 which had itself been produced by Chrysler Australia as the P25 [[Plymouth Cambridge]] and [[Plymouth Cranbrook|Cranbrook]], the D49 [[Dodge Kingsway]] and the SP25 [[De Soto Diplomat]].&lt;ref name=Farmer_23_24&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas In Motion, A History of Chrysler In Australia 1946-1981, pages 23 &amp; 24&lt;/ref&gt; Original designations for the three different designs were AD1 for the Dodge, AS1 for the DeSoto and AP1 for the Plymouth.&lt;ref name="Great Ideas In Motion"/&gt; Plans to market the updated version under these three names were dropped late in the development program and the new model would be sold only as the Chrysler Royal&lt;ref name=allpar&gt;[http://www.allpar.com/world/royal.html The Australian Chrysler Royal, Plainsman, and Wayfarer] Retrieved from www.allpar.com on 27 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; thus revising a name used by [[Chrysler]] in the US market &lt;ref name=allpar/&gt; from 1937 to 1950. The design chosen for the final model was that proposed for the Plymouth variant, thus the AP (Australian Plymouth) designation was adopted, and changed to stand for Australian Production.&lt;ref name="Great Ideas In Motion"/&gt;
The Royal differed from the P25 in using front and rear mudguards similar to those on the 1956 US Plymouth and a rear window which was larger than that of the P25.&lt;ref name=allpar/&gt; The AP1 was produced as a Royal four-door sedan, a Plainsman four-door [[station wagon]], and a Wayfarer two-door [[coupé utility]], and was offered with two versions of Chrysler's [[Chrysler Flathead engine|valve-in-block straight-6 engine]]: a {{convert|230.2|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} with manual transmission and a {{convert|250.6|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} with the [[Powerflite]] 2-speed automatic. Chrysler's {{convert|313|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler A engine|polyspherical-head V8]] was introduced as an option during the AP1 model run.&lt;ref name=allpar/&gt; V8 powered Royals were popular with the [[South Australia Police]], where they were employed as Highway Patrol cars.&lt;ref name="Great Ideas In Motion"/&gt;

[[File:Chrysler Royal AP2 V8 (16092365937).jpg|thumb|left|Chrysler AP2 Royal]]
A revised Royal, the AP2 was introduced in late 1958.&lt;ref name=allpar/&gt; This series featured a new grille and unusual rear styling with additional “saddle fins” grafted on to the exiting tailfins.&lt;ref name=allpar/&gt; The AP2 was available as a Royal four-door sedan, a Plainsman four-door station wagon, and a Wayfarer two-door coupé utility.&lt;ref name="Great Ideas In Motion"/&gt; The Plainsman station wagon was dropped from the range during the AP2 series.&lt;ref name="Great Ideas In Motion"/&gt; The choice of six cylinder and V8 engines continued, with the V8 identified by a V shaped emblem in the grille and a small V8 badge on the rear quarter.

[[File:1961 Chrysler AP3 Royal V8 sedan (8184594992).jpg|thumb|left|Chrysler AP3 Royal]]
The final version of the Royal was the AP3 which was introduced during 1960.&lt;ref name=allpar/&gt; The new series was easily distinguished from its predecessors by its vertically stacked quad [[headlamps]] and triple [[Automotive lighting|tail lights]] similar to those of the 1959 US [[DeSoto (automobile)|Desoto]] models.&lt;ref name=allpar/&gt; A new pressing for the roof panel was also used. Chrysler's 3-speed [[Torqueflite]] automatic transmission replaced the 2-speed PowerFlite automatic of the AP2.&lt;ref name=allpar/&gt; Production ceased in 1964.&lt;ref name=allpar/&gt; The AP3 was available as a Royal four-door sedan and a Wayfarer two-door coupé utility. The choice of six cylinder and V8 engines continued, with the V8 identified by twin side trim strips (the six cylinders having only one side trim strip) and a small V8 badge on the rear quarter.

==Chrysler Plainsman &amp; Wayfarer==
[[File:Chrysler AP3 Wayfarer.jpg|thumb|Chrysler AP3 Wayfarer]]
In addition to the Royal sedan, Chrysler Australia also produced the following Royal based derivatives:
* Chrysler Plainsman Station Wagon (AP1 and AP2) from 1957 to 1959 &lt;ref name=allpar/&gt;
* Chrysler Wayfarer 1/2-ton coupé utility (AP2 and AP3) from 1958 to 1961 &lt;ref name=allpar/&gt;
* Chrysler Royal chassis/cowl were produced to allow for custom bodywork to be fitted, for example [[ambulance]]/[[hearse]] &lt;ref name= "Great Ideas In Motion"/&gt;

The Plainsman and Wayfarer models were not marketed under the Royal name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-rVz7_-DqXQU/Tg9V9KOmOVI/AAAAAAAAA0A/hp0RVFNFAW4/s800/IMG_5005.JPG Brochure cover for the Chrysler AP1 Plainsman] Retrieved on 29 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AAfQF0Hly7s/Tg9WIF8BFHI/AAAAAAAAA0M/I4IZ3y1dZ3s/s800/IMG_5006.JPG Brochure cover for the Chrysler AP3 Wayfarer] Retrieved on 29 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specialised bodies==
All three series of Royals were very popular with ambulance services throughout Australia with many ambulance services basing their fleet on the Royal chassis. The [[Ambulance Victoria|Victorian Civil Ambulance Service]] in [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]] is one such service that employed vast numbers of Royals as did many country areas in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].&lt;ref name=colacambulance&gt;[http://www.colacambulance.com/chrysler%20royal.htm Chrysler Royal] Retrieved from www.colacambulance.com on 28 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Royal ambulances were also used throughout [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]] and [[Tasmania]].
Various [[coachbuilder]]s were contracted to transform Royals into ambulances, using different specifications depending on District requirements. Some vehicles used hand formed steel bodywork over timber frames, others used newly developed [[fibreglass]] technology. In 1957 [[Commonwealth Engineering]] (ComEng) began development of the first fibreglass ambulance body in Australia, in conjunction with the Central District Ambulance in Sydney. The first vehicle was completed in June 1958, after Central District agreed to replace its entire fleet with fibreglass bodied Royals constructed by ComEng.&lt;ref name=comeng&gt;"A History of Commonwealth Engineering 1955-1966" by John Dunn&lt;/ref&gt; The use of fibreglass bodywork provided a vehicle that was believed to be tougher, quicker to build, and easier to repair and resulted in a weight saving of around 560 pounds (254 kilograms).&lt;ref name=comeng/&gt;
As well as using the available chassis/cowl configuration, ambulances were also converted from sedans, Wayfarer coupe utilities, and at least one was converted from a Plainsman station wagon.
The Royal chassis was also popular with [[undertaker]]s as a basis for hearse conversion.

The '''Chrysler Viper GTS-R''' (also known as the '''Dodge Viper GTS-R''' when raced in North America) was a successful [[race car|racing]] variant of the [[Dodge Viper]] developed in conjunction with [[Chrysler]] of North America, [[Oreca]] of France, and [[Reynard Motorsport]] of the United Kingdom.  Officially unveiled at the 1995 [[Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance|Pebble Beach Concours]], it has won numerous championships and famous events in its history.  Some chassis are still in use today.

==Development==
:''For the development of the road car, see [[Dodge Viper]].''
In the early 1990s, first generation Dodge Viper RT/10s had been modified by racing teams for use in GT racing in North America and Europe without much success.  Although its [[V10 engine]] was powerful, the car was not adapted to racing and teams lacked the funding to build a car that could compete with factory efforts.  One key issue was the fact that the Viper was a roadster, therefore lacking the rigidity that a coupe bodystyle would have.  However, following the sales success of the first generation Viper, Dodge began redesigning the car in 1995, upgrading the roadster while at the same time adding a new coupe, known as the Viper GTS.

Although the first generation Vipers had sold well, Dodge wished to showcase the potential capabilities of the new car, mostly in the realm of handling.  At the same time, Dodge also hoped to increase sales in Europe where importation of the Viper had struggled.  Dodge's parent, [[Chrysler]], therefore approved the development of a racing program centering on the Viper GTS which was still in development at the time.  This co-development would allow for elements of the racing car to be adapted to the road car, and vice versa, for each car's mutual improvement.

Chrysler believed that in order to adapt their car not only for North American but also European circuits, they would require outside assistance.  An agreement was made with the French racing and engineering firm [[Oreca]], who had many years of experience in sports car racing as well as assistance in the [[Mazda 787B]]'s win in the [[1991 24 Hours of Le Mans]].  Oreca would construct and maintain the racing cars in their shops, as well as run Chrysler's official factory teams in Europe.  For North America, Chrysler would recruit the Canaska/Southwind Team as their factory effort.

Although Oreca would construct the cars, key elements would come from British engineering firm [[Reynard Motorsport]].  This would mainly consist of the construction of the car's basic chassis and other integral parts before they were shipped to Oreca for assembly.  As for the Viper's engine, it was ideally suited for competition at the time due to limits of 8000 cc being just beyond the Viper's 7998.5 cc.  Modifications were therefore light for the ''356-T6'' V10, with concentration on redesigned intakes for horsepower and reinforcements for endurance.

In terms of design much of the bodywork of the Viper GTS was retained on the race car.  Mandatory elements such as a rear wing, rear diffuser, and front splitter were added for aerodynamics, while initial cars had their fog lights covered over before being put back for increased visibility at night.  To aid in lighting, optional lights were able to be placed in square notches above the grill.  The exhaust would also be routed out the side of the car, just under the doors, about halfway between the front and rear wheel wells.  Side exhausts had been a feature of the first generation American-market RT/10s, but were no longer used on the GTS.  Vents were also added to the hood for cooling the engine, while intakes were placed on the roof and rear fenders.

In total, 57 Viper GTS-Rs would be built.  After the production of an initial five prototypes for testing and early usage by Oreca and Canaska/Southwind, 52 more cars would be built.  Although some would be used by the factory teams, most would be sold directly to customers for use in whatever series would allow them.  Viper GTS-Rs continued to be built into 2005, after which Oreca concentrated on maintaining and supporting the existing Viper GTS-R fleet.

===Naming===
Although the production cars have mostly been known as Dodge Vipers, the Dodge brand did not sell the Viper in Europe.  Because the new cars, named GTS-R, were built in Europe, they were mostly known as Chrysler Viper GTS-R.  However cars racing in North America usually ran under the Dodge banner, making them Dodge Viper GTS-Rs.  This naming difference therefore depends on location and region.  The cars themselves actually carried no badging for either Chrysler or Dodge, with only the ''Viper GTS-R'' name appearing on the side of the bonnet.

===Commemorative Edition===

With the FIA GT2 Team and Driver series wins in October 1997, Team Viper set forth with the creation of a unique Viper called the GT2 Commemorative Edition.  There would be 100 offered through the top Dodge Viper dealers.

The team started working on the concept in November 1997 with design concept approve in January 1998, prototype parts in February 1998, pricing approval of $85,200 in April 1998, and production from June 16th to July 7th, 1998.  The vehicles were the first to be built in VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) sequential order with the first having 001 as its last three on the VIN and the last being 100.  

The GT2 exterior is best known for its white with blue stripes paint, large rear wing, front dive planes and splitter, side sills, American flag, BBS rims, and GTS-R badging.  Its this badging that causes many to refer to the vehicle as the GTS-R.  However, the GTS-R was the race version of the Viper and not street legal.

The GT2 interior is best known for the blue accent trim, Oreca 5-point racing harness, and the center dash plaque with the vehicles unique production number.

The GT2 power increased by 10 horsepower to 460 HP with the use of K&amp;N air filter and smooth tubes connecting the filter to the intake manifold.  Torque increased by 10 to 500 foot pounds.

Of the 100 number vehicles, number 100 was keep by the Chrysler museum until it was later sold into private ownership.  Number 051 was given to Oreca Team drive Olivier Beretta.  However, due to Monaco's import regulations, Olivier was unable to take delivery.  The vehicle was later sold at Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale's auction and is in private hands.  Number 052 was given to Oreca Team driver Justin Bell.  He kept the vehicle for several years before being sold into private hands.

The GT2 is regarded as the pinnacle of the Gen II (Generation Two) GTS Viper coupe collectability.

Any reference to the GT2 being built to meet any homologation effort are inaccurate.

==Racing history==
Debuting in 1996, two racing teams separately developed the Chrysler Viper GTS-R coupe for competition. Canaska Southwind started in the North American [[IMSA GT Championship]] GTS-1 class at the 1996 [[24 Hours of Daytona]], managing to finish in 29th place. However, the team would improve with a twelfth-place finish at the [[12 Hours of Sebring]].  [[Oreca|Viper Team Oreca]] would also run a limited schedule beginning with the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]].

Both teams appeared at the [[1996 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] with two entries each.  Three of those four cars managed to finish with Canaska Southwind earning the best result in tenth place.  The two teams returned to their respective series afterwards. Viper Team Oreca concluded the year with three races in the [[BPR Global GT Series]] earning eighth place at [[Brands Hatch]], ninth at [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa]], and sixth at [[Circuit Paul Armagnac|Nogaro]]. Canaska Southwind concluded the season by finishing second in class at [[Mosport]] and sixth overall. 

The Canaska Southwind team would end their involvement in the Viper program in 1997.  This meant Oreca would make the only appearance for a Viper in IMSA GT by submitting a lone entry at the Rolex 24 at Daytona, finishing in 12th place.  After Daytona, the team returned to Europe to concentrate on the new [[FIA GT Championship]] which had replaced the BPR series.  The team would switch to the less powerful GT2 class due to the strength of the [[Porsche]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]] teams which were entering GT1, while at the same time being joined by the customer Chamberlain Engineering team.  Oreca began the season strong with a 1-2 finish in their class ahead of the Roock Racing Porsches, and would go on to take six more victories in the eleven race season and winning the GT2 championship.  The team also returned to Le Mans with three cars, although they would only finish in 14th place, fifth in their class.  Another customer Viper would also appear in the [[All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship]] for [[Team Taisan]], making two appearances with a best finish of eighth.

The Oreca team would strengthen their dominance in FIA GT in 1998, as the team managed to win all but one event in the ten race schedule.  Oreca would also take their first class victory at [[1998 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] with an eleventh place overall finish.  Chamberlain continued as a privateer in FIA GT earning several points, as well as earning a 14th-place finish at Daytona.  Meanwhile, the Oftedahl Motorsport would purchase a Viper GTS-R and go on to score six class wins in the [[British GT Championship]], including an overall race win at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] and earning Kurt Luby and Richard Dean the drivers' championship.

For 1999, Oreca's efforts were expanded further, as the team now operated in two championships: A two-car team in the new [[American Le Mans Series]] and the existing two car team already competing in FIA GT.  FIA GT saw the Vipers once again sweep the series with nine wins for Oreca, and a lone win for the [[Paul Belmondo]] Viper.  Chamberlain improved their team to finish second in the championship, while [[PK Carsport|GLPK Carsport]] would be the fourth Viper squad to compete.  A similar story occurred in the ALMS, with Oreca winning six races and taking that championship as well.  Oreca would also earn their second straight win at [[1999 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]], with various Vipers finishing in the top six positions in their class.  The [[FFSA GT Championship]] would see the appearance of Belmondo's Vipers, earning two victories over the season, and the [[24 Hours Nürburgring]] would see [[Zakspeed]] claiming overall victory.

For 2000, Oreca chose to concentrate on North America, leaving the FIA GT Championship to privateers. The team opened the season with one of their most notable victories, winning the 24 Hours of Daytona by a small margin over the new [[Chevrolet Corvette]] factory team.  Oreca went on to win ten races in the American Le Mans Series, eventually falling to Corvette in two rounds late in the season but once again securing the championship.  Oreca would also outperform Corvette at Le Mans, winning their third straight class victory with a seventh-place finish.  In FIA GT, the Paul Belmondo and new Carsport Holland teams would run strong and win a collective four races, but would not be able to overcome the five victories by the [[Lister Storm]], forcing the two teams to settle for second and third in the championship.  In French GT, the DDO, ART, and MMI squads would combine for a total of eight Viper victories.

The backing by [[Chrysler]] officially ended in 2001, as Chrysler and Oreca had begun work the previous year on developing a [[Le Mans Prototype]], forcing Oreca to abandon their Viper teams.  The American Viperacing squad would be the sole contender in the American Le Mans Series, scoring no victories and finishing the season in third for the championship.  FIA GT would however see a blossoming of teams, as eight different Viper squads competed over the season. [[Larbre Compétition]] would win three events (including the [[Spa 24 Hours]]) and win the championship, while Carsport Holland won two races and finished second.  Hayles Racing would win four races in British GT to win that championship by two points over [[Lister Cars|Lister]], while the DDO team would win five French GT events, and [[Zakspeed]] would manage to win the 24 Hours Nürburgring for the second time.  Le Mans however would not see the Vipers repeat their past success, as the factory Corvette squad won the class and only a lone Viper finished.
[[File:Dodge Viper Team Zakspeed.jpg|thumb|right|250px|One of [[Zakspeed]]'s Viper GTS-Rs from the [[24 Hours of Nürburgring]], advertising the new presence of [[Dodge]] in Europe]]
Larbre was able to defend their FIA GT championship in 2002, but were only able to win one race in the process.  Carsport Holland and Paul Belmondo also managed single victories, while the new [[Ferrari 550]]s showed their potential with four wins.  The only other victories for Vipers that season came in French GT, with four earned by DDO, and a third victory at the Nürburgring for Zakspeed.  An Oreca-backed entry at [[2002 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] would manage to finish on the class podium, although several laps behind the two factory Corvettes.

In 2003, the dominance of the [[Prodrive]]-built [[Ferrari]]s began.  Vipers were unable to win any races in FIA GT, leaving Larbre as the best finishing Viper in the championship, a distant seventh.  Some victories were still scored by Vipers however, as Larbre took six wins in French GT and Force One Racing a further two.  The Team Taisan Viper in JGTC would also manage its first class victory in an event at [[Fuji Speedway]].  Vipers would compete for the first time in Italian GT, winning all but three races during the season.  However at the same time, Vipers would make their final appearance at [[2003 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]], with Larbre finishing fourth in their class.

2004 would see the Viper GTS-Rs begin to be phased out.  Only Zwaan's Racing would be entered in the full FIA GT season, earning ninth in the championship.  Vipers would remain dominant in FFSA GT and Italian GT, winning eleven and five races respectively.  For 2005, the only Viper entry in FIA GT would be a single entry at the Spa 24 Hours, finishing 12th, while Italian GT would see only three teams competing and unable to score any victories.  French GT became the only series in which Vipers were competitive, which lured former [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Formula One champion]] [[Alain Prost]] to run Viper GTS-R chassis #C50 in the series as part of his 50th birthday, eventually winning one race as part of the Vipers nine victories that season.

In 2006, Viper GTS-Rs continue in French GT and Italian GT, although their victories continued to diminish.  By 2007, the homologation of the Viper GTS-Rs would come to an end as the Viper GTS bodystyle had been replaced nearly seven years prior.  Few privateers entered Vipers in French and Italian GT, while Red Racing would enter a lone car in select rounds of the FIA GT Championship as part of the amateur Citation Cup but would be unable to even finish any of its events. In 2008 Italian team Lanza Motorsport entered a GTS-R in the Italian round of the FIA GT Championship, but the car did not finish the race.

In 2007 a Viper GTS-R was first raced during a historic event at Magny-Cours by Florent Moulin. The new GT90s serial accepts former FIA GT racers from 1990 to 2000. The car was chassis C23, the FIA GT Championship-winning car from 1999 driven as by Karl Wendlinger and Olivier Beretta, completely restored into original 1999 Oreca specifications. The same car was invited at Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2008 and driven by its period driver Justin Bell in its Le Mans 1999 livery when Justin drove this very car to 2nd place in GTS.  In November 2008 Florent Moulin entered it again in GT90's Revival race at Le Castellet, co-driven by another of its period driver from Le Mans 1999 Marc Duez.  In 2010, chassis 27 participated in the Goodwood Festival of Speed to celebrate the 10th Anniversary 24 Hours of Daytona victory.

==Achievements==

==Replacement==
Following Dodge's official end of their factory-backed racing program in 2001, as well as the redesigning of the Viper in 2003, the first generation GTS-Rs have been retired.  Nonetheless, Dodge persevered in motorsports competition by backing a different type of racing endeavor.  Unlike before, there would be no factory team.  These racing vehicles, known as Dodge Viper Competition Coupes, would be sold to those customers who wanted a ready-made track car.  Because they complied with the [[Group GT3|FIA GT3]] regulations, these vehicles were prevented from exhibiting the same level of extreme performance characteristic of the earlier Viper GTS-Rs which ran in GT1.  In this instance, Oreca ran the Viper Competition Coupe program, building the cars for Dodge.

Attempts were made by Oreca as well as privateers Racing Box and Woodhouse Performance to modify Viper Competition Coupes to run in the faster [[Group GT2|GT2]] class.  Although this has not received official support from Dodge, they have expressed interest in exploring the idea. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Coinciding with the release of the fifth generation Viper road car in 2012, Chrysler returned to motorsports competition under the [[Street &amp; Racing Technology|SRT Motorsports]] banner in the [[American LeMans Series]] with the SRT Viper GTS-R race car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drivesrt.com/news/2012/05/alms-com-documents-the-top-five-wins-for-viper-gts-r-in-american-le-mans-series.html |title=ALMS.com documents the top-five wins for Viper GTS-R in American Le Mans Series | work=driveSRT.com |date=May 4, 2012 |accessdate=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After winning the GTLM Class of the [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship|Tudor United Sportscar Championship]] in [[2014 United SportsCar Championship|2014]], factory support was again terminated. Nevertheless, private racing teams can still compete with the 2013 release of the Dodge Viper SRT GT3-R which is FIA GT3 homologated as GT3-036.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drivesrt.com/racing/viper-gt3r/ |title=SRT Viper GT3-R |work=driveSRT.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fia.com/homologations |title=FIA Homologations |work=Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile | date=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''' Chrysler VC Valiant ''' is an [[automobile]] that was produced in [[Australia]] by [[Chrysler Australia]] from 1966 to 1967.&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; It was released in March 1966, replacing the [[Chrysler AP6 Valiant]].&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; The VC was the fifth [[Chrysler Valiant]] model to be produced in Australia.

==Overview==
The VC Valiant was longer and lower than any previous Australian Valiant model, but was essentially a facelift of the superseded AP6 model,&lt;ref name=UniqueVC&gt;[http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_chrysler_valiant_vc.htm Chrysler Valiant VC at www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au] Retrieved on 24 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; with Chrysler Australia photographs of early VC's showing them bearing the model designation AP7.&lt;ref&gt;https://picasaweb.google.com/104928423534347932585/ValiantVC&lt;/ref&gt; It featured a new grille, front bumper, bonnet and front mudguards.&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; Sedans had new rear styling with vertical taillights.&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; Wagons and utilities carried over the rear lights and panels from their AP6 predecessors,&lt;ref name=UniqueVC/&gt; with wagons receiving the new rear bumper and utilities carrying over the previous models bumperettes. The VC range displayed a greater degree of differentiation between models with the Valiant, Regal and V8 each having unique exterior decoration and trim.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;Tony Davis, Aussie Cars, 1987, page 96&lt;/ref&gt; Regal and V8 models had a chrome strip situated near the lower edge of the doors&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; and V8 models featured a vinyl roof, bucket seats and a floor mounted gear selector with full length centre console, as well as V8 badges on the rear roof pillar, bootlid, bonnet emblem and hubcaps.&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; V8 sedans also featured three horizontal chrome bars on the rear quarter panel. Front disc brakes were introduced as an option in November 1966.&lt;ref name=Farmer&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, 2010, pages 129-133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model range==
The VC series Valiant was offered in 4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]], 5-door [[station wagon]] and 2-door [[coupe utility]] models.&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt;

===Dodge 106 heavy duty utility===
A variant of the Valiant Wayfarer utility was marketed as the Dodge 106 heavy duty utility.&lt;ref name=AussieUte/&gt; The Dodge had a 1,500&amp;nbsp;lb load capacity,&lt;ref name=AussieUte/&gt; as against the 1,200&amp;nbsp;lb capacity of the Wayfarer,&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; and was visually differentiated by less chrome and exterior decoration.&lt;ref name=AussieUte/&gt;

==Engines and transmissions==
A {{convert|225|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-six engine]] was fitted to all models other than the 273 V8 sedan and wagon, which were powered by a {{convert|273|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine]].&lt;ref name=UniqueVCSpecs&gt;[http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/valiant_vc_technical_specifications.htm Valiant VC Technical Specifications, www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au] Retrieved on 24 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Base models were available with either three speed manual transmission or three speed automatic transmission, whilst Regals and 273 V8s were fitted with a three speed automatic as standard.&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt;

==Production and replacement==
A total of 65,634 VC Valiants were built prior to its replacement by the [[VE Valiant]] range in 1967.&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt;
{{Clear}}

==Motorsport==
Two VC Valiant V8 automatic sedans contested the [[1966 Gallaher 500]] endurance race at [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Mount Panorama, Bathurst]], finishing first and second in Class D. They placed 10th and 11th outright, beaten only by the [[Morris Cooper S]] which filled the first nine places.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Tuckey, Australia's Greatest Motor Race, 1981, pages 114-121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police Cars==
Chrysler Australia produced 33 or 34 (actual figure is disputed) Valiant sedans with the base level trim, but equipped with the 273 V8, for use by Victoria and South Australia Police forces as high speed pursuit vehicles. These show in the production records as model code V41.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, The History of Chrysler in Australia 1946-1981, page 409&lt;/ref&gt; Regular production base model Valiants used model code M41, whilst regular production V8 with the luxury trim used model code P41. Externally they were identical to the regular six cylinder Valiant sedans, and had standard base trim level interiors instead of the luxury interior of the regular production V8s

The Chrysler group minivans, which include the [[Dodge Caravan]]/[[Dodge Grand Caravan]] and included the [[Plymouth Voyager]]/[[Plymouth Grand Voyager]]/[[Chrysler Voyager]], have ranked as the 13th [[List of bestselling vehicle nameplates|bestselling automotive nameplates]] worldwide, with over 12 million sold.&lt;ref name="autonews"&gt;{{cite web|title= Chrysler LLC Celebrates 25th Anniversary of the Minivan |publisher=Autonew24h.com |url= http://www.autonews24h.com/Auto-Industry/Chrysler/2885.html |accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After five generations and 27 model year runs, the Town &amp; Country nameplate was retired at the end of the 2016 model year run and was replaced by the 2017 model-year [[Chrysler Pacifica (2017)|Chrysler Pacifica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Can 2017 Pacifica minivan re-energize Chrysler?|url = http://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/detroit-auto-show/2016/01/11/2017-chrysler-pacifica-minivan-monumental-leap/78336620/|website = Detroit Free Press|access-date = 2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dodgenotleavingyet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/chrysler/2015/12/05/2017-chrysler-minivan-coming-dodge-not-leavingyet/76745544/ |title=2017 Chrysler minivan coming; Dodge not leaving yet |author=Priddle, Alisa |work=Detroit Free Press |date=December 5, 2015 |accessdate=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally planned to be introduced as a 1989 model,&lt;ref&gt;[http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/wqIAAOxy4c5RsPPu/$T2eC16FHJIQE9qUHrjB(BRsPPur4DQ~~60_57.JPG?rt=nc Early sales material for the model referring to it as a 1989 model], retrieved on 2014-12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; the Chrysler Town &amp; Country minivan was ultimately introduced as a 1990 model in the Spring 1989. The model was introduced before the 1990 model year Caravans and Voyagers entered production; the Dodge and Plymouth counterparts produced alongside the Town &amp; Country until June 1989 were still 1989 models. Sharing the body of the long-wheelbase (LWB) Grand Voyager/Grand Caravan's [[Chrysler S platform#T-115|Chrysler S platform]], the Town &amp; Country was externally distinguished by its chrome waterfall grille, crystal pentastar hood ornament, standard woodgrain applique, grooved lower body cladding (a version of that found on the Caravan ES, slightly extended to compensate for the longer wheelbase), and 15" lace-spoke aluminum wheels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imperialclub.com/Yr/1990/index.htm "1990 Chrysler Showroom Brochure" pg. 20-21], retrieved on 2011–06–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Town &amp; Country was only available in two exterior colors, initially in Bright White Clearcoat only; the Black Clearcoat color was added in June 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imperialclub.com/Yr/1990/index.htm "1990 Chrysler Showroom Brochure" pg. 30], retrieved on 2011–06–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Chrysler Corporation's most luxurious minivan, the Town &amp; Country came standard with nearly every feature available on Plymouth and Dodge minivans in addition to some exclusive amenities of its own. This included unique gathered leather seating surfaces and door trim panels, front and rear air conditioning, power windows, power locks, an [[Infinity (audio)|Infinity sound system]], seven-passenger seating, luggage rack, and an electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Sales Material "1990 Chrysler Sales Brochure", published by the Chrysler Motors Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; Models produced before June 1989 came with 3.0&amp;nbsp;L Mitsubishi 6G72 V6 engines while models produced from June onward received an upgrade to Chrysler's own 3.3&amp;nbsp;L EGA V6. As all models equipped with the 3.0&amp;nbsp;L engine were produced during the time period in which the Caravan and Voyager model year was 1989, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] lists it as a 1989 model rather than a 1990, despite the VIN indicating otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/noframes/6255.shtml "Fuel Economy of the 1989 Chrysler Town and Country"], retrieved on 2015-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically, the first-generation Town &amp; Country minivan was released for the final model year of production of the first-generation Chrysler minivans. The Town &amp; Country, Voyager/Grand Voyager, and Caravan/Grand Caravan would all be redesigned for the 1991 model year. Total production was 1,789 units in 1989 and 3,615 in 1990, making this model of the Town &amp; Country as the most obscure of all the Chrysler minivans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/cars/production/chrysler-US.html |title=Chrysler Cars and Production Numbers, United States |first=Gerard |last=Wilson |date=June 2013 |work=Allpar |accessdate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Production numbers may be inaccurate as the source cited is confusing, showing production numbers for NS Town &amp; Country vans (first produced in 1995) in calendar year 1992.|date=July 2019}} The reason for 1990 being the only model year for this bodystyle was because it was an attempt to repurpose an abundance of pre-manufactured bodies previously slated for the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

[[File:2nd-Town-and-Country.jpg|thumb|left|1993 Chrysler Town &amp; Country with woodgrain appliqué]]
Introduced in November 1990, the 1991 through 1995 Town &amp; Country used the [[Chrysler S platform|Chrysler AS platform]]. This was the last Town &amp; Country that was derived from the [[Chrysler K platform]]. As with the previous generation, the Generation II Town &amp; Country came fully equipped, with no actual trim levels but only additional options &amp;mdash; and continuing exclusively in the long-wheelbase (LWB) format.

This generation Town &amp; Country shared the [[Plymouth Voyager]]'s headlight and taillight clusters; the [[Dodge Caravan]] had its own. The Town &amp; Country was set apart on the exterior by its chrome (later body colored) waterfall grille, crystal pentastar hood ornament, body colored side mirrors, body side cladding, and unique alloy wheels. The interior of the Town &amp; Country included standard leather seating surfaces, woodgrain dashboard and door trim, as well as a digital instrument cluster.

===Innovations===
* "Quad Command" bucket seating, made standard on the Town &amp; Country (MY1992)
* Integrated [[child safety seats]] (1991, MY1992), improved design with recliners (1993, MY1994)
* Available [[anti-lock brakes]]

===Year-to-year changes===
*'''1991''': For its second model year as a minivan, the Chrysler Town &amp; Country is completely redesigned with improved aerodynamics and less sharper corners, and had the 250-watt Chrysler Infinity audio system.
*'''1992''': The Town &amp; Country was available with [[all-wheel drive]] and integrated child safety seats. Now standard were a driver's side airbag (from August 1991 production) and quad command bucket seating. On the exterior, the Town &amp; Country was available with a vinyl woodgrain delete option. If buyers opted for this, the woodgrain siding was replaced by a gold pinstripe along the beltline. New gold web-design alloy wheels were available.
*'''1993''': There were several interior revisions. On the exterior, a stainless steel exhaust system and new available wheel designs greeted buyers for 1993.
*'''1994''': Launched in November 1993, a redesigned dashboard and instrument panel was new for 1994. All 1994 Town &amp; Country's were given a passenger's side airbag and knee bolsters. Side door guard beams were installed this year, so that they met 1998 federal side impact standards. Also made standard was a 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 engine.
*'''1995''': The fob for the standard remote keyless entry had to be pressed twice within five seconds to prevent accidental opening of the liftgate. 1995 would be the last model year for the [[Chrysler K platform|K-based]] Town &amp; Country. A completely new [[cab-forward]] styled Town &amp; Country would be introduced in early 1995 as a 1996 model.

{{main|Chrysler minivans (NS)}}

The 1996 redesign used the [[Chrysler S platform|Chrysler NS platform]] and included several industry firsts, including a driver's-side sliding door and a seating management system marketed as ''Easy Out Roller Seats''. With Generation III, the Town &amp; Country was able to cover a wider customer base through new designated trim levels. The premium '''LXi''' (and later '''Limited''') included amenities such as pre-programmed driver's seat and mirror, standard leather interior, 8-way power adjustable front seats, [[Infinity (audio)|Infinity sound system]] with cassette/CD player, and dual driver/passenger climate control to name a few. An unnamed entry-level model (later redesignated '''LX''') featured fewer amenities in a long-wheelbase (LWB) form.  The '''LX''' model (later redesignated '''SX''') featured similar content in a short-wheelbase (SWB) form. Both Base and LX models were intended to fill the gap left by the discontinuation of the upscale LX model of the Plymouth Voyager/Grand Voyager which had been discontinued for the third generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Yates, Brock |title=The Critical Path: Inventing an Automobile and Reinventing a Corporation "Showtime in St.Louis" p.210 |publisher=Little, Brown |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generation III Town &amp; Countries were the first to feature the historic Chrysler blue ribbon emblem (later incorporated into the winged emblem), which dates from the 1930s.

Engines included a 3.3&amp;nbsp;L gasoline-powered engine (8th [[Vehicle Identification Number|VIN digit]] R), a 3.3&amp;nbsp;L [[E85|flexible-fuel]] 3.3&amp;nbsp;L engine (8th VIN digit G), and a 3.8&amp;nbsp;L engine (8th VIN digit L). In Canada, Town &amp; Country models came standard with the 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 and were offered only in long-wheelbase (LWB) versions.

In 1999, Chrysler presented a concept minivan, the [[Chrysler Pacifica (1999 concept vehicle)|Pacifica]] using the Town &amp; Country's body shell and bearing resemblance to the Town &amp; Country and the [[Chrysler LHS|LHS]].

Generation III examples of the Town &amp; Country with only the passenger side sliding door (vs. both rear sliding doors) were only offered for 1996. ''[[Car and Driver]]'' included the Town &amp; Country on their [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 1996 and 1997.

===Year-to-year changes===
*'''1996''': The redesigned Generation III Town &amp; Country is introduced with a short-wheelbase LX model and two long-wheelbase models: an unnamed base model and the LXi. Early minivans had discrete grab handles on the front interior door panels; they were integrated into the front door armrests as a running change during this model year. Another running change during this model year saw the elimination of the plastic intake manifold cover on the 3.8&amp;nbsp;L engine. The 3.8&amp;nbsp;L engine was standard on the LXi and optional on the LX and Base.
*'''1997''': Permanent all-wheel drive arrived as an option for 1997 on long-wheelbase minivans, and all-wheel drive models got 4-wheel disc brakes. Front wheel drive minivans gained a new traction control system, which worked at low speeds to prevent wheel slippage. The rear driver's side sliding door was standard on all 1997 Town &amp; Countries. The short-wheelbase model was redesignated SX, with the LX designation being given to the previously unnamed long-wheelbase base model.
*'''1998''': A new front fascia was introduced, replacing the waterfall grille with a black eggcrate grille and a winged version of the Chrysler ribboned badge. The new front fascia also featured a larger, more aggressive looking bumper with new headlights that offered better illumination and round fog lights. Also, the 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 gained {{Convert|14|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for a total of {{Convert|180|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. SX and LX models equipped with cloth interiors received new cloth upholstery. Additionally, the design of the auto-dimming rear view mirror was updated to include a sensor for automatic headlights. HVAC vents on the driver's side and center of the dashboard were updated to a more conventional design in calendar year 1998 
*'''1999''': The exterior emblems were changed to use a new font. The middle bench seat was dropped in some models for 1999, and a child seat was now available in one of the two reclining middle-row buckets. Other additions included a small [[cargo net]] between the front seats. Another model, the top-of-the-line Limited, was also available for 1999. Among other features of the Limited were a new 3rd row bench that featured higher bucket-like backs on the left and right sides, chrome exterior door handles, and 16" chrome alloy wheels.
*'''2000''': The short-wheelbase SX was dropped for 2000, leaving only extended wheelbase models, along with new interior and exterior colors. All models seated seven and had sliding doors on both sides. A new Rear Seat Video entertainment system, with a VCR and 6.4 in display screen, was available as a dealer-installed option.

===Crash test results===

The 1996–2000 Dodge Grand Caravan (twin of the Town &amp; Country) received a "Marginal" rating in the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]'s 40&amp;nbsp;mph offset test. The structural performance and restraints were graded "Acceptable", but the foot injuries were very high.

In the U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) crash tests, it received 4 stars for the driver and front passenger in the frontal-impact. In the side-impact test, it received five stars for the driver, and 3 stars for the rear occupant, and resulted in a fuel leak that could cause a fire hazard.

Despite bad results in the Euro NCAP crash tests, statistics from the real world indicate that this is not the whole picture. [[Folksam]] is a Swedish insurance company that in May 2009 published a report on injuries and survivability of 172 car models. The 1988-95 generation received a real world rating of "Average", and the 1996-00 generation got a rating called "Safest" (at least 30% safer than the average car.)

{{main|Chrysler minivans (RS)}}

The Town &amp; Country was redesigned for the 2001 model-year, using the [[Chrysler S platform#RS|Chrysler RS platform]] and initially only available in long-wheelbase (LWB) form.&lt;ref name="consumerguideauto.com"&gt;[http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2001-to-2004-chrysler-town-country.htm "2001-2004 Chrysler Town &amp; Country"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020134650/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2001-to-2004-chrysler-town-country.htm |date=October 20, 2010 }}, retrieved on 2011–08–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysler's short-wheelbase minivan was instead sold under the [[Chrysler Voyager|Voyager]] nameplate, which had been transferred to the Chrysler brand in mid-2000 from the Plymouth brand. After 2003, however, the Voyager nameplate was dropped altogether, and short-wheelbase(SWB)models once again joined the Town &amp; Country lineup.&lt;ref name="consumerguideauto.com"/&gt; The fourth generation Town &amp; Country went on sale in January 2000 as a 2001 model.

Trim levels for 2001 were carried over from the previous generation.&lt;ref name="consumerguideauto.com"/&gt; This meant entry-level '''LX''', mid-level '''LXi''', and the range-topping '''Limited'''. By 2002, the value-packed '''eL''' and '''eX''' models had both been added. These models were both value-priced versions of the LX and LXi, respectively, with popular option packages.&lt;ref name="edmunds.com"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.edmunds.com/chrysler/town-and-country/2002/?sub=minivan |title=2002 Chrysler Town &amp; Country|publisher= Edmunds|accessdate=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2004 saw the addition of an unnamed base short-wheelbase model. LX, LXi, and Limited were the Canadian trim levels, but only the LXi and Limited were sold to consumers, LX restricted to fleet sales.

The 2005 Town &amp; Country received a mid-cycle refresh including revised exterior styling and a mildly restyled interior. Most notable, was the introduction of ''Stow'n Go'', a system of second and third row seating that folded completely into under-floor compartments. The addition of Stow'n Go resulted in redesigned 2nd and 3rd row seats, as well as the elimination of all-wheel drive. The Stow'n Go system was prominently featured in this model's marketing campaign. For the remainder of this generation, the Town &amp; Country was available in the short-wheelbase base model, and long-wheelbase LX, '''Touring''', and Limited models.&lt;ref&gt;[http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2005-chrysler-town-and-country.htm "2005 Chrysler Town &amp; Country"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110730005022/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2005-chrysler-town-and-country.htm |date=July 30, 2011 }}, retrieved on 2011–08–22.&lt;/ref&gt; As with the pre-refresh model, only the Touring and Limited were sold to consumers in Canada, the LX being restricted to fleets. A driver's side knee airbag was now standard on all models. The front seat-mounted side airbags of previous years were discontinued in favor of side-curtain airbags for all three rows. These were standard on Limited trim and optional on all other models, however could not be ordered with the moonroof option. Uconnect Bluetooth phone pairing was now available, as well as an overhead rail storage system with three moveable or removable compartments.

===2008 model year===
Chrysler debuted the 2008 model year Town &amp; Country went on sale on August 16, 2007 as a 2008 model. The short-wheelbase model was discontinued.

The minivans featured styling by [[Ralph Gilles]], a six-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]], a new 4.0&amp;nbsp;L V6 engine as standard on the Limited model &amp;mdash; and a system of second row seats that swiveled to face the third row &amp;mdash; marketed as ''Swivel'n Go'' seating. A small table, which stored in the bins below the floor, could be positioned between the two rear rows when they were facing each other. Much like its competitors, the [[Toyota Sienna]] and [[Honda Odyssey (North America)|Honda Odyssey]], the Town &amp; Country now featured power windows on the sliding doors and moved the gear shift from the steering column to the center console, in a higher position. Another new feature of this generation was an available rear overhead console which featured LED map lights as well as halo ambient lighting. A new DVD system was also available, which featured dual screens for the rear passengers. SIRIUS Backseat TV was also offered, which featured three channels of children's programming.

A version of this vehicle is sold in several export markets (Australia/South Africa/Middle East/China/Singapore/Russia) as the [[Chrysler Voyager|Chrysler Grand Voyager]]. In Europe it is known as the [[Lancia]] Voyager from the 2011 model year and up. Before 2011 it was sold as a Chrysler. Since 1991, the model has been sold in the Philippines under the Town and Country nameplate. In the European and Filipino markets, it is equipped with a 2.8L turbodiesel engine and 6-speed transmission as standard.

==Seating innovation==
Chrysler has regularly innovated new seating systems for their minivans, to enhance interior flexibility.

===Quad command===
Introduced in 1990 for the 1991 model year, Chrysler marketed 2nd row "captains chairs" as a substitute to the "partial bench" 2nd row seat.

===Integrated child safety seats===
In 1991 introduced a second row bench seat integrating two child booster seats.  These seats have continued as an available option through Generation 5.

===Easy-Out Roller Seats===
In 1995, Chrysler introduced a system of seats to simplify installation, removal, and re-positioning&amp;mdash; marketed as ''Easy-Out Roller Seats''. When installed, the seats are latched to floor-mounted strikers. When unlatched, eight rollers lift each seat, allowing it to be rolled fore and aft. Tracks have locator depressions for rollers, thus enabling simple installation. Ergonomic levers at the seatbacks release the floor latches single-handedly without tools and raise the seats onto the rollers in a single motion. Additionally, seatbacks were designed to fold forward.  Seat roller tracks are permanently attached to the floor and seat stanchions are aligned, fascillitating the longitiudinal rolling of the seats. Bench seat stanchions were moved inboard to reduce bending stress in the seat frames, allowing them to be lighter.

When configured as two- and three-person benches (available through Generation IV), the Easy Out Roller Seats could be unwieldy.  Beginning in 2000, second- and third-row seats became available in a 'quad' configuration &amp;mdash; bucket or captain chairs in the second row and a third-row three-person 50/50 split "bench" &amp;mdash; with each section weighing under 50&amp;nbsp;lbs. The Easy-out system remained in use through Generation V &amp;mdash; where certain models featured a two-person bench ''and'' the under-floor compartments from the ''Stow'n Go'' system.

The [[Volkswagen Routan]], a [[badge engineered|rebadged nameplate variant]] of the Chrysler minivans, used the Easy Out Roller Seats on its second-row seating.  These were made available on upper trims the Town and Country after the discontinuation of the Swivel 'n Go seats.

=== Stow'n Go seating===
In 2005, Chrysler introduced a system of second- and third-row seating that folded completely into under-floor compartments &amp;mdash; marketed as ''Stow 'n Go'' seating and exclusively available on long-wheelbase models.

In a development program costing $400 million,&lt;ref name="ameinfo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chrysler extends leadership in Mideast minivan segment with 'Stow 'n Go' |publisher=Ameinfo.com |url=http://www.ameinfo.com/53687.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130325175844/http://www.ameinfo.com/53687.html |archivedate=March 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; engineers used an [[erector set]] to initially help visualize the complex interaction of the design&lt;ref name="pressrel1"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Chrysler Group Brings Minivan Segment's Only Stow 'n Go Seating And Storage System to Market in Just 18 Months |author=Chrysler |work=PR Newswire |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/01-05-2004/0002083064&amp;EDATE= |accessdate=March 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417042753/http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F01-05-2004%2F0002083064&amp;EDATE= |archive-date=April 17, 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and redesigned underfloor components to accommodate the system &amp;mdash; including the spare tire well, fuel tank, exhaust system, parking brake cables, rear climate control lines, and the rear suspension.&lt;ref name="pressrel1"/&gt;  Even so, the new seating system precluded incorporation of an AWD system, effectively ending that option for the Chrysler minivans.

The system in turn creates a combined volume of {{convert|12|cuft|L}} of under floor storage when second row seats are deployed. With both rows folded, the vans have a flat load floor and a maximum cargo volume of {{convert|160.7|cuft|L}}.&lt;ref name="ameinfo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stowngopressrelease"&gt;http://www.media.chrysler.com/newsrelease.do?id=129&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stow 'n Go system received ''Popular Science'' magazine's "Best of What's New" for 2005 award.&lt;ref name="autointell"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stow 'n Go Minivan Technology Awarded Popular Science Magazine's "Best of What's New" for 2005 |publisher=Autointell.com |url= http://www.autointell.com/News-2004/November-2004/Nov-2004-3/Nov-17-04-p3.htm |date=17 November 2004 |accessdate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stow 'n Go system was not offered on the (now discontinued) [[Volkswagen Routan]], a [[badge engineering|rebadged nameplate variant]] of the Chrysler minivans.

The Stow 'n Go seating and storage system in the Town &amp; Country and [[Dodge Grand Caravan]] was improved, revised and renamed "Super Stow 'n Go" for the 2011 model year.  This system is still on the Grand Caravan and was adapted for the new Pacifica.

===Swivel 'n Go===
Chrysler introduced a seating system in 2008, marketed as ''Swivel'n Go''. In the system, the two second row [[Swivel seat|seats swivel]] to face the third row. A detachable table can be placed between the second and third row seats.  Swivel'n Go is available with Stow 'n Go seating after 2008 models.  The Swivel 'n Go system is offered on the [[Dodge Caravan]], but not the [[Volkswagen Routan]], a [[badge engineering|rebadged nameplate variant]] of the Chrysler minivans.

These Swivel 'n Go Seats were manufactured by Intier Corp. a division of Magna. The tracks, risers and swivel mechanisms are assembled by Camslide, a division of Intier. The swivel mechanism was designed by and is produced by [[Toyo Seat]] USA Corp.

The system is noted for its high strength{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}. The entire load of the seat in the event of a crash is transferred through the swivel mechanism, which is almost twice as strong as the minimum government requirement.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The swivel mechanism includes bumpers that stabilize the seat while in the lock position. When rotated the seat comes off these bumpers to allow easy rotation.

The seat is not meant to be left in an unlocked position or swiveled with the occupant in it, although this will not damage swivel mechanism.

Swivel 'n Go was dropped from the 2011 line of Chrysler and Dodge minivans due to a lack of consumer interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.autonews.com/article/20101129/OEM01/311299953/1250 |title=Swivel 'n . . . gone |journal=Automotive News |date=29 November 2010 |accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minivan production==
Chrysler Town &amp; Country and Dodge Grand Caravan minivans with ''Stow 'n Go'' &amp; ''Swivel 'n Go'' seats are built in [[Windsor, Ontario]].

Two plants have had the task of building the Town &amp; Country, with [[Saint Louis Assembly]] building it from 1989 to 2001, and Windsor from 2001 to the present. As of May 2006, [[Windsor Assembly]] will be the lead producer of the [[Chrysler RT platform|RT]], but will not fully take over until 2009 when they phase out current production of the Pacifica (CS). [[Saint Louis Assembly]] minivan plant was closed in October 2008 making Windsor the sole producer of the Chrysler Town &amp; Country and Dodge Grand Caravan.

Taiwanese-market Town &amp; Country minivans were assembled in [[Yangmei District|Yangmei]], [[Taiwan]] under license by the [[China Motor Corporation]], starting with the 2006 model year.

From 1991 to 2007 [[Chrysler Voyager|Chrysler Voyager/Grand Voyager]] cars were assembled in Austria and sold out in Europe and in many other global markets. Since 2008 the European-Version is also produced in Ontario, although [[diesel engine]]s are still available, and the trim is also different. From the outside the cars look very similar to the North American ''Town &amp; Country'' Model, but are sold as the ''Chrysler Grand Voyager''.

The Town &amp; Country is also marketed in Mexico, [[Venezuela]], and from 2011 on, in [[Brazil]], as it was previously sold there rebadged as the Chrysler Caravan.

==Town &amp; Country Plug-in hybrid==
[[File:Chrysler Town and Country EV.jpg|thumb|right|Chrysler Town &amp; Country EV]]
In September 2008, Chrysler unveiled a [[plug-in hybrid]] version of the Town &amp; Country along with similarly engineered 4-door [[Jeep Wrangler]] and a purely electric sports car.  The Town &amp; Country prototype had an [[all-electric range]] of {{convert|40|mi|km|adj=on}} before gasoline starts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martinez|first1=James|title=Chrysler minivan plug-in hybrid promises 40 mile electric only range|url=https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1029794_chrysler-minivan-plug-in-hybrid-promises-40-mile-electric-only-range|website=Motor Authority|accessdate=May 14, 2018|date=September 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in November 2009 [[Fiat SpA]] disbanded Chrysler's [[Envi (automobile)|ENVI]] electric car division and dropped these models from future product plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-BusinessofGreen/idUSTRE5A605N20091107 |title=Chrysler dismantles electric car plans under Fiat |author=Kevin Krolicki |date=2009-11-06 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=2009-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A two-year demonstration program with 25 [[flexible-fuel vehicle|flexible-fuel]] plug-in minivans began in April 2012. The first Town and Country were delivered in [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]] and [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. The {{USD|26}}-million demonstration project is partially financed by a {{USD|10}} million  grant from the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE). The plug-in hybrid minivans are equipped with an [[E85]]-compatible 3.6-liter Pentastar engine mated to a front-wheel-drive, with two-mode hybrid transmission. The plug-in hybrid is powered by a liquid-cooled 12.1 [[KWh]] [[lithium-ion battery]] that delivers a total output of 290 horsepower. The total vehicle range is {{convert|700|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://green.autoblog.com/2012/04/18/chrysler-delivers-first-plug-in-minivans-in-26m-demonstration-p/ |title=Chrysler delivers first plug-in minivans in $26m demonstration project |first=Danny |last=King |publisher=Autoblog Green |date=18 April 2012 |accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2012/04/18/chrysler-group-sends-more-plug-in-hybrid-chrysler-minivans-to-duke-energy/ |title=Chrysler Group Sends More Plug-In Hybrid Chrysler Minivans To Duke Energy |date=18 April 2012 |first=Matt |last=Roush |work=CBS Detroit |accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A plug-in hybrid version of the [[Chrysler Pacifica (2017)|next-generation Chrysler minivan]] launched in the U.S. in late 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20141006/OEM05/141009866/hybrid-chrysler-minivan-will-hit-market-in-15-a-year-early|title=Hybrid Chrysler minivan will hit market in '15, a year early |author=Larry P.

;Fire incident
{{See also|Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents}}
In September 2012 Chrysler temporarily suspended the demonstration program. All 109 [[Dodge Ram 1500 Plug-in Hybrid]]s and 23 Chrysler Town &amp; Country plug-in hybrids deployed by the program were recalled due to damage sustained by three separate pickup trucks when their 12.9 [[kWh]] battery packs overheated. The carmaker plans to upgrade the battery packs with cells that use a different lithium-ion chemistry before the vehicles go back on service. Chrysler explained that no one was injured from any of the incidents, and the vehicles were not occupied at the time, nor any of the minivans were involved in any incident, but they were withdrawn as a precaution. The demonstration is a program jointly funded by Chrysler and the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] that includes the first-ever factory-produced vehicles capable of reverse power flow. The experimental system would allow fleet operators to use their plug-in hybrids to supply electricity for a building during a power outage, reduce power usage when electric rates are high or even sell electricity back to their utility company.&lt;ref name=Chrysler&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1079368_chrysler-yanks-plug-in-hybrid-test-fleet-off-roads-will-replace-batteries |title=Chrysler Yanks Plug-In Hybrid Test Fleet Off Roads, Will Replace Batteries |first=John |last=Voelcker |publisher=Green Car Reports |date=24 September 2012 |accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company reported that the demonstration fleet had collectively accumulated 1.3 million miles (2.1 million km) before the vehicles were recalled. Chrysler also reported that the plug-in pickups delivered peak average fuel economy of {{convert|37.4|mpgUS|abbr=on}}, while the plug-in hybrid minivans delivered {{convert|55.0|mpgUS|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Chrysler/&gt;

The '''Chrysler Town &amp; Country''' is a [[station wagon]] that was manufactured by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] from 1940 to 1942 and from 1945 to 1988 (there was no production during [[World War II]] from 1943 to 1945). The [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country (pre-1990)|Town &amp; Country]] was also available in four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]], two-door [[hardtop]] (no "B" pillar), and [[convertible]] body styles from 1947 to 1950 and from 1983 to 1986. The 1988 model year was the last for the [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country (pre-1990)|Town &amp; Country]] [[station wagon]], after that and partly during one model year (1989), the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country (pre-1990)|Town &amp; Country]] nameplate was off the market until the 1990 model year run when Chrysler re-introduced the Town &amp; Country nameplate as a [[badge engineering|rebadged variant]] [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] [[minivan]].

Chrysler's Town &amp; Country wagon was reintroduced as a four door station wagon of all steel construction in 1951.  It was offered in both Windsor and New Yorker variants through the end of Windsor model production after the 1960 model year, and then in Newport and New Yorker models through 1965.  After that, it was a model in its own right, with trim and features which bridged the gap between the two sedan lines.  It was distinguished by luxury features including a carpeted loadfloor trimmed with chrome strips, and from 1968 forward, woodgrain paneling on the body sides and tailgate, a feature also associated with somewhat competitive top-shelf station wagons such as the [[AMC Ambassador]], [[Buick Estate]], [[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]], [[Ford Country Squire]], and the [[Mercury Colony Park]].  Town and Country, however, stood in a class by itself until the last of the full-sized versions of 1977.  From 1978, it was sized down and absorbed into the LeBaron series, with a lesser version lacking the more luxurious features and the woodgrain bodyside decals available for a few years in the early 1980s.

[[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] re-introduced the Town &amp; Country nameplate in calendar year 1989 as a luxury [[badge engineering|rebadged variant]] of the [[Dodge Grand Caravan]]/[[Plymouth Grand Voyager]] [[minivan]] for the 1990 model year and continued to sell this incarnation of the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] until the end of the 2016 model year when [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] reintroduced the Pacifica nameplate for their minivan in calendar year 2016 for the 2017 model year run.

A simulated woodgrain appearance reappeared on other Chrysler products, such as the 1993 [[Jeep Grand Cherokee (ZJ)#Jeep Grand Wagoneer (1993)|Jeep Grand Wagoneer (ZJ)]] and the [[Chrysler PT Cruiser]].

'''1941'''&lt;br&gt;
During the 1941 model year, the 1941 [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] Town &amp; Country 4-door 8-passenger [[station wagon]] made its debut as the first [[woodie (car body style)|woodie]] with an all-steel roof.  It used the roof of the concurrent [[Chrysler Imperial]] 4-door 8-passenger limousine, which led to a rear loading configuration with wooden double doors (also called 'Barrel Back' doors) that opened out from the center beneath the fixed backlight (rear window).

'''1942'''&lt;br&gt;
[[File:1942 Chrysler Town &amp; Country 'Barrel Back' Station Wagon p2.JPG|thumb|left|1942 Chrysler Town &amp; Country 4-door 8-passenger wagon (pre-war)]]
The 1942 model year Town &amp; Country had an abbreviated production run due to the U.S.' entry into World War II.  Less than one-thousand units had been produced since the vehicle's introduction a year earlier.

|layout=[[FR layout]]
}}

'''1946'''&lt;br&gt;
After [[World War II]], the Town &amp; Country nameplate returned, though the 4-door 8-passenger wagon never did.  Only the 1946 Town &amp; Country 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] and the 1946 Town &amp; Country 2-door [[convertible]] were offered; however, the 1946 Town &amp; Country sales brochure also described and illustrated a [[roadster (automobile)|roadster]], a 2-door sedan called the Brougham, and a 2-door hardtop called the Custom Club Coupe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/chrysler/46tc/46tc.html&lt;/ref&gt; None of those three additional body styles progressed beyond the prototype stage.

During three model years later (1949), General Motors would claim the distinction of total mass-production of the first pillarless 2-door [[hardtop]] offering; however, Chrysler built seven pre-production Town &amp; Country cars of this body style during the 1946 model year, of which only one survives today.  The last true original Chrysler Town &amp; Country 2-door hardtop woodie offering, ever, would go into full production during four model years later (1950).

'''1947'''&lt;br&gt;
During the 1947 model year, the 1947 Town &amp; Country 4-door sedan and the 1947  2-door convertible each carried over with just a few improvements over the previous model year (1946).

'''1948'''&lt;br&gt;
During the 1948 model year, while the 1948 Town &amp; Country 4-door sedan was in its last model year of production ever after only a three-model-year production run (since the 1946 model year), the 1948 Town &amp; Country 2-door convertible carried over with just very few improvements over the previous model year (1947).

'''1949'''&lt;br&gt;
The 1949 Town &amp; Country 2-door convertible, which carried over with so very few improvements over the previous model year (1948){{fact|date=March 2020}}, was in its last model year of production, which was the only Chrysler Town &amp; Country offering during the 1949 model year after a four-model-year production run (since the 1946 model year), during the next model year (1950), Chrysler would produce the last true woodie offering&amp;mdash;ever&amp;mdash;as the Town &amp; Country 2-door hardtop. The cars for 1949 were first Chrysler's new postwar designs, with a longer wheelbase (131.5 in), based upon the New Yorker model.&lt;ref&gt;J. "Kelly" Flory (2008). ''American Cars, 1946–1959: Every Model, Year by Year''. McFarland &amp; Company. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-3229-5}}. p. 196-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1950'''&lt;br&gt;
The 1950 Town &amp; Country 2-door hardtop was the last true original [woodie offering, ever, during its one-model-year production run, especially since production on all true original Chrysler Town &amp; Country woodie offerings all ceased during the end of the 1950 model year.

The 1950 [[Crosley]] Hot Shot is often given credit for the first production [[disc brakes]] but the [[Chrysler Imperial|Chrysler Imperial Crown]] actually had them first as standard equipment at the start of the 1949 model year.&lt;ref name="Langworth 1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|title=Chrysler and Imperial: The Postwar Years|publisher=Motorbooks International|year=1994|isbn=0-87938-034-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;The [[Chrysler]] 4-wheel disc brake system was built by Auto Specialties Manufacturing Company  (Ausco) of [[St. Joseph, Michigan]], under patents of inventor H.L. Lambert, and was first tested on a 1939 [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]].&lt;ref name="Langworth 1996"/&gt; Unlike the caliper disc, the [[Ausco Lambert disc brake|Ausco-Lambert]] utilized twin expanding discs that rubbed against the inner surface of a cast iron brake drum, which doubled as the brake housing.&lt;ref name="Langworth 1996"/&gt; 

The Ausco-Lambert disc brake was complex, and because of the expense, the brakes were only standard on the Chrysler Crown Imperial through 1954 and the Town and Country Newport in 1950.&lt;ref name="Langworth 1996"/&gt; They were optional, however, on other Chryslers, priced around $400, at a time when an entire Crosley Hot Shot retailed for $935.&lt;ref name="Langworth 1996"/&gt;

After the woodies were discontinued, the Town &amp; Country name was immediately transferred to a steel-bodied [[full-size]] [[rear wheel drive]] [[station wagon]], coinciding with the debut of the company's first [[V8 engine|V8]] engine (then called FireDome, but later dubbed HEMI). This wagon introduced several firsts, including roll-down rear windows for [[Trunk_(automobile)#Door|tailgate]]s for 1951 and rear-facing third row seats for 1957. 

The 1951 Town &amp; Country wagons were offered in the [[Chrysler Windsor|Windsor]], [[Chrysler Saratoga|Saratoga]] and [[Chrysler New Yorker|New Yorker]] series. The New Yorker version disappeared for 1952, but reappeared for 1953 when the Saratoga series was dropped. The Windsor version lasted through 1960, then was moved to the new [[Chrysler Newport|Newport]] series for 1961; the New Yorker edition continued through 1965.  Then for 1969, the Town &amp; Country became a series in its own right.

For model years 1960 through 1962, the New Yorker Town and Country remained on the 126 inch wheelbase, while first the Windsor then the Newport Town and Country models rode a wheelbase of 122 inches.  These were the roomiest factory-bodied, automobile-based station wagons on the market at the time.  Six roof pillar [[hardtop]] styling was available on these cars.  These were the first large wagons, and among the largest automobiles ever built, with unibody construction.

For 1963, all Chrysler models including New Yorker standardized on the shorter Newport 122 inch wheelbase.  Both New Yorker and Newport trim level Town and Country wagons continued as four-door hardtops through 1964, making Chrysler the last American station wagons offered in this short-lived configuration.  Powertrains and standard equipment remained familiar.  A 340 hp 4-BBL 413 cu.in. V8 with pushbutton Torqueflite AT, plus power steering and power brakes remained standard on the New Yorker T&amp;C.  The Newport T&amp;C shared that model’s standard 265 hp 2-BBL 361 cu. in. V8 with 3-speed synchromesh transmission and floor shifter.  Both continued to offer 6 and 9 passenger variants, plus a long list of optional equipment.  The New Yorker remained unique among large American wagons, offering the option of bucket front seats with center cushion and folding armrest.

All of Chrysler’s full sized cars, except the Imperial, received major makeovers for the 1965 model year. They were the work of Chief of Design, Elwood Engel, who was hired away from Ford Motor Company a few years earlier. The unitized body and chassis, with longitudinal front torsion bars and rear leaf springs carried over from the prior generation.

Automatic transmission equipped cars dropped the dashboard pushbutton shift control, and converted to the new industry standard PRNDL sequence shift lever, either column or floor mounted.  Dodge and Chrysler models shared passenger compartment structures, thus interior dimensions were essentially identical. The Town and Country wagons shared the {{convert|121|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase and design with Plymouth and Dodge wagons, while other Chysler body styles rode on a {{convert|3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} longer wheelbase. However, the wagons had the same overall length as sedans, at just under {{convert|220|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. All Chrysler brand models and body styles featured rear wheel opening skirts, including the Town &amp; Country.
 
Thin pillars and tall glass shared with 4 door sedans made for generous space and outward visibility. Straight roof rails on the long roof rack had adjustable cross bars.  All Newport models including wagons had a larger standard engine for 1965:  The 3.375” stroke LB engine was bored to 4.25” yielding 383 cubic inches.  With a 2BBL carburetor and single exhaust, the regular fuel 383 produced 270 HP.  A premium fuel 383 engine with 4BBL and dual exhausts producing 305 HP was an available option.    New Yorker wagons continued to feature the 413 cu. in. 4BBL V8, Torqueflite automatic transmission, plus power steering and power brakes as standard equipment.  Both trim levels were available in 6 or 9 passenger versions.  However, this was the last year that wagons would be available in either New Yorker or Newport trim levels.

For 1966, Town &amp; Country would become a model designation for the one and only wagon in the Chrysler lineup.  Exterior trim was similar to the Newport series, with unique taillights.  The vinyl bench seat interior shared features with both the Newport and New Yorker series, with the front seat center armrest standard, and simulated woodgrain on the dashboard, resulting in a level of standard trim intermediate between the two sedan series.  Individual buckets with center armrest and passenger recliner from the New Yorker option list remained available for one more model year.  Chrysler’s 2BBL regular fuel 383 V8 became the standard engine, with the 4BBL, dual exhaust, premium fuel 383 V8 available as an option, as on Newport.  Unlike Newport, power steering, power brakes and Torqueflight automatic transmission were standard equipment.  New in all Chryslers for 1966, the 3.75” stroke RB engine was bored to 4.32” yielding 440 cubic inches.  With a 10.0:1 compression ratio, premium fuel, a 4BBL carb and dual exhausts, the 440 cu. in. V8 produced 350 HP and was the top power option for Town &amp; Country.  Also available for the first time on all large Chryslers were front disc brakes, which required 15” wheels with unique wheel covers.  With optional front discs, T&amp;C wagons wore size 8.45x15 extra load range tires.  With standard drum brakes, tire size was 9.00x14.

In 1967, exterior sheetmetal for all large Chryslers was new, with concave side cove as a key design element.  Interiors were updated with a new instrument panel, perfectly symmetrical in shape and featuring an inverted fan style speedometer.  Chassis dimensions and the greenhouses for 4-door sedans and wagons carried over unchanged.  A single Town &amp; Country model in two or three seat versions was offered.  The exterior trim matched the Newport series.  Interior trim again split the difference between Newport and New Yorker, and featured a standard all vinyl notchback bench seat with folding center armrest, and the New Yorker's simulated woodgrain applique on the dashboard.  A new seating option was Chrysler’s 50/50 3-in-1 split bench seat, shared with the Newport Custom sedan.  Standard and optional powertrains remained the same.  Sales literature for 1967 showed front disc brakes as standard equipment on Town &amp; Country, along with the requisite 15” wheels, 8.45x15 extra load tires, and restyled “disc brake” wheel covers.  However, many ‘67 had 14” wheels and Newport wheel covers because they had drum brakes.  These wagons wore size 8.85x14 tires.

For 1968, all new US cars were equipped with front and rear side marker lights.  Chrysler bumpers, grille, hood, deck lid, rear fascia and lamps all changed significantly, although side sheet metal, wagon tailgate and rear lamps remained the same.  Functionally, there were few changes.  Better breathing cylinder heads boosted output of the standard 383 cu. in. 2BBL V8 to 290 HP.  Front disc brakes returned to the options list, while front drum brakes and size 8.85x14 tires were standard.  Inside, standard notchback and optional 50/50 front seats continued, sharing seat and door trim patterns with the Newport Custom series. The big change in Town &amp; Country appearance came in the form of simulated walnut grain paneling, filling the coved portion of the body sides and surrounded by a stainless steel molding.  The wood paneling was standard on all Town &amp; Country wagons, with a delete option offered

The original Town &amp; Country genuine wood was available on coupes and convertibles as well as wagons, the simulated wood panels were offered as an option on Newport 2-door hardtop and convertible for 1968 and 1969 model years.

For 1969, a major restyle brought a dramatic new look to all full sized Chrysler Corporation cars.  Called "fuselage design", it featured a pronounced side curvature from the rocker panels all the way to the roof rails.  Plymouth and Dodge models, excluding wagons, shared passenger compartment structures and greenhouses riding on 120” and 122” wheelbases respectively.  Similarly, Chrysler and Imperial models, excluding T&amp;C wagon, shared slightly longer passenger compartments and greenhouses, riding on 124” and 127” wheelbases respectively (all of the Imperial’s longer wheelbase was in the front clip).  As in the prior generation, all Chrysler Corp. full sized wagons shared a common greenhouse on a unitized body and chassis with longitudinal front torsion bars, rear leaf springs and the Dodge’s 122” wheelbase.  And, as before, the wagon’s shorter wheelbase was offset by additional rear overhang.  1969 Town and Country wagons were nearly identical to other Chrysler body styles in overall length at just under 225”.

Fuselage era Chryslers all featured a full width loop style chrome front bumper.  Quad headlamps and grille were recessed inside the loop, with differing grille inserts for each series.  Turn signal and parking lamps were recessed into the bumper below the head lamps.  Body sides were simple and smooth with a subtle character line originating at the front bumper, descending slightly for the length of the car, and ending at the wrap-around rear bumper.  On Town and Country wagons, this character line was also the location of the lower molding surrounding the standard wood grain side paneling, simulated cherry for 1969.  The fuselage profile extended the length of a full sized “long roof” made for a rather striking looking wagon.  At the trailing edge of the long roof, body sides, D pillars, and a unique roof top air foil formed one continuous arch over the tailgate opening.  The airfoil directed airflow from the roof downward and over the tail gate window, intended to keep the glass clear of dirt accumulation.  

Town and Country’s grille insert and wheel covers for this new generation were from the New Yorker, while front seating choices and interior trim were again drawn from the Newport Custom.  The new instrument panel featured a symmetrical padded loop echoing the design theme of the front end.  The inverted fan style speedometer from 1967 &amp; 68 continued, balanced on the passenger side by a large glove box door.  A unique Chrysler feature was floodlighting of the instruments and controls instead of more typical back lighting.  The effect met with mixed reviews over several model years.

For 1969, ALL full sized Chrysler Corp vehicles returned to standard 15” wheels.  This accommodated the growing share of cars equipped with front disc brakes, which were updated to a new simpler and less costly single piston sliding caliper design from the earlier 4-piston fixed caliper type.   Once again, Chrysler sales literature listed power front disc brakes as standard equipment on Town and Country.  But, once again, some left the factory with front drum brakes instead.  Regardless of brake type, all T&amp;Cs wore standard size 8.85x15 tires on 6.5”x15” heavy duty rims.  Powertrain choices for Town and Country remained unchanged.

Chrysler played catch-up on some wagon specific features in 1969:  The tailgate became a two-way door-gate, able to swing sideways or drop downward, a feature Ford had pioneered in 1965.  And, the rear axle track was widened nearly {{convert|3|in|mm}} to 63.4”, enabling a full 48.5” wide load floor between the wheel wells, a feature GM had pioneered, also in 1965.  Chrysler sought to leapfrog those competitors with a few wagon only features of its own, including passenger assist handles integrated into the rear opening trim molding, and a tailgate window washer, contained entirely inside the tailgate.

After so many changes in the prior year, it is no surprise that there were few changes for 1970.  Most US makes including Chrysler adopted bias belted tires.  They were a short-lived hybrid that combined familiar soft riding bias body plies with tread stabilizing belts used in European style radial tires.  One well known brand name at the time was Goodyear’s Polyglas.   All 1970 Chryslers featured standard bias belted tires, with Town &amp; Country wagons wearing size J78-15.  J identified the second largest size available in load capacity, 78 indicated a cross-section height-to-width, or aspect ratio of 78%, and 15 being the nominal rim diameter in inches, as before.

A minor styling change found only on Town and Country for 1970 and 1971 was the addition of a dogleg or kink in the lower body side character line on the rearward half of each rear door.  Simulating a styling feature which had been seen on all 1967-1968 Chryslers, and which would return in 1974, this dogleg was simply a new shape for the woodgrain side trim, and involved no special sheet metal.  It served to distinguish Chrysler wagons from Dodge and Plymouth models using the same body.  Front disc brakes moved back to the option list one last time.

The late 1960s proved to be a financially challenging time for Chrysler Corporation, as tightening emissions standards and safely requirements spread resources thin.  Consequently, the biennial mid-cycle face-lift originally intended to be the new model year 1971 corporate large car lineup was postponed one year.  Thus, all 1971 Chryslers, including Town and Country, looked virtually unchanged from the prior year.  One interior change planned that did make it into the 1971 cars was the instrument panel surround… Its upper bolster became a bit more massive, while the lower bolster was reduced in size eliminating the lower ledge. and the glove box door received a color keyed overlay.  Standard tires for the wagons were enlarged to L84x15, a size shared with the Imperial, and unique to Chrysler Corp.  Torsion Quiet Ride, comprising a set of tuned rubber isolators for the front suspension sub-frame and rear leaf-spring mounts, was added to wagons.  It had been introduced as a new feature for all other Chrysler models and body styles in 1970.  And finally, for the third time, front disc brakes appeared on the Town and Country standard equipment list… this time for good.

Additional unseen changes were related to Federal Emission Standards and the requirement that ALL 1971 cars run on unleaded regular grade gasoline.  Compression ratios on all engines were reduced to ~8.5:1.  For just this year, engine power and torque specifications were advertised using both the familiar SAE gross rating method (for the last time), and SAE net rating method, which remains the standard today.  (Net ratings are more representative of engine output as-installed since they measure output when the engine is fully “dressed” with production intake and exhaust plumbing, cooling system, and accessory loads in place.)   Revised ratings for Town and Country engines were:  383 cu. In. 2-BBL V8:  275 (190 net) hp with 375 (305 net) lb-ft; 383 cu. In. 4-BBL V8:  300 (240 net) hp with 410 (310 net) lb-ft; 440 cu. In. 4-BBL:  335 (220 net) hp with 460 (350 net) lb-ft.  Dual exhaust systems were no longer used.

For 1972, the mid-cycle restyle originally intended for the prior year made its appearance.  The overall design of Chrysler models remained very similar.  The uni-body platform and all key dimensions remained unchanged.  The fuselage theme evolved toward an even simpler body side, still with a subtle rearward sloping character line, but with a squared off shoulder at the window sill.  The front bumper retained its loop form, adding a center divider splitting the grille into halves.  Greenhouses for all 4 door models remained unchanged, while two-door coupe rooflines grew more formal, and convertibles were dropped.  After many years of declining sales, the 300 series was eliminated, replaced by a New Yorker Brougham series with plusher interior choices and more standard equipment, slotted between the Imperial and New Yorker. 

Town and Country for 1972 borrowed most of its exterior trim from the New Yorker.  Die cast grille inserts were shared with New Yorker, and rear wheel openings once again wore fender skirts.  Brushed bright metal moldings about two inches wide ran the length of the car from front bumper to rear, and served as the lower border for the standard simulated wood grain side panels.  Standard wheel covers were shared with the Newport, and were identical to the 1969 wheel covers, then shared with the New Yorker.  Inside, the front seating choices and door trim were again shared with the Newport Custom. Seatbacks for the standard notch-back front seat featured a high back design with integral head rests.   And, Chrysler's two-way door-gate became a three-way, able to open as door with the glass up.
 
Unfortunately, as the Town and Country (and every other car in the ‘70s) grew heavier, available powertrain choices became fewer and weaker.  Compression ratios were further reduced to 8.2:1.  An increase in bore from 4.25” in the 383 to 4.34” produced a new LB series engine displacement of 400 cu. in.   With a 2-BBL carburetor, it just matched the 190 net horsepower and {{convert|310|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} net torque ratings of the prior year 383s.  The only remaining optional engine was the 440 cu. in. 4-BBL V8 producing 215 net horsepower and {{convert|345|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} net torque.  Even so, the updated Town and Country with its more imposing grille and nicely integrated fender skirts set sales records, with 6,473 six passenger and 14,116 nine passenger wagons produced for the model year.
[[File:Classic Days 2019, Berlin (CDB90143).jpg|thumb|left|1973 Town &amp; Country (rear view)]]
1973 was the 5th and final year of what had been planned as a four-year platform cycle.  A federal mandate to equip MY 1973 cars with bumpers that could absorb up to {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} impacts with no functional damage was a major challenge, since the large cars Chrysler Corp had designed to comply with this standard were delayed until MY 1974.  The stopgap solution was to replace the fuselage era signature loop front bumpers with a generic looking grille and conventional looking bumpers wearing large black rubber impact absorbers, front and rear.  The absorbers added more than five inches (127 mm)  to the overall length of every car, and unfortunately, looked like the afterthought that they were.  Apart from {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} bumpers, other changes for the 1973 Town and Country were few:  The 50/50 3 in 1 front seat had proven sufficiently popular that it became standard equipment, as did the higher torque 440 cu.in. V8 engine, which featured standard electronic ignition for the first time.

[[File:1975 Chrysler Town &amp; Country Station Wagon 7.2 Rear.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view]]
For model year 1974, Chrysler Corporation introduced its new large car lineup originally planned a year earlier.  The timing could hardly have been worse… The Arab oil embargo of late 1973 had Americans waiting in line for gasoline coast to coast, sometimes for hours.  Big cars quickly became a glut on the market, despite the fact that Chrysler’s new models were some of the best large cars Chrysler had produced in years.  The new styling was a clear departure from the fuselage generation, and appeared to share the proportions and design cues of GM’s 1971 large car redesign.  Body sides had a more pronounced tumble home.  A-pillars were thin, and beltlines were noticeable lower, yielding significantly more glass area.  Energy absorbing bumpers were nicely integrated into the designs, front and rear.

For this generation, full-sized Plymouths and Dodges, excluding wagons, shared more than just body shells.  They also shared a common 122” wheelbase, instrument panels, and most exterior body stampings.  Likewise, Chrysler and Imperial models shared slightly longer body shells on a common 124” wheelbase, plus instrument panels, and exterior body stampings.  And, once again, Chrysler Corporation wagons would share a common greenhouse across divisions… although this time, all wagons would roll on the longer Chrysler 124” wheelbase.  All remained large enough to swallow the ubiquitous 4x8 sheet of plywood flat on its floor with the three-way door-gate closed… no evidence of any attempt to follow GM’s clamshell style rear closure, fortunately.  The roof was slightly elevated aft of the C-pillar, and a body colored air deflector at the trailing edge remained a standard feature, although it was no longer integrated into the body structure.    Fully skirted rear wheel openings and simulated woodgrain side and doorgate panel appliqués remained standard equipment on all Town and Country wagons.

A significant safety improvement was achieved with relocation of the fuel tank from the left rear quarter where it had resided since the 1950s, to under the floor just behind the rear axle.  Under floor storage space was reduced on 2-seat wagons, but revisions in the 3rd seat folding mechanism minimized any compromises in seating utility.  The space freed up in the left rear quarter panel became a lockable storage compartment.

Although the overall size of 1974 Chryslers was barely larger than the fuselage generation that preceded it, weight continued to creep upward.  Additional emission controls, safety features, and growing standard equipment lists were having the same effect on every automaker.  The 3-seat T&amp;C tipped the scales at just under 5,000 pounds, about 300 pounds heavier than ’72 fuselage generation T&amp;C.  With air conditioning, and a typical complement of power assists, the average ’74 T&amp;C weighed about 5,200 pounds.  Standard tires were size L78x15 bias belted on size 6.5x15 inch rims.  Steel belted radials were optional.

For 1975, changes were few, and most were shared across the entire US industry, including Chrysler.  Those lower rolling resistance radial-ply tires became standard equipment, in size LR78x15 for the Town and Country.  Every Chrysler was equipped with an exhaust system catalytic converter for the first time, requiring no lead gasoline to run properly.  The 400 cu.in. 2BBL V8 engine returned as a fuel economy alternative to the still standard 440 engine.  And, as a minor appearance upgrade for all Chrysler models:  Lower instrument panels, steering columns, and steering wheels became color coordinated…  They had been black.  

1975 was a year of product line consolidation for Chrysler.  After 19 years of marketing Imperial  as a separate marque, Chrysler reluctantly conceded what sales statistics had told them for years…  A pair of highly trimmed Chryslers could not compete effectively with Cadillac, Lincoln, or the premium European brands capturing the attention of American  luxury car shoppers.  Chrysler pulled the plug on the [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]] brand, and recast most of the Imperial’s unique trim… waterfall grille, concealed headlamps, extended rear fenders, vertical tail lamps, and loose pillow seating… as the 1976 New Yorker Brougham.  Similarly, what had been New Yorker interior and exterior trim became the 1976 Newport Custom.  The Town and Country, unchanged inside and out, soldiered on.  It remained as large, elegant, and well equipped as ever, but the market’s interest in giant luxury station wagons was waning.

1977 would be the last year of Chrysler Town and Country as a traditional American full-sized premium station wagon.  Both GM and Ford would downsize and continue traditional big wagons, thru the 1980s for Ford, and into the 1990s for GM.  But at Chrysler, the beloved Town and Country moniker would take on new roles in new market segments.

From 1978 through 1981, the Town &amp; Country badge designated the simulated wood trimmed wagon model of the mid-sized Chrysler LeBaron series, built on the [[Chrysler M platform]], which included [[Plymouth Gran Fury]], [[Dodge Diplomat]], and [[Chrysler LeBaron]].   Although trimmed more elegantly inside and out, there were not many substantial differences in the [[chassis]] and [[powertrain]], between Chrysler's downsized intermediate line-up and its [[compact car|compact]] [[rear wheel drive]] [[Dodge Aspen]]/[[Plymouth Volare]] models introduced in 1976. Wheelbases, tread width, and interior dimensions were identical, leaving only front/rear overhangs and overall length to differentiate mid-sized from compact.

For model years 1982 through 1988, the Town &amp; Country name was featured on the [[station wagon|wagon]] version of the [[Chrysler K platform|K-body]] based [[front wheel drive]] [[Chrysler LeBaron|LeBaron]], featuring simulated woodgrain exterior trim.  A limited production [[convertible (car)|convertible]] version was manufactured for model years 1983 to 1986 and also featured simulated woodgrain paneling and was meant to reflect the classic look of original 1940s and early 1950s convertibles.  The convertibles came standard with Mark Cross leather interior.

Chrysler's [[Chrysler K platform|K-body]] platform models, including the LeBaron-based Town &amp; Countries, were eventually phased out by the late 1980s.  The Town &amp; Country name was briefly absent from the start of the 1989 model year, but returned for 1990 on a newly branded luxury [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] [[minivan]].  Like most Town &amp; Country models of the past, the new minivan also featured woodgrain exterior trim.

Initially planned for the 1989 model year, the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] returned in the spring of 1989 as an early 1990 model year introduction, only this time around, it became part of the new [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] luxury [[minivan]] line up, which was based on the [[Dodge Grand Caravan]] and [[Plymouth Grand Voyager]] [[minivan]] cousins, each of which, were added to [[Chrysler]]'s corporate [[minivan]] line up during the start of the 1987 model year as long wheelbase/extended length versions of their standard wheelbase/standard length [[Dodge Caravan]] and [[Plymouth Voyager]] [[minivan]] cousins, which had been introduced for the first time ever during the start of the 1984 model year line up.  After its return early in the start of the 1990 model year line up, the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] [[minivan]] has been redesigned for each of the 1991, the 1996, the 2001 and the 2008 model year line ups, with each following generation adding new technology and with numerous industry firsts.

The ''' Chrysler VF Valiant ''' is an [[automobile]] that was produced in [[Australia]] by [[Chrysler Australia]] from 1969 to 1970.&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; It was released in March 1969, replacing the [[Chrysler VE Valiant]].&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt;

==Changes==
The VF Valiant was a facelifted version of the [[VE Valiant]], featuring four new quarter panels, new lights and a new grille.&lt;ref name=Farmer_139_142&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, 2010, pages 139 to 142&lt;/ref&gt; Parking and indicator lights were now mounted above the headlights.&lt;ref name=Farmer_139_142/&gt; Seating, safety features and soundproofing were improved,&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;Tony Davis, Aussie Cars, 1987, page 106&lt;/ref&gt; Pacer and Regal 770 models were new and a [[hardtop]] body style was offered for the first time.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;

The hardtop combined the VF Valiant front, from the A-pillar forward, with the rear of the US [[Dodge Dart]].&lt;ref name=Farmer_139_142/&gt; This included the Dart floorpan with its 111-inch wheelbase.&lt;ref name=Farmer_139_142/&gt;

Coupe utilities retained the rear styling of the previous VE series with only the front styling revised.

==Model range==
The VF series Valiant was offered in 4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]], 2-door [[hardtop]],  5-door [[station wagon]] and 2-door [[coupe utility]] models.&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt;
* Valiant sedan&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; (VF-M41)
* Valiant hardtop&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; (VF-M23)
* Valiant Safari wagon&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; (VF-M45)
* Valiant Pacer sedan&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; (VF-S41)
* Valiant Regal sedan&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; (VF-H41)
* Valiant Regal hardtop&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; (VF-H23)
* Valiant Regal Safari wagon&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; (VF- H45)
* Valiant Regal 770 sedan&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; (VF-H41 shared with Regal)
* Valiant Regal 770 hardtop&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; (VF-H23 shared with Regal)
* Valiant utility&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; (VF-L20)
* Valiant Wayfarer utility&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; (VF-M20)

The hardtop models were introduced in September 1969.&lt;ref name=Farmer_139_142/&gt; There were also 20 Pacer station wagons built. These show up in production records as model code VF-S45.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, The History of Chrysler in Australia 1946-1981, page 409&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:TransportationWashingtonDullesAirport.jpg|thumb|A mobile lounge at Washington Dulles International Airport]]

A '''mobile lounge''' is a system for boarding and disembarking from [[aircraft]], using a bus-like vehicle.

==Purpose==
The mobile lounge was an innovative feature of the [[Washington Dulles]] terminal design by [[Eero Saarinen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/eerosaarinenshap0000saar | url-access=registration | page=[https://archive.org/details/eerosaarinenshap0000saar/page/304 304] | quote=Eero Saarinen mobile lounge. |
date= 2006 |
title=Eero Saarinen: Shaping the Future |
author1=Saarinen, Eero |
author2=Pelkonen, Eeva-Liisa |
author3=Albrecht, Donald |
publisher=Yale University Press |
isbn=097248812X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saarinen promoted the mobile lounge concept with a short animated film by [[Charles and Ray Eames]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Expanding Airport |url=http://vimeo.com/4139559 |author1=Eames, Charles |author2=Eames, Ray |publisher=The Office of Charles and Ray Eames |date=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dulles Airport was the realization of the concepts expressed in the film. Dulles's designers thought that by shuttling from the main terminal directly to a midfield [[jet ramp]], they could save passengers from long walking distances amidst weather, noise, and fumes on the ramp. The advent of the [[jet bridge]] and construction of the two midfield concourse buildings at this airport negated the benefits of the system.

==Application==
The mobile lounge is used at [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in [[Virginia]] and at [[Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport]] in Canada. The system was also used at [[Montreal Mirabel International Airport]], [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]'s International Terminal in [[New York City]], [[Mexico City Airport]] until 2007, and [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] in [[Paris]] before the 1990s and at [[King Abdulaziz International Airport]] in [[Jeddah]] until the early 2000s. While it is still used at Dulles Airport, the growth in passenger numbers made it impractical to use mobile lounges for individual flights.  Remote concourses were constructed, and the fleet of mobile lounges was used as a shuttle between the concourses and the main terminal.  On January 26, 2010, the [[MWAA]] replaced the Dulles mobile lounge system for passenger movements between the Main Terminal and the A-, B-, and C-Gates with the underground [[AeroTrain (Washington Dulles International Airport)|AeroTrain]].  However, some mobile lounges and plane mates remain in use for passenger movements between the main terminal and Concourse D (until the replacement Concourses C and D are built and the AeroTrain is built out to run in a continuous two-way loop), to disembark international passengers from all arriving international aircraft (with the exception of [[United Airlines]] and certain [[Star Alliance]] flights, which are directly serviced at Concourse C's Federal Inspection Station; and flights from airports with border preclearance) and carry them to the International Arrivals Building, and to convey passengers between the main terminal and aircraft on hard standing (i.e., those parked remotely on the tarmac without access to jet bridges).&lt;ref name="aerotrain"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/25/AR2010012502837.html|title=Passenger train goes into operation Tuesday at Dulles airport|last=Rein|first=Lisa|date=26 January 2010|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==

===Passenger Transfer Vehicle (PTV)===
The Passenger Transfer Vehicle or Passenger Transport Vehicle (PTV) (mobile lounge) is a 54-by-16-foot carriage mounted on a scissor truck, capable of carrying 102 passengers. These vehicles were designed by the [[Chrysler Corporation]] in association with the [[Budd Company]], and are sometimes [[nickname]]d "moon buggies" due to their otherworldly appearance.  When mobile lounges were first introduced, they had ramps at one end that could be raised or lowered to the floor height of an aircraft. However, after Dulles built the midfield concourses, some of the lounges were retrofitted to be used only for inter-terminal passenger transport. The ramps were removed and doors that could interlock with a terminal building were fitted to either end.  Mobile lounges have a driver's cab at each end.  The wheels at either end of the lounge can be steered, but the wheels at the end opposite the driver lock into a straight-ahead configuration so that the lounge is steered only by the forward driving wheels.

===Plane Mate===
The Plane Mate is an evolutionary variation on the mobile lounge concept. They are similar in appearance to mobile lounges, but can raise themselves on screws (parts of which are contained in a pair of fin-like towers above the vehicles) to "mate" directly with an aircraft. These are used at Dulles and Dorval. This allows passengers to deplane directly aboard and be carried to the main terminal. They are easily identified by the different window configuration. More noticeably, plane mates have two short columns on the roof with yellow beacons mounted on the top, and have an accordion-like canopy at one end (similar to the canopy seen at the end of a [[jet bridge]]) and have only one driver's cab and one set of steering wheels at the canopy end.

===NASA Crew Transport Vehicles===
Early in the space shuttle program, NASA used the Plane Mate system of mobile lounge to move [[astronaut]]s directly from the orbiter to crew facilities. A modified vehicle obtained from [[Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] was used for shuttle landings at [[Edwards Air Force Base]]. A similar vehicle was used at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] to take astronauts directly from the orbiter to the [[Kennedy Space Center#Facilities|Operations and Checkout building]], where the vehicle was again lifted up for the astronauts to exit directly onto the 2nd floor of the facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/luceneweb/caption_direct.jsp?photoId=S91-38869 JSC Digital Image Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217070209/http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/luceneweb/caption_direct.jsp?photoId=S91-38869 |date=2013-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/scripts/hardware/hardw.aspx?hardware_id=873 Hardware Information at NASA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714161740/http://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/scripts/hardware/hardw.aspx?hardware_id=873 |date=2014-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''' Chrysler AP5 Valiant ''' is an [[automobile]] which was produced by [[Chrysler Australia]] from 1963 to 1965.&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; It was the third [[Chrysler Valiant]] model to be produced in [[Australia]].

==Overview==
The AP5 Valiant was released in May 1963, replacing the [[SV1 Valiant]].&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; It was the first Valiant model to be manufactured in [[Australia]] rather than just assembled there.&lt;ref name=Unique_AP5&gt;[http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_chrysler_valiant_ap5.htm Chrysler Valiant AP5, www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au] Retrieved on 20 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The AP5 featured entirely new sheet-metal, with most body panels produced in Australia.&lt;ref name= Unique_AP5/&gt; It differed from the US [[Plymouth Valiant]] in having a six-bar grille,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valiant.org/ausval.html Australian Production (AP5 and AP6), www.valiant.org] Retrieved on 20 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; a larger boot with a different rear deck and a flat rear window.&lt;ref name= Unique_AP5/&gt; The 225 cid slant six engine was carried over from the SV1 model and remained fully imported.&lt;ref name= Unique_AP5/&gt; Suspension was substantially unchanged but employed softer rear springs.&lt;ref name= Unique_AP5/&gt;

The AP5 range was increased to include the up-market Valiant Regal which featured different badgework, better seats and interior trim, auto transmission as standard, a heater with integrated demister, carpets and white-wall tyres.&lt;ref name= Unique_AP5/&gt; In November 1963 Safari and Regal Safari station wagons were added to the range.&lt;ref name= Unique_AP5/&gt; The wagons shared mechanical components and front styling with the sedans and were fitted with heavier rear springs.&lt;ref name= Unique_AP5/&gt; US Plymouth Valiant wagon rear sheetmetal was used, resulting in different rear end styling depending on production dates. Early build AP5 wagons used 1963 Plymouth Valiant wagon horizontal style tail lights while later build wagons used 1964 Plymouth Valiant wagon vertical style tail lights.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Australia - 1962-1969 Valiant and V.I.P. Parts List - body section various pages&lt;/ref&gt; Both versions incorporated amber turn signals to comply with Australian regulations.

The AP5 was marketed by Chrysler Australia as the "Valiant by Chrysler"&lt;ref&gt;"Valiant by Chrysler" - Chrysler Australia sales brochure for the AP5 Valiant sedans&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Valiant by Chrysler" - Chrysler Australia advertisement for the AP5 Valiant sedans, Australian Motor Manual, December 1963, page 4&lt;/ref&gt; rather than as the Chrysler Valiant.

==Model range==
The AP5 Valiant was offered with 4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]] and 5-door [[station wagon]] body styles&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; in six models.&lt;ref name=Unique_AP5_Specs/&gt;

==Engines and transmissions==
A {{convert|225|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-six engine]] was fitted to all models.&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; Three speed manual and three speed "TorqueFlite" push button operated automatic transmissions were offered, with the latter fitted as standard on Regal models.&lt;ref name=Unique_AP5_Specs/&gt;

==Production and replacement==
A total of 49,440 AP5 Valiants were built prior to its replacement by the [[AP6 Valiant]] in February 1965.&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; Of this total, 37,292 were sedans and 12,148 were wagons.&lt;ref name=Farmer_418&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion – A History of Chrysler in Australia 1946-1981, page 418&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motor sport==
An AP5 Valiant driven by Tony Reynolds and Tony Allen won Class D in the [[1963 Armstrong 500]] endurance race at [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Mount Panorama, Bathurst]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/bathurst_1963.htm Armstrong 500 - Mount Panorama, Bathurst - 6 October 1963, www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au] Retrieved on 19 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chrysler Cirrus''' is a [[mid-size car|mid-size]]d 4-door [[notchback]] [[Sedan (automobile)#Notchback sedans|sedan]] introduced by Chrysler motors for the 1995 model year. Built on the [[Chrysler JA platform]], the 4-door [[notchback]] [[Sedan (automobile)#Notchback sedans|sedan]] joined Chrylser's roster of "Cloud Car" models drawing their names from [[meteorological]] terms, including the mid-priced [[Dodge Stratus]] it was based on introduced at the same time, and the low-priced [[Chrysler Cirrus#Plymouth Breeze|Plymouth Breeze]] variant a year later.

==Design==
Development of the Cirrus started in 1991, with the goal of creating an affordable, expressive looking, fun to drive vehicle that was still safe enough to transport an everyday family.&lt;ref name="allpar"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/model/cirrus.html |title=1995-2000 Dodge Stratus, Plymouth Breeze, and Chrysler Cirrus |work=allpar |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Completely flaunting the latter core criterion, the concept show vehicle featured rear [[suicide doors]] and a 400&amp;nbsp;hp turbocharged 3.0-liter two stroke engine.&lt;ref name="allpar"/&gt; Both the concept and production model used the [[Chrysler Corporation]]'s new [[cab-forward]] design, which was launched on the larger [[Chrysler LH platform|LH]] sedans in 1992. This [[Three-box styling|three-box]] design was characterized by a large passenger cabin in proportion to comparatively short hood and trunk, highlighted by a long, dramatically slanted windshield and short overhangs. Pushing the wheels further to the corners of the body created a much larger cabin than most other similarly sized vehicles of that time.

The a four-door [[notchback]] [[Sedan (automobile)#Notchback sedans|sedan]] was designed with flowing lines with no distinct beginning or end, but almost resembled a [[Three-box styling|two-box]] [[fastback]].&lt;ref name="allpar"/&gt; Design work was done during 1991, with the final version moved on for production by 1992.

==Features==
The Cirrus was introduced for 1995 as replacement for the [[Chrysler LeBaron]] sedan. It was often compared to other smaller [[mid-size car]]s such as the [[Chevrolet Malibu]], yet judged roomier than the [[Ford Contour]] by many magazines such as [[Consumer Reports]]. The exteriors of the Chrysler Cirrus, Dodge Stratus, and Plymouth Breeze were very similar, with the front [[Fascia (car)|fascia]], rear [[bumper (car)|bumper]], [[taillight]]s, and wheels being the main differences. The interiors had little variation between the three models; being almost identical, save for the name on the [[steering wheel]], and a few available options. The fascias of each JA car corresponds with each brand's [[minivan]] offering, sharing [[headlight]]s and [[Grille (car)|grille]] designs.

All three variants of the platform were available with most of the same standard features: [[four-wheel drive|four-wheel]] independent [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] (double wishbone in the front with a multilink rear), [[air conditioning]], tilt [[steering wheel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=''Old Cars Weekly'' Staff |title=Standard Catalog of Chrysler 1914-2000 |publisher=Krause Publications |year=2012 |isbn=9781440232367}}&lt;/ref&gt; and driver and front-passenger air bags and available options, such as the following: an optional four-speed [[automatic transmission]] ([[Autostick]] was not available on the Breeze), [[anti-lock brakes]], [[cruise control]], [[power window]]s, [[power door lock]]s, [[power mirror]]s, sunroof. A five-speed manual was available with the 2.0&amp;nbsp;L. The 2.4&amp;nbsp;L was not offered in a manual because of its high torque and difficult drivability issues, mainly due to wheel spinning.

[[File:1999-2000 Chrysler Cirrus.jpg|thumb|right|1999–2000 Chrysler Cirrus LXi]]
The Cirrus was originally available in two trim levels: the well-equipped base ''LX'' and the luxury ''LXi''. Both models featured sporty, black twin-post [[side mirror]]s, [[fog light]]s, the same [[bodyside moulding]]s, chrome bumper accents, an [[automatic transmission]] and a low extending [[Grille (car)|waterfall grille]] that was either chrome or body colored depending on color of the vehicle. The Cirrus was one of the first Chrysler vehicles to feature the rose medallion logo, which had not been used in 41 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/chrysler15.htm |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=How Chrysler Works |date=1 June 2007  |work=HowStuffWorks.com |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1995 to 1997, the Cirrus was offered in two trim levels: the entry-level LX and the luxury LXi. The LX model was dropped for the 1998 model year, but returned in 2000 to compensate for the [[Plymouth Breeze]] that was discontinued early in the 2000 model year. It was replaced by the 2001 [[Dodge Stratus]] sedan.

===Trim levels===
*''LX'' • 1995–1997; 2000
*''LXi'' • 1995–2000

===Trim Level Features===
LX: The '''LX''' was the base Chrysler Cirrus trim level. It included the following standard equipment: a 2.4L Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine, a four-speed automatic transmission, black steel wheels with plastic wheel covers, an A/M-F/M stereo with cassette player and six speakers, air conditioning, full instrumentation, power windows and door locks, exterior color-keyed side mirrors and door handles, and premium cloth seats.

LXi: The '''LXi''' was the top-of-the-line Chrysler Cirrus trim level. It added the following equipment to the already well-equipped '''LX''' trim level: alloy wheels, a premium A/M-F/M stereo with cassette player and integrated CD changer controls, keyless entry, chrome accents, a premium front grille, and woodgrain interior trim.

===Engines===
*2.4&amp;nbsp;L [[Straight-4|I4]]
*2.5&amp;nbsp;L [[V6 engine|V6]]

===Model year changes===
*'''1995''': The all-new Chrysler Cirrus sedan is launched in the United States and Canada in late 1994.
*'''1996''': Rear headrests were added.
*'''1997''': The 4-cylinder engine was made standard in both models, with the V6 as an option. The interior gained a new center console with a storage compartment and integrated armrest.
*'''1998''': The 4-cylinder engine and the LX trim level were eliminated, leaving only V6 LXi models.
*'''1999''': For its fifth model year, the Cirrus received a redesigned open grille with Chrysler's new winged grille badge. Chrysler's Sentry Key system was a new option. Sentry Key disabled the ignition unless the proper key was inserted. Standard {{convert|15|in|mm|adj=on}}  wheel covers could be upgraded to new {{convert|15|in|mm|adj=on}} alloy wheels. Cirrus was the only one of the JA "cloud cars" to receive any form of facelift over the course of its production.
*'''2000''': For its final model year, the 4-cylinder LX model returned to join the V6-powered LXi sedan. Previously optional rear child seat anchorages, aluminum wheels, and an 8-speaker [[AM broadcasting|AM]]/[[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio stereo were now listed as standard features.  The last Chrysler Cirrus rolled off the assembly line on June 13, 2000.

==Plymouth Breeze==
[[File:Green breeze.png|thumb|right|1996 Plymouth Breeze]]

The '''Plymouth Breeze''' was released in 1995 as a 1996 model. Although it did not match the sales of its predecessor, the [[Plymouth Acclaim|Acclaim]], the Breeze did manage to sell over 230,000 units and total production was greater than that of its Chrysler Cirrus sibling, which was produced for nearly two additional years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=Encyclopedia of American Cars |chapter=Plymouth "Chrysler Production Figures"|pages=280–281 |publisher=Publications International |year=2006 |isbn=9781412713542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of Chrysler's new marketing strategy which addressed concerns that its brands were treading into each other's marketing territory, Plymouth, as Chrysler Corporation's low-price brand for essentially its entire existence, was to focus exclusively on value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Yates, Brock |title=The Critical Path: Inventing an Automobile and Reinventing a Corporation "Showtime in St.Louis" p. 209–11 |publisher=Little, Brown |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Breeze (as well as the base model Stratus) filled the position as the entry-level JA car. Due to this, the Breeze lacked certain features including an available V6 engine, alloy wheels, leather interior, body-colored door handles, fog lights, and Chrysler's [[Autostick]] transmission, all of which were offered on the Stratus and Cirrus.&lt;ref name="allpar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1999brochure"&gt;Daimler-Chrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure "1999 Plymouth lineup"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Plymouth Breeze came only as one basic model. Equipped similarly to a base model Dodge Stratus, the Breeze came standard with the 2.0&amp;nbsp;L I4 engine, five-speed manual transmission, 14-inch wheel covers, air conditioning, tilt steering wheel, AM/FM stereo, and driver and front-passenger air bags. The Breeze was also available with many options including a four-speed [[automatic transmission]], 2.4&amp;nbsp;L four-cylinder engine (available with automatic transmission only), [[anti-lock brake]]s, [[cruise control]], [[power window]]s, [[power door lock]]s, [[power mirror]]s, cassette or CD player, and a power sunroof. Additionally, 1998 and 1999 Breezes offered an "Expresso Package" similar to the one available on the [[Plymouth Voyager|Voyager]] and [[Plymouth Neon|Neon]].  "Expresso" content included special badging, unique wheel covers, upgraded audio system, and premium interior cloth in unique "Rhythm" pattern.&lt;ref name="1999brochure"/&gt; The Breeze was discontinued early in the 2000 model year,&lt;ref name="allpar"/&gt; as part of the [[Plymouth (automobile)#Final years|Chrysler's phaseout of the Plymouth brand]]; the last Breeze rolled off the [[Sterling Heights Assembly]] line on January 7, 2000.

===Trim levels===
* base: 1996–2000
* ''Expresso'': 1998–1999

===Trim Level Features===

Base: The '''Base''' was the least-expensive trim level of the Plymouth Breeze from 1994-1999, and the only available trim level for the Breeze's final year of production in 2000. The '''Base''' included the following standard equipment: a 2.0L Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine, a five-speed manual transmission, fifteen-inch black steel wheels with plastic wheel covers, an A/M-F/M stereo with four speakers, full instrumentation, air conditioning, cloth seats, and manual windows and door locks.

Expresso: The '''Expresso''' was the top-of-the-line trim level of the Plymouth Breeze, but was discontinued after 1999. The '''Expresso''' added the following equipment to the '''Base''' trim level: power windows and door locks, an A/M-F/M stereo with cassette player and six speakers, premium cloth seats, exterior color-keyed side mirrors and door handles, and a 2.4L Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine with a four-speed automatic transmission. An '''Expresso''' decal adorned both front doors, as well as the rear trunk lid.

===Engines===
*2.0&amp;nbsp;L [[Straight-4|I4]]
*2.4&amp;nbsp;L [[Straight-4|I4]]

===Year-to-year changes===
*'''1996''': Plymouth Breeze sedan is released.
*'''1997''': A new center console which included storage space, an integrated armrest, and rear-seat cupholders.
*'''1998''': The 2.4&amp;nbsp;L [[straight-4|I4]] is added as an option, and so is the ''Expresso'' trim level.
*'''1999''': Revised suspension tuning for 1999 which promised a smoother ride.
*'''2000''': Breeze production was halted early in 2000, due to the phaseout of the Plymouth brand name. Only a base model Breeze was available.

==Dodge Stratus==
[[File:1st Dodge Stratus ES.jpg|thumb|right|1996 Dodge Stratus ES]]
[[File:Chrysler Stratus Interior.jpg|thumb|right|Dodge Stratus Interior]]
{{Main|Dodge Stratus}}

The Dodge Stratus was introduced in February 1995, with two trims: ''base'' (later renamed ''SE'' for 2000), which came standard with the 2.0&amp;nbsp;L [[Straight-4|I4]] or optional 2.4&amp;nbsp;L; and the '''ES''', which came standard with the a 2.0&amp;nbsp;L from 1994–1997, and had a DOHC 2.4&amp;nbsp;L and a 2.5&amp;nbsp;L V6 as optional. In 1998 the 2.4&amp;nbsp;L was standard and the 2.5&amp;nbsp;L V6 was optional on the ES, and from 1999–2000, the 2.5&amp;nbsp;L V6 was the only engine on the ES model.

The Stratus directly replaced the high-volume [[Dodge Spirit|Spirit]] and [[Dodge Dynasty|Dynasty]] ([[United States]] only) to favorable reviews, but lower sales.

Mexico:
A [[turbocharged]] version of the Stratus was sold in Mexico, with the 2.4&amp;nbsp;L [[DOHC]] 4-cylinder engine and a 4-speed [[automatic transmission]] with [[AutoStick]]. This engine produced {{convert|168|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 5200 rpm and {{convert|216|lb·ft|N·m}} of torque at 2200 rpm.

In 2000, the Stratus was available for its last year of sales in Canada, with the [[Chrysler Sebring]] taking over as the company's only lower mid-size sedan - [[Dodge]] did not sell the equivalent version in Canada.

===Chrysler Stratus===
The Stratus was marketed as the '''Chrysler Stratus''' in markets that the [[Dodge]] name was not used; such as Europe, Argentina and Brazil. In Brazil, the Stratus had the same engines as the North American version but a higher [[ground clearance]] for the road conditions there. In Europe, only the 2.0&amp;nbsp;L 4-cylinder engine or the 2.5&amp;nbsp;L V6 engine were available. The European version also had chrome accent moldings along the doors and bumpers.

===Year-to-year changes===
*'''1995''': Stratus sedan is released.
*'''1996''': No changes
*'''1997''': A new center console which included storage space, an integrated armrest, and rear-seat cupholders.
*'''1998''': 2.4&amp;nbsp;L becomes standard on ''ES''
*'''1999''': V6 engine becomes standard on ''ES''
*'''2000''': ''Base'' trim renamed ''SE''

===Trim levels===
*''base'' 1995-1999
*''SE'' 1999-2000
*''ES'' 1995-2000

===Trim Level Features===

Base: The '''Base''' was the least expensive trim level of Stratus from 1995-1999. The '''Base''' was very well-equipped, with standard equipment such as: a 2.0L Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine, a five-speed manual transmission, fifteen-inch black steel wheels with plastic wheel covers, an A/M-F/M stereo with four speakers, air conditioning, manual windows and door locks, cloth seats, and a full instrument cluster.

SE: The '''SE''' was the least expensive trim level of Stratus in 2000. The '''SE''' included exactly the same standard equipment as the previously-base '''Base''' trim level of Stratus.

ES: The '''ES''' was the top-of-the-line trim level of Stratus from 1995-2000. The '''ES''' added the following equipment to the '''Base''' or '''SE''' trim levels: a 2.4L Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine, a four-speed automatic transmission, alloy wheels, a premium A/M-F/M stereo with cassette player and integrated CD changer controls with six speakers, power windows and door locks, keyless entry, a power-adjustable driver's seat, premium cloth seats, and exterior color-keyed side mirrors and door handles.

The '''Dodge Daytona''' is an automobile which was produced by the [[Chrysler Corporation]] under their [[Dodge]] division from 1984 to 1993. It was a [[front-wheel drive]] [[hatchback]] based on the [[Chrysler G platform]], which was derived from the [[Chrysler K platform]]. The '''[[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] Laser''' was an upscale rebadged version of the Daytona. The Daytona was restyled for 1987, and again for 1992. It replaced the Mitsubishi Galant-based [[Dodge Challenger|Challenger]], and slotted between the [[Dodge Charger (L-body)|Charger]] and the [[Mitsubishi Starion|Conquest]].  The Daytona was replaced by the 1995 [[Dodge Avenger]], which was built by [[Mitsubishi Motors]]. The Daytona derives its name mainly from the [[Dodge Charger Daytona]], which itself was named after the [[Daytona 500]] race in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]].

==History==
The Daytona originally used the 2.2 L [[Chrysler K engine]] in [[normally aspirated]] or [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] form. Power outputs are {{convert|93|and|142|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} respectively. The {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|adj=on}}, 2.5-litre K engine was added for 1986. In 1985, the 2.2-L Turbo I engine's horsepower was increased to {{convert|146|hp|abbr=on}}. The 1984 Daytona was available in three trim lines: standard, Turbo and Turbo Z. Total production was 49,347. The Daytona Turbo was on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver 10Best#1984|10Best]] list for 1984. Both the Daytona and Chrysler Laser were available with the Chrysler [[electronic voice alert]] system through 1987. A performance oriented "[[Carroll Shelby|Shelby]]" version of the Daytona was introduced in 1987.

===Chrysler Laser===
[[File:ChryslerLaserXE1985.jpg|thumb|left|1985 Chrysler Laser XE]]

The Chrysler Laser was billed as the Chrysler brand's first sports car. The Laser was a virtual clone of the Dodge Daytona, but came only in the upscale trim version. It was produced from 1984 to 1986. The Laser emphasized European luxury, and was intended to be an "executive personal luxury coupe". The Laser was sleek, low-slung, and aerodynamic, with a drag coefficient of 0.35. The car had a large rear hatchback, with a rear deck-lid spoiler. The 1984 Laser was available in two trim lines: standard and XE. In mid-1985, the XT trim was added as the top-of-the-line version. The standard, XE and XT trim lines would continue until the Laser’s demise in mid-1986. After 1986, the Daytona was exported to Canada as the ''Chrysler Daytona'', officially ending Canadian Daytona sales under the [[Dodge]] marque. The turbo version of the Laser could be recognized by its use of black hood louvers. The 2.2 L Turbo I engine was available as standard equipment in the XE and XT trim lines and optional on the standard model. The Laser was replaced by the Mitsubishi built [[Chrysler Conquest]], a rear-wheel drive vehicle which competed directly against the [[Toyota Celica Supra]]. The Laser name was silently terminated after the first half of 1986 model year, then resurrected for the 1990 model year as the [[Plymouth Laser]], built by [[Diamond Star Motors]], a joint venture between Chrysler and [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]]. The rebranded Laser shared its body and chassis with the [[Eagle Talon]] and [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]].

In 1987, the [[Chrysler LeBaron]] coupe was restyled as a more proper sports car, removing Chrysler's need for the Laser. However, the Laser’s luxury performance image would be carried over into the 1987 Dodge Daytona Pacifica as well as the [[Dodge Lancer|Lancer Pacifica]] and other Dodge vehicles styled by Chrysler's Pacifica Studios.

The Laser was specified to have an estimated {{convert|22|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} city/{{convert|35|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} highway fuel mileage. Chrysler offered a five-year or {{convert|50000|mi|km|sing=on}} warranty, or a protection plan with outer body rust-through protection, based on [[United States Automobile Club]] tests. [[Mark Cross (retail chain)|Mark Cross]] leather seats and a six-way power option were available as options.

Notable features of the Chrysler Laser XE included: 
*A dashboard with digital readouts for the speedometer, tachometer, odometer, temperature, oil pressure, voltage, and fuel
*An electronic monitoring system situated near the top of the center console. This monitoring system checked 22 separate functions on the car, such as an open door, low fuel, or a blown taillight, and would give a digital readout of the situation, along with an audio message produced by a synthesized voice.
*An electronic navigator, which would give information on fuel mileage, miles traveled, distance to destination, and elapsed driving time

===Production numbers===
*1984 - 59,858 (Laser- 33,976/Laser XE- 25,882)
*1985 - 50,866 (Laser- 29,221/Laser XE- 18,193/Laser XT- 3,452)
*1986 - 36,672 (Laser- 14,134/Laser XE- 15,549/Laser XT- 6,989)

===1984===
The Daytona debuted with a 142&amp;nbsp;hp Turbo I motor. Many Turbo Z models were produced and were more luxurious than other years due to their use of Mark Cross leather, light up speakers, and rear amplifier switches. These options were dropped after 1984.

===1985===
Changes were minimal for the Daytona's second year of production. The Turbo Z model was no longer listed as a package but was now a model in its own right. The wraparound spoiler, formerly exclusive to the Turbo Z model, was now offered on all three models. But the biggest change was under the hood: the 2.2 Turbo was given four more hp to 146&amp;nbsp;hp (109&amp;nbsp;kW), and a new shift linkage was added. Optional "Swiss cheese" wheels were replaced with new optional "pizza" wheels. All wheels now had five lug nuts (instead of four). Total production was 47,519.

===1986===
[[File:1986 Daytona Turbo Z CS (Carroll Shelby) with T roof.png|thumb|right|250px|1986 Daytona Turbo Z CS (Carroll Shelby&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dempseybowling.com/sheldodg/sheldodd.htm|title=Dodge Daytona C/S packages|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) with T roof]]
There were several changes for the 1986 Daytona. The middle "Turbo" model was dropped, leaving only two models, the base and Turbo Z. Engine changes were also made, including a new 2.5 L 100&amp;nbsp;hp (75&amp;nbsp;kW) four-cylinder engine for the base model. A new [[targa top|T-roof]] package was added to the option list, and 5,984 Daytona owners chose this option.{{cn|date=March 2018}} The biggest addition was the C/S ([[Carroll Shelby]]) suspension package, available only as an option on the Turbo Z. This consisted of {{convert|32|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} front and {{convert|28|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} rear anti-sway bars, performance tuned struts, and 225/50VR15 Goodyear Eagle Gatorback tires. This package would foreshadow the Daytona Shelby of 1987 and beyond. Some 7,704 owners added this handling package to their Daytonas.{{cn|date=March 2018}} Total production this year was 44,366.

===1987–1988===
[[File:87-91 Dodge Daytona.jpg|thumb|right|250px|1987–1991 Dodge Daytona]]
[[File:Daytonashelbyz.jpg|thumb|1987 Dodge Daytona Shelby Z]]
For 1987, the Daytona was restyled externally, and featured pop-up headlights. New in 1987 was a ''Shelby Z'' trim level with an available Chrysler developed Turbo II intercooled version of the 2.2 L [[Chrysler K engine]], as well as a heavy-duty A555 transaxle with [[Getrag]] gears. The engine produces {{convert|174|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|200|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The Shelby Z also featured numerous suspension upgrades, including a larger diameter front sway bar and disc brakes on all four wheels. This version was sold in Europe under the name ''Chrysler GS Turbo II''. A more luxury-oriented ''Pacifica'' trim line was also added to replace the Chrysler Laser, which was dropped in mid-year 1986. Among the optional equipment included a leather interior, eight-way power enthusiast driver's seat (with mechanical thigh and lumbar controls), digital instrument cluster, and a 12-button trip computer (with instant fuel ratings as well as trip averages and estimated travel times). In 1988, the C/S package was revived. However, this time the C/S was only available on the base model Daytona. In order to reduce weight and produce a lighter Daytona, the C/S came without the ground effects and other features that were on the Shelby. The AGB model C/S had a Turbo I 2.2 L engine, which was available with either an automatic or manual transmission.

====Decepzione====
Following the Chrysler takeover of [[Lamborghini]], product programs general manager Jack Stavana introduced a program to fit a [[Lamborghini Jalpa]] V8 into a Daytona. The motor was linked to an [[all-wheel drive]] (AWD) system designed by Lotus UK and the car was called the ''Decepzione''. Despite its performance and media buzz generated by articles in ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine, the project was discontinued because of the engine's [[oil pan]] having just {{convert|1.5|in|mm|1}} of ground clearance, necessitated by the comparatively tall engine block.

===1989–1991===
Model year 1989 saw the introduction of the ES model offered with silver contrasting ground affects, along with "snowflake" patterned alloy wheels. The 2.2 L Turbo I was replaced with the 2.5 L Turbo I, rated at 150&amp;nbsp;hp and 180&amp;nbsp;ft. lbs. of torque. The ES model was offered as an appearance package/equipment group on base models in order to attract the "average" Daytona buyer’s eye without a major price hike. Also introduced in 1989 was the AGS C/S Competition model, which was featured along with the regular AGB model. This new C/S model featured an intercooled 2.2 L Turbo II engine, along with many other features that were also on the Shelby.{{clarify|date=March 2018}} However, this model was only available with a manual transmission. The AGS C/S package would remain in availability until 1991. The AGB C/S Performance model had the 2.5 L non-intercooled Turbo I engine available with five-speed manual or three-speed automatic. A driver's side airbag was standard.  

For 1990, all Daytonas received an interior restyling, featuring a modernized cockpit-style wraparound dashboard. A variable nozzle turbocharger (''VNT Turbo IV''), borrowed from the 1989 [[Shelby CSX#CSX-VNT|Shelby CSX VNT]], was offered in the Shelby model producing the same {{convert|174|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} as the Turbo II but eliminated turbo lag and improved drivability. Also for 1990, a 3.0 L [[SOHC]] Mitsubishi [[V6]] was made available. 

For 1991, the 2.2 L turbocharged engine was dropped in favor of the new 2.5 L "high torque" turbocharged engine. Although sporting a lesser power output of 152&amp;nbsp;hp, this engine offered 210&amp;nbsp;ft. lbs. of torque, exceeding that of the Turbo II. Also new was the addition of an ''IROC'' model with either the 3.0 L V6 or turbocharged 2.5 L engine. Visually, IROC models differed from lesser models, having a ground effects kit and alloy wheels, among other differences. The IROC decals where added in halfway through 1991 even though all Shelby Daytonas from 1991 were considered to be IROCs. There is no difference between a 1991 Shelby and an IROC besides the decals and the letter "J" in the VIN sequence; on 1991 Daytona Shelbys, the VIN has the sequence ''G74J'' and IROC models have the sequence ''G743''.

===1992–1993===
[[File:Wiki cars 087.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Dodge Daytona]]
For the 1992 model year, production was moved from the St. Louis, Missouri plant to the Sterling Heights, Michigan plant. The Daytona also received a thorough facelift, which replaced the pop-up headlights with flush-mounted rounded ones and added a new grille and rear fascia.  Window surround moldings on the doors were also new, and rounder than the sharp angles of the moldings on 1984 to 1991 models. The 1992 model also displayed the new Dodge "ram head" emblem on the hood and below the taillights. While the 3.0 L V6 became an option on lower end models, it was the standard engine on IROC models. Optional on the 1992 IROC was the 2.5 L "High Torque" Turbo, available as a very rare option (less than 230 produced). Also available on the IROC was the new ''R/T'' performance package, which featured a {{convert|224|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} ''Turbo III'' version of the 2.2 L four-cylinder, but with a Lotus designed [[dual overhead cam|DOHC]] cylinder head and direct ignition system instead of a distributor-type ignition system. Although the Shelby trim was discontinued after 1991 (due to the end of Carroll Shelby's involvement with Chrysler), a small number of 1992 Daytona IROCs were produced bearing the Shelby name. These IROCs featured "Shelby" decals which was added at the dealership or later to help boost sales, and were all 2.5 Turbo cars, as they featured the Shelby Performance Package sales code, as this was superseded by the iroc package. Shelby versions were mainly "Chrysler" branded Daytonas which were sold overseas , and were part of an early run of IROCs. These were the last production vehicles produced by Chrysler to bear the Shelby name was in 1991 when replaced with Iroc. Production of the Daytona ended in February 1993 without an immediate replacement.&lt;ref name=NZCarp16&gt;{{cite journal | ref = NZC493 | journal = New Zealand Car | title = Newsline | page = 16 | volume = 7 | number = 6 | date = April 1993 | editor-last = Anderson | editor-first = Donn | location = Auckland, New Zealand | publisher = Accent Publishing Cnr | issn = 0113-0196 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1995 [[Dodge Avenger]] eventually took the Daytona's place.

The ''' Chrysler Valiant AP6''' is an [[automobile]] which was produced by [[Chrysler Australia]] from 1965 to 1966.&lt;ref name=UniqueSpecs/&gt; It was the fourth [[Chrysler Valiant]] model produced in [[Australia]].

==Overview==
The Valiant AP6 was released in March 1965,&lt;ref name=UniqueSpecs/&gt; replacing the [[Chrysler Valiant AP5]]. The basic styling was carried over from the AP5 but differed in having a new split grille, a new bonnet and new front mudguards.&lt;ref name=Unique/&gt; Mechanical changes included a redesigned camshaft, the introduction of self-adjusting brakes and the replacement of the push button gear selector on models with automatic transmission by a traditional lever system.&lt;ref name=Unique/&gt; Optional power brakes were made available across the range.&lt;ref name=Unique/&gt;

A [[coupe utility]] variant was added to the range in April 1965&lt;ref name=Unique/&gt; and marketed as the Valiant Wayfarer.&lt;ref&gt;Sales brochure for Valiant Wayfarer (AP6)&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first Valiant-based coupe utility to be produced by Chrysler Australia.

As with the previous AP5 model, station wagon rear styling varied depending on production dates. Early build wagons used 1965 US Plymouth Valiant wagon style tail lights. At some time in the production run Chrysler Australia invested in new tooling for the wagon rear sheet metal, allowing the use of sedan rear doors. Later style wagons again used vertical style tail lights. The new pressings required revised rear cargo area side windows and rear bumpers were also redesigned. Changes occurred from build number AP6-2W-3107 (manual Safari), AP6-4W-2167 (automatic Safari), AP6-4HW-1418 (Regal Safari) and AP6-4WHV-209 (V8 Safari).&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Australia - 1962-1969 Valiant and V.I.P. Parts List - body section various pages&lt;/ref&gt; The difference in sheet metal is most notable where the rear bumpers on the later versions finish. On early build cars the rear bumper ends lead into a pressing on the lower rear quarter panel sheet metal, whereas on later build cars the bumper has curved ends with a flat sheet metal surface on the lower rear quarters.

Valiant V8 models were released in August 1965. A V8 sedan and V8 Safari wagon were offered, both powered by a {{convert|273|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine]] with “TorqueFlite 8” automatic transmission. V8 models could be identified by V8 badges, with the V8 sedan having a vinyl roof and the V8 Safari wagon being fitted with a roof rack.&lt;ref name=Unique/&gt; Power-assisted brakes were standard equipment.&lt;ref name=Unique/&gt; Although it utilized Regal trim and equipment, the V8 was marketed as the Valiant V8, not as a Valiant Regal V8.&lt;ref name=Farmer&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, A History of Chrysler in Australia 1946-1981, Ilinga Books, 2010, page 125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model range==
The Valiant AP6 was offered in 4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]], 5-door [[station wagon]] and 2-door [[coupé utility]] body styles in ten models.&lt;ref name=UniqueSpecs/&gt;

The VG range featured a newly introduced Australian built "Hemi" six cylinder engine which was claimed by Chrysler to be the most advanced engine of its kind in the world.&lt;ref name=Tuckey_77&gt;Elisabeth Tuckey and Ewan Kennedy, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, page 77&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chrysler by Chrysler'''&lt;!-- The term "Chrysler by Chrysler" was official and was used by Chrysler Australia in its publicity material eg sales brochure reproduced on page 111 of "Chrysler Valiant" by Tuckey &amp; Kennedy --&gt; is an [[automobile]] which was produced by [[Chrysler Australia]] from 1971 to 1976. It is an extended wheelbase, luxury variant of the [[Australia]]n developed [[Chrysler Valiant]].

=={{anchor|CH}} CH Series==
The original CH Series Chrysler was introduced in November 1971 replacing the [[Chrysler VIP]]&lt;ref name=UniqueCH&gt;[http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_chrysler_by_chrysler_ch.htm Chrysler by Chrysler CH] Retrieved on 10 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; as Chrysler’s competitor to the [[Ford Fairlane (Australia)|Ford Fairlane]] and the [[Statesman (automobile)|Statesman]] in the Australian prestige car market.&lt;ref name=UniqueCH/&gt; It was offered in four-door Sedan and two-door Hardtop models.&lt;ref name=UniqueCH/&gt; The Chrysler was based on the VH series Chrysler Valiant, utilizing the floorpan of the two-door Hardtop version.&lt;ref name=UniqueCH/&gt; The {{convert|115|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase of the Chrysler was identical to that of the Valiant Hardtop and {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} longer than that used on the Valiant Sedan.&lt;ref name=UniqueCH/&gt; The Chrysler also differed significantly from the Valiant in external appearance, featuring a four headlight grille encircled by a chrome surround and a unique wrap-around horizontal tail-light assembly.&lt;ref name=UniqueCH/&gt; The frontal styling was highly reminiscent of the 1971 US [[Dodge Coronet]]. A long list of standard luxury equipment items set the Chrysler further apart from the Valiant and included front disc brakes, power assisted steering, a push button radio with power antenna, a carpeted boot, tinted power operated windows and courtesy lighting which included adjustable reading lights for rear passengers.&lt;ref name=UniqueCH/&gt; Considerable attention had also been taken to reduce [[Noise, vibration, and harshness]] (NVH) with the application of additional soundproofing material.&lt;ref name=UniqueCH/&gt;

[[File:Chrysler CH Sedan.JPG|thumb|left|Chrysler CH Sedan]]
A {{convert|265|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Hemi six-cylinder engine was fitted as standard equipment, with an American designed, Australian built {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 available as an option.&lt;ref name=UniqueCH/&gt; An imported “[[TorqueFlite]]” three-speed automatic transmission was used in all variants.&lt;ref name=UniqueCH/&gt;

=={{anchor|CJ}} CJ Series==
[[File:1974 Chrysler by Chrysler (CJ) sedan (2015-01-01) 01.jpg|thumb|Chrysler (CJ)]]
An updated CJ Series version of the Chrysler was released in May 1973,&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Tuckey and Ewan Kennedy, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, page 129&lt;/ref&gt; one month after the VJ Series update of the Valiant.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Tuckey and Ewan Kennedy, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, page 113&lt;/ref&gt; This model of the Chrysler was distinguishable by minor cosmetic styling changes from its predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Tuckey and Ewan Kennedy, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, page 129-130&lt;/ref&gt; The four-door Sedan was now the only model offered, as the two-door Hardtop body-style was not carried over into this Series.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Tuckey and Ewan Kennedy, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, page 133&lt;/ref&gt;

This model was also sold in some export markets, including Japan. In that country it was marketed as the "Chrysler 318 CA" and featured a three-speed automatic transmission coupled to the smaller 5.2 liter V8 which was not offered in Australian market cars until 1976, with {{convert|150|PS|hp kW|0|abbr=on}}. Claimed top speed for the Japanese market model is {{convert|170|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Catvol20&gt;{{cite journal | ref = JAMA20 | journal = 自動車ガイドブック: Japanese motor vehicles guide book | language = Japanese | volume = 20 |date=1973-10-30 | publisher = [[Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association]] | location = Japan | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|CK}} CK Series==
An updated CK Series version of the Chrysler was released in October 1975, coinciding with the release of the VK Valiant range.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Tuckey and Ewan Kennedy, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, page 135 &amp; 145&lt;/ref&gt; Changes were again minor.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Tuckey and Ewan Kennedy, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, page 148&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine was modified to improve both economy and performance,&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Tuckey and Ewan Kennedy, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, page 147&lt;/ref&gt; however new emission regulations saw this unit replaced by a {{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 from 1 July 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/valiant_vk_ck_technical_specifications.htm Valiant VK/CK Technical Specifications] Retrieved on 10 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The CK Chrysler was discontinued in October 1976 with the introduction of the CL Series of Valiant and Regal models. This range included a luxury Chrysler Regal SE Sedan which effectively replaced the Chrysler,&lt;ref&gt;Tony Davis, Aussie Cars, 1987, page 147&lt;/ref&gt; although it did not feature the longer wheelbase or the unique styling features of the outgoing model.

The '''Chrysler/Dodge/Plymouth Neon''' is a front-engine, front-wheel drive [[compact car]] introduced in January 1994 for [[model year]] 1995 by [[Chrysler]]'s [[Dodge]] and [[Plymouth automobile|Plymouth]] divisions in two- and four-door bodystyles over two generations.

Marketed in Europe, Mexico, Canada, Japan, Egypt, Australia and South America as a Chrysler, the Neon was offered in multiple versions and configurations over its production life, which ended with model year 2005.

The Neon nameplate was subsequently resurrected in 2016 for the Dodge Neon, a [[Rebadging|rebadged]] variant of [[Fiat Tipo (2015)|Fiat Tipo]] sedan for the [[Mexico|Mexican]] market.&lt;ref name="Fiat Neon" /&gt;

==1991 concept car==
The Neon nameplate first appeared as a [[concept car]] in 1991 under the Dodge brand. Although radically styled and clearly not production-ready, the Neon concept somewhat resembled the production vehicle and featured sliding [[suicide door]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldconceptcars.com/1930-2004/dodge-neon-concept-1991/|title=Dodge Neon Concept (1991) – Old Concept Cars|author=|date=14 September 2014|website=oldconceptcars.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.modernperformance.com/check-out-this-1991-brochure-from-chrysler-on-the-neon-concept|title=Check out this 1991 Brochure from Chrysler on the Neon Concept..  - Modern Performance’s Blog|author=|date=|website=blog.modernperformance.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Neon concept was designed by Chrysler designers who had joined the company from Chrysler's buyout of [[American Motors]] in 1987.

The first generation Neon was introduced in January 1994 and manufactured until August 1999. It was available as a four-door [[notchback]] [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] and a two-door [[notchback]] [[coupe]]. Available engines were [[SOHC]] and [[DOHC]] versions of Chrysler's [[Chrysler 1.8, 2.0 &amp; 2.4 engine|2.0&amp;nbsp;L 4-cylinder engine]] producing {{convert|132|hp|kW|abbr=on}} at 6,000&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|129|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 5,000&amp;nbsp;rpm or {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}} at 6,500&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|133|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 5,600&amp;nbsp;rpm, respectively; transaxle options were a 3-speed [[Torqueflite#Front-wheel drive transaxles|Torqueflite]] automatic or a five-speed [[manual transmission|manual]].

The car was [[Badge engineering|badged and sold]] as both a Dodge and a Plymouth in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]; in [[Mexico]] was sold as Dodge and Chrysler, and in Europe, Australia and other export markets it was sold as the '''Chrysler Neon'''. At the Neon's release, then president of [[Chrysler Corporation]] [[Bob Lutz (businessman)|Bob Lutz]] said, "There's an old saying in [[Detroit]]: 'Good, fast, or cheap. Pick any two.' We refuse to accept that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ingrassia |first1=Paul |authorlink1=Paul Ingrassia |last2=White |first2=Joseph |title=Comeback: the fall and rise of the American automobile industry |url=https://archive.org/details/comebackfallrise00ingr |url-access=registration |year=1994 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0671792148 |page=[https://archive.org/details/comebackfallrise00ingr/page/449 449]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese press touted the Neon as the "Japanese car killer", due to a spiralling Yen and the lower production cost of the Neon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/1996-06-09/will-neon-be-the-little-car-that-could-in-japan |title=Will Neon Be the Little Car That Could in Japan? |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=1996-06-09 |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Neon also became the first Chrysler small car sold in Japan but despite of focused attention, only 994 were sold in Japan between June to December 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Nikkei Shimbun evening 31 March 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The Neon received praise for its appearance, price, and power when compared to competing cars such as the [[Honda Civic]] DX at {{convert|102|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, the Civic EX at {{convert|127|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, the [[Nissan Sentra]] at {{convert|115|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, the [[Ford Escort (North America)|Ford Escort ZX2]] at {{convert|130|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, the [[Toyota Corolla]] at {{convert|115|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, the [[Saturn S-Series]] at {{convert|100|hp|kW|abbr=on}} for SOHC variants and {{convert|124|hp|kW|abbr=on}} for DOHC variants, and the [[Chevrolet Cavalier]] Base and LS models at {{convert|120|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, among others. Car and Driver tested the DOHC 5-speed equipped Neon R/T and reported that it could run 0-60 in 7.6 seconds and 15.9 seconds in the quarter mile.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} First-generation Neons were competitive in [[SCCA]] Solo [[autocross]] and showroom-stock road racing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=LeBlancurl |date=2005-12-02 |url=http://www.auto123.com/en/info/news/ourwriters,view,.spy?artid=52904&amp;pg=1&amp;author=4 |title=Farewell road test: 2005 Dodge SRT4 Editor's Review |publisher=Auto123.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210033931/http://www.auto123.com/en/info/news/ourwriters%2Cview%2C.spy?artid=52904&amp;pg=1&amp;author=4 |archivedate=2008-02-10 |accessdate=2015-05-15 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equipment===
Neons had unconventional option availability, including the lack of power windows in the rear doors. Certain color base-model Neons, including red and black, had bumper covers molded in color rather than painted. These covers, while textured and not as glossy as paint, absorbed scuffs and scrapes with less visible damage. The mid-level Highline models in 95 &amp; 96 used wheel covers with a bubble design. Initially, Neons were available in many bold colors including Nitro yellow-green, Lapis Blue, Aqua, and Magenta, however paint color choices became more subdued by the 1998-1999 model years, as the majority of buyers opted for more traditional colors.

The Australian market Chrysler Neon came in two models, the SE and the better-equipped LX. Later, the LX model was replaced by the LE with the updated model in 1999.

In Japan, only the sedan was offered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.carsensor.net/catalog/chrysler/neon/F001/ carsensor.net] (Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt; It was very similar to those sold in the Australian market. it was equipped with amber turn signal indicators next to the tail lights to comply with Japanese regulations, and a side indicator behind the front wheel installed in the fender.

In the United States, the lineup started out as Base, Highline, and Sport, with different styles and options in each line, but the lineup titles changed frequently (other trim lines included Expresso, SE, ES, SXT, ACR, and R/T).

In Europe, the car was available with a 1.8&amp;nbsp;L engine. Europe received one limited edition model, the CS, which came only in Platinum paint. It was fitted with the {{convert|131|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} SOHC engine, American R/T specification suspension (slightly lower, {{convert|3.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} rear, {{convert|2.7|cm|in|abbr=on}} front), rear spoiler, unique alloy wheels, standard leather interior, dual stainless steel exhaust, 6CD changer and a shorter 5-speed manual gearbox.

===Special models===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
{{originalresearch-section|date=November 2011}}

====ACR====
The ACR Neon, available with the DOHC engine, featured four-wheel disc brakes, Arvin non-adjustable struts for 1995–1996 models and Koni adjustable dampers for 1997–1999 models, thicker anti-sway bars, stiffer suspension bushings, fast-ratio steering, heavy-duty wheel hubs, and a five-speed manual transmission with a shorter .81 fifth gear and final drive ratio of 3.94 for quicker acceleration. 1995 through 1997 models featured adjustable camber. The computer-controlled speed limiter was removed from 1995 ACR models (limited to {{convert|130|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on later models), and ABS was also, to save weight. The ACR offers no badging to distinguish it from other Neon models; the only visible differences are a bumper with fog light holes, but no fog lights and a lack of side moldings. For 1995, the ACR was only offered to SCCA members, but in subsequent years it was available to the general public. The name "ACR" was initially the internal ordering code for the "Competition Package", as it was termed in dealer materials; however, as knowledge of the model spread, the ACR name stuck. The [[backronym]] "American Club Racer" was coined due to its popularity with club and grassroots racers. To save weight, both the standard A/M-F/M radio with cassette player and air conditioning could be deleted, both for credit.

====R/T====
The R/T model (Road/Track) debuted in the 1998 model year. Offered only with a 5-speed DOHC configuration, the R/T featured many of the ACR's mechanical upgrades including the numerically higher ratio 3.94 5-speed manual transmission, with the .81 5th gear and 130&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit. The R/T, however, was intended for the street, with more comfort and convenience features standard or available, and specialized parts like the adjustable dampers removed, although the dampers as well as the front coil springs found on R/T models were slightly stiffer, offering an advantage over standard model Neons. R/Ts featured optional stripes over the top of the car, silver "R/T" badging on the front door panels and the right side of the trunk deck lid, and a functional wing. The "Stripe Delete" option was available from the factory, but with no credit to the Neon's price. All striped R/Ts (black, red, blue) had silver colored stripes, with the exception of the White R/Ts, which came with dark blue colored stripes. The R/T also came in 4-door form with limited numbers made.

Sales of the second generation model started with model year 2000 and production ended with the 2005 model year. The second generation Neon was only available as a four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]. In some global sales regions, including the U.S., the sole engine was the 2.0&amp;nbsp;L SOHC engine, the power output remaining at {{convert|132|hp|abbr=on}}. An optional Magnum engine configuration (with an active intake manifold, and other engine revisions to increase power) that produced {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}} was available. Both engines had a redline of 6762&amp;nbsp;rpm.

[[File:Dodge Neon 2.0i LX 2003 (14268138518).jpg|thumb|Chrysler Neon]]

The second generation was more refined than the first generation car. It was advertised that the second generation Neon had over 1,000 refinements from the original generation. The first generation's frameless windows were replaced with a full-framed door. Other [[Noise, Vibration, and Harshness|NVH]] refinements were implemented. The new interior and greater size increased weight. The [[DOHC]] engine (Chrysler code name ECC) was no longer available.

In 2000, the R/T trim returned after a one-year hiatus. The R/T consisted of a new {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}} SOHC Magnum 2.0&amp;nbsp;L Engine, {{convert|16|in|cm|abbr=on}} wheels, spoiler, dual chrome exhaust tips, quicker steering box and stiffer springs. The 2001 and 2002 R/Ts had a flat, 'hammerhead' spoiler. From 2000-2003, the R/T was sold as a Chrysler in the United Kingdom. The Neon was offered with a sport package for the 2001 model year only commemorating Dodge's return to the NASCAR scene, called the Motorsports Edition. It was available on SE, ES, and R/T and on SE/ES models, consisted of an R/T wing, R/T {{convert|16|in|cm|abbr=on}} wheels, R/T springs, Goodyear NASCAR raised yellow-lettering tires, 'Dodge Motorsports' side decals, white instrument cluster and R/T steering box. SE and ES cars were an R/T visually except for the lack of dual exhaust, R/T lower mouldings, fog lamps and R/T exclusive front bumper. The SE and ES only came equipped with the base model's {{convert|132|hp|kW|abbr=on}} engine and was available with an automatic transmission (unlike the manual-only R/T model), the R/T retained the 150hp Magnum engine. In 2001, there was also a Sport Appearance Package available on SE and ES, which added the R/T wing and 16” wheels as well as other option availability. 2001 was the last year for the Plymouth Neon, and the Plymouth brand as well. The last Plymouth Neon, which was also the last Plymouth ever produced (a silver four-door sedan), rolled off the assembly line on June 28, 2001.

The former Dodge and Plymouth Neon were briefly sold under the Chrysler name in Canada from 1999–2002, until being renamed as Dodge SX 2.0 for 2003. As before, in Europe, Australia, Mexico, Asia and South America, it continued to be sold as a Chrysler, as Dodge and Plymouth passenger cars were not marketed outside the U.S. and Canada at the time. Besides the 2.0&amp;nbsp;L engine, it used the same [[Tritec engine|Tritec]] 1.6&amp;nbsp;L unit found in the [[Mini (marque)|MINI]] prior to 2007. The 1.6&amp;nbsp;L unit is a variation of the 2.0&amp;nbsp;L SOHC engine designed by Chrysler and built by Tritec.&lt;ref name="allpar"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/mopar/rover.html  |title=The Chrysler/Mini (Rover) 1.4 and 1.6 Engines |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the second generation Neon featured a five-speed manual transmission using the former ACR gear ratios to improve acceleration. However, this hurt gas mileage and made the car noisier on the highway, and eventually the original gear ratios were restored. A four-speed automatic (41TE) was offered in the Neon for the 2002 model year, and the 03-05 received an updated 40TE four-speed auto, replacing the earlier 3-speed 31TH.

[[File:03-05 Dodge Neon.jpg|thumb|2003–2005 Dodge Neon (US)]]

The Chrysler Neon was renamed '''Dodge SX 2.0''' in Canada for 2003, and sold at Dodge dealerships.. In Australia and Canada, the Chrysler Neon was discontinued in 2002.
In 2002, the front clip was changed to match the '''R/T''' and '''ACR''' front clip with the exception of missing a lower lip.

The Neon was facelifted once again for 2003 with large "crosseyed" headlights and crosshair grille to make it look more like a [[Dodge Caravan]] and [[Dodge Stratus]].

The ACR model was discontinued for 2003; the R/T model for 2004. The Chrysler Neon continued to be sold in Europe until 2004.

In Brazil, the Neon was marketed as a [[luxury car|luxury]] [[mid-size]] sedan; for [[Mexico]] it was a competitor to the [[Ford Escort (North American)|Ford Escort]], and sold as a Chrysler with either the 1.6 or 2.0&amp;nbsp;L engine and European-style [[taillight]]s (with separate amber indicator lights), except for the R/T model, which was a Dodge, with U.S.-style taillights.

For the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] market, the Neon proved more successful than for the rest of [[the Continent]]. Trim levels were 2.0 LX and 2.0 SE. However, some grey import versions came in from [[Mexico]].

This generation continued to be offered in Japan from 1999-2001. The Japanese version was installed with leather interior, and was marketed as a small luxury car to Japanese consumers. In 2002, the Neon was replaced by the [[Chrysler PT Cruiser]] in Japan.

===Final year===
DaimlerChrysler discontinued the Neon, with the final cars assembled on September 23, 2005 at the [[Belvidere Assembly]] plant in [[Belvidere, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dodge Neon History|url=http://www.dodge-neon.net/history/|website=dodge-neon.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Neon was replaced in the spring of 2006 with the 2007 [[Dodge Caliber]], which is based on the shared [[Chrysler]]/[[Mitsubishi Motors]] [[Mitsubishi GS platform|GS platform]]. Like the Neon, the Caliber had an SRT-4 variant, but like the standard Caliber, it used a completely different engine.&lt;ref name="allpar1"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/cars/dodge/caliber.html |title=Dodge Caliber: crossover-like compact cars, 2007-2012 |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Belvidere plant underwent retooling for the Caliber, [[Jeep Compass]], and [[Jeep Patriot|Patriot]].

In markets like [[Australia]] the Neon range was reduced to either 2.0 LX or 2.0 SE models.

===Safety===
The first generation Neon earned a ''"Poor"'' rating in an offset frontal [[Crash test]] conducted by the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]. The second generation Neon earned a higher ''"Marginal"'' rating. The second generation were rated as ''"Poor"'' in the side impact crash test&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/ratingsbyseries.aspx?id=382 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Dodge Neon |publisher=Iihs.org |accessdate=2009-08-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081128144548/http://www.iihs.org/ratings/ratingsbyseries.aspx?id=382 |archivedate=November 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (IIHS Safety ratings go from ''"Poor"'', to ''"Marginal"'', ''"Acceptable"'' and ''"Good"''). By comparison, the [[Chevrolet Cavalier]] performed worse in the small car category in 2005, the Neon's final year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/news/2005/iihs_news_030605.pdf |title=IIHS News: March 6, 2005 |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-08-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081127130958/http://www.iihs.org/news/2005/iihs_news_030605.pdf |archivedate=November 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cars made from 2000 to 2005 that were rated "Poor" when tested without optional side airbags included the Ford Focus, Toyota Corolla, Toyota Prius, Mitsubishi Lancer, and Chevrolet Cobalt. No small car made in this period, tested without side airbags, achieved better than a "Poor."&lt;ref name=IIHS&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iihs.org/news/2005/iihs_news_030605.pdf |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110701111358/http://www.iihs.org/news/2005/iihs_news_030605.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-01 |title=Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Report |publisher=Iihs.org |date=2005-03-06 |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the Institute carried out side impact tests on 14 small car models, simulating an impact with an SUV. Among these, the Neon performed the worst. IIHS stated that the Neon had ''"...major problems beginning with its structure. This car is a disaster...The structure is poor...If this had been a real driver in a real crash, it's likely it wouldn’t have been survivable...if safety is a priority, the Neon is a small car to be avoided."''&lt;ref name=IIHS/&gt;

The '''Chrysler CM Valiant''' is an [[automobile]] that was produced in [[Australia]] by [[Chrysler Australia]] from 1978 to 1980 and subsequently by [[Mitsubishi Australia]] from 1980 to 1981. It was a facelifted and revised version of the [[Chrysler CL Valiant]], which it replaced. It was the last Australian [[Chrysler Valiant]].

==Model range==
The CM Valiant was offered in 4 door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]] and 5 door [[station wagon]] body styles in the following models:
* Chrysler Valiant sedan&lt;ref name=CM_Brochure&gt;Regal and Valiant (Chrysler CM Regal and Valiant sales brochure 5/2006261), Chrysler Australia Ltd., July 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

Regal models were marketed as Chrysler Regals, without the Valiant name.&lt;ref name=CM_Brochure/&gt;

A GLX pack, option code A16,&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, A History of Chrysler in Australia, 2010, page 421&lt;/ref&gt; was offered on the CM Valiant sedan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valiantglx.com/glx.htm GLX Information, www.valiantglx.com] Retrieved on 9 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It featured the 265 cubic inch (4.3 litre) engine, the four speed manual transmission, or 3 speed auto or the 318 v8 engine with an auto, “Hot Wire” cast alloy wheels, a tachometer, front grille paint treatment, tinted side glass, roof console with map light, rear seat armrest, floor console, body stripes and other embellishments.&lt;ref name=Unique/&gt;

The '''Chrysler Valiant (SV1)''' is an [[automobile]] which was produced in Australia from March 1962 to April 1963 by [[Chrysler Australia]]. It was the second Australian [[Chrysler Valiant]] model, replacing the [[Chrysler Valiant (RV1)|RV1]] (R series)

==Changes==
The SV1 Valiant (or "S Series" &lt;ref name=Unique/&gt;) was introduced in March 1962,&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; replacing the [[Chrysler Valiant (RV1)]]—also known as the "R Series"—only ten weeks after the release of its predecessor.&lt;Ref Name=Farmer107&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, page 107&lt;/ref&gt; Like the RV1 it was essentially a US design just assembled in Australia.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; It was an evolution of the previous model, featuring a revised radiator grille treatment with the name "Valiant" at the top.&lt;Ref Name=Farmer107/&gt; The boot lid no longer included a non-functional spare wheel moulding and round tail-lights replaced the previous oblong units.&lt;Ref Name=Farmer107/&gt; Mechanical changes included larger brakes, increased fuel tank capacity and a corrosion-resistant exhaust muffler.&lt;ref name=Unique/&gt; A steering-column mounted gearshift replaced the floor-mounted shifter, however cars fitted with the automatic transmission option retained push-putton controls.&lt;Ref Name=Farmer108&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, page 108&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''' Chrysler Valiant (VK)''' is an [[automobile]] which was produced by [[Chrysler Australia]] from October 1975 to October 1976.&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; It was the eleventh [[Australia]]n produced [[Chrysler Valiant]] series.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, A History of Chrysler in Australia 1946-1981, pages 414 to 416&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Chrysler Valiant VK series was introduced in October 1975, replacing the [[Chrysler Valiant (VJ)|Valiant VJ series]].&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; The VK was essentially a facelift of the VJ with revised grilles, taillights and badging.&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; The VK was intended to have significantly different styling to the VJ, however this did not eventuate due to financial constraints.&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt;

The range was rationalized with a reduced number of models and options.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; The Chrysler name was now prompted more strongly with Chrysler badging displayed prominently on the new models.&lt;ref&gt;''New face, new features'', Modern Motor, December 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The Charger was now known as the ''Chrysler Charger'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_chrysler_valiant_vk.htm ''Chrysler Valiant VK'', www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au] Retrieved on 24 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; having previously been promoted as the ''Valiant Charger by Chrysler''.&lt;ref&gt;''Valiant Charger by Chrysler'' (sales brochure for VJ series Valiant Charger by Chrysler)&lt;/ref&gt;

The six cylinder engines were fitted with a new Carter carburetor.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;Tony David, Aussie Cars, 1987, page 143&lt;/ref&gt; A vacuum operated “Fuel Pacer” was offered as an option, the device using a flashing light to assist the driver in avoiding fuel wastage.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; This light was initially on the right-hand guard, but was later fitted to the instrument panel.&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; Additional safety features included a pressure proportioning valve in the rear brake circuit,&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, A History of Chrysler in Australia 1946-1981, page 197&lt;/ref&gt; power-boosted brakes and hazard warning lights.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; Indicator, headlight dipping, headlight flashing and windscreen wiper controls were now housed in a steering column stalk.&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; This was the first multi-purpose stalk control to be fitted by any of the “big three" manufacturers,&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; the other two being [[Ford Australia]] and [[General Motors-Holden's]].

==Model range==
The VK series was offered in 4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]], 5-door [[station wagon]], [[coupé]] and [[coupé utility]] body styles&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; in the following models:

* Chrysler Valiant Ranger sedan&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt;
* Chrysler Valiant Ranger wagon&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt;
* Chrysler Valiant Regal sedan&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt;
* Chrysler Valiant Regal wagon&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt;
* Chrysler Charger XL&lt;ref name=Charger&gt;''Chrysler Charger'' (sales brochure for VK series Chrysler Charger XL &amp; 770), Chrysler Australia Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chrysler Charger 770&lt;ref name=Charger/&gt;
* Dodge utility&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt;

200 Charger White Knight Specials were produced, based on the Charger XL.&lt;ref name=AMC&gt;James Cockington, ''1976 VK Chrysler Charger White Knight'', Australian Muscle Car, Issue 78, 2014/15, pages 38 to 45&lt;/ref&gt; Specified via Option Code A50,&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, A History of Chrysler in Australia 1946-1981, page 422&lt;/ref&gt; 100 examples were produced in Arctic White and 100 in Amarante Red.&lt;ref name=AMC/&gt;

==Engines and transmissions==
The range of engines available in the VK series comprised {{convert|215|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-six engine|I6]], {{convert|245|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-six engine|I6]], {{convert|265|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-six engine|I6]], {{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]] and {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]].&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt; 3 speed manual, 4 speed manual and 3 speed automatic transmissions were offered.&lt;ref name=Tuckey/&gt;
{{Clear}}
As of July 1976, the 215 and 360 engines were dropped from the lineup, to conform with ADR27A emissions requirements. The 215 was replaced by a low compression version of the 245.

==Production and replacement==
VK production comprised 11,722 sedans, 4,039 wagons, 1,625 Chargers and 3,169 utilities for a total of 20,555 units.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, A History of Chrysler in Australia 1946-1981, page 418&lt;/ref&gt; This was the lowest Valiant production since the [[Chrysler Valiant (SV1)|S Series]]. The VK was superseded by the [[Chrysler Valiant (CL)]] in November 1976.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; 
{{Clear}}

==Chrysler CK series==
{{Main|Chrysler by Chrysler}}
[[Chrysler Australia]] also produced the related Chrysler CK series, a long wheelbase, luxury model developed from the Valiant VK.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Tuckey and Ewan Kennedy, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, pages 144 to 149&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 1976, the 360 (5.9L) engine was dropped to meet ADR27A emissions requirements, being replaced by the 318 (5.2L) engine as standard fitment to the Chrysler, now badged as Chrysler SE, gaining colour coded hubcaps and Cloth Cord trim at the same time.

}}The '''Chrysler Pacifica''' is a [[minivan]] being produced by the [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] division of [[FCA US LLC]]. Despite sharing its name with a [[Chrysler Pacifica (CS)|discontinued crossover]], it is an all-new design replacing the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]].

The minivan is produced with two powertrains, a 3.6-liter gasoline powered engine and a [[plug-in hybrid]], marketed as '''Pacifica Hybrid'''. The plug-in hybrid version has a 16-kWh [[lithium-ion battery]] that can propel the car up to {{convert|33|mi|abbr=on}} on [[All-electric range|electric power alone]]. The gasoline-only version of the Pacifica minivan went on sale in mid-2016, while the plug-in hybrid version became available in early 2017.

== History ==
[[File:2017 Chrysler Pacifica on West Side Highway.jpg|thumb|left|Side view]]
In June 2013, it was reported that [[Chrysler]] was preparing to produce a new generation of its Town &amp; Country minivan at the [[Windsor Assembly Plant]], with production set to begin in 2015 and a release for the 2017 model year. An industry analyst reported that the new version would possibly be a [[crossover utility vehicle]] in the vein of the [[Chrysler Pacifica (CS)|Pacifica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blogs.windsorstar.com/2013/06/18/next-generation-minivan-launch-in-2015-as-chrysler-town-and-country-report/ |work=Windsor Star |year=2013 |accessdate=2013-09-10|title=Next minivan to launch in 2015 as Chrysler Town and Country: Report|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140330123926/http://blogs.windsorstar.com/2013/06/18/next-generation-minivan-launch-in-2015-as-chrysler-town-and-country-report/ |archivedate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, FCA CEO [[Sergio Marchionne]] announced that it would invest $2 billion in developing a new minivan, and overhauling the Windsor Assembly Plant to facilitate its production.&lt;ref name="dfp-pacifica"&gt;{{cite news|title=2017 Chrysler Pacifica is a 'monumental leap' forward|url= http://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/detroit-auto-show/2016/01/11/2017-chrysler-pacifica-minivan-monumental-leap/78336620/ |accessdate=11 January 2016|newspaper=Detroit Free Press |publisher=Gannett}}&lt;/ref&gt; A company roadmap revealed that a new Town &amp; Country would begin production in February 2016 for the 2017 model year, and that the final-generation Dodge Grand Caravan would be maintained in parallel with the new Town &amp; Country as a lower-cost option during the 2017 model year, after which it will be discontinued. Marchionne has been against "duplicate[d] investments" in product development—a strategy reflected by his reduction of [[Rebadging|badge-engineering]] between FCA US's domestic marques.&lt;ref name="detnews-marchionnedup"&gt;{{cite news|title=Marchionne on consolidation: 'Something needs to give'|url= http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/chrysler/2015/04/29/fiat-chrysler-plans-increase-na-profit-margin/26572323/ |newspaper=The Detroit News|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.autonews.com/article/20150622/OEM04/306229983/dodge-plans-to-produce-17-minivan |title=Dodge plans to produce '17 minivan |work=Automotive News |last=Vellequette |first=Larry P. |date=June 22, 2015 |accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dodgenotleavingyet"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/chrysler/2015/12/05/2017-chrysler-minivan-coming-dodge-not-leaving-yet/76745544/ |title=2017 Chrysler minivan coming; Dodge not leaving yet |last=Priddle |first=Alisa |newspaper=Detroit Free Press |date=December 5, 2015 |accessdate=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 3, 2015, FCA filed to have its [[trademark]] registration on the Pacifica brand renewed; FCA's Head of Passenger Car Brands Timothy Kuniskis denied that this was related to any new products, and that it was standard industry practice to continue renewing its trademarks because "you don't want to lose names. Establishing new names is expensive."&lt;ref name="dodgenotleavingyet" /&gt;

The new vehicle debuted on January 11, 2016, at the 2016 [[North American International Auto Show]]. Rather than being named as the Town &amp; Country, the new vehicle was branded as the Pacifica. The decision to drop the Town &amp; Country brand was made primarily to distinguish the new vehicle from previous iterations; Director of Chrysler brand product marketing Bruce Velisek explained that the Pacifica was meant to "change the entire paradigm of what people know about minivans in the segment". Among its differences from the previous Town &amp; Country is a new platform, and a design carrying a sportier appearance inspired by crossovers—a market segment that had cannibalized minivan sales—in an effort to disassociate the vehicle from other minivans with a boxier build.&lt;ref name="detnews-2017pacifica"&gt;{{cite news|title=2017 Chrysler Pacifica: All-new ‘modern family’ minivan|url= http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/detroit-auto-show/2016/01/11/chrysler-pacifica-new-minivan-todays-modern-family/78613046/ |accessdate=11 January 2016|newspaper=The Detroit News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aol-newpacifica"&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 Chrysler Pacifica isn't your parents' Town &amp; Country [w/video]|url= http://www.autoblog.com/2016/01/11/2017-chrysler-pacifica-minivan-detroit-official/#slide-3762538 |website=Autoblog|publisher=AOL|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysler is also changing the minivan's sliding doors: they will be aluminum and hands-free, opening automatically when the fob holder waves under them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/new-chrysler-pacifica-minivan-1.3398114 |title=Chrysler unveils all-new minivan at Detroit auto show|website=www.cbc.ca |access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Waymo-Pacifica.jpg|thumb|[[Waymo]] Pacifica driverless minivan]]

The production of a [[plug-in hybrid]] version, which will be the first of its class in the United States, was, according to chief engineer Kevin Mets, meant to create an electric vehicle that could feasibly be a family's "primary vehicle".&lt;ref name="autoblog-hybrid"/&gt;

On November 7, 2017, [[Waymo]] announced that it had begun testing [[Autonomous car|driverless cars]] without a safety driver at the driver position using the Pacifica plug-in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/7/16615290/waymo-self-driving-safety-driver-chandler-autonomous|title=Waymo is first to put fully self-driving cars on US roads without a safety driver|work=The Verge|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chrysler Voyager ===
{{See also|Chrysler Voyager#Sixth generation (2020–present)}}
Starting with the 2020 model year, the low-end "L" and "LX" models have been separated from the Pacifica nameplate and are now sold under the Voyager nameplate. This marks the return of the Voyager nameplate to the Chrysler model lineup, in which it was last used in 2016, and the North American market, in which it was last used in 2003 in the United States and 2007 in Mexico. In addition to the L and LX trim levels, an "LXi" model is available to fleet customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a28207234/2020-chrysler-voyager-photos-info/|title=The 2020 Chrysler Voyager Is a Budget Version of the Pacifica Minivan|work=Car and Driver|access-date=2019-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2021 facelift ===

A restyled 2021 [[Chrysler]] Pacifica was introduced at the 2020 [[Chicago Auto Show]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. The 2021 [[model year]] Pacifica features new exterior styling, and is now available with All Wheel Drive (AWD) for gasoline-powered models in addition to Front Wheel Drive (FWD) (Pacifica Hybrid models will remain exclusively available with Front Wheel Drive (FWD)). The new Pacifica is the first [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]] vehicle to feature the new [[Android (operating system)|Android]]-based [[Uconnect]] 5 infotainment system with a standard 10.1-inch high-resolution touchscreen display and [[Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]] smartphone integration, as well as [[Amazon Alexa]] capabilities, as well as [[SiriusXM]] [[Satellite Radio]] and high-speed data connectivity. USB C high-speed data and charging ports are standard equipment, and [[TomTom]]-based GPS navigation will be optional. The "FamCam" rear camera system can display an image of rear passengers in place of a conversation mirror. A new '''Pinnacle''' trim level adds "Pinnacle" badging on the front doors, unique leather seat trim, quilted leather pillows for the second-row seats, and unique exterior styling cues.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.chrysler.com/2021/pacifica.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
Production of the vehicle uses an all-new platform at the Windsor Plant in Windsor, Ontario, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = As Chrysler redoes the minivan, a look back|url = http://bsccomment.com/2016/01/17/as-chrysler-redoes-the-minivan-a-look-back.html|website = bsccomment.com|access-date = 2016-01-17|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160312010609/http://bsccomment.com/2016/01/17/as-chrysler-redoes-the-minivan-a-look-back.html|archive-date = 2016-03-12|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Powertrains ===

[[File:Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid WAS 2017 1684.jpg|thumb|275px|Charging port of the 2017 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid]]
The Pacifica uses a new revision of the 3.6-liter [[Chrysler Pentastar engine#PSU|Pentastar]] V6 engine, and will be produced with two powertrains, gasoline-only and [[plug-in hybrid]], the latter marketed as '''Pacifica Hybrid'''. The plug-in hybrid version uses a 16-kWh [[lithium-ion battery]], located under the floor under the second row of seats (the hybrid will not be available with the Stow'n'Go seating and vacuum), with an [[all-electric range]] of {{convert|33|mi|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Szostech|first1=Michael|title=Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid Specifications|url=http://www.mychryslerpacifica.com/chrysler-pacifica-hybrid-specifications/|publisher=My Electric Car Forums|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; before switching back to using the gasoline engine. The battery can be fully recharged in two hours using a 240-volt plug-in system.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} The gasoline-only version of the Pacifica minivan went on sale in mid-2016; the plug-in hybrid version, in 2017.

The '''Chrysler Pacifica''' nameplate was used by [[Chrysler]] for a variety of vehicles. It was first used on a luxury [[minivan]] concept vehicle in 1999. From 2004 to 2008, it was used on a mid-size [[crossover (automobile)|crossover]]. Since the 2017 model year, it has been used as the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country|Town &amp; Country minivan]]'s replacement.

The '''Icon Derelict DeSoto''' is a one-off [[rat rod]], modified from a standard 1952 [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country (1941-1988)|Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] by ICON. It uses a [[Chrysler Hemi]] [[V8 engine]], and features the front end from a [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]].

== Specification ==
The Derelict DeSoto was originally built as a [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country (1941-1988)|Chrysler Town &amp; Country Wagon]] in 1952, but was rebuilt by Icon into a [[rat rod]] as part of their Derelict line.&lt;ref name="autoblog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/09/18/icon-derelict-desoto-cools-its-heels-in-jay-lenos-garage/ |title=Icon Derelict DeSoto cools its heels in Jay Leno's Garage |publisher=Autoblog |date=18 September 2012 |accessdate=21 September 2012 |first=Zach |last=Bowman}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car features the front end from a 1952 [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]], whilst it retains the Town &amp; Country's original rear end.&lt;ref name=dupontregistry&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dupontregistry.com/AUTOS/BLOG/post/2011/02/22/Hot-Rod-magazine-to-feature-Icons-Derelict.aspx |title=Hot Rod magazine to feature Icon's Derelict |publisher=duPont Registry |date=22 February 2011 |accessdate=21 September 2013 |first=Benjamin |last=Greene}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard [[Chrysler Hemi]] [[V8 engine]] was replaced by a 6.1-litre, {{convert|425|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} [[Street and Racing Technology|SRT]] Hemi V8, as used in the [[Dodge Challenger SRT-8]]; a 6-speed [[automatic transmission]] was also fitted.&lt;ref name="hrm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hotrod.com/featuredvehicles/hrdp_1104_the_derelict_1952_chrysler_town_country/viewall.html |title=The Derelict - 1952 Chrysler Town &amp; Country - Beauty In The Beast |publisher=[[Hot Rod Magazine]] |date=April 2011 |accessdate=21 September 2013 |author=[[David Freiburger]], Rob Kinnan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
[[Hot Rod Magazine]] tested the car in April 2011, and were generally positive.&lt;ref name="hrm"/&gt; They praised the car's reliability and driveability, although [[David Freiburger]] criticized the placement of the [[fly-by-wire]] [[throttle]], and both testers criticized the cupholders.&lt;ref name="hrm"/&gt; In 2012, it was featured on an episode of [[Jay Leno|Jay Leno's Garage]].&lt;ref name="autoblog"/&gt;

The '''Eagle Vision''' was a [[full-size car|full-sized]], [[front-wheel drive]] four-door [[sports sedan]] that was produced from 1992 to 1997. It was marketed by [[Eagle (automobile)|Eagle]], replacing the [[American Motors|AMC]]/[[Renault]]-designed [[Eagle Premier]] (from which the Vision was derived). The Eagle Vision was badged as the '''Chrysler Vision''' in [[Europe]]. The Vision debuted at the [[North American International Auto Show#1992|1992 North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]]. As one of the LH [[sedan (car)|sedan]]s, it was ''[[Automobile Magazine]]'s'' Automobile of the Year in 1993, and ultimately the only Eagle model to be completely designed and built in-house by Chrysler.

==Design background==
[[File:1995 Vision TSi rear.jpg|thumb|1995 Eagle Vision TSi rear]]
The Vision's design can be traced to 1986, when designer Kevin Verduyn completed the initial exterior design of a new aerodynamic concept sedan called Navajo. The design never passed the clay model stage.

It was also at this time that the Chrysler Corporation purchased [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]] [[Italy|Italian]] [[sports car]] manufacturer [[Lamborghini]]. The Navajo's exterior design was reworked and became the [[Lamborghini Portofino]], released as a concept at the [[Frankfurt Auto Show#1987|1987 Frankfurt Auto Show]]. The Portofino was heralded as a design triumph, setting in motion Chrysler's decision to produce a production sedan with the Portofino's revolutionary exterior design, called "cab-forward."

The [[cab forward]] design was characterized by the long, low slung windshield, and relatively short overhangs. The wheels were effectively pushed to the corners of the car, creating a larger passenger cabin than the contemporaries of the time.

Design of the chassis began in the late 1980s, after Chrysler had bought another automaker: [[American Motors Corporation]] (AMC) in 1987, from which the Eagle division is derived. During this time, Chrysler began designing the replacement for the [[Dodge Dynasty]] and [[Chrysler Fifth Avenue]] as well as a potential [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]]. The initial design of Dodge's LH bore resemblance to the Dynasty, and this design was scrapped entirely after [[François Castaing]], formerly AMC's Vice President of product engineering and development, became Chrysler's Vice President of vehicle engineering in 1988. The new design, under Castaing's leadership, began with the [[Eagle Premier]].

The chassis design was continually refined throughout the following years, as it underpinned more Chrysler prototypes: the 1989 Chrysler Millennium and 1990 [[Eagle Optima]]. The Premier's longitudinal engine mounting layout was inherited, as was the front suspension geometry, and parts of the braking system. The chassis itself became a flexible architecture capable of supporting front or [[rear-wheel drive]] (designated "LH" and "LX" respectively). The transmission was inspired by the Premier's Audi and ZF automatics. Borrowing heavily from Chrysler's A604 (41TE) "[[Ultradrive]]" transversely mounted automatic, it became the A606 (also known as 42LE).
[[File:1995 Eagle Vision ESi Sedan 3.5L - cropped.jpg|thumb|1995 Eagle Vision ESi]]

By 1990, it was decided that the new technologically advanced car would need a new technologically advanced engine to power it. Until that time, the only engine confirmed for use was Chrysler's 3.3&amp;nbsp;L [[pushrod engine|pushrod]] [[V6]]. The 3.3&amp;nbsp;L engine's 60° block was bored out to 3.5&amp;nbsp;L, while the pushrod-actuated valves were replaced with [[SOHC]] cylinder heads with four valves per cylinder, creating an advanced 3.5&amp;nbsp;L V6.

The appearance, still based on the cab forward exterior design of the 1987 [[Lamborghini Portofino]] [[concept car|concept]], with its aerodynamic shape, made for little wind noise inside this large car. The engineering and sleek styling gives the Vision a low [[Automobile drag coefficients|drag coefficient]] (0.31), on par with the [[Porsche 997]].

Without badges, the Vision could easily pass as a [[Chrysler Concorde#First generation|(first-generation) Concorde]]. The main difference between the two are the taillight clusters. Like the [[Europe]]an sedans it was marketed to compete against, the Vision incorporates rear amber turn signals over the Concorde's red ones. Neither does the Vision have the Concorde's faux rear lightbar between the taillights. While the two cars share headlights, the Vision's grille is smaller and, separated by its prominent center badge, has been likened to the appearance of "nostrils." The interior of the Vision is nearly identical to the Concorde, the biggest difference being the absence of the Concorde's faux wood trim and steering wheel emblem. Unlike the Vision, the Concorde never offered the autostick option. Marketed as a sport sedan, the Vision offered only bucket seats with console, never the split bench with column shift.

The Vision featured a monochromatic design inside and out, with no brand or model badge on the doors (as found on the Concorde), and available aluminum wheels with a simple design. The single color motif was more pronounced on models without the grey lower body trim paint scheme. In keeping with its high-performance image, the Vision was the only LH sedan to come standard with "touring" suspension.&lt;ref name="allpar"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allpar.com/model/lh2/lh-body.html |title=Development of the Body Shell, Suspension, and Steering of the Chrysler LH Series (Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler Concorde, Eagle Vision) |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Performance" suspension was an available option on the Vision.&lt;ref name="allpar"/&gt;

The upscale TSi model featured leather-trimmed seats, 8-way [[power seat]]s for both the driver and front passenger, leather-wrapped steering wheel, leather shift knob, cloth door inserts, rear seat vents, center rear armrest, and personal reading lamps.

[[Power window]]s and central door locks were standard for both trims, as were dual airbags, with [[Remote keyless system|remote keyless entry]] available as an option. Among other factory installed sound systems available, was the top-of-the-line [[Infinity (audio)|Infinity]] sound system which included 8 speakers positioned throughout the cabin along with an equalizer. Head units included a radio with either cassette or CD playback, and a maximum five-bands adjustable graphic equalizer.
[[File:Eagle-Vision.JPG|thumb|right|1993–1995 Eagle Vision with grey lower body trim]]
[[File:Chrysler Vision Solec Street Warsaw Poland-1.jpg|thumb|right|Chrysler Vision]]

The TSi model was distinguishable as it did not have a fixed mast antenna, but a retractable power antenna that stored itself inside the rear passenger-side fender. Anti-lock brakes ([[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]]) were standard, with [[Traction control system|traction control]] optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1993-to-1997-eagle-vision-1.htm |title=1993–1997 Eagle Vision Road Tests |publisher=Consumer Guide Automotive |date=23 November 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111206045203/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1993-to-1997-eagle-vision-1.htm |archivedate=6 December 2011 |accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dual-way power sunroofs were available on this car in either trim. They were designed and installed by American Sunroof Corp. (now ASC Global) from its Columbus, Ohio plant, not by Mopar itself.  An installed sunroof eliminated most of the front overhead console that featured storage bins for a garage door opener and sunglasses. However, the Overhead Travel Information System (OTIS), an onboard computer with integrated map lights, was retained.

The Vision was generally the middle offering of the original three LH cars, with the ESi starting between a base Intrepid and a base Concorde (usually just under the Concorde by a few hundred dollars). However the TSi's base price was more than a base Concorde. Other [[Chrysler LH platform|LH]] cars, the New Yorker and LHS, started higher than the Vision.

===Trims===
*''ESi'' - 1993–1997
*''TSi'' - 1993–1997

==Performance==
The Eagle Vision ESi came equipped with a 3.3 liter [[V6]] engine initially producing 153 [[Brake horsepower|bhp]] (112&amp;nbsp;kW) and rising to {{convert|162|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in the 1994–1995 models. For 1996, it lost {{convert|4|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, but gained 9 [[ft·lbf]] of torque. The TSi was factory-equipped with the more powerful [[Single overhead cam|SOHC]] 24-valve 3.5 L V6 engine producing {{convert|214|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Both engines were joined to a 4-speed automatic. The 1996 and 1997 TSi with its 3.5 had the 4-speed autostick option featuring a unique PRNDL mechanism invented by Peter Gruich, with no option of a [[manual transmission]].

===Engines===
*3.3 L V6 &amp;ndash; Horsepower and Torque: {{convert|153|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} &amp; {{convert|177|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} (1992–93), {{convert|162|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} &amp; {{convert|194|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} (1994–1995) and, {{convert|158|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} &amp; {{convert|203|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} (1996–1997)
*3.5 L V6 &amp;ndash; {{convert|214|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} &amp; {{convert|221|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}
The 3.3 liter engine was engineered to run on 87 [[Octane rating|octane]] [[gasoline]], while the larger 3.5 requires mid-grade 89 octane fuel as a minimum, but benefits from premium 91 octane fuel.

==Year-to-year changes==
*'''1994''': Variable-assist power steering was available, providing more feel at higher speeds. Both models now wore the same lower-body cladding, minimizing the evident differences between the ESi and TSi. The 3.3&amp;nbsp;L [[internal combustion engine|engine]]'s power output was increased by 8&amp;nbsp;hp, while the 4-speed [[automatic transmission]] was revised for smoother shifting.
*'''1995''': New standard features included heated power exterior rear-view mirrors, power windows, and an AM/FM stereo with a cassette player. The 3.5-liter engine became available as an upgrade option for the ESi trim level.
*'''1996''': A new [[Autostick]] shifting feature became available for the TSi trim. The car could be "manually" shifted by tilting the shift knob right or left to change gears up or down. Plastic lower trim was deleted in favor of body color lower trim for a monochromatic color scheme. Pentastar logo previously present on the front fenders in front of the doors was deleted. Windshield wiper jets were moved from the wiper arms to the hood. All 1996 Eagle Visions were made OBD-II compliant.
*'''1997''': Only minor changes were made to the 1997 Vision. After this model year, the Vision was discontinued.

==End of the Vision==
The Vision sold around 105,000 units, from 1993 to 1997, and Chrysler was planning to continue it for the redesign of the LH cars for 1998. Some prototypes featured the Eagle logo, and Vision production continued into September 1997 to offer dealers with an adequate amount of 1997 models, until the introduction redesigned 1998 Vision. However, Chrysler made the decision to stop production of the Vision and [[Eagle Talon|Talon]] (Eagle's only other model by then) with the last unit built on September 5, 1997. On September 29, 1997, the automaker notified 2,340 U.S. and 337 Canadian dealers that the [[Eagle automobile|Eagle]] brand would be discontinued by the end of the 1998 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CyBFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=Eagle+finally+giving+up+Chrysler+discontinued+the+brand+after+1998 |page=203 |title=American Motors Corporation: The Rise and Fall of America's Last Independent Automaker |first=Patrick R. |last=Foster |year=2013 |publisher=Motorbooks |isbn=9780760344255 |accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QpLtCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT626&amp;dq=By+the+end+of+the+1998+model+year,+the+Eagle+brand,+was+discontinued |title=The Advertising Age Encyclopedia of Advertising |first=John |last=McDonough |first2=Karen |last2=Egolf |publisher=Routledge |year=2015 |isbn=9781135949136 |accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://www.theautochannel.com/articles/press/date/19970929/press006613.html |title=Chrysler to Discontinue Eagle Brand at End of 1998 Model Year |date=29 September 1997 |publisher=The Auto Channel |agency=Chrysler Corporation |accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}The '''third-generation [[Chrysler minivans|Chrysler minivan]]s''' are a series of passenger [[Minivan|minivans]] that were marketed by the [[Chrysler Corporation]] (later [[Daimler AG#Merger with Chrysler|DaimlerChrysler]]) from the 1996 to 2000 model years.  Designated the NS platform by Chrysler, these minivans were sold by Chrysler, Dodge and Plymouth divisions in passenger configurations; minivans were exported under the Chrysler brand.  While the second-generation AS platform was a revision of the original vans, the NS platform marked the first ground-up redesign of the Chrysler vans since their 1984 introduction, ending the use of components from [[Chrysler K platform|K-Car]] derivatives.

The first non-compact minivans{{Original research inline|date=November 2019}} in North America to adopt four sliding passenger doors, the third-generation Chrysler minivans saw its form factor adopted by many competitors.  In addition to chief competitors [[Ford Windstar]], [[Honda Odyssey (North America)|Honda Odyssey]], and [[Toyota Sienna]], the NS-platform configuration was adopted by the [[Chevrolet Venture]], [[Oldsmobile Silhouette]], and [[Pontiac Montana|Pontiac (Trans Sport) Montana]], and the [[Mercury Villager]]/[[Nissan Quest]].

In line with the first and second-generation minivans, the third-generation minivans were assembled at [[Windsor Assembly]] in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor, Ontario, Canada]], with additional production sourced from [[Saint Louis Assembly|Saint Louis (South) Assembly]] in [[Fenton, Missouri]].  To supplement exports from the United States, production of the Chrysler Voyager was sourced from [[Graz|Graz, Austria]] (in the [[Eurostar Automobilwerk|Eurostar]] joint venture factory between Chrysler and [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch]]).

== Development ==
Development of the NS platform minivans commenced in 1990; with a team lead by [[Tom Gale (designer)|Tom Gale]] and Chris Theodore, design work (by Don Renkert) was approved in September 1991 with a design freeze in May 1992.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQhTq18vi7AC&amp;pg=PA300&amp;lpg=PA300&amp;dq=chrysler+ns+may+1992+november+prototype&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Baa1wOSccR&amp;sig=AzR2pxZT2AWQuP-2jLCW3ZGN--0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9GBiUZCpAvSC2gWRk4DoBg&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=chrysler%20ns%20may%201992%20november%20prototype&amp;f=false|title=Riding the Roller Coaster: A History of the Chrysler Corporation – Google Books|date=1991-09-23|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to becoming the first all-new Chrysler minivan in a decade, the third-generation vans were also a response to the development of a front-wheel drive replacement for the [[Ford Aerostar]] (unveiled in 1994 as the 1995 Ford Windstar).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.org/NLD_docs/DHUM0006.pdf|title=Civil Action File No. 0110133833|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016062810/http://www.justice.org/NLD_docs/DHUM0006.pdf|archivedate=October 16, 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the S/AS-platform vans did not share direct structural underpinnings with the Chrysler K-Cars, in contrast to their predecessors, the NS vans were the first generation designed from the ground up as a minivan.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/96-development.html|title=1996-2000 Chrysler, Plymouth, and Dodge Minivans: the reasons behind the choices (development story)|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the first Chrysler vehicles designed with [[CATIA#Automotive|CATIA]], which allowed for much tighter design tolerances.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In its effort to design the third-generation minivans, Chrysler benchmarked the vehicle from various sources of data, using customer input, warranty data, and research based on various other minivans (the Ford Aerostar, Mercury Villager, and Toyota Previa)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  During its market research, Chrysler sought owner feedback on adding a $300 driver-side sliding door option from minivan owners, with 85% of participants answering that they would buy the van with the second sliding door, even as an extra-cost option.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Ironically, the feature was planned for the first-generation minivans, but was removed in 1980 due to concerns over additional tooling costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/history.html|title=Creating the Plymouth, Dodge, and Chrysler Minivan: The Caravan/Voyager Development Story|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside the sliding door, several designs underwent consideration for the floor layout.  Initially, a lower floor height was considered (research feedback felt that the step-in height was too high), but was rejected as it jeopardized the higher driving position sought by buyers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  For production, a compromise design was approved, retaining the same floor height as the previous generation eased into lower door sills.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In addition to preserving the higher driving position, the floor design allowed the fitment of all-wheel drive without major modification, larger wheels and tires, CNG tanks, and batteries for electric vehicles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

While the V6 powertrains of the previous-generation platform were retained, during the development of the NS platform, several configurations underwent configuration.  To improve the body structure, a mid-engine powertrain (in line with the [[Toyota Previa]]) was initially considered, but was rejected for cost and complexity considerations.  A transition to a longitudinal-mounted powertrain (to simplify V6 engine access and all-wheel drive configuration) underwent strong consideration; the transverse layout was chosen in order to reduce overall length.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In an extensive shift from the boxy design of the first two generations, the body adopted [[Cab forward|cab-forward design]], shifting the dashboard and windshield forward.  In contrast to the controversial styling of the GM APV minivans, the roof was moved upward (nearly 3 inches) and the cowl moved lower&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, allowing for a less radical windshield angle.  To move the base of the windshield back several inches (to further improve visibility), Chrysler designed the windshield wiper module/lower windshield cowl to be removable (allowing for improved engine bay access).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In total, the development of the NS platform would cost Chrysler Corporation $2.8 billion dollars (approximately $4.6 billion in 2017 dollars&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://westegg.com/inflation/infl.cgi|title=The Inflation Calculator|website=westegg.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the most costly vehicle ever developed by Chrysler at the time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Model overview ==

=== Chassis ===
The third-generation Chrysler minivans use the Chrysler NS platform designation.  Using a completely new unibody chassis, the NS platform uses a 113.3 inch wheelbase for standard-wheelbase vans (1.3 inches longer) and a 119.3 inch wheelbase for long-wheelbase vans (same as 1994-1995 AS-platform vans).  Front-wheel drive is the standard drivetrain configuration with all-wheel drive offered as an option.

The suspension of the NS platform is a modified version of the previous two generations.  In front, the use of [[MacPherson struts]] continued, with leaf springs and a beam axle in the rear.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/96-development.html|title=1996-2000 Chrysler, Plymouth, and Dodge Minivans: the reasons behind the choices (development story)|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During its development, a number of suspension configurations were considered, including a 4-wheel double wishbone layout.  Rear leaf springs were retained largely in an effort to provide an ideal handling balance with a load in addition to maximize interior load space.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

In a major modification, the front track width was widened three inches, allowing for lower mounting of the engine and transaxle, reduction in turning radius, and a lower cowl height.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

Front-wheel drive vans had front-wheel disc brakes and rear drum brakes.  From 1997, all-wheel drive vans were fitted with four-wheel disc brakes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/overview.html|title=1996-2000 Chrysler, Plymouth, and Dodge Minivans: Caravan, Voyager, Town &amp; Country|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Powertrains====
For 1996, the Chrysler minivans received the first new four-cylinder engine in the powertrain line since 1987, with the introduction of a 2.4L engine (shared with the JA-platform cars).  While smaller in displacement than its 2.5L predecessor, the 150hp engine nearly matched the 3.0L V6 in both output and fuel economy.

In states that did not observe [[California emission standards]], the Mitsubishi 3.0L V6 was the standard V6 option.  In those that followed California emissions standards, the Chrysler 3.3L V6 was the standard V6 option.  In the Dodge Caravan ES and Chrysler Town &amp; Country LXi, the 3.8L V6 was standard.

In 1999, the 3.8L V6 became optional on the Plymouth Voyager Expresso; in Canada, the 2.4L engine was dropped, with the 3.0L V6 becoming the standard engine.

In the United States and Canada, a manual transmission was no longer available, with a 3-speed [[TorqueFlite]] automatic fitted to the 2.4L and 3.0L engines.  The 3.3L and 3.8L engines were fitted with a 4-speed  [[Ultradrive]] automatic.

For the first time, export vehicles were fitted with different powertrains, with the standard engine being a SOHC 2.0L engine with an optional  DOHC 2.0L engine (from the Neon); a VM Motori 2.5L inline-4 was offered, becoming the first diesel Chrysler minivan.  All three engines were offered with either a 5-speed manual or an automatic transmission.  In addition to the four-cylinder engines, export vehicles were offered the 3.3L and 3.8L V6 engines offered in American-market minivans.  AWD models were not sold in the [[United Kingdom]].

=== Body ===
In an extensive shift from the second-generation minivans, the NS-platform minivans abandoned the boxy body design of the previous two Chrysler minivan generations.  While (on average) three inches taller than their predecessors, the new design lowered the exterior coefficient of drag from 0.39 to 0.35&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/overview.html|title=1996-2000 Chrysler, Plymouth, and Dodge Minivans: Caravan, Voyager, Town &amp; Country|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; (matching the Ford Windstar, bested only by the GM APV minivans).   In the redesign, no body panels were carried over, with all three brands adopting new model badging.

A central feature of the redesign (later becoming a standard feature on some trim levels) was the driver-side sliding door.  While first used on compact minivans, including the [[Nissan Stanza Wagon]] and [[Nissan Axxess]], the NS-platform minivans were the first mid-size minivans to adapt the feature.  Though again using a 3-track mounting system for the sliding doors, the system was redesigned to consume less interior space; the exterior door track was hidden below the side windows.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;  In addition to its styling, the function of the liftgate was changed for the first time, with an exterior handle available for the first time, eliminating the pop-and-lift maneuver of the two previous generations (adapted from the K-car station wagon).  The exterior door handles were redesigned, switching from a flip-up design to a pull-out design.

Alongside the exterior, major changes were made to the interior of the NS-platform minivans.  Again offered with 7 passenger seating, the latching system for the 2nd and 3rd row seats was redesigned; in a single motion, owners could release 2nd and 3rd-row bench seats by floor latch, raising them onto rollers to move them out of the vehicle (the lighter 2nd-row bucket seats did not have them).&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;  For the first time, the seatbacks of front bucket seats folded forward.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;  The mounting positions for the third-row seat were moved inboard, matching the second row, eliminating a separate set of seat mounts on the floor.

While styled far differently from its 1995 predecessor, the dashboard of the NS-platform minivans adopted a similar layout to the second-generation minivans.  For the first time since 1988, each Chrysler minivan shared the same steering wheel (among the only Chrysler Pentastars visible to the driver).  While the glovebox was enlarged, the underseat storage drawer made its return as an option, complemented by a second locking storage compartment mounted to the side of the passenger seat.  As a first for minivans, the NS minivans introduced dual-zone climate control (as an option) and adjustable cupholders.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

=== Safety ===
The 1996–2000 Dodge Grand Caravan received a "Marginal" rating in the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]'s 40&amp;nbsp;mph offset test.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} The structural performance and restraints were graded "Acceptable", but the foot injuries were very high.

In the NHTSA crash tests, it received 4 stars for the driver and front passenger in the frontal-impact. In the side-impact test, it received 5 stars for the driver, and 3 stars for the rear occupant, and resulted in a fuel leak that could cause a fire hazard.

According to EuroNCAP crash test results, the 1999 model Chrysler Voyager did so badly in the frontal impact that it earned no points,&lt;ref name="euroncap.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroncap.com/tests/chrysler_voyager_1999/56.aspx|title=Chrysler Voyager 1999|work=euroncap.com|accessdate=2015-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the worst of the group.{{Cn|date=September 2018}} The body structure became unstable and the steering column was driven back into the driver's chest and head'. The 2007 model Chrysler Voyager fared little better, achieving just 19% in the frontal impact test, with an overall score of 2 stars out of a possible 5.&lt;ref name="www.euroncap.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroncap.com/tests/chrysler_voyager_2007/277.aspx|title=Chrysler Voyager 2007|work=www.euroncap.com|accessdate=2015-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, chest compression measurements on the test dummy 'indicated an unacceptably high risk of serious or fatal injury. As a result, the final star in the adult occupant rating is struck-through'.

Despite the bad results in the EuroNCAP crash tests, statistics from the real world indicate that this is not the whole picture. [[Folksam]] is a Swedish insurance company that in May 2009 published a report on injuries and survivability of 172 car models.  The 88–96 generation got a real world rating of "Average", and the 96-00 generation got a rating called "Safest" (at least 30% safer than the average car.){{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

== Marketing variations ==
Introduced in March 1995 for the 1996 model year&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQhTq18vi7AC&amp;pg=PA300&amp;lpg=PA300&amp;dq=chrysler+ns+may+1992+november+prototype&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Baa1wOSccR&amp;sig=AzR2pxZT2AWQuP-2jLCW3ZGN--0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9GBiUZCpAvSC2gWRk4DoBg&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=chrysler%20ns%20may%201992%20november%20prototype&amp;f=false|title=Riding the Roller Coaster: A History of the Chrysler Corporation – Google Books|date=1991-09-23|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the third-generation Chrysler minivans were marketed by the Chrysler, Dodge, and Plymouth divisions, with the return of the [[Plymouth Voyager]], [[Dodge Caravan]], and [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]].  In a change from the previous two generations, to better distinguish its three divisions, the Plymouth Voyager was marketed as an entry-level minivan, with the Dodge Caravan slotted between the Voyager and the Chrysler Town &amp; Country.    

As before, the Voyager and Caravan were produced in standard and extended-length (Grand) configurations, with the Town &amp; Country introducing a standard-length configuration for the first time.  For the first time, all Chrysler minivans were passenger vans, as the Dodge Caravan C/V cargo van was discontinued.    
[[File:2000 Chrysler Town &amp; Country Limited.png|thumb|2000 Chrysler Town &amp; Country Limited]]

=== Chrysler Town &amp; Country ===
Again positioned as the flagship of the Chrysler minivans, the third-generation Chrysler Town &amp; Country underwent an extensive revision of its model range.  For the first time, a short-wheelbase body was offered, along with multiple trim levels.  As part of the redesign, the model line saw its long-running simulated woodgrain trim (dating to 1965) deleted in favor of body color moldings with chrome exterior trim.  In another change, the Chrysler crystal Pentastar hood ornament was replaced by a medallion-style Chrysler grille badge.

Replacing the LE-trim Voyager/Grand Voyager (in the United States), the base trim was LX (short-wheelbase, SX for 1997-1999) with LXi serving as the top-level trim.  In 1997, the driver-side sliding door became standard on the Town &amp; Country (1996 examples produced without one are very rare).

For 1998, the Town &amp; Country underwent a mid-cycle revision to further differentiate it from its Dodge and Plymouth counterparts, centered around the introduction of a redesigned grille (introducing a "winged" Chrysler badge) and an updated interior.  Above the LXi, the Town &amp; Country Limited made its debut.  For 2000, the short-wheelbase body was discontinued, ending the SX trim.  [[File:2001 Chrysler Grand Voyager LE Automatic 3.3.jpg|thumb|2001 Chrysler Grand Voyager LE (RHD)]]

=== Chrysler Voyager (export) ===
Outside the United States and Canada, Chrysler exported the third-generation minivans to a number of global markets under the Chrysler (Grand) Voyager nameplate.  Using the body and interior of the Dodge Caravan, the Voyager was produced by Saint Louis Assembly in Fenton, Missouri and by Eurostar in Graz, Austria. Despite being discontinued for most markets, a commercial version continued to be offered in the Netherlands under the Dodge Ram Van nameplate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/autohistorian/31839325642 |title=1996 Dodge Ram Van |date=December 30, 2016 |first=Alden |last=Jewell |accessdate=December 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time, the Voyager was produced in right-hand drive, allowing wide sales in Australia and the United Kingdom.  Sharing its V6 engines with its domestic counterpart, the Voyager was also offered with a 2.0L inline-4 (from the Neon, in place of the 2.4L engine), and a 2.5L diesel inline-4.  Along with automatic transmissions, a 5-speed manual transmission was offered (the only third-generation Chrysler minivan produced with a manual transmission).

In some markets (including Brazil and South Korea), Chrysler minivans were offered under the Chrysler Caravan nameplate, using Dodge Caravan bodyshells.[[File:Dodge-Caravan.jpg|thumb|1996 Dodge Caravan (no driver-side sliding door)]]

=== Dodge Caravan ===
In a break from its predecessors, the third-generation Dodge Caravan was marketed distinctly from the Plymouth Voyager, becoming the mid-range model of the Chrysler minivan product line.  The Caravan C/V cargo van was discontinued, with all examples serving as passenger vans.  In place of the Pentastar, Chrysler adopted the Dodge "Ram" hood emblem; the Caravan is the only NS minivan with a hood-mounted emblem.  

As with its predecessor, the Caravan and Grand Caravan used base, SE, LE, and ES trims.  Base and SE/LE trims were fitted with gray bumpers with gray moldings; ES trims (and Sport-package versions) featured body-colored trim.  7-passenger seating was standard, regardless of body length.  For 1999, the driver-side sliding door became offered as an option on all versions of the Caravan.    

For 1999, the Dodge Caravan ES was equipped with an [[Autostick#Chrysler%20Autostick|Autostick gear selector]] for its automatic transmission, a first for a minivan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/first.html|title=Chrysler minivan firsts|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the Caravan is designed with a column-mounted automatic transmission shifter, Autostick is operated via a momentary switch on the gear selector.  [[File:Plymouth Grand Voyager.jpg|thumb|Plymouth Grand Voyager SE]]

=== Plymouth Voyager ===
In a shift from previous minivans, the third-generation Voyager was marketed as the entry-level Chrysler minivan rather than as a direct counterpart of the Dodge Caravan.  While sharing the same bodyshell, the Voyager and Caravan saw significant changes in body trim and feature content.  Distinguished by a dark gray eggcrate grille (a body-color grille became an option in 1998), the Voyager used matte gray bumpers across all trim levels with matte gray side moldings (fog lights were not available as an option).   Before calendar 1996, the NS Voyager was produced with the Pentastar, shifting to the "sailboat" Plymouth grille emblem afterward.  

The Voyager retained the base, SE, and LE trims from its predecessor.  To reduce model overlap, the LE trim was discontinued in the United States (in favor of an expanded Town &amp; Country range).  To allow the Plymouth brand to remain competitive, the Rallye option package was introduced on the SE trim&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure "1996 Plymouth Voyager/Grand Voyager"&lt;/ref&gt;; along with exterior badging, the Rallye offered interior content featured in LE-trim Voyagers and Caravans.  For 1998, the Rallye trim was renamed Expresso.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure "1998 Plymouth Voyager"&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2000, as Chrysler withdrew the Plymouth brand, the Voyager was marketed by both Chrysler and Plymouth.  

== Alternative-fuel vehicles ==
In 1999, Dodge introduced the Caravan EPIC, a fully electric minivan. The EPIC was powered by 28 12-volt NiMH batteries and was capable of traveling up to {{convert|80|mi|km}} on a single charge. The EPIC was sold as a fleet-only lease vehicle. Production of the EPIC was discontinued in 2001. Only a few hundred of these vehicles were produced and sold. After the leases expired they were returned and crushed. Approximately 10 vans remain in private hands today.

== Concept vehicles ==
&lt;p&gt;In 1999, coinciding with the 15th anniversary of Chrysler minivan production, Chrysler unveiled three concept minivans, largely intended to further advance the divisional styling and design of each vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Chrysler Pacifica ===
&lt;p&gt;The [[Chrysler Pacifica (1999 concept vehicle)|Chrysler Pacifica]], derived from the Chrysler Town &amp; Country, was given an exterior and interior restyling.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allcarindex.com/auto-car-model/United-States-Chrysler-Pacifica-Concept-1/|title=Chrysler - Pacifica Concept [1]|website=ACI|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to a full-size conversion van, the Pacifica was given a raised roof for increased headroom, with a full-length skylight. In a 2+2+2 seating layout, the Pacifica was fitted with power-operated middle-row seats (with power-operated footrests).&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  The exterior adapted design elements of the flagship [[Chrysler LHS]] sedan, including a (smaller) version of its grille and modified versions of its headlamps.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2004 to 2008, the Chrysler Pacifica nameplate saw use on a production vehicle, as a CUV derived from the Grand Caravan/Town &amp; Country.  For 2017, the Pacifica nameplate was again revived, used on the current generation of Chrysler-division minivans.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Dodge Caravan R/T ===
&lt;p&gt;As a follow-up to the 1996 Dodge Caravan ESS&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motortrend.com/news/dodge-caravan-ess/|title=Motor Trend {{!}} Car Reviews {{!}} DODGE CARAVAN ESS - FIRST TEST}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the 1999 Dodge Caravan R/T replaced the 3.8L V6 with the 3.5L V6 of the Chrysler 300M, increasing output to 253 hp, paired with the 4-speed AutoStick transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motortrend.com/news/dodge-caravan-2/|title=Motor Trend {{!}} News {{!}} DODGE CARAVAN - DODGE'S CORNER-CARVING CARAVAN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dodge Caravan adapted several styling elements from the Dodge Viper RT/10, including hoodscoops (carried directly over from the Viper), and a redesigned lower fascia that shifted the Dodge "crosshair" grille into the lower bumper (with the addition of foglamps from the Viper).  The interior featured a performance-oriented theme, with brushed aluminum trim for the trim and door panels, with black leather seats and racing-style pedals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2011 to 2016, Dodge produced the Grand Caravan R/T as an trim variant, though the option was largely cosmetic.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Plymouth Voyager XG ===
&lt;p&gt;Derived from the Plymouth Voyager, the Plymouth Voyager XG was a four-seat minivan geared towards active lifestyles of younger drivers.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carstyling.ru/en/car/1999_plymouth_voyager_xg/|title=1999 Plymouth Voyager XG - Concepts|last=Site-Mechanics|website=www.carstyling.ru|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Externally similar to the standard Voyager, the XG was distinguished by its 17-inch wheels (shared with the Plymouth Prowler), and body-color bumpers and grille.  The interior was given a full-length retractable fabric sunroof, with a large removable storage pod placed behind the seats.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Voyager XG featured the powertrain of the export-market Chrysler Voyager, with a 2.5L diesel engine and a 5-speed manual transmission.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

== Awards ==
&lt;p&gt;The new minivans earned unanimous critical acclaim: the Dodge Caravan was the 1996 [[Motor Trend Car of the Year]] (the first and only minivan to ever win the award), the 1996 [[North American Car of the Year]], and the vans were on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 1996 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120724084058/http://www.caranddriver.sg/features/archive/1996_10best_cars-10best_cars "1996 10Best Cars"], retrieved on 2010–08–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caranddriver.sg/features/archive/1997_10best_cars-10best_cars "1997 10Best Cars"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120730194234/http://www.caranddriver.sg/features/archive/1997_10best_cars-10best_cars|date=July 30, 2012}}, retrieved on 2010–08–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The '''Chrysler TEVan''' was a [[battery electric vehicle]] produced from 1993 to 1995 by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] and sold primarily to electric utilities throughout the [[United States]]. The first generation used either [[Nickel-iron battery|nickel-iron]] or [[Nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium]] batteries. Only 56 were produced and were sold for approximately $120,000 each. Half were produced using nickel-iron batteries and half were equipped with the nickel-cadmium packs. The TEVan was built on the same production line as the gasoline-powered minivans at Chrysler's Windsor Assembly Plant in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. It had a top speed of {{convert|70|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, seating for five adults, and a curb weight of {{convert|5060|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}. The second generation, named the EPIC (Electric Powered Interurban Commuter Vehicle), was launched in 1997 with advanced [[Lead-acid battery|lead acid]] batteries and later in 1998 with [[Nickel metal hydride battery|nickel metal-hydride]] batteries. It was offered for lease in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[California]] in 1999. 

==Batteries==
The 180V nickel-cadmium pack consisted of 30 [[Saft Groupe S.A.|SAFT]] STM5-180 6V 180Ah batteries in six removable pods under the floor of the car, delivering over {{convert|50|mi|km}} of range, and used an automatic watering system for easy battery maintenance. The nickel-iron pack consisted of 30 Eagle-Pitcher 6V 200Ah batteries in six pods under the floor and delivered over {{convert|60|mi|km}} of range. The TEVan owner's manual stated {{convert|80|mi|km}} of range.

==Charger==
The TEVan's on-board charger was a [[Power factor correction|PFC]] Martin-Marietta and accepted 120 VAC@20A or 40A, 240 VAC@20A or 40A, and as high as 220 VAC@40A- three-phase inputs.

==Powertrain==
The TEVan used a 27&amp;nbsp;hp, 65&amp;nbsp;hp max (48&amp;nbsp;kW) Separately-Excited [[GE]] DC traction motor coupled to a two-speed FWD trans-axle that featured Hi, Lo, Reverse and Park. The owner's manual referred to it as a 'semi-automatic transmission' although it used a clutch. The motor controller was also manufactured by GE. The EPIC used an AC traction motor and single speed transmissions.

==Accessories==
The TEVan had an 8.8&amp;nbsp;kW three-stage ceramic [[electric heater]]. The 120A DC/DC converter provided all the 12v power, there was no auxiliary (12V) battery. [[Dashboard#Dashboard items|Gauge]]s included motor temperature and SOC (state of charge, akin to "Fuel Level") using the stock instruments. It was also equipped with electric [[air conditioning]] (R-134a), regenerative braking, power brakes using a Delco electric vacuum pump, [[power steering]], [[radio|AM/FM Stereo]], and [[airbag]]s. The original equipment tires were LRR, (Low Rolling Resistance), Goodyear P205/75R15 Momentum at 50PSI.

The '''RS-platform Chrysler minivans''' are a series of passenger [[minivan]]s marketed by [[Chrysler]] from model years 2001 to 2007, the fourth in six generations of [[Chrysler minivans]], which were heavily revised versions of the [[Chrysler minivans (NS)|NS minivans]]. Depending on the market, these vans were known as the '''Dodge Caravan''', '''Chrysler Town &amp; Country''' and the '''Chrysler Voyager'''. With the discontinuation of the [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] brand, the [[Plymouth Voyager]] didn't return.

==Overview==
In development from February 1996 to December 1999, the Generation IV minivans were based on the [[Chrysler S platform|Chrysler RS platform]] and featured a larger body frame with modified headlights and taillights. Design work by Brandon Faurote was approved in January 1997 and reached production approval in October 1997. Unveiled at the 2000 [[North American International Auto Show]] (NAIAS) on Monday, January 10, 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DdJIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PoIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3634,6863785&amp;dq=2001+dodge+caravan&amp;hl=en |title=DaimlerChrysler Debuts minivans |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the RS minivans were released for sale in August 2000. The release was part of a promotional tie-in with [[Nabisco]], which unveiled their new "[[Oreo|Mini Oreos]]" inside the van during the unveiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-28159731_ITM |title=Article: New Mini Oreos Debut in New Mini Van |publisher=AccessMyLibrary |date=August 10, 2000 |accessdate=September 26, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530062823/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-28159731_ITM |archivedate=May 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first vans rolled off the line at the [[Windsor Assembly]] Plant on July 24.

The RS minivans were sold as the Dodge Caravan, Chrysler Voyager and Chrysler Town &amp; Country, in 4 door body styles. The Caravan was available in a long wheelbase model, called the Grand Caravan, while the Chrysler Voyager was a short wheelbase model with base levels of equipment and the Town &amp; Country was only available with a long wheelbase and was the highest end model. The U.S. and Canadian market Chrysler Voyager was originally intended to be a Plymouth, but became a Chrysler with the discontinuation of the Plymouth brand in 2000. This model was also exported, while the Town &amp; Country was exported as a high-level model of the Voyager. Export models had the platform designation RG.

Trim levels for the Caravan and Town &amp; Country were carried over from the previous generation, while the Voyager was only offered in a base model.&lt;ref name="consumerguideauto.com"&gt;[http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2001-to-2004-chrysler-town-country.htm "2001-2004 Chrysler Town &amp; Country"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020134650/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2001-to-2004-chrysler-town-country.htm |date=October 20, 2010 }}, retrieved on 2011–08–22.&lt;/ref&gt; The Caravan was available in Base, SE, Sport and ES trims, and the Town &amp; Country was available in LX, LXi and Limited. In addition to other detailed changes, remote operated sliding doors and rear hatch, which could be opened and closed at the push of a button, either inside the vehicle, or with the keyless entry fob, became options, as well as a new tri-zone climate control system and side seat mounted airbags. In 2002, the value-packed '''eL''' and '''eX''' models were added to the Town &amp; Country. These models were both value-priced versions of the LX and LXi, respectively, with popular option packages.&lt;ref name="edmunds.com"&gt;[http://www.edmunds.com/chrysler/town-and-country/2002/?sub=minivan "2002 Chrysler Town &amp; Country"], retrieved on 2011–08–22.&lt;/ref&gt; 2004 saw the addition of an unnamed base short-wheelbase model.

In 2003, the Chrysler Voyager was discontinued in the U.S., a short wheelbase Town &amp; Country became available, and the Caravan C/V and Grand Caravan C/V returned after having been discontinued in 1995. The C/V featured the option of deleted side windows (replaced by composite panels), optional rear seats, a cargo floor made of plastic material similar to pickup truck bedliners, rubber flooring in lieu of carpeting and normal hatch at the rear. Minor changes were made to the Grand Caravan ES including many of the features included in Option Group 29S becoming standard, the 17&amp;nbsp;inch Titan Chrome wheels no longer being an option replaced with standard 16&amp;nbsp;inch chrome wheels, and the disappearance of the AutoStick Transmission option. This year also saw the appearance of an optional factory-installed rear seat DVD system with single disc player mounted below the HVAC controls, and the addition of a SXT model. 2004 offered an exclusive one year only "Anniversary Edition" package to mark Caravan's 20th year in production. This package was offered on higher level SXT models, and included chrome wheels, body color moldings, special interior accents and a unique fender badge.

The 2005 minivans received a mid-cycle refresh including revised front fascias and a mildly restyled interior. This model introduced a system of second- and third-row seating that folded completely into under-floor compartments. It was marketed as ''Stow 'N Go'' and was available exclusively on long-wheelbase models. In a development program costing $400 million,&lt;ref name="ameinfo"&gt;{{cite web|title= Chrysler extends leadership in Mideast minivan segment with 'Stow 'n Go' |publisher =Ameinfo.com |url= http://www.ameinfo.com/53687.html |date=February 12, 2005 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130325175844/http://www.ameinfo.com/53687.html |archivedate=March 25, 2013 |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; engineers initially used an [[Erector Set]] to visualize the complex interaction of the design&lt;ref name="pressrel1"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Chrysler Group Brings Minivan Segment's Only Stow 'n Go Seating And Storage System to Market in Just 18 Months |publisher=PRnewswire – Chrysler Group |url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chrysler-group-brings-minivan-segments-only-stow-n-go-seating-and-storage-system-to-market-in-just-18-months-58686772.html |date=January 5, 2004 |accessdate=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and redesigned under-floor components. The system included the spare tire well, fuel tank, exhaust system, parking brake cables, rear climate control lines, and rear suspension&lt;ref name="pressrel1"/&gt; but brought the elimination of [[Four-wheel drive|all-wheel drive]] (AWD). The system, in turn, creates a combined volume of {{convert|12|cuft|L}} of under-floor storage when second-row seats are deployed.

Trim levels were again reshuffled on the Town &amp; Country, being available in a short-wheelbase base model, and long-wheelbase LX, Touring and Limited models.&lt;ref&gt;[http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2005-chrysler-town-and-country.htm "2005 Chrysler Town &amp; Country"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110730005022/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2005-chrysler-town-and-country.htm |date=July 30, 2011 }}, retrieved on 2011–08–22.&lt;/ref&gt; As with the pre-refresh model, only the Touring and Limited were sold to consumers in Canada, the LX being restricted to fleets. A driver's side knee airbag was now standard on all models. The front seat-mounted side airbags of previous years were discontinued in favor of side-curtain airbags for all three rows. These were standard on Limited trim and optional on all other models, however could not be ordered with the moonroof option. Uconnect Bluetooth phone pairing was now available, as well as an overhead rail storage system with three moveable or removable compartments.

Taiwanese-market Town &amp; Country minivans were assembled between 2005 and 2007 in [[Yangmei District|Yangmei]], [[Taiwan]] under license by the [[China Motor Corporation]], starting with the 2006 model year. They were based on the RG variant Grand Voyager for global market. Taiwanese models featured minor variations for the local market including LED taillights, backup cameras and mirror-mounted turn signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://roadtest.u-car.com.tw/article/5173/%E4%B8%83%E4%BA%BA%E5%85%B1%E8%B3%9E%E5%9F%8E%E9%84%89%E4%B9%8B%E7%BE%8E%EF%BC%8DChrysler%20Town%20%20Country%E8%A9%A6%E9%A7%95%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20|title=七人共賞城鄉之美－Chrysler Town &amp; Country試駕|author=高英凱|work=U-CAR|date=June 21, 2006|accessdate=November 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, production ended and the production line was relocated to China where [[Soueast]] continued to assemble it under the [[Chrysler Grand Voyager]] and [[Dodge Grand Caravan]] nameplates from 2007 until late 2010.

Production of this generation continued in China under the Chrysler Grand Voyager and Dodge Grand Caravan nameplates from 2007, when the Taiwanese Town &amp; Country production line was relocated to [[Soueast]] (a [[joint venture]] between CMC, [[Mitsubishi Motors]] and the [[Fujian Motors Group]], until late 2010 when the facelifted fifth generation Chrysler Grand Voyager was introduced there. The Grand Caravan was replaced in this market by the [[Dodge Journey|JCUV]]. The Chinese Grand Voyager was identical to the Taiwanese Town &amp; Country, while the Grand Caravan was not based on the RS Grand Caravan sold in the United States and Canada. Instead, it was a modified version of the Grand Voyager with a new grille, incandescent taillights instead of the Grand Voyager's LED units, fender-mounted turn signals instead of mirror-mounted units, and wheels from the RS Grand Caravan. Chinese models were equipped with [[Mitsubishi 6G7x engine|Mitsubishi 6G72]] engines.

===Safety===
The 2001 model of this version earned a "Poor" rating in the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]
's 40&amp;nbsp;mph offset test. It did protect its occupants reasonably well, and the dummy movement was well controlled, however, a fuel leak occurred. Chrysler corrected this problem starting with the 2002 models, moving it up to an "Acceptable" rating.

The 2006 model year brought optional side curtain airbags and a stronger B-pillar, which was tested by the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]'s side impact crash test. With the side airbags, it got an "Acceptable" rating. For the driver, there is a chance of serious neck injuries, rib fractures and/or internal organ injuries. The rear passengers, however, could leave this accident unharmed, as there is a low risk of significant injury in a crash of this severity for them.

The 4th generation Town &amp; Country (Grand Voyager, as it is known in Europe))right hand drive (RHD) version performed very poorly in the [[Euro NCAP]] car safety tests and achieved the following ratings:&lt;ref name="Euro NCAP"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.euroncap.com/tests/chrysler_voyager_2007/277.aspx |title=For safer cars &amp;#124; Chrysler Voyager |publisher=Euro NCAP |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
However, it was noted that "The LHD car performed significantly better than the RHD car in the frontal impact, scoring 9 points, giving a potential four star adult occupant rating." &lt;ref name="Euro NCAP"/&gt;
Thatcham's New Car Whiplash Ratings (NCWR) organization tested the 4th generation European Grand Voyager for its ability to protect occupants against whiplash injuries with the car achieving an 'Acceptable' rating overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thatcham.org/ncwr/index.jsp?page=147&amp;year=2008&amp;rating=All&amp;manufacturer=6&amp;model=672&amp;display=s&amp;showDisclaimer=Y&amp;showResultCount=Y |title=Safety &amp;#124; New Car Whiplash Ratings &amp;#124; Car Search &amp;#124; Thatcham MIRRC |publisher=Thatcham.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-08 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110728092658/http://www.thatcham.org/ncwr/index.jsp?page=147&amp;year=2008&amp;rating=All&amp;manufacturer=6&amp;model=672&amp;display=s&amp;showDisclaimer=Y&amp;showResultCount=Y |archivedate=July 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powertrains==
As with the previous generation, the Caravan came standard with a 2.4&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Chrysler Neon engine#2.4 and 2.4 Turbo|EDZ]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] and a 3-speed [[TorqueFlite]] automatic transmission, with optional 3.3&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.3|EGA]]'' and 3.8&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.8|EGH]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] engines, which came with a 4-speed [[Ultradrive]] automatic transmission. The 3.3L V6 was the standard engine on the Voyager and Town &amp; Country, as well as Canadian Caravans, where the 2.4L wasn't offered. Export models could be equipped with a 2.5 L Turbo Diesel ''[[List of VM Motori engines#R 425 DOHC|R 425]]''&lt;br /&gt; or a 2.8 L Turbo Diesel ''[[List of VM Motori engines#R 428 DOHC|R 428]]'' from [[VM Motori]], and were available with a 5-speed manual transmission. Chinese models got a 3.0 L ''[[Mitsubishi 6G7 engine|6G72]]''.

The '''RT-platform Chrysler minivans''' are a series of passenger [[minivan]]s marketed by [[Chrysler]] starting in model year 2008, the fifth in six generations of [[Chrysler minivans]]. Depending on the market, these vans were known as the '''Dodge Grand Caravan''', '''Chrysler Town &amp; Country''', '''Chrysler Grand Voyager''', '''Lancia Voyager''' and the '''Volkswagen Routan''', a modified version sold by [[Volkswagen]] in North America. Only long wheelbase models were offered with the [[Dodge Journey]] replacing the short wheelbase model. While most versions were discontinued in 2016 with the launch of the [[Chrysler Pacifica (RU)|Chrysler Pacifica minivan]], the Grand Caravan remained in production.

==Overview==
Chrysler debuted the 2008 model year minivans at the 2007 [[Detroit Auto Show]] &amp;mdash; eliminating the short-wheelbase model. With discontinuation of the short-wheelbase minivans, Dodge offered the [[Dodge Journey|Journey]] on nearly an identical wheelbase and as a [[crossover (automobile)|crossover]] rather than a [[minivan]]. Although the SWB model, which had accounted for half of all sales in Canada,&lt;ref name="CAdriver"&gt;{{cite web|title=Test Drive: 2008 Dodge Grand Caravan Canada "Value Package" |publisher=Autos Canada |first=Jil |last=McIntosh |date=February 25, 2008 |url= http://www.autos.ca/car-test-drives/test-drive-2008-dodge-grand-caravan-canada-value-package/ |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; cost approximately $2,000 less and offered a four-cylinder engine option with improved fuel economy, Chrysler executives stated the SWB Caravan was discontinued to accommodate new features offered in the Grand Caravan, consistent with the demands of the majority of the minivan market.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news|title = Minivan sales slow, hit by gas prices and image |publisher = USAtoday |first=Dee-Ann |last=Durbin |url= https://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2008-06-06-2536673535_x.htm |date=June 6, 2008 |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:'08 Chrysler Town And Country.jpg|thumb|left|2008 Chrysler Town &amp; Country]]

The RT minivans were a completely new design, sharing few components with the previous model. They abandoned the rounded styling introduced on the [[Chrysler minivans (NS)|NS vans]], instead using a more boxy look styled by [[Ralph Gilles]]. New features included standard electronic stability control, the MyGIG entertainment system (a stereo with built in hard drive for recording, storing, and playing music), second and third row video screens, powered second row windows, standard side curtain airbags, and dashboard-mounted transmission controls. Much like its competitors, the [[Toyota Sienna]] and [[Honda Odyssey (North America)|Honda Odyssey]], the Town &amp; Country now featured power windows on the sliding doors and moved the gear shift from the steering column to the center console, in a higher position. Another new feature of this generation was an available rear overhead console which featured LED map lights as well as halo ambient lighting. A new DVD system was also available, which featured dual screens for the rear passengers. SIRIUS Backseat TV was also offered, which featured three channels of children's programming. The ''Stow 'n Go'' seats, carried over from the previous generation, were standard, with a new seating system marketed as ''Swivel 'n Go'' optional on higher end models. In this seating system, two full size second row [[Swivel seat|seats swivel]] to face the third row. A detachable table can be placed between the second and third row seats. The Swivel 'n Go seating system includes the 3rd row seating from the Stow 'n Go system, but not the second row, which must be manually removed from the vehicle. This model was exported as the Dodge Grand Caravan and Chrysler Town &amp; Country to the Philippines, Chrysler Town &amp; Country to Central and South America, and Chrysler Grand Voyager to all other markets.

The Routan marked the start of [[Volkswagen]]'s business strategy to offer additional vehicles specially developed for the U.S. market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.volkswagenag.com/content/vwcorp/info_center/en/publications/2009/03/GB_2008.-bin.acq/qual-BinaryStorageItem.Single.File/Y_2008_e.pdf |title=2008 Annual Report |page=182 |publisher=Volkswagen AG |accessdate=2 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110170744/http://www.volkswagenag.com/content/vwcorp/info_center/en/publications/2009/03/GB_2008.-bin.acq/qual-BinaryStorageItem.Single.File/Y_2008_e.pdf |archive-date=November 10, 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the 2008 model year minivan resulted from a partnership that began in 2005 between Volkswagen and [[DaimlerChrysler]]. Prior to the agreement, Volkswagen had no minivan model for the United States or Canadian markets. The Routan is sold only in North America (U.S., Canada, Mexico).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QUA123NvjZcC&amp;pg=PA285&amp;dq=Routan+Mexico |pages=284–285 |title=Developing International Strategies: Going and Being International for Medium-sized Companies |first=Rudolf |last=Grünig |first2=Dirk |last2=Morschett |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2012 |isbn=9783642247248 |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The automaker's intent with outsourcing production the Routan to Chrysler was to avoid the significant expense of developing its own family-sized minivan.&lt;ref name="HealyUSA"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/09/23/vw-routan-suv-crossblue/2856593/ |title=VW axes Routan van, mulls 7-passenger SUV replacement |first=James R. |last=Healey |newspaper=USA Today |date=23 September 2013 |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; VW announced in an early 2008 projection that the company intended for the Routan and other models to help achieve significant expansion of U.S. sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VW Plans to Triple U.S. Vehicle Sales |publisher=Car &amp; Driver |date=September 2007 |url= http://www.caranddriver.com/news/car_news/vw_plans_to_triple_u_s_vehicle_sales_car_news |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Routan was Volkswagen's first van offered in North America since discontinuation of the [[Volkswagen Transporter (T4)|Volkswagen Eurovan]] in 2003, and is not related to the European-market [[Volkswagen Touran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vander Doelen |first=Chris |title=VW's Routan to roll off Windsor Assembly |newspaper=Windsor Star |date=22 January 2008 |url=http://www.canada.com/windsorstar/news/business/story.html?id=c728f842-dbdf-4a17-a637-88c7b33b8610 |accessdate=2 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182818/http://www.canada.com/windsorstar/news/business/story.html?id=c728f842-dbdf-4a17-a637-88c7b33b8610 |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Routan features a rebranded version of Chrysler's hard drive-based audio and navigation system—marketed by Chrysler as the MyGig system and by Volkswagen as the Joybox, but has neither Chrysler's [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country#Stow'n Go seating|Stow'n Go]] nor [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country#Swivel 'n Go|Swivel'n Go]] seating systems.  Instead, the second row seats in the Routan  feature the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country#Easy-Out Roller Seats|Easy Out Roller Seat system]], but can be modified using Chrysler or Dodge parts to have Stow'n Go or have Swivel'n Go seats installed. Routans as of 2010 offer optional Wi-Fi access, which was also offered in Dodge and Chrysler versions as UConnect Web.

[[Volkswagen Group of America|VW of America]] had projected for the Routan to gain at least five percent of the U.S. minivan market,&lt;ref name="stldispatch"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chrysler-built Routan has VW look |newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch |first=Christopher |last=Boyce |date=7 February 2008 |url= http://business.highbeam.com/435553/article-1G1-174361244/minivan-vw-can-call-its-own-routan-being-built-chrysler |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160310003057/https://business.highbeam.com/435553/article-1G1-174361244/minivan-vw-can-call-its-own-routan-being-built-chrysler |url-status= dead |archive-date= 10 March 2016 |publisher=Highbeam |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 45,000 units of the 700,000 minivans sold currently. In January 2009, VW of America asked Chrysler Canada to stop production of the Routan for the month of February after 29,000 Routans had been shipped to US dealerships. By July 2009, 11,677 units had been sold.&lt;ref name="ablogjan09"&gt;{{cite web|title=Routan Bust?

In January 2013, Volkswagen announced there would be no 2013 retail model, but held open the possibility that development may resume with a potential 2014 model. The 2013 Routan was reserved for fleet purchasers, and 2,500 were produced by Chrysler during the calendar year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://media.chrysler.com/newsrelease.do?&amp;searchresult=&amp;id=15234&amp;mid= |title=Chrysler Group LLC December 2013 Production Data |date=17 January 2014 |publisher=Chrysler Group LLC |accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Automotive industry analysts were not surprised by VW's decision to drop the Routan because buyers had no reason for selecting the Routan over the similar Dodge Grand Caravan or the Chrysler Town &amp; Country, and the Routan's base price of nearly $28,000 was far more than the basic $21,000 Grand Caravan, while the Routan's list of equipment was less than included on the upscale Town &amp; Country.&lt;ref name="autotrader"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.autotrader.com/research/article/car-news/206373/2013-vw-routan-canceled.jsp |title=2013 VW Routan Canceled |publisher=autotrader |accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chrysler minivans underwent a mid-cycle refresh for the 2011 model year, which included major changes in both styling and functionality. Changes included restyled exterior and interior with all-new wing logo, standard SafetyTec (including Blind Spot Monitoring and Rear Cross Path Detection), improvement to the Stow n Go seating and storage system, a one-touch fold down feature for easier access to the third row, (The Swivel n' Go seats were dropped) a new super center console and technology, a dual DVD system that can play different media at the same time, SIRIUS Backseat TV which offers three channels of childrens programming, FLO TV featuring 20 channels of live programming, Pentastar V6 (283&amp;nbsp;hp) engine replacing previous 3.8-liter and 3.3-liter V-6 engines, six-speed automatic transmission, a new fuel economizer mode, a new instrument panel and instrument cluster, new Chrysler Brand steering wheel with integrated controls that allow the driver to operate the radio, cruise control, hands-free phone and other vehicle functions while keeping their hands on the wheel; upgraded cloth and leather seating materials; new soft touch door trim, new heating and cooling control system. The suspension was heavily re-tuned, with both Dodge and Chrysler minivans gaining a larger front sway bar and new rear sway bar, increased rear roll center height, adjusted spring rates, a new steering gear, a revised front static camber setting, and lowered ride height. This dramatically improved handling in both the Chrysler and Dodge. Other changes included extra sound insulation, acoustic glass, new seats, softer-touch surfaces, new [[LED]] ambient lighting and center console, and halogen projector headlamps with LED accents. The Chrysler models were adjusted so that instead of competing against equivalent Dodge trim levels, they were above Dodge in trim and features.

All three of the former engine choices were replaced by the new [[Chrysler Pentastar engine|Pentastar]] 3.6-liter V6 with six-speed automatic transmission, now the sole powertrain choice for all models. Interior trim was restyled on both vans, in addition to major exterior revisions highlighted by the new "double-crosshair" grille on the Grand Caravan and a new chrome grille for the Town &amp; Country.

Chrysler Voyagers sold in continental Europe was rebranded as the [[Lancia]] Voyager. The Chrysler-branded variant continued to be sold in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Russia, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore, and China, as Lancia does not have sales operations in those markets.

The Ram Cargo Tradesman, or Ram C/V Tradesman, debuted for the 2012 model year, replacing the Dodge Grand Caravan C/V. It is based on the Dodge Grand Caravan, but with solid metal instead of rear windows and a flat load space with {{convert|144.4|cuft|L}} of interior storage, and a {{convert|1800|lb|abbr=on}}. cargo payload plus a towing capability of up to {{convert|3600|lb|abbr=on}}.

The 2.4&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Chrysler Neon engine#2.4 and 2.4 Turbo|EDZ]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] was dropped, with the 3.3&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.3|EGA]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] standard. The 3.8&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.8|EGH]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] engine was optional on mid level models, with a [[Chrysler SOHC V6 engine|4.0L SOHC V6]] engine optional as the top level engine. A 2.8 L ''[[List of VM Motori engines#R 428 DOHC|RA428]]'' I4 diesel was available on export models, while the 3.3L wasn't offered in Europe. The 3.3L got a 4 speed [[Ultradrive]] [[automatic transmission]], while all the other engines came with a new 6 speed [[Ultradrive#62TE|62TE]] automatic transmission. In 2011, the 3.3L, 3.8L and 4.0L engines were all dropped, replaced with the ''[[Chrysler Pentastar engine|Pentastar]]'' 3.6 L V6, which came with the 62TE transmission.

== Future of the Dodge Grand Caravan ==

With the all-new 2017 [[Chrysler Pacifica]] introduced to replace the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]], the [[Dodge Grand Caravan]] was due to be discontinued after the 2016 [[model year]]. However, it was later announced that the [[Grand Caravan]] would be sold alongside the [[Chrysler Pacifica]] unchanged from the 2016 model, with a simplified model lineup.

At the 2018 [[North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], [[Fiat]] CEO [[Sergio Marchionne]] said there may be a successor to the current [[Dodge Grand Caravan]], which would be based on the [[Chrysler Pacifica]], saying that the [[Grand Caravan]] successor would be "a Caravan-like vehicle".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.allpar.com/news/2018/01/future-of-the-caravan-sergio-semi-confirms-the-rumors-39345&lt;/ref&gt;

Marchionne is quoted as saying, "The replacement of the [[Dodge Caravan|Caravan]] will be a [[Dodge Caravan|Caravan]]-like vehicle. I need another minivan. It's going to be in line with the Pacifica architecture".

[[Dodge]] has announced that the Grand Caravan will be discontinued in May 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dodge Grand Caravan Production Coming to an End|publisher=Car and Driver|first=Colin|last=Beresford|date=February 28, 2020|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a31156055/dodge-grand-caravan-end-production/|accessdate=February 28, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its replacement will be the [[Chrysler Voyager]], which is an entry-level version of the [[Chrysler Pacifica]] minivan, and will offer similar pricing and features to its Grand Caravan predecessor. For its final [[model year]], the Grand Caravan will be offered in three trim levels: base '''SE''', midlevel '''SE Plus''', and range-topping '''SXT'''. The previous '''GT''' trim, a fleet-exclusive model, has been dropped for the 2020 [[model year]]. For 2020, the midlevel '''SE Plus''' receives standard "Super Stow-'n'-Go" second-row bucket seats and in-floor storage bin, a standard eight-way power front driver's seat, a black interior with "Cranberry Wine" stitching, and an available '''Blacktop Package'''. The base '''SE''' trim no longer offers aluminum-alloy wheels as an option. A compact spare tire and wheel is now optional equipment on all trim levels. &lt;ref&gt;https://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=21001&amp;mid=58&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''first-generation [[Chrysler minivans]]''' are a series of [[minivan]]s produced and marketed by the [[Chrysler Corporation]] in North American and Europe from 1984 to 1990.  Sold in both passenger and cargo configurations, the series is the first of six generations of Chrysler minivans.  Launched ahead of chief competitors [[Chevrolet Astro|Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari]] and [[Ford Aerostar]], the first-generation Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager effectively created the modern minivan segment in North America, with many later North American minivans adopting a similar body configuration.

Launched in November 1983 for the 1984 model year, the Chrysler minivans were produced in a single body style, with the extended-length Grand Caravan and Grand Voyager introduced in 1987.  For 1990, the minivan was added to the Chrysler brand, adopting the Chrysler Town &amp; Country nameplate.  For export, Chrysler sold the Chrysler Voyager, competing against the [[Renault Espace]] (which began life as a Talbot, part of the former Chrysler Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.matrasport.dk/Cars/Espace/history.html|title=The Matra/Renault Espace|last=Sorth|first=Lennart|website=www.matrasport.dk|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Background and development ==
[[File:1986 Dodge Caravan Smithsonian National Museum of American History.jpg|thumb|right|A 1986 Dodge Caravan at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History]]

The development of what became the Chrysler minivans began in the early 1970s, as both Ford Motor Company and the truck division of Dodge began separate projects on "garageable vans".  Intended as a more powerful, safer-handling alternative to the Volkswagen Microbus, both companies sought to create vehicles capable as a second car.&lt;ref name="allpar.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/m/history.html|title=A Brief History of the Chrysler Minivan|publisher=Allpar|accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dodge project did not progress past the clay model stage; Chrysler chairman [[Lynn Townshend]] argued that if a market for such a vehicle existed, Ford and GM would have already done it. At Ford, Lee Iaccoca and Hal Sperling developed a proposed garageable van called the [[Ford Carousel]]. It was rejected for the same reason, that GM would have done it already if it was a viable idea.

At the end of 1977, development of Chrysler minivans restarted with four main goals, with a planned 1982 model year launch.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;

# The ability to park in a standard-size garage 
# Car-like [[Noise, vibration, and harshness|NVH]]
# Low, flat load floor
# Removable rear seats (ability to carry a 4×8 sheet of building material on the floor)

Although both the front-wheel drive [[Chrysler K platform|K-Cars]] and L-body ([[Dodge Omni|Omni/Horizon]]) were being considered as donor platforms, Chrysler also allowed consideration of rear-wheel drive.  Ultimately, the L-body was ruled out, as it was considered too light-duty for either the size of the vehicle or its planned six-cylinder engine.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;

In 1978, both [[Lee Iacocca]] and Hal Sperlich were fired from Ford Motor Company, joining Chrysler Corporation.  The same year, the truck engineering division of Dodge was merged within its car counterpart of Chrysler.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  During 1978, Chrysler began research across the United States, seeking what features customers desired in a potential minivan, finding agreement in its planned goals.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  Though potential customers found concept sketches "ugly", Chrysler still found a potential market of nearly 1 million vehicles per year, with Chrysler selling 215,000 of them.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;

By 1979, Chrysler chose front-wheel drive for the minivan project, codenamed "T-115".&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  Though the van would share its transverse engine and transmission with the K-cars, it would be based on a separate body structure.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  Approved by Lee Iaccoca at the end of 1979, the T-115 project would cost $500 million to produce, funded as part of the $1.5 billion in federal loan guarantees given to Chrysler.

From is 1979 approval to the 1984 launch, the proposed design would undergo several major changes.  Originally intended to use four sedan-style doors (similar to a station wagon), Chrysler changed to two sliding doors for the rear, claiming better parking-lot access. The design was later changed to a single sliding door, as Chrysler wanted to market the van to commercial buyers; while engineers wanted to make the left-side door an option. The decision to go with a single sliding door was done to reduce costs.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  During development, the configuration of the rear door was also contentious, with a liftgate winning out over a station wagon-style tailgate.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  On the exterior, in 1981, the side windows were redesigned to become flush with the body; while requiring a major redesign of components and tooling, the design change allowed for a reduction of wind noise and drag.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  To further reduce costs, a number of visible interior components were shared with the [[Plymouth Reliant|Dodge Aries/Plymouth Reliant]], including the instrument panel, interior controls, radio, and various trim items. Drivetrain choices proved problematic as the K-car 2.2&amp;nbsp;L four was considered inadequate and the Slant Six was unsuited for transverse FWD mounting. The Mitsubishi 2.6&amp;nbsp;L four could however be offered as an interim engine until a V6 became available.

==Overview==
Launched in November 1983 for the 1984 model year, Chrysler marketed the first-generation minivans as the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager, along with the Mini Ram Van cargo van.  While the Dodge Caravan nameplate was used for the first time, Plymouth had used the Voyager nameplate since 1974 on its version of the Dodge Sportsman full-size passenger van.

Initially released in a single 112-inch wheelbase, Chrysler introduced a 119-inch wheelbase as part of a 1987 update, launching the Grand Caravan/Grand Voyager.  Starting in 1988, the Chrysler Voyager was exported to markets outside of the United States and Canada.  For 1990, Chrysler began production of the Chrysler Town &amp; Country, among the first luxury vehicles produced as a minivan.

=== Body ===
[[File:1984 Plymouth Voyager LE (30965894313).jpg|left|thumb|LE-trim Chrysler minivan rear seats (1984-1986)]]
Designed as an alternative to full-size station wagons, the standard-length Dodge Caravan/Plymouth Voyager (two inches shorter and two inches wider than a K-car station wagon), presented nearly double the cargo space of a K-car station wagon with a 7-foot long cargo floor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/original-minivans.html|title=Original Minivans: 1984-91 Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager, Chrysler Town &amp; Country|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to the K-car station wagons, the minivans use a liftgate rear door (supported by gas struts), unlocked by key.

Several seating configurations were offered, depending on trim level.  The standard configuration of five-passenger seating in two rows was included with seven or eight-passenger seating in three rows; the back two seats were two-passenger and three-passenger bench seats (in the style of a larger van, these latched to the floor).  The more popular two-passenger configuration was offered in several configurations, with low-back seats (as the minivan was technically a light truck), or high back seats with headrests; depending on trim level, seats could have vinyl, "deluxe" cloth or vinyl, or "luxury" cloth/vinyl upholstery.  Two styles of rear seats were offered.  The three-passenger rear bench was adjustable for passenger legroom or cargo space; the seatback also folded down when not in use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In 1985, a five-passenger version was introduced with a fold-flat rear seat; called "Convert-a-bed", the option allowed the rear seat to fold backwards into a bed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

To lower production and development costs of the Chrysler minivans, the vehicles maintained a high degree of visible parts commonality with other Chrysler vehicles, sharing wheel covers, door handles, instrument panels, and other visible trim pieces with the Aries/Reliant and other Chrysler vehicles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  As the design of the dashboard precluded a conventional glove box, Chrysler added a large storage drawer underneath the passenger seat (a feature retained in later generations of Chrysler minivans and the Chrysler PT Cruiser).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The minivans also became the first automobiles ever with modern cup holders.&lt;ref&gt;https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2013/03/08/when-did-cars-get-cup-holders/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dean |first1=Sam |title=The History of the Car Cup Holder |url=https://www.bonappetit.com/trends/article/the-history-of-the-car-cup-holder |accessdate=24 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1984–1986 ===
At their 1984 launch, as with the K-Cars, the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager were externally distinguished largely by their grilles.  Both vehicles were fitted with four headlights, with the Caravan fitted with an eggcrate grille while the Voyager was fitted with a horizontally-oriented grille.  In what would become a signature styling feature of 1980s Chrysler minivans, top-trim Caravans and Voyagers were both offered with [[Woodie (car body style)#simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] as an option.

In following with many other Chrysler vehicles, for 1986, Chrysler minivans shifted from 4-lug to 5-lug wheels.  To reduce high-speed wind noise, Chrysler added a bumper-mounted air dam.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== 1987–1990 ===
The 1987 model year saw a mid-cycle update to the S-platform minivans.  Largely centered around the May 1987 introduction of the Grand Caravan and Grand Voyager, the update brought a new front fascia and taillights.  To better differentiate the Caravan from the Voyager, the model lines received different grilles; all models except the Mini Ram Van (cargo van) were shifted to flush-lens composite headlamps.  Fourteen inches longer in length than a standard-wheelbase Chrysler minivan, the Grand Caravan/Grand Voyager was the largest minivan in North America in 1987. The first Chrysler minivans fitted with a V6 engine, the Grand Caravan/Grand Voyager eventually became the two most popular configurations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  With both rear seats removed, the "Grand" minivans offered 150 cubic feet of cargo room, 25 extra than a standard wheelbase Chrysler minivan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The front bench seat and Convert-A-Bed, both seldom ordered, did not return for 1987. Interior upholstery was upgraded on several trims, with base vinyl seats removed (and deluxe vinyl remaining as an option on SE trim); for the first time, leather seating was offered on LE/Grand LE trim.

For 1989, the minivans saw a minor update.  To improve fit and finish, Chrysler redesigned the front and rear bumpers, with single-piece bumper covers, painted to match the color of the body.  The early-1980s K-Car steering wheel was replaced by a 3-spoke design (though the rest of the dashboard remained unchanged).  In addition to the standard trim levels, Chrysler added the top-line Dodge Caravan ES and Plymouth Voyager LX; as an early 1990 model, the Chrysler Town &amp; Country luxury minivan was introduced in early 1989.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Chassis ===
The first-generation Chrysler minivans are based upon the Chrysler S platform, using unibody construction.  Contrary to popular belief, the S platform is not directly related to the K platform;&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; though sharing powertrains to lower development and production costs, the S platform has a distinct body structure, allowing for a higher hoodline and seat height.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  The S platform is produced in two wheelbases: 112.1 inches for standard-length minivans; 119.1 inches for "Grand"-length minivans.

Adapting the layout of the K platform for a larger vehicle, the S-platform vans were fitted with [[MacPherson strut]] front suspension and a [[Beam axle|beam rear axle]] with [[leaf spring]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  All S-platform minvans are fitted with front disc and rear drum brakes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Engines ====
For the first three years of production, two engines were offered&amp;nbsp;– both [[inline-4]] engines with two-barrel [[carburetors]]. The base [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2&amp;nbsp;L]] was borrowed from the [[Chrysler K platform|Chrysler K-cars]], and produced {{convert|96|hp|kW|abbr=on}} horsepower. The higher performance fuel-injected version of the [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2&amp;nbsp;L]] engine later offered in the K-cars was never offered in the Caravan, and the 2-bbl version would remain the base power plant until mid-1987. Alongside the [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2&amp;nbsp;L]], an optional Mitsubishi [[Astron 2.6|2.6&amp;nbsp;L]] engine was available, producing {{convert|104|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.

[[File:Dodge V6 EFI fender badge.jpg|thumb|right|Fender badge originally used on V6 equipped minivans]]

In mid-1987, the base [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2&amp;nbsp;L]] [[Straight-4|I4]] was replaced with a [[fuel-injected]] [[Chrysler K engine#2.5|2.5&amp;nbsp;L]] [[Straight-4|I4]], which produced {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while the [[Mitsubishi Astron engine|Mitsubishi ''G54B'']] I4 was replaced with a new [[fuel-injected]] [[Mitsubishi 6G7x engine#6G72|3.0&amp;nbsp;L Mitsubishi]] [[V6 engine|V6]] producing {{convert|136|hp|kW|abbr=on}} in March of that year.

Shortly thereafter, in model year 1989, a more powerful engine became optional: a [[Chrysler K engine#2.5 Turbo|turbocharged version]] of the 2.5&amp;nbsp;L I4 producing {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Revisions to the Mitsubishi V6 increased its output to {{convert|142|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, and in 1990 a new {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.3|3.3&amp;nbsp;L V6]] was added to the option list. The V6 engines became popular as sales of the 2.5 turbo dwindled, and it was dropped at the end of the year.

None of the V6 engines nor the turbocharged four were available on the European Chrysler Voyager. The Chrysler Town &amp; Country was only available with one engine option, the Mitsubishi 3.0&amp;nbsp;L V6, until June 1989 when it was replaced by the newly introduced 3.3&amp;nbsp;L V6.

====Transmissions====
Both a three-speed [[TorqueFlite]] A413 [[automatic transmission]] and a five-speed manual were available with most [[inline-4]] engines, including the turbocharged 2.5 L (this was a rare combination). Manual transmissions were not available on 2.6&amp;nbsp;L Mitsubishi 4-cylinder models nor V6 models of the passenger Caravan, but were an option on the Mini Ram Van and Caravan C/V's long wheelbase models with a 3.0 L V6.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[V6 engine]]s were only offered with the fully hydraulically operated TorqueFlite until the computer controlled [[Ultradrive]] 4-speed automatic became available in 1989. The [[Ultradrive]] offered much better fuel economy and responsiveness, particularly when paired with the [[inline-4]] engine. However, it suffered from reliability problems, usually stemming from what is known as "gear hunt" or "shift busyness", resulting in premature wear of the internal clutches. It also required an uncommon type of automatic transmission fluid and is not clearly labeled as such, leading many owners to use the more common [[Dexron|Dexron II]] rather than the specified "Mopar ATF+3", resulting in transmission damage and eventual failure.

The [[Ultradrive]] received numerous design changes in subsequent model years to improve reliability,{{Original research inline|date=February 2015}} and many early model transmissions would eventually be retrofitted or replaced with the updated versions by dealers, under warranty. These efforts were mostly successful, and most first-generation Caravans eventually got an updated transmission.{{Original research inline|date=February 2015}}

=== Trim ===
The S-platform Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager were both offered in three trim levels, an unnamed base trim level, mid-range ''SE'', and top-range ''LE''; LE-trim minivans were marketed with the option of [[Woodie (car body style)#simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] paneling.  In 1989, as part of a minor exterior update, Dodge and Plymouth each gained an additional trim level for the top of the model range, the Dodge Caravan ES and Plymouth Voyager LX, available only in standard-wheelbase configuration.

== Variants ==

=== Cargo van ===
[[File:Dodge Caravan CV.jpg|thumb|1989-1990 Dodge Caravan C/V]]
Chrysler produced two cargo van variants of the S platform, both based upon the Dodge Caravan.  From 1984 to 1988, Dodge marketed the Mini Ram Van.  Distinguished by a "Ram" nameplate under the side-view mirror, the Mini Ram Van was renamed the Caravan C/V (Cargo Van) for 1989.  In contrast to passenger vans, the Caravan C/V was fitted with model-specific headlight clusters, using dual sealed-beam headlamps (shared with the export Chrysler Voyager).  Several window configurations were available, ranging from either no windows to a full set of windows.  Coinciding with the 1987 introduction of the Grand Caravan, cargo van production expanded to both wheelbases.

On the Caravan C/V, in addition to the liftgate rear door, Chrysler offered 50/50 split rear doors (similar to the [[Chevrolet Astro]] and traditional cargo vans).  Produced as an option, the 50/50 doors were constructed of fiberglass; custom-installed by an outside vendor, the doors were installed between the factory and shipment to a dealer.

As with the larger [[Dodge Ram Van]], the Mini Ram Van and Caravan C/V also served as a basis for [[conversion van]]s, sold through Chrysler dealers as well as through converters themselves.

=== Chrysler Voyager (export) ===
{{Main|Chrysler Voyager}}
[[File:VoyagerIEuropeLeft.jpg|thumb|1989-1990 Chrysler Voyager]]
Starting for the 1988 model year, Chrysler began exports of minivans to Europe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  As neither the Plymouth nor the Dodge brands were marketed outside of North America by Chrysler, minivans were exported under the [[Chrysler Voyager]] nameplate, competing against the [[Renault Espace]] and [[Volkswagen Type 2 (T3)|Volkswagen Transporter/Caravelle]] (sold as the Vanagon in North America).

While the Voyager name was derived from the Plymouth division, the Chrysler Voyager was a rebranded version of the Dodge Caravan, fitted with the front fascia of the Caravan C/V cargo van.  To accommodate the vehicle for European sale, the Chrysler Voyager was fitted with amber turn signal lenses (requiring new taillights), turn signal repeaters, and a model-specific license plate surround (adapted for European license plates and embossed with "Chrysler").

Along with its rebranding, the Chrysler Voyager saw internal modifications, largely to comply with European safety and emissions regulations.  With the exception of the turbocharged 2.5&amp;nbsp;L I4 and 3.3&amp;nbsp;L V6, the Chrysler Voyager shared its powertrain with its North American counterpart; many examples were produced with manual transmissions.

=== Chrysler Town &amp; Country ===
{{Main|Chrysler Town &amp; Country}}
[[File:1990 Chrysler Town &amp; Country minivan.jpg|thumb|1990 Chrysler Town &amp; Country]]After being discontinued in the 1988 model year, the Chrysler Town &amp; Country nameplate was revived as Chrysler released a minivan for its namesake division.  Introduced in the spring of the 1989 as an early 1990 model, the Town &amp; Country was released as the highest-trim version of the three Chrysler minivans, sold exclusively in the long-wheelbase body length.  Originally slated for a 1989 release,&lt;ref&gt;[http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/wqIAAOxy4c5RsPPu/$T2eC16FHJIQE9qUHrjB(BRsPPur4DQ~~60_57.JPG?rt=nc Early sales material for the model referring to it as a 1989 model], retrieved on 2014-12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; the Town &amp; Country was the first of the three minivans produced as a 1990 model.

Designed as a competitor to luxury-themed minivans such as the Ford Aerostar Eddie Bauer and the (then-upcoming) [[Oldsmobile Silhouette]], the Town &amp; Country included nearly every feature of the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager as standard equipment, with a number of trim features of its own.  All examples were produced with woodgrain trim (a feature associated with the nameplate).  Initially, Bright White Clearcoat was the sole color available, with Black Clearcoat added as an option in June 1989 (as 1990 Caravans/Voyagers entered production&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imperialclub.com/Yr/1990/index.htm "1990 Chrysler Showroom Brochure" pg. 30], retrieved on 2011–06–18.&lt;/ref&gt;).

To externally distinguish the Town &amp; Country, Chrysler added a chrome waterfall grille (styled similar to the [[Chrysler New Yorker]]), clear-lens turn front turn signals, body-color mirrors, a crystal Pentastar hood ornament (shared with the New Yorker/Fifth Avenue), lower body trim (a monochromatic, long-wheelbase version of the Dodge Caravan ES body trim), and 15" alloy wheels&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imperialclub.com/Yr/1990/index.htm "1990 Chrysler Showroom Brochure" pg. 20-21], retrieved on 2011–06–18.&lt;/ref&gt; (later used with the Plymouth Voyager LX and other Plymouth models).  The interior featured model-specific leather seating, leather interior trim panels, all available power-operated equipment, front and rear air conditioning, and an [[Infinity (audio)|Infinity II sound system]].

Depending on production date, the 1990 Chrysler Town &amp; Country was produced with one of two V6 engines.  Prior to June 1989, it was fitted with a 142&amp;nbsp;hp 3.0L Mitsubishi V6.  From June 1989 onward, all examples were fitted with the 150&amp;nbsp;hp Chrysler 3.3L V6.  Although all S-platform Town &amp; Country minivans have 1990 VINs, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] classifies examples with the 3.0L V6 as 1989 vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/noframes/6255.shtml "Fuel Economy of the 1989 Chrysler Town and Country"], retrieved on 2015-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both engines were paired with the 4-speed [[Ultradrive]] automatic transmission.

In total, 5,404 examples of the Chrysler Town &amp; Country were produced, making this variant the rarest of all Chrysler minivans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/cars/production/chrysler-US.html|title=Chrysler Cars and Production Numbers, United States|last=Wilson|first=Gerard|date=June 2013|work=Allpar|accessdate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=July 2019}}

The '''second-generation [[Chrysler minivans]]''' are a series of [[Minivan|minivans]] that were manufactured and marketed by [[Chrysler|Chrysler Corporation]] in North America and Europe from 1991 to 1995.  Officially designated the AS platform by Chrysler, the second-generation minivans were an extensive revision of the first-generation chassis and body.  As before, passenger and cargo configurations were sold by Dodge, Plymouth, and Chrysler divisions.  The first minivans offered with driver-side airbags (in 1991) and with optional integrated child safety seats (in 1992), the second-generation Chrysler minivans offered all-wheel drive as an option for the first time; a manual transmission would be offered for the last time in the North American market.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/1991-voyager.html|title=1991-1995 Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager minivans|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;      

As with its predecessor, Chrysler assembled second-generation minivans at [[Windsor Assembly]] in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, with additional production at [[Saint Louis Assembly|Saint Louis (North) Assembly]] in Fenton, Missouri from 1990 to 1994.  In 1992, to supplement exports from the United States, the Chrysler Voyager and Dodge Mini Ram Van began production in Graz, Austria (in the [[Eurostar Automobilwerk|Eurostar]] joint venture factory between Chrysler and [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch]]).  

For the 1996 model year, the AS-generation minivans were replaced by the [[Chrysler minivans (NS)|NS platform]], marking the first complete redesign of the Chrysler minivans since their 1984 introduction.

==Overview==
Introduced in November 1990, the second-generation Chrysler minivans were marketed by the Dodge, Plymouth, and Chrysler divisions.  The Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager nameplates returned, with both short-wheelbase and long-wheelbase (Grand) body configurations.  As with the first-generation minivans, base-trim examples were equipped with 5-passenger seating, with 7-passenger seating as standard in higher-trim versions (SE, LE, ES/LX, and all Town &amp; Country vans).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For 1994, the model range underwent a mid-cycle revision, primarily intended to comply with 1998 upgrades to US federal safety standards for cars (although the entire model range was officially considered a light truck).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/1994.html|title=1994 minivans: Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager, Chrysler Town &amp; Country|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alongside minor exterior styling changes, the minivans were given dual airbags, four-wheel disc brakes with ABS, and side impact beams in the front and sliding doors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In another set of revisions, Chrysler sought to make the vans quieter, improving fit and finish.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Chassis ===
The second-generation Chrysler minivans are officially designated the Chrysler AS platform (matching the Chrysler shift to two-letter platform designations in 1990).  Largely a substantial revision of the first-generation S-platform minivans, the AS chassis retained the 112.0 inch wheelbase for standard-wheelbase vans and 119.1 inches for extended-wheelbase "Grand" vans.  While structurally unrelated to the (discontinued) [[Chrysler K platform|Chrysler K-cars]], the second-generation minivans shifted mechanical commonality towards its larger derivatives, adopting engines and transmissions from the Chrysler AA platform (Dodge Spirit/Plymouth Acclaim) and the Chrysler AC/AY platform (Chrysler New Yorker/Fifth Avenue/Imperial and Dodge Dynasty).  

Retaining the unibody construction of the first-generation minivans, the second-generation minivans are fitted with a MacPherson strut front suspension with coil rear springs; all-wheel drive versions have 4-wheel independent suspension with a leaf-sprung rear axle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  During the development of the platform, attention was paid on refining the handling over the first-generation vans, in order to improve stability, maneuverability, and steering feel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For 1991 to 1993, a disc front/rear drum brake configuration was utilized, with a four-wheel disc brake system introduced in 1994.  All versions were fitted with anti-lock brakes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

====Powertrain====
With the lone exception of the Chrysler 2.5L Turbo I inline-4, the second-generation minivans returned the powertrain from their 1990 predecessors. The standard engine was a naturally-aspirated Chrysler 2.5L inline-four, producing 100 hp; this engine was standard on standard-wheelbase passenger vans and all cargo vans. A Mitsubishi-produced 3.0L V6 (producing 142 hp) was an option on short-wheelbase vans. Introduced in 1990, the Chrysler 3.3L V6 (producing 150 hp; increased to 162 hp in 1994) was standard on all Grand Voyagers/Grand Caravans, Town &amp; Countrys, and vans with all-wheel drive; the 3.3L V6 was offered on short-wheelbase as a second option.

For 1994, the AS-platform minivans adopted the 3.8L V6 engine from the Chrysler Imperial.  A larger-bore version of the 3.3L V6 tuned for additional torque output, while producing the same 162 hp of the 3.3L V6, produced 213 lb-ft of torque. The standard engine of the Chrysler Town &amp; Country and all-wheel drive vans, the 3.8L engine became an option on the Grand Voyager/Grand Caravan. In January 1992 a 2.5-liter turbodiesel built by Italy's [[VM Motori]] was made available in Austrian-built Voyagers.&lt;ref name="AR93"&gt;{{citation | ref = AR93 | title = Automobil Revue 1993 | editor-last = Büschi | editor-first = Hans-Ulrich | publisher = Hallwag AG | location = Berne, Switzerland | language = German, French | page = 206 | volume = 88 | date = 4 March 1993 | isbn = 3-444-00559-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially deleted from the model line for 1991, the 5-speed manual transmission made a return for 1992 through 1994 on base-trim or cargo vans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The 2.5L engine was available with a 3-speed TorqueFlite automatic, along with the 3.0L V6. The 4-speed Ultradrive overdrive automatic transmission was fitted to both the 3.3L and 3.8L V6 engines.

=== Body ===
In an extensive redesign, the second-generation minivans featured a major revision of the exterior, lowering the exterior coefficient of drag from 0.43 to 0.39.  While the styling changes were largely evolutionary, the only shared body panels from the first-generation vans were the front doors and the sliding door.    

The front fascia saw the largest degree of change, with redesigned front fenders allowing for a lower hoodline.  Introduced in 1987, composite headlamp units made their return, wrapping into the front fenders.  With the lower hoodline, a smaller grille was used.  As part of the model change, stylists sought to differentiate the three model ranges from each other.  The Plymouth Voyager was given chrome-trimmed headlights and a sleeker version of its 1987-1990 grille; the Dodge Caravan was given headlamps without chrome trim and adopted the Dodge divisional four-segment grille for the first time.  The Chrysler Town &amp; Country shared its headlamps with the Plymouth Voyager with a model-specific waterfall-style grille.  In an effort to lessen rust and improve fit and finish, front and rear bumpers were redesigned, with wraparound plastic bumpers replacing steel and rubber-ended bumpers.

For 1991, the exterior door handles were carried over from the 1984-1990 vans; for the 1992 model year, the door handles were replaced by a larger design, fitted flush with the body.  

In line with the front fascia, the rear fascia underwent several major changes, with the rear liftgate redesigned.  In addition to rounded edges to improve aerodynamics, the liftgate added a larger rear window and a center/third rear brake lamp;  the rear window wiper was updated to feature intermittent modes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In addition to the extensive exterior changes, the interior saw a complete redesign; as with the previous generation, the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager shared nearly identical interiors (across comparable trim levels).  Coinciding with the addition of a driver-side airbag, the dashboard was reconfigured, placing many primary and secondary controls within closer reach of the driver.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Dodge and Plymouth vans were offered with two different analog instrument panels, with the Chrysler Town &amp; Country fitted with a digital instrument panel.  For the first time, a glovebox was added to the dashboard (the underseat storage drawer made its return).  

The 1991 redesign adopted the seating configurations offered on the 1989-1990 vans.  While 5-passenger seating remained available on base-trim vans, 7-passenger seating became standard for all SE and LE-trim vans (regardless of wheelbase).  To meet federal safety standards, all outboard seating positions were fitted with 3-point seatbelts.  The Chrysler Town &amp; Country (in line with other high-content minivans) shifted from a second-row bench seat to second-row bucket seats as part of the redesign.  Marketed as "Quad Command" seats, the configuration was available on higher-trim (LE and LX/ES) Dodge and Plymouth vans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For 1992, for vans with second-row bench seats, Chrysler introduced integrated child safety seats as an optional feature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For 1994, the integrated child safety seats were modified, allowing for a recline position (closer to a standard carseat).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;    

=== Marketing variations ===
From the first-generation minivans, Chrysler carried over the previous trim levels essentially unchanged (the Mini Ram Van was replaced by the Dodge Caravan C/V, although the nameplate continued to be used in the Netherlands).  Although once a distinguishing feature of the Chrysler minivans in the 1980s, simulated woodgrain trim began to fall out of favor in the 1990s.  In 1992, woodgrain became a delete option from the Chrysler Town &amp; Country and removed entirely from the Dodge Caravan for 1994.  

As part of the 1994 model revision, the liftgate badging was changed from a stamped silver-on-black badge to a smaller embossed silver font; this was the first change to badging since 1984.  Chrysler Town &amp; Country versions retained their script-style badging.

==== Chrysler Town &amp; Country ====
As part of the introduction of the second-generation minivans, the Chrysler Town &amp; Country became a permanent member of the minivan model range, intended as its flagship.  Produced only in the long-wheelbase body configuration, the Town &amp; Country was equipped with woodgrain trim, body-color mirrors, and alloy wheels; the Town &amp; Country is the only version of this generation produced with a [[Electronic instrument cluster|digital instrument panel]].  As with its Chrysler New Yorker and Imperial counterparts, the Town and Country was fitted with a crystal Pentastar hood ornament.  Along with tufted leather interior trim, the Town &amp; Country was fitted with "Quad Command" seating, replacing the second row bench seat with bucket seats matching those of the front row.

Although woodgrain trim had been associated with the Town &amp; Country nameplate since the 1940s, in 1992, the feature became a delete option (replaced by a gold pinstripe and a Town &amp; Country fender script) as it began to fall out of favor with buyers.  In 1993 for [[Model year|MY]]1994, Chrysler introduced a version of the Town &amp; Country with a body-color grille alongside the woodgrain side trim.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Chrysler Voyager (export) ====
Outside North America, as Chrysler does not own the rights to the Dodge or Plymouth brands, exports of the Chrysler minivans were done under the Chrysler nameplate.  In Europe, Chrysler began sales of the Voyager in 1988.  As with its first generation counterpart, the second-generation Chrysler Voyager is largely related to the Dodge Caravan in trim. Initially produced by St. Louis Assembly, in late 1991, Chrysler began sourcing the Voyager from Eurostar in Austria. In January 1992, the Chrysler Voyager began production with a 2.5L VM Motori diesel engine. The Chrysler minivans have never been sold with a diesel option in North America, however.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager ====
As with the first generation minivans, the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager were trimmed nearly identically, with the exception of cargo vans marketed exclusively by the Dodge division (as the Dodge Caravan C/V and Grand Caravan C/V in North America, and Mini Ram Van in the Netherlands).  With the exception of the steering wheel, second-generation Dodge and Plymouth minivans are nearly identical internally across comparable trim levels; Dodge Caravans are fitted with a four-spoke steering wheel while Plymouth and Chrysler minivans use a two-spoke steering wheel.

Along with the base-trim 5-passenger vans, both divisions continued the mid-grade SE and deluxe-trim LE, with the LX serving as the top trim for the short-wheelbase Voyager and the ES serving as the top.

In a change from the first-generation vans, all SE and LE vans were offered with 7-passenger seating, regardless of wheelbase.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  LE-trim vans included many features available on SE-trim vans as option as standard, along with additional sound insulation; long-wheelbase ("Grand") vans and all-wheel drive models were equipped with 15-inch wheels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The top trim in the Caravan and the Voyager was the ES (for both versions of the Caravan) and the LX (for the short-wheelbase Voyager).  Sharing its model features with LE-trim models included as standard equipment,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA2"&gt;Chrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure "1991 Plymouth Voyager/Grand Voyager"&lt;/ref&gt; the LX/ES trims served as a cosmetic upgrade similar to namesake trims in the [[Plymouth Acclaim]] and [[Dodge Spirit]].  In place of woodgrain trim, the LX was given color-keyed two-tone exterior; the ES was given nearly monochrome trim (as with the Dodge Spirit, ES-trim Caravans were fitted with white-painted wheels).  In line with the European Chrysler Voyager, the Dodge Caravan ES was not fitted with a stand-up hood ornament (with a body-color Chrysler Pentastar affixed directly onto the hood).

== Alternative-fuel vehicles ==

=== CNG minivan (1994) ===
Following the production of CNG-fuel ([[compressed natural gas]]) van prototypes derived from the [[Dodge Ram Van]] in 1992, Chrysler began production of a CNG-fuel version of its minivan in 1994.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/CNG-van.html|title=Chrysler CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) Minivans|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using the 3.3L V6 and 4-speed Ultradrive transmission powertrain, the CNG minivans underwent several modifications to accommodate the change in fuel.  Along with modifications to the engine valvetrain, four 3000PSI CNG fuel tanks were added to the vehicle, taking the place of the spare tire well and gasoline tank, holding the energy equivalent of 8.5 gallons of gasoline.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Electric vehicles (1992-1995) ===
{{Main|Chrysler TEVan}}
The Chrysler TEVan is a [[battery electric vehicle]] developed between Chrysler and the Electric Power Research Institute.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/corporate/electric-cars.html|title=Chrysler and Electric Cars and Minivans: TEVan, EPIC, and more|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First unveiled as a concept in 1992, an unknown number were produced between 1993 and 1995 (between 56 and 80).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Deriving its name from the original T-115 codename for the Chrysler minivans and EV, the TEVan was sold nearly exclusively to fleet buyers; the vehicle was based on a standard-wheelbase five-passenger Dodge Caravan.

The TEVan used a 27&amp;nbsp;hp, 65&amp;nbsp;hp max (48&amp;nbsp;kW) Separately-Excited [[GE]] DC traction motor coupled to a two-speed FWD trans-axle that featured Hi, Lo, Reverse and Park. The owner's manual referred to it as a 'semi-automatic transmission' although it used a clutch. The motor controller was also manufactured by GE.

Two different battery types were available for the TEVan during its production;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; weighing in at {{convert|1800|lb}}, the battery pack brought the curb weight the minivan to {{convert|5060|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}.  The 180 V nickel-cadmium pack consisted of 30 [[Saft Groupe S.A.|SAFT]] STM5-180 6 V 180 Ah batteries in six removable pods under the floor of the car, delivering over {{convert|50|mi|km}} of range, and used an automatic watering system for easy battery maintenance.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The nickel-iron pack consisted of 30 Eagle-Pitcher 6 V 200 Ah batteries in six pods under the floor and delivered over {{convert|60|mi|km}} of range. The TEVan owner's manual stated {{convert|80|mi|km}} of range.  The TEVan's on-board charger was a PFC Martin-Marietta and accepted 120 V AC@20 A or 40 A, 240 V AC@20 A or 40 A, and as high as 220 V AC@40 A three-phase inputs.

The TEVan had an 8.8&amp;nbsp;kW three-stage ceramic [[electric heater]]. The 120 A DC/DC converter provided all the 12 V power, there was no auxiliary (12 V) battery. [[Dashboard#Dashboard items|Gauges]] included motor temperature and SOC (state of charge, akin to "Fuel Level") using the stock instruments. It was also equipped with electric [[air conditioning]] (R-134a), regenerative braking, power brakes using a Delco electric vacuum pump, [[power steering]], [[Radio|AM/FM Stereo]], and [[airbag]]s. The original equipment tires were LRR, (Low Rolling Resistance), Goodyear P205/75R15 Momentum at 50 PSI.

As a successor, Chrysler would produce the 1997-1999 EPIC (Electric Powered Interurban Commuter Vehicle), based upon the third-generation minivans.

[[File:Space Shuttle concepts.jpg|thumb|right|In the top left is SERV with MURP. In comparison to the DC-3 design, with the straight wings to the right of SERV, SERV would be just over 100 feet long, while DC-3 was just under 300.]]

'''SERV''', short for '''Single-stage Earth-orbital Reusable Vehicle''', was a proposed [[Space Launch System|space launch system]] designed by [[Chrysler]]'s Space Division for the [[Space Shuttle]] project. SERV was so radically different from the two-stage spaceplanes than almost every other competitor entered into the [[Space Shuttle design process|Shuttle development process]] that it was never seriously considered for the shuttle program.

SERV was to be a [[single-stage to orbit]] spacecraft that would take off from the existing [[Saturn V]] complexes and land vertically at Kennedy for re-use. SERV looked like a greatly expanded [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Command Module (CM)|Apollo capsule]], with an empty central core able to carry {{convert|125000|lb|abbr=on}} of cargo. SERV could be launched uncrewed for cargo missions, ejecting a cargo capsule and returning to Earth. For crewed missions, a separate [[spaceplane]], '''MURP''' (Manned Upper-stage Reusable Payload), could be carried atop the vehicle.

The name "SERV" was also used by an entirely unrelated [[NASA]] project, the "Space Emergency Re-entry Vehicle".

==History==

===Background===
In 1966 the [[US Air Force]] started a study effort that explored a variety of crewed spacecraft and associated launchers. As the proposals were studied, they broke them down into one of three classes, based on the level of reusability. On the simpler end of the development scale were the "Class I" vehicles that placed a [[spaceplane]] on top of an existing or modified [[ICBM]]-based launcher. "Class II" vehicles added partial reusability for some of the launcher components, while the "Class III" vehicles were fully reusable. The USAF had already started work on a Class I design in their [[X-20 Dyna Soar]] program, which had been cancelled in December 1963, but were interested in the [[Lockheed Star Clipper]] Class II design as a possible future development. Nothing ever came of the study effort, as the USAF wound down their interest in crewed space programs.

At the time, NASA was in the midst of winding down the [[Project Apollo]] build-out, as the vehicles progressed to flight. Looking into the future, a number of NASA offices started programs to explore crewed missions in the 1970s and beyond. Among the many proposals, a permanently crewed [[space station]] was a favorite. These plans generally assumed the use of the existing Saturn rockets to launch the stations, and even the crews, but the Saturn systems were not set up for the sort of constant supply and crew turnaround being envisioned. The idea of a simple and inexpensive crewed launcher, a "ferry and logistics vehicle", developed out of the space station studies almost as an afterthought, the first mention of it being in the fiscal year 1967 budgets.&lt;ref name=names&gt;Helen Wells, Susan Whiteley, and Carrie Karegeannes, [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4402/SP-4402.htm "Origins of NASA Names"], NASA SP-4402, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

Design of a low cost, reusable [[Space Transportation System]] (STS) started in earnest in December 1967, when [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]] organized a one-day brainstorming session on the topic. He jump-started the discussion by inviting the USAF to attend, even keeping the original USAF acronym for the project, "ILRV". Like the original USAF studies, a small vehicle was envisioned, carrying replacement crews and basic supplies, with an emphasis on low cost of operations and fast turnarounds. Unlike the USAF, however, NASA's Space Task Force quickly decided to move directly to the Class III designs.

===Phase A===
NASA envisioned a four-phase program of development for the STS. "Phase A" was a series of initial studies to select an overall technology path, and development contracts for proposals were released in 1968 with the proposals expected back in the fall of 1969. A number of designs were presented from a variety of industry partners. Almost universally, the designs were small, fully reusable, and based around [[delta wing]] or [[lifting body]] spaceplanes.

Chrysler Aerospace won contract NAS8-26341 for their entry into the Phase A series, forming a team under Charles Tharratt. Their 1969 report, NASA-CR-148948, outlined the SERV design, preliminary performance measures, and basic mission profiles. This report described a {{convert|23|foot}} wide cargo bay{{efn|Similar in diameter to the Saturn IV stage, allowing easy carriage of cargo on either platform.}} Tharratt was convinced that SERV offered better flexibility than any of the winged platforms, allowing it to launch both crewed and uncrewed missions, and being much smaller overall.&lt;ref&gt;NASA-CR-148948, pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

With most of the NASA centers backing one of the winged vehicles, and being dramatically different from any of them, SERV found no supporters within the bureaucracy and was never seriously considered for STS.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Butrica, "Single Stage to Orbit", Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8018-7338-X}}, pg. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the astronaut corps was adamant that any future NASA spacecraft would have to be crewed,&lt;ref&gt;Gregg Easterbrook, [http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/8004.easterbrook-fulltext.html "Beam Us Out Of This Death Trap, Scotty"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304014605/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/8004.easterbrook-fulltext.html |date=2016-03-04 }}, ''Washington Monthly'', April 1980&lt;/ref&gt; so the potentially uncrewed SERV won no converts there either.

An extension contract was offered anyway, producing the final NASA-CR-150241 report on the SERV design that was turned in on 1 July 1971. This differed mostly in minor details, the major change being the reduction of the cargo bay from 23&amp;nbsp;feet to {{convert|15|foot}} in keeping with the rest of the Shuttle proposals.

==Description==

===Vehicle design===
SERV consisted of a large conical body with a rounded base that Chrysler referred to as a "modified Apollo design". The resemblance is due to the fact that both vehicles used [[Atmospheric reentry#Blunt body entry vehicles|blunt body re-entry profiles]], which lessen heating load during re-entry by creating a very large [[shock wave]] in front of a rounded surface. Tilting the vehicle in relation to the direction of motion changes the pattern of the shock waves, producing lift that can be used to maneuver the spacecraft - in the case of SERV, up to about 100 [[Nautical mile|NM]] on either side of its ballistic path.&lt;ref&gt;CR-150241, slide 3-33&lt;/ref&gt; To aid lift generation, SERV was "stepped", with the lower portion of the cone angled in at about 30 degrees, and the upper portion closer to 45 degrees. SERV was {{convert|96|ft|m}} across at the widest point, and {{convert|83|ft|m}} tall.&lt;ref&gt;CR-150241, slide 2-3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gross lift off weight]] was just over {{convert|6000000|lb|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=final&gt;CR-150241, slide 2-9&lt;/ref&gt; about the same as the [[Saturn V]]'s {{convert|6200000|lb|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-was-the-saturn-v-58.html |title=What was the Saturn V |website=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; but more than the Shuttle's {{convert|4500000|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Space_Shuttle/Shuttle_technical_facts |title=Shuttle Technical Facts |website=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the SERV airframe consisted of steel [[composite honeycomb]]. The base was covered with screw-on [[Atmospheric reentry#Ablative|ablative heat shield panels]], which allowed for easy replacement between missions. The upper portions of the airframe, which received dramatically lower heating loads, were covered with metal shingles covering a quartz insulation below.&lt;ref&gt;NASA-CR-148948, pg. 111&lt;/ref&gt;  Four landing legs extended from the bottom, their "foot" forming their portion of heat shield surface when retracted.&lt;ref name="NASA-CR-148948, pg. 35"&gt;NASA-CR-148948, pg. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

A twelve module LH2/LOX [[aerospike engine]] was arranged around the rim of the base, covered by movable metal shields.&lt;ref&gt;CR-150241, slide 4-3&lt;/ref&gt; During the ascent the shields would move out from the body to adjust for decreasing [[air pressure]], forming a large [[altitude compensating nozzle]]. The module was fed from a set of four cross-linked [[turbopump]]s that were designed to run at up to 120% of their nominal power, allowing orbital insertion even if one pump failed immediately after takeoff. The engine as a whole would provide 7,454,000&amp;nbsp;lbf (25.8 MN) of thrust,&lt;ref name=final/&gt; about the same as the [[S-IC]], the first stage of the [[Saturn V]].

Also arranged around the base were forty {{convert|20000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} jet engines, which were fired just prior to touchdown in order to slow the descent. Movable doors above the engines opened for feed air.&lt;ref name=layout&gt;See general layout diagram, CR-150241, slide 2-13&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[RL-10]]'s provided de-orbit thrust, so the main engine did not have to be restarted in space. Even on-orbit maneuvering, which was not extensive for the SERV (see below), was provided by small LOX/LH2 engines instead of thrusters using different fuels.&lt;ref&gt;NASA-CR-148948, pg. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of conical tanks around the outside rim of the craft, just above the engines, stored the [[LOX]]. [[LH2]] was stored in much larger tanks closer to the center of the craft. Much smaller spherical tanks, located in the gaps below the rounded end of the LOX tanks, held the [[JP-4]] used to feed the jet engines. Orbital maneuvering and de-orbit engines were clustered around the top of the spacecraft, fed by their own tanks interspersed between the LH2.&lt;ref name=layout/&gt; This arrangement of tanks left a large open space in the middle of the craft, 15 by {{convert|60|ft|m}}, which served as the cargo hold.{{efn|Some sources based on the original 1969 version of the SERV design state the cargo hold is 23 feet wide, but the final vehicle selection reduced this to 15 by 60 feet in keeping with the other shuttle designs.}}

===Operational modes===
Two basic spacecraft configurations and mission profiles were envisioned. "Mode A" missions flew SERV to a high-altitude parking orbit at {{convert|260|nmi|km|abbr=on}} inclined at 55 degrees, just below the space station's orbit at {{convert|270|nmi|km|abbr=on}}. "Mode B" missions flew to a {{convert|110|nmi|km|abbr=on}} [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) inclined at 28.5 degrees, a due-east launch from the [[Kennedy Space Center]]. In either case the SERV was paired with a long cargo container in its bay, and optionally combined with a crewed spacecraft on top.

The original proposals used a lifting body spaceplane known as MURP to support crewed missions. The MURP was based on the [[HL-10]] design already under study by [[North American Rockwell]] as part of their STS efforts. MURP was fitted on top of a cargo container and fairing, which was {{convert|114|ft|m}} long overall.&lt;ref name="CR-150241, slide 2-5"&gt;CR-150241, slide 2-5&lt;/ref&gt; In the second version of the study, Chrysler also added an option that replaced MURP with a "personnel module", based on the [[Apollo CSM]], which was {{convert|74|ft|m}} long when combined with the same cargo container. The original, "SERV-MURP", was {{convert|137|ft|m|abbr=on}} when combined with SERV, while the new configuration, "SERV-PM", was {{convert|101|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall.&lt;ref name=final/&gt; Both systems included an all-aspect abort of the crewed portion throughout the entire ascent.&lt;ref&gt;CR-150241, slide 3-17&lt;/ref&gt;

After considering all four combinations of mode and module, two basic mission profiles were selected as the most efficient. With SERV-PM the high-earth orbit would be used and the PM would maneuver only a short distance to reach the station. With SERV-MURP, the low Earth orbit would be used and the MURP would maneuver the rest of the way on its own. In either case, the SERV could return to Earth immediately and let the PM or MURP land on their own, or more commonly, wait in the parking orbit for a cargo module from an earlier mission to rendezvous with it for return to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;CR-150241, slide 2-7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Weight and balance]] considerations limited the return payload.

Both configurations delivered {{convert|25000|lb|abbr=on}} of cargo to the space station, although in the PM configuration the overall thrown weights were much lower.&lt;ref name="CR-150241, slide 2-5"/&gt; If the PM configuration was used with a fairing instead of the capsule, SERV could deliver {{convert|112000|lb|abbr=on}} to LEO, or as much as {{convert|125000|lb|abbr=on}} with an "Extended Nosecone".&lt;ref&gt;CR-150241, slide 3-19&lt;/ref&gt; The Extended Nosecone was a long spike with a high [[fineness ratio]] that lowered atmospheric drag by creating shock waves that cleared the vehicle body during ascent.&lt;ref name="NASA-CR-148948, pg. 35"/&gt;

In addition, Chrysler also outlined ways to support {{convert|33|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide loads on the front of SERV. This was the diameter of the [[S-IC]] and [[S-II]], the lower stages of the Saturn V. NASA had proposed a wide variety of payloads for the [[Apollo Applications Program]] that were based on this diameter that were intended to be launched on the [[Saturn INT-21]]. Chrysler demonstrated that they could also be launched on SERV, if weight considerations taken into account. However, these plans were based on the earlier SERV designs with the larger {{convert|23|ft|m|abbr=on}} cargo bay.&lt;ref name="NASA-CR-148948, pg. 35"/&gt; When NASA's loads were adapted to fit to the smaller {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} bay common to all the STS proposals, this option was dropped.

SERV was not expected to remain on orbit for extended periods of time, with the longest missions outlined in the report at just under 48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;CR-150241, slide 3-5&lt;/ref&gt; Typically it would return after a small number of orbits brought its [[ground track]] close enough to Kennedy, and abort-once-around missions were contemplated. The vehicle was designed to return to a location within four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) of the touchdown point using re-entry maneuvering, the rest would be made up during the jet-powered descent.&lt;ref&gt;NASA-CR-148948, pg. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction and operations===
NASA had partnered with Chrysler to build the NASA-designed [[Saturn IB]], at the [[Michoud Assembly Facility]] outside [[New Orleans]]. Chrysler proposed building SERVs at Michoud as well, delivering them to KSC on the Bay-class ships used to deliver Boeing's S-IC from the same factory. Since the SERV was wider than the ships, it had to be carried slightly tilted in order to reduce its overall width. Pontoons were then added to the side of the ships to protect the spacecraft from spray.&lt;ref&gt;CR-150241, slide 9-11&lt;/ref&gt;

SERVs would be fitted out in the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] (VAB) High Bay, mated with the PM or MURP which were prepared in the Low Bay, and then transported to the [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC39]] pads on the existing [[crawler-transporter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;CR-150241, slide 9-15&lt;/ref&gt; The LC39 pads required only minor modifications for SERV use, similar to those needed to launch the [[Saturn IB]].&lt;ref&gt;CR-150241, slide 9-21&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysler proposed building several SERV landing pads between LC39 and the VAB, and a landing strip for the MURP near the existing Space Shuttle landing strip.&lt;ref&gt;NASA-CR-148948, pg. 145&lt;/ref&gt; The SERVs would be returned to the VAB on an enormous flatbed truck. The only other new infrastructure was a set of test stands at the [[John C. Stennis Space Center|Mississippi Test Operations]] engine testing complex, near Michoud.

Re-using much of the existing infrastructure lowered overall program costs; total costs were estimated as $3.565 billion, with each SERV costing $350 million in FY1971 dollars, and being rated for 100 flights over a 10-year service life.&lt;ref&gt;CR-150241, pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt; This was far less expensive than the two-stage flyback proposals entered by most companies, which had peak development costs on the order of $10 billion.

==Similar designs==
SERV was similar to the later [[McDonnell Douglas DC-X]] design. The primary difference between the two was that the DC-X was built to a military mission and required much greater re-entry maneuvering capability. Because of this, the airframe was long and skinny, and the spacecraft re-entered nose-first. Tilting this shape relative to the path of motion generates considerably more lift than the blunt base of SERV, but also subjects the airframe to much higher heating loads.

More recently, the original SERV layout was used in the [[Blue Origin Goddard]] spacecraft. Like the SERV, Goddard did not need the extended crossrange capabilities of a military launcher, and returned to the simpler blunt-base re-entry profile. The similar [[Kankoh-maru]] design study also used the same blunt-body VTOL profile.

'''Plymouth''' was a brand of [[automobile]]s produced by [[Chrysler|Chrysler Corporation]] and its successor [[Daimler AG|DaimlerChrysler]]. The brand was launched in 1928 to compete in what was then described as the "low-priced" market segment that was dominated by Chevrolet and Ford. It became the high-volume seller for the automaker until the late 1990s. Plymouth cars were marketed primarily in the [[United States]]. The brand was withdrawn from the marketplace in 2001. The Plymouth models that were produced up to then were either discontinued or rebranded as Chrysler or Dodge.

==History==
===Origins===
[[File:1928-plymouth-archives.jpg|thumb|1928 Plymouth Model Q Coupe]]
The Plymouth automobile was introduced at [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]] on July 7, 1928.&lt;ref name="Genius"&gt;{{cite book |last=Curcio |first=Vincent |title=Chrysler: The Life and Times of an Automotive Genius |year=2000 |page=394 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195078961 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=w8djsCB8-OUC&amp;dq=%22Madison+Square+Garden+in+New+York+City+on+July+7,+1928%22&amp;pg=PA394#v=onepage |accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Chrysler Corporation's first entry in the low-priced field previously dominated by Chevrolet and Ford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alfred |last=Sloan |title=Alfred P.

The logo featured a rear view of the ship ''[[Mayflower]]'' which landed at [[Plymouth Rock]] in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]]. However, the inspiration for the Plymouth brand name came from Plymouth binder twine, produced by the [[Plymouth Cordage Company]], also of Plymouth. The name was chosen by [[Joseph W. Frazer|Joe Frazer]] due to the popularity of the twine among farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/history/plymouth/plymouth-name.html |title=What's in a Name? (How Plymouth Was Named) |publisher=Allpar.com |first=Lanny |last=Knutson |accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of Plymouth can be traced back to the [[Maxwell automobile]]. When [[Walter P. Chrysler]] took over control of the troubled Maxwell-[[Chalmers automobile|Chalmers]] car company in the early 1920s, he inherited the Maxwell as part of the package. After he used the company's facilities to help create and launch the six-cylinder Chrysler automobile in 1924, he decided to create a lower-priced companion car. So for 1926, the Maxwell was reworked and rebadged as the low-end four-cylinder Chrysler "52" model. In 1928, the "52" was once again redesigned to create the Chrysler-Plymouth Model Q.&lt;ref name="Kimes 3rd-a"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kimes |first1=Beverly Rae |last2=Clark, Jr. |first2=Henry A. |title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1805-1942 |edition=Third |section=Plymouth |page=1198 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eA4ahvS96soC&amp;q=%22four-cylinder+Chrysler+52+which+itself+had+metamorphosed+from+the+venerable+Maxwell+four%22&amp;pg=PA1198 |publisher=Krause Publications |isbn=9780873414289 |year=1996 |accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Chrysler" portion of the nameplate was dropped with the introduction of the Plymouth Model U in 1929.

While the original purpose of the Plymouth was to serve the lower end of a booming automobile market, during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, the division helped significantly in ensuring the survival of the Chrysler Corporation when many other car companies failed. Beginning in 1930, Plymouths were sold by all three Chrysler divisions ([[Chrysler (brand)|Chrysler]], [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]], and [[Dodge]]).&lt;ref name="Genius2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Curcio |first=Vincent |title=Chrysler: The Life and Times of an Automotive Genius |year=2000 |page=473 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-514705-6 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=w8djsCB8-OUC&amp;dq=%22March+7,+1930%22+%22all+Dodge+DeSoto+and+Chrysler+dealers+would+carry+the+Plymouth+line%22&amp;pg=PA473#v=onepage |accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plymouth sales were a bright spot during this dismal automotive period, and by 1931 Plymouth rose to number three in sales among all cars.&lt;ref name="Kimes 3rd"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kimes |first1=Beverly Rae |last2=Clark, Jr. |first2=Henry A. |title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1805–1942 |edition=Third |page=1198 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eA4ahvS96soC&amp;q=%22In+1931+Plymouth+production%22+%22displaced+Buick+in+the+number+three+spot%22 |publisher=Krause Publications |date=1996 |isbn=978-0-87341-428-9 |accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 with the Model PA, the company introduced [[floating power]] and boasted, "The smoothness of an eight – the economy of a four."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ALMlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EvwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4015%2C6913455 |title=Walter P. Chrysler Announces New Plymouth Floating Power .. and Free Wheeling |newspaper=The Gettysburg Times -- Pennsylvania (advertisement) |page=3 |date=6 July 1931 |accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Chrysler decided to catch up with [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[Chevrolet]] in engine cylinder count. The {{convert|190|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} version of Chrysler's [[Chrysler Flathead engine|flathead-six engine]] was equipped with a downdraft [[carburetor]] and installed in the new 1933 Plymouth PC, introduced on November 17, 1932. However, Chrysler had reduced the PC's wheelbase from {{convert|112|to|107|in|cm|1|abbr=on}}, and the car sold poorly. By April 1933, the Dodge division's Model DP chassis, with a {{convert|112|in|cm|1|adj=on}} wheelbase, was put under the PC body with DP front fenders, hood, and radiator shell. The model designation was advanced to 'PD'. The PC was redesigned to look similar to the PD and became the 'Standard Six' (PCXX). It had been the 'Plymouth Six' at introduction, and was sold through to the end of 1933, but in much lower numbers. In 1937, Plymouth (along with the other Chrysler makes) added safety features such as flat dash boards with recessed controls and the back of the front seat padded for the rear seat occupants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Plymouth/1937_Plymouth/1937_Plymouth_Biggest_Value_Brochure/1937%20Plymouth%20Biggest%20Value-19.html |title=1937 Plymouth "Biggest Value Brochure" |page=19 |website=oldcarbrochures |accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PC was shipped overseas to Sweden, Denmark, and the UK, as well as Australia. In the UK, it was sold as a 'Chrysler Kew', the town of Kew being the location of the Chrysler factory outside London. The flathead six which started with the 1933 Model PC stayed in the Plymouth until the 1959 models.

In 1939, Plymouth produced 417,528 vehicles, of which 5,967 were two-door convertible coupes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.joesherlock.com/39Ply_history.html |title=1939 Plymouth – history |publisher=Joesherlock.com |first=Joseph M. |last=Sherlock |accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[rumble seat]]s. The 1939 convertible coupe was prominently featured at Chrysler's exhibit at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]], advertised as the first mass-production convertible with a power folding top. It featured a {{convert|201|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}, {{convert|82|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} version of the flathead six engine.

For much of its life, Plymouth was one of the top-selling American automobile brands; it, together with [[Chevrolet]] and [[Ford Motor|Ford]], was commonly referred to as the "low-priced three" marques in the American market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/15/automobiles/the-return-of-detroit-s-low-priced-three.html |first=James |last=Cobb |title=The Return of Detroit's 'Low Priced Three' |newspaper=The New York Times |date=15 June 1997 |accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plymouth almost surpassed Ford in 1940 and 1941 as the second-most popular make of automobiles in the U.S.

In 1957, [[Virgil Exner|Virgil Exner's]] new [[Forward Look]] design theme, advertised by Plymouth with the [[tagline]] "Suddenly, it's 1960",&lt;ref name=Allpar_57_Plymouth&gt;{{cite web|last=Benjaminson |first=Jim |url= http://www.allpar.com/history/plymouth/1946-1959/cars-1957.html |title=Plymouth cars 1957: Three Years Ahead |publisher=Allpar.com |accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced cars with advanced styling compared to Chevrolet or Ford. The 1957 total production soared to 726,009, about 200,000 more than 1956, and the largest output yet for Plymouth. However, the 1957–1958 Forward Look models suffered from poor materials, spotty build quality, and inadequate corrosion protection; they were rust-prone and greatly damaged Chrysler's reputation.&lt;ref name=Allpar_57_Plymouth/&gt;&lt;ref name=Allpar_Plymouth_History_5&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/history/inside/plymouth-5.html |title=Insider's history of Plymouth - Part V |publisher=Allpar.com |first=Curtis |last=Redgap |accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, Chrysler started its decade-long unsuccessful attempt to develop and market a viable car powered by a turbine engine when it installed an experimental turbine developed specifically for road vehicles in a Plymouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zSADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA102&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |title=Turbo Plymouth Threatens Future of Standard |journal=Popular Science |date=July 1954 |pages=102–103 |volume=165 |issue=1 |accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s===
[[File:1962 Plymouth Sport Fury (27212738104).jpg|thumb|left|1962 Plymouth Sport Fury]]
[[File:PlymouthAutomobileLogo.jpg|thumb|right|1960s logo]]
Although Plymouth sales suffered as a result of the quality control problems and excesses of the Exner-styled models in the early 1960s, people bought enough of the cars to keep the division profitable. Starting in 1961, the Valiant compact became a Plymouth, further boosting sales. Under the impression that Chevrolet was about to "downsize" its 1962 models, Chrysler introduced a significantly smaller standard Plymouth for 1962. As is known, Chevrolet's big cars were not downsized, catching Plymouth in a sales slump in a market where "bigger was better". The 1963 Fury, Belvedere, and Savoy were slightly larger, featuring a totally new body style, highlighted by prominent outboard front parking lights. For 1964, Plymouth got another major restyle, featuring a new "slantback" roofline for hardtop coupes that would prove popular.
[[File:1968 Plymouth Roadrunner (15044423839).jpg|thumb|1968 Plymouth Roadrunner, one of the Muscle car era models]]
For 1965, the Fury models were built on the new C-body platform. The Savoy line was discontinued and the Belvedere was classified an intermediate, retaining the B-body platform used starting 1962. The low-end series was Fury I, the mid-level model was Fury II, and the higher-end models were Fury IIIs. The Sport Fury, which featured bucket seats and console shifter, was a mix of luxury and sport. Ford and Chevrolet had introduced luxury editions of their big cars for 1965 and Plymouth responded in 1966 with the VIP, a more luxurious version of the Fury. Furys, Belvederes, and Valiants continued to sell well during the late-1960s and early-1970s. While Fury I and Fury II were only available in the U.S. as sedans, Canadians got a Fury II two-door hardtop in addition to the pillared sedans.

The performance car market segment expanded during the late 1960s and early 1970s. The 1964 [[Plymouth Barracuda|Barracuda]] fastback is considered the first of Plymouth's sporty cars. Based on the Valiant, it was available with the [[Chrysler Slant 6 engine|Slant Six]], or {{convert|273|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} small block V8. For 1967, Plymouth introduced the Belvedere GTX, a bucket-seat high-style hardtop coupe and convertible that could be ordered with either the "Super Commando" {{convert|440|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} or Hemi {{convert|426|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engines. Looking for an advantage at the drag races, 1968 had a stripped-down Belvedere coupe, the Road Runner, which featured a bench seat and minimal interior and exterior trim, but was available with Chrysler's big-block engines and a floor-mounted four-speed manual transmission. The Barracuda, originally a "compact sporty car", became available with the 426 Hemi and 440 big block engines in 1968. The GTX, Barracuda, Road Runner, Sport Fury GT, and Valiant Duster 340, were marketed by Plymouth as the 'Rapid Transit System', which was similar to Dodge's 'Scat Pack' concept. During this time, the brand also competed in professional automobile racing. Examples include Richard Petty's career with Plymouth in NASCAR; Dan Gurney, who raced a 'Cuda as part of the All American Racers in numerous Trans Am events; and Sox and Martin, one of the most well-known drag-racing teams of the period, only raced Plymouths after 1964.

===1970s===

By the 1970s, emissions and safety regulations, along with soaring gasoline prices and an economic downturn, meant demand dropped for all muscle-type models. As with other American vehicles of the time,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} there was a progressive decrease in the Barracuda's performance. To meet increasingly stringent safety and [[Automobile emissions control|exhaust emission]] regulations, big-block engine options were discontinued. The remaining engines were detuned year by year to reduce exhaust emissions, which also reduced their power output. There was also an increase in weight as bumpers became larger and, starting in 1970, E-body doors were equipped with heavy steel side-impact protection beams. Higher fuel prices and performance-car insurance surcharges deterred many buyers as the interest in high-performance cars waned. Sales of pony cars were on the decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JHVaQFDrx_MC&amp;pg=RA1-PA1973&amp;dq=sales+of+pony+cars+were+on+the+decline,+with+a+few+exceptions |page=55 |last=Mitchell |first=Larry G. |title=AMC Muscle Cars |year=2000 |publisher=MBI Publishing |isbn=9780760307618 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales had dropped dramatically after 1970, and while 1973 showed a sales uptick, Barracuda production ended 1 April 1974, ten years to the day after it had begun.
The redesign for the 1970 Barracuda removed all its previous [[Automobile platform|commonality]] with the Valiant. The original fastback design was deleted from the line and the Barracuda now consisted of coupe and convertible models. The all-new model, styled by [[John E. Herlitz]], was built on a shorter, wider version of Chrysler's existing [[Chrysler B platform|B platform]], called the [[Chrysler E platform|E-body]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Newhardt |first=David |title=Dodge Challenger &amp; Plymouth Barracuda |year=2000 |publisher=MotorBooks International |isbn=9780760307724 |page=[https://archive.org/details/dodgechallengerp0000newh/page/42 42] |url=https://archive.org/details/dodgechallengerp0000newh/page/42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing this platform was the newly launched [[Dodge Challenger]]; however no exterior sheet metal interchanged between the two cars, and the Challenger, at {{convert|110|in|0|abbr=}}, had a wheelbase that was {{convert|2|in|mm}} longer than the Barracuda.

The E-body Barracuda was now "able to shake the stigma of 'economy car'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newhardt |first=David|title=Dodge Challenger &amp; Plymouth Barracuda|publisher=MotorBooks/MBI |year=2000 |page=7 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=31CLdf2RfFAC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Barracuda+stigma+of+economy+car+1970 |isbn=978-0-7603-0772-4 |accessdate=2010-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three versions were offered for 1970 and 1971: the base Barracuda (BH), the luxury oriented Gran Coupe (BP), and the sport model 'Cuda (BS).&lt;ref name="Hamtramck Historical Registry: Salesman Pocket Guide"&gt;[http://www.hamtramck-historical.com/images/dealerships/SalesmansPocketGuides/1970/Pg%20027.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning mid year 1970, and ending with the 1971 model, there also was the Barracuda Coupe (A93), a low-end model which included the 198ci Slant Six as a base engine, lower grade interior, and (like other Coupe series Chrysler Corp. offered that year) had fixed quarter glass instead of roll-down rear passenger windows.&lt;ref name="www.challengerspecs.com"&gt;[http://www.challengerspecs.com/1970challenger_deputy.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The high-performance models were marketed as'' 'Cuda'' deriving from the 1969 option. The E-body's engine bay was larger than that of the previous A-body, facilitating the release of Chrysler's {{convert|426|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler Hemi engine#Second generation: 426|Hemi]] for the regular retail market.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

For 1970 and 1971, the Barracuda and Barracuda Gran Coupe had two [[Straight-six engine|six-cylinder engines]] available — a new {{convert|198|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} version of the slant-6, and the 225 — as well as three different V8s: the 318ci, the 383ci with two-barrel carburetor and single exhaust, and the 383ci with four-barrel carburetor and dual exhaust {{convert|330|hp|0|abbr=on}} SAE gross. The Cuda had the 383ci {{convert|335|hp|0|abbr=on}} SAE gross (same as Dodge's 383 Magnum) as the standard engine.

Other Barracuda options included decal sets, hood modifications, and some unusual "high impact" colors such as "Lime Light", "Bahama Yellow", "Tor Red", "Lemon Twist", "Curious Yellow", "Vitamin C", "In-Violet", "Sassy Grass" and "Moulin Rouge".&lt;ref name="Hamtramck Historical Registry: Paint Chip chart"&gt;[http://www.hamtramck-historical.com/paintChipCharts/_1970PaintChipCharts-01.shtml?load_img=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The compact Valiant sold well, and built a reputation for attractive styling, durability, economy, and value. Although the Valiant hardtop was discontinued for 1967, it was reintroduced as a virtual clone of the Dodge Dart Swinger for 1971 under the model name "Valiant Scamp". The Scamp was produced along with the Valiant, Dodge Dart, and Swinger until 1976, when it was replaced with the Volaré. Featuring transverse-mounted torsion bars and a slightly larger body, the Volaré (and its Dodge twin, the Aspen) was an instant sales success. Available as coupe, sedan, or station wagon, the Volaré offered a smoother ride and better handling than the Dart/Valiant, but suffered quality control problems and by 1980, was selling poorly.

Realizing that front-wheel drive, four-cylinder engines, and rack-and-pinion steering would become the standards for the 1980s, Chrysler introduced a new compact car for 1978, the Plymouth Horizon/Dodge Omni twins, based on a Simca platform. Horizon sold well, but unfortunately suffered from a scathing report by ''Consumer Reports'', which found its handling dangerous in certain situations. Plymouth continued to sell the Horizon until 1987, when a variety of front-wheel drive compact cars made up the line. Big Plymouths, including the Fury and Gran Fury, were sold until the early 1980s, but mostly as fleet vehicles. While attempting to compete with Ford and Chevrolet for big-car sales, Plymouth was hurt by Chrysler's financial woes in the late 1970s, when both its competitors downsized their full-size models.

===1980s===

[[File:1989-92 Plymouth Acclaim LX.jpg|thumb|right|1989-1992 Plymouth Acclaim LX]]

Most Plymouth models, especially those offered from the 1970s onward, such as the [[Plymouth Valiant|Valiant]], [[Plymouth Volaré|Volaré]],and the [[Plymouth Acclaim|Acclaim]], were [[Badge engineering|badge-engineered]] versions of Dodge or Mitsubishi models.

The '''Plymouth Reliant''' and  '''[[Dodge]] Aries''' were introduced for model year 1981 as the first "[[Chrysler K platform|K-cars]]" manufactured and marketed by the [[Chrysler|Chrysler Corporation]]. The Reliant was available as a 2-door [[coupe]], 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]], or as a 4-door [[station wagon]], in three different trim lines: base, Custom and SE ("Special Edition"). [[Station wagon]]s came only in Custom or SE trim. Unlike many small cars, the K-cars retained the traditional 6 passenger 2 bench seat with column shifter seating arrangement favored by many Americans. The Reliant was powered by a then-new [[Chrysler K engine|2.2 L I4]] [[overhead camshaft#Single overhead camshaft|SOHC]] engine, with a [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]] "Silent Shaft" 2.6&amp;nbsp;L as an option (curiously this engine also featured hemispherical combustion chambers, and all 1981 models equipped with it featured "HEMI" badges on the front fenders). Initial sales were brisk, with the both Reliant and Aries each selling over 150,000 units in 1981. As [[badge engineering|rebadged variants]], the Reliant and Aries were manufactured in [[Newark Assembly|Newark, Delaware]], [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], and [[Toluca Car Assembly|Toluca, Mexico]] &amp;mdash; in a single generation. After their introduction, the Reliant and Aries were marketed as the "Reliant K" and "Aries K".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allpar.com/eek/k/kron.html allpar K-Chronology]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reliant replaced the [[Plymouth Volaré]]/[[Plymouth Road Runner|Road Runner]]. The Aries replaced the [[Dodge Aspen]].The Reliant and Aries were classified by the EPA as mid-size and were the smallest cars to have 6-passenger seating with a 3-seat per row setup, similar to larger [[rear-wheel drive]] cars such as the [[Dodge Dart]] and other [[front-wheel drive]] cars such as the [[Chevrolet Celebrity]]. Chrysler marketed the car as being able to seat "six Americans." The Aries was sold as the Dart in [[Mexico]]. The Reliant and Aries were selected together as ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Car of the Year]] for 1981 and sold almost a million Aries and 1.1 million Reliant units over the nine-year run.

In 1982, Plymouth downsized the Gran Fury again, this time sharing the mid-size [[Chrysler M platform|M platform]] with the [[Chrysler Fifth Avenue]] (called [[Chrysler New Yorker]]/[[Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue|New Yorker Fifth Avenue]] for 1982 and 1983) and the [[Dodge Diplomat]]. In addition to the R-body Gran Fury, the M-body Gran Fury replaced the M-body [[Chrysler LeBaron]], which had moved to the [[compact car|compact]] [[Chrysler K platform|K platform]] that year. Now considered a mid-sized car, this generation Gran Fury was close to the exterior size of what was once the compact [[Plymouth Valiant|Valiant]] and [[Plymouth Volare|Volaré]] but offered more interior room.  The M-body was in fact heavily based on the Volaré's [[Chrysler F platform|F platform]]. Like its predecessor, the 1982 Gran Fury was introduced later than its Chrysler and Dodge siblings; the [[Chrysler LeBaron]] and [[Dodge Diplomat]] had used the M-body since 1977. 1982-1989 Plymouth Gran Furys shared the Dodge Diplomat's front and rear fascias. They were virtually identical with the exception of badging. Once again, the third generation Gran Fury was available in base and higher-end "Salon" trim.  As in previous years, the higher-volume Gran Fury base model catered more towards fleet customers while Gran Fury Salons were geared more towards private customers and offered options such as full vinyl roofs, velour upholstery, turbine-spoke wheels, power windows, and power locks. Although available to private retail customers, the M-body Gran Fury was far more popular with police departments and other fleet customers, primarily since the car was reasonably priced and had a conventional drivetrain with proven components that could withstand a good deal of abuse. This generation of the Gran Fury sold in respectable numbers. However, despite having the same base prices as the Gran Fury (just under $12,000 [[USD]] for their final year), the Diplomat always outsold it, usually by several thousand units each year. The Chrysler Fifth Avenue's total sales were always more than that of the Gran Fury and Diplomat by far, even though it generally cost about $6,000 [[USD]] more. This was the last car to carry the Gran Fury nameplate, but it remained largely unchanged for its 7-year run. Declining sales, a lack of promotion, and technical obsolescence—the platform dated back to the 1976 [[Plymouth Volare]] and [[Dodge Aspen]]—eventually contributed to the model's demise in early 1989. That year, a driver-side airbag became standard; this would be the last RWD Plymouth until the introduction of the [[Plymouth Prowler|Prowler]]. While Dodge offered the 1990 [[Dodge Monaco|Monaco]], and later the 1993 [[Dodge Intrepid|Intrepid]], Chrysler never replaced the Gran Fury with any other large car in the remainder of Plymouth's lineup on through to its demise in the 2001 model year.

In 1984, Chrysler marketed the [[badge engineering|rebadged]] Plymouth variant of its new minivan as the Voyager, using the Chrysler's S platform,  derived from the K-platform ([[Plymouth Reliant]] and [[Dodge Aries]]). The Voyager shared components with the K-cars including portions of the interior, e.g., the Reliant's instrument cluster and dashboard controls, along with the K-platform front-wheel drive layout and low floor, giving the Voyager a car-like ease of entry. The Voyager was on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 1985.&lt;ref name="allpar"&gt;{{cite journal  | url=http://www.allpar.com/model/m/history.html  | title=A Brief History of the Chrysler Minivan | journal= Allpar.com | accessdate=2008-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1987, the Voyager received minor cosmetic updates as well as the May 1987 introduction of the Grand Voyager, which was built on a longer wheelbase adding more cargo room. It was available only with ''SE'' or ''LE'' trim. First-generation Voyager minivans were offered in three trim levels: an unnamed base model, mid-grade ''SE'', and high-end ''LE'', the latter bearing [[Woodie (car body style)#simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] paneling. A sportier ''LX'' model was added in 1989, sharing much of its components with the Caravan ES. Safety features included 3-point seat belts for the front two passengers and lap belts for rear passengers. Standard on all Voyagers were legally mandated side-impact reinforcements for all seating front and rear outboard positions, but [[airbags]] or [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] were not available.&lt;ref name="allpar"/&gt; Notably, the Voyager, along with the [[Dodge Caravan#First generation (1984–1990)|Dodge Caravan]], are considered to be the first mass produced vehicles to have dedicated built in [[cup holder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2013/03/08/when-did-cars-get-cup-holders/|title=When Did Cars Get Cup Holders? - Sociological Images|last=Pages|first=The Society|language=en|access-date=2019-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bonappetit.com/trends/article/the-history-of-the-car-cup-holder|title=The History of the Car Cup Holder|last=Dean|first=Sam|website=Bon Appetit|language=en|access-date=2019-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Original commercials for the 1984 Voyager featured magician [[Doug Henning]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joE9juKuWSY "1984 plymouth voyager commercial"], retrieved on 2010–08–25.&lt;/ref&gt; as a spokesperson to promote the Voyager "Magic Wagon's" versatility, cargo space, low step-in height, passenger volume, and maneuverability. Later commercials in 1989 featured rock singer [[Tina Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl2HV4UlZ84 "1989 Tina Turner Plymouth Voyager Commercial"], retrieved on 2010–08–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian commercials in 1990 featured pop singer [[Celine Dion]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi5t4AxvKKg "Celine Dion : 1990 Dodge Caravan &amp; Plymouth Voyager"], retrieved on 2010–08–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1987, which was the Sundance's first year, it was available in a single base model. For 1988, a higher-end RS model was available. The RS model, which stood for Rally Sport, came with standard features that included two-tone paint, fog lights, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. It was also available with a turbocharged 2.2 L I4 engine, and other amenities like an Infinity sound system, tinted window glass, and dual power mirrors. For 1991, the base model split into two distinct models: entry-level America and mid-level Highline, in addition to the high-end RS. The stripped-down America had previously been offered for the Plymouth Horizon's final year in 1990.

The AA-body cars were [[Badge engineering|badge-engineered]] triplets, as were most Chrysler products of this time. The Acclaim differed from its siblings primarily in wheel choices, bodyside molding, and fascias where it sported its unique taillights and the corporate Plymouth eggcrate-grille. Like the K-body and E-body vehicles they replaced, the Acclaim and Dodge Spirit were both marketed as mainstream variants, while the Chrysler LeBaron was marketed as the luxury variant. Despite this, there was substantial overlap in trims and equipment among each car. For example, a fully loaded Acclaim was almost similar to a base LeBaron in features and price.&lt;ref name="msn.com"&gt;[http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/pricing.aspx?year=1991&amp;make=Plymouth&amp;model=Acclaim "Plymouth Acclaim Prices"], retrieved on 2011–01–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its entry-level base model, the Acclaim was initially available in mid-range '''LE''' and high-end '''LX''' trim. LE and LX models came equipped with features such including premium cloth seating, power windows/door locks, premium sound systems, bodyside cladding, additional exterior brightwork, and on the latter 15-inch lace-spoke aluminum wheels.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Chrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure "1990 Plymouth Acclaim"&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, the base model accounted for nearly 85 percent of Acclaim sales.&lt;ref name="auto.howstuffworks.com"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/plymouth-cars16.htmm |title= How Plymouth Works: 1990, 1991, 1992 Plymouths |author=Auto editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |date=18 June 2007 |publisher=HowStuffWorks |accessdate= 2011-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Spirit, the Acclaim did not receive any sport-oriented models.&lt;ref name="allpar.com"&gt;[http://www.allpar.com/model/acclaim.html "Plymouth Acclaim, Dodge Spirit, Chrysler LeBaron and Saratoga" Information courtesy of Chrysler, allpar], retrieved on 2011–01–17.&lt;/ref&gt; The Acclaim has also been characterized as the replacement for the smaller [[Plymouth Reliant|Reliant]],&lt;ref&gt;Fifty Years of American Automobiles, the editors of Consumer Guide, Beekman House 1989, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[{{Cite web

===Final years: 1990s–2001===
[[File:1999 Plymouth Prowler (15117931110).jpg|alt=|thumb|1999 Plymouth Prowler]]
By the 1990s, Plymouth had lost much of its identity, as its models continued to overlap in features and prices with Dodges and Eagles.&lt;ref name="auto.howstuffworks.com"/&gt; Chrysler attempted to remedy this by repositioning Plymouth to its traditional target market as the automaker's entry-level brand. This included giving Plymouth its own new sailboat logo and advertisements that focused solely on value.&lt;ref name="auto.howstuffworks.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yates |first=Brock |title=The Critical Path: Inventing an Automobile and Reinventing a Corporation |chapter=10.

Chrysler considered giving Plymouth a variant of the highly successful new-for-1993 full-size [[Chrysler LH platform|LH platform]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/model/intrepid.html |title=Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision, Chrysler 300M, New Yorker, and LHS - the LH cars, with reviews |publisher=Allpar.com |accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would have been called the Accolade, but decided against it. By the late 1990s, only four vehicles were sold under the Plymouth name: the [[Plymouth Voyager|Voyager/Grand Voyager]] minivans, the [[Plymouth Breeze|Breeze]] mid-size sedan, the [[Plymouth Neon|Neon]] compact car, and the [[Plymouth Prowler|Prowler]] sports car, which was to be the last model unique to Plymouth, though the [[Chrysler PT Cruiser]] was conceived as a concept unique to Plymouth before production commenced as a Chrysler model.

[[File:Plymouth (automobile logo).jpg|thumb|right|Late 1990s letter emblem from a 1999 Neon]]
After discontinuing the [[Eagle (automobile)|Eagle]] brand in 1998, Chrysler was planning to expand the Plymouth line with a number of unique models before the corporation's merger with [[Daimler-Benz]] AG. The first model was the [[Plymouth Prowler]], a [[hot rod]]-styled sports car. The [[Chrysler PT Cruiser|PT Cruiser]] was to have been the second. Both models had similar front-end styling, suggesting Chrysler intended a retro styling theme for the Plymouth brand. At the time of Daimler's takeover of Chrysler, Plymouth had no models besides the Prowler not also offered in similar version by Dodge. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

From a peak production of 973,000 for the 1973 model year, Plymouth rarely exceeded 200,000 cars per year after 1990. Even the Voyager sales were usually less than 50% that of Dodge Caravan. In Canada, the Plymouth name was defunct at the end of the 1999 model year. Consequently, DaimlerChrysler decided to drop the make after a limited run of 2001 models. This was announced on November 3, 1999.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The last new model sold under the Plymouth marque was the second-generation Neon for 2000. The PT Cruiser was ultimately launched as a Chrysler, and the Prowler and Voyager were absorbed into that make, as well. Following the 2001 model year, the Neon was sold only as a Dodge in the US, though it remained available as a Chrysler in Canadian and other markets. The [[Plymouth Breeze]] was dropped after 2000, before Chrysler introduced their redesigned 2001 [[Dodge Stratus]] and [[Chrysler Sebring]] [[sedan (car)|sedan]].

The [[Plymouth Caravelle|Caravelle]] four-door sedan based on the E-body and a two-door coupe based on the K-body were introduced in Canada. The sporty subcompact [[Plymouth Horizon TC3|Horizon TC3]] was renamed [[Plymouth Turismo|Turismo]]. The full-sized [[Plymouth Voyager|Voyager]] van was discontinued.
* 1984: The [[Plymouth Voyager|Voyager]] minivan and Mitsubishi-based [[Plymouth Colt Vista|Colt Vista]] [[multi-purpose vehicle]] (MPV) were introduced.
* 1985: The E-body Plymouth Caravelle was introduced in the United States.
* 1987: The compact P-body Plymouth Sundance entered the line-up with three- and five-door hatchbacks. The Turismo was discontinued, the five-door Horizon was rebranded "Horizon America" with the most popular options made standard equipment with the less-popular ones dropped, along with a substantial price cut.
*1987.5: The Grand Voyager, an extended wheelbase version of the preexisting Voyager, is introduced.
* 1989: The [[midsize car|mid-sized]] Gran Fury (Caravelle in Canada), as well as the [[Plymouth Reliant|Reliant]], were discontinued after this model year. The Reliant and E-body Caravelle are replaced by the [[Plymouth Acclaim|Acclaim]].
* 1990: The Mitsubishi-based [[Plymouth Laser]] [[Sport compact|sport-compact]] was introduced. The L-body Horizon was discontinued.
*1991: The second generation of the Voyager/Grand Voyager is introduced.
* 1992: The higher-priced Acclaim models were repositioned as entry trim [[Chrysler LeBaron]]s. Total sales of Acclaim and LeBaron dropped. Total 1993 Plymouth model-year production dropped to 159,775, along with 237,875 Voyager models. Dodge built 300,666 Caravans alone, and 263,539 non Caravan models.
* 1994: The little-advertised [[Plymouth Laser|Laser]] and the popular [[Plymouth Sundance|Sundance]] and [[Plymouth Colt|Colt]] [[compact car|compacts]] all end production. They are replaced by a single car, the [[Plymouth Neon|Neon]], a car that Chrysler decided to offer as a Plymouth after dealers protested the loss of the Sundance and Colt with no replacement.
* 1995: Plymouth's lineup was at its all-time low, just three cars: the Acclaim, the Neon, and the [[Plymouth Voyager|Voyager/Grand Voyager]]. The number went up to four in 1997, with the introduction of the [[Plymouth Prowler|Prowler]], but never got any higher.
* 1996: Chrysler announced the new [[Plymouth Breeze]] six months after sister [[Dodge Stratus]] and [[Chrysler Cirrus]] models. Chrysler originally had no plans to replace the Acclaim model.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In an attempt to move Plymouth downmarket, Chrysler made the redesigned Voyager only available in base and mid-level ''SE'' models. All of the higher-end trim levels available on the previous generation were now only be found on the Dodge Caravan. The high-end trim levels could still be found in certain markets outside the US.
* 1997: Production for the 1997 model year was 178,807 cars plus 187,347 Voyager models. Dodge built 448,394 cars and 355,400 Caravans.
* 1999: Total 1999 production for Plymouth cars was to 195,714 with Dodge at 394,052. Voyager production numbered 197,020, compared to 354,641 Caravans. The redesigned 2000 Neon became the brand's last new model.
* 2000: The mid-sized Breeze ended production. This was also the last year for the Voyager [[minivan]] as a Plymouth. All 2000 Voyagers built in December 1999 and beyond were badged as Chrysler Voyagers. In Canada, the redesigned Neon was sold under the Chrysler name and both the Plymouth and Dodge names were dropped on all car models, save for the Prowler and Viper. The Voyager name was dropped in Canada as all Chrysler dealers sold Dodge trucks, including the Caravan. Total 2000 model year production for Plymouth was 108,546 compared to 459,988 Dodge cars. Voyager production totaled 123,869 versus 330,370 Caravan models.
* 2001: In Plymouth's final model year, only the Neon remained. The Prowler and the Voyager became Chryslers. The Voyager gained a high-end LX trim, as well as a base eC trim, and it retained the SE trim. The Breeze was dropped as Chrysler issued the [[Chrysler Sebring]] [[sedan (car)|sedan]] to replace the [[Chrysler Cirrus]]. The [[Chrysler PT Cruiser|PT Cruiser]] was launched as a Chrysler, though it was originally planned to be a Plymouth. The final Plymouth, a Neon, was assembled on June 28, 2001, with a total of 38,657 built for the model year.

==Plymouth trucks==
Plymouth built various trucks and [[van]]s over the years, mainly rebadged Dodge or Chrysler vehicles. Early pickups, delivery trucks, and other commercial trucks were available, and later an SUV, full-sized vans, and minivans. Plymouth had supplied components to the [[Fargo Trucks|Fargo]] vehicles, another member of the Chrysler family, but entered the commercial market in 1937 with the PT50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Benjaminson |first=Jim |url= http://www.allpar.com/history/plymouth/plymouth-commercial.html |title=Plymouth commercial vehicles |publisher=Allpar.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chrysler LHS''' is a [[Full-size car|full-size]] [[Luxury vehicle|luxury]] four-door sedan that was produced by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] for the 1994 through the 2001 [[model year]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.intellichoice.com/20-10-631-21/used-chrysler-lhs-luxury-cars.html |title=Used Chrysler LHS Luxury Cars |publisher=intellichoice |accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a one-year hiatus for 1998. It replaced the [[Chrysler Imperial]] as the division's flagship model.

Introduced in May 1993 for the 1994 model year, the Chrysler LHS was the top of the line model for the division, as well as the most expensive of the [[Chrysler LH platform]] cars.&lt;ref name="Allpar-2ndGen"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/model/300LHS.html |title=Creating the second-generation Chrysler LHS and the Chrysler 300M |publisher=allpar |date=April 2014 |accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the LH-series models shared a {{convert|113.0|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase and were developed using Chrysler's new computer drafting system.&lt;ref name="edmunds1999test"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.edmunds.com/chrysler/300m/1999/road-test.html |title=1999 Chrysler 300M and 1999 Chrysler LHS Road Test |date=January 1, 1999 |first=Greg |last=Anderson |publisher=Edmunds |accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The car was differentiated from the division's [[Chrysler New Yorker|New Yorker]] sedan by its bucket leather seats (the New Yorker had a bench seat) and standard features such as alloy wheels that were options on the New Yorker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/model/lh2/index.html |title=1993–1997 Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision, and Chrysler Concorde, New Yorker, and LHS |publisher=allpar |accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further differences between the Chrysler LHS and its New Yorker counterpart were a floor console and shifter, five-passenger seating, lack of chrome trim, an upgraded interior and a sportier image. From the 1996 model year on the New Yorker was dropped in favor of a six-passenger option on the LHS. The LHS received a minor face change in 1995 when the corporate wide pentastar emblem was replaced with the revived Chrysler brand emblem.

Standard features of the LHS included a 3.5 L EGE 24-valve {{convert|214|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} V6 engine, body-colored grille, side mirrors and trim, traction control, aluminum wheels, integrated fog lights, 8-way power adjustable front seats, premium sound systems with amplifiers, and automatic temperature control. Unlike the New Yorker, leather seats were standard.

===Annual changes===
* MY 1995: The headlamps on the 1994 models were poorly designed, Chrysler received complaints about their poor brightness, and rushed the redesign into fall 1994 production for 1995 models.  Redesigned a projector-style headlight beam, which was rather uncommon for its time. A new Chrysler medallion on the grille replaced the pentastar.
* MY 1996: Body color mirrors were no longer available, as well as the optional carphone. With the withdrawal of the [[Chrysler New Yorker#LH|New Yorker]], front bench seats became optional. Homelink garage door opener and a hidden antenna became standard equipment.

After a one-year hiatus, a redesigned LHS was introduced in 1998 for MY1999.&lt;ref name="edmunds1999test"/&gt; It featured the new winged emblem of the Chrysler division. With the introduction of the [[Chrysler 300M|300M]] and the discontinuation of the New Yorker, the second generation LHS competed with traditional large luxury sedans while the shorter and sportier 300M competed in the performance luxury market.&lt;ref name="Allpar-2ndGen"/&gt; The new generation of the LHS was much more refined than its predecessor, and its 3.5 L SOHC 24-valve V6 produced {{convert|253|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} @ 6400 rpm and {{convert|255|lb·ft|N·m}} of torque @ 3950 rpm.&lt;ref name="edmunds1999test"/&gt;

Chrysler discontinued the LHS after 2001, replacing it with the new Concorde Limited. The Concorde's fascias, the primary exterior difference between the Concorde and LHS, were replaced with the LHS'. In effect, the LHS was rebadged as the Concorde Limited allowing Chrysler to streamline its model lineup a bit.

==Europe==
The first-generation LHS, sold in Europe with the New Yorker nameplate during the 1995–1997 model years, featured rear amber turn signals, rear fog lights, side turn signal repeaters, lack of side markers, and headlamps that incorporated different lens geometry and bulbs.

==Legacy==
The first generation LHS was praised by motoring journalist [[Jeremy Clarkson]], who is well known for criticizing American automobiles, described the LHS as "by global standards, right up there with the best."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=U89BZOQwtOoC&amp;pg=PT53&amp;lpg=PT53&amp;dq=Jeremy+Clarkson+by+global+standards,+right+up+there+with+the+best |title=Motorworld |first=Jeremy |last=Clarkson |publisher=Penguin |year=2009 |isbn=9780141901367 |accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LHS nameplate was discontinued after 2002, but the design continued as the Concorde Limited.

'''''Walt's Puffer II''''' is an early [[United States|American]] [[Altered (drag racing)|Altered]] [[drag racing]] car, built in [[Inkster, Michigan]].&lt;ref name="Genat" &gt;Genat, Robert. "1939 Fiat Coupe Altered", written 21 April 21, 2010, at  [http://www.hotrod.com/articles/mopp-1006-1939-fiat-coupe-altered/ ''Hot Rod Magazine'' online] (retrieved 22 May 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Walt’s Puffer II'' is a [[Fiat 500 "Topolino"|FIAT Topolino]] powered by a [[Fuel injection|fuel injected]] [[Chrysler Hemi engine#392|392 hemi]], driven by [[Walt Knoch]], Jr.&lt;ref name="Genat" /&gt;

Construction of the car began in 1959. Using a 1939 Fiat body, it was built by Walt Knoch, Sr., and a family friend, for Walt, Jr.&lt;ref name="Genat" /&gt; It originally had a [[Latham (supercharger manufacturer)|Latham]] [[supercharger]].&lt;ref name="Genat" /&gt; It debuted at [[Detroit Dragway]].&lt;ref name="Genat" /&gt; It routinely turned in passes with 10 second e.t.s and speeds of {{convert|150|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Genat" /&gt;

Knoch Jr. approached [[Ed Iskendarian]] and [[Stuart Hilborn]] for equipment to improve the 392's performance.&lt;ref name="Genat" /&gt; After switching to Hilborn injection, Knoch set an A/Altered record pass at the [[1959 NHRA Nationals|1959 Nationals]], with a trap speed of {{convert|138.67|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Genat" /&gt;

The car lost the Altereds title at the 1960 U.S. Nationals to the [[Oldsmobile]]-powered Ratican-Jackson-Stearns Fiat.&lt;ref name="Genat" /&gt;

In 1961, the car's top was chopped, and it was dubbed ''Walt's Puffer II''.&lt;ref name="Genat" /&gt; It routinely turned in passes with 10 second e.t.s and speeds of {{convert|150|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Genat" /&gt; It again lost to the Ratican-Jackson-Stearns Topolino at the 1961 Nationals.&lt;ref name="Genat" /&gt;

The next year, the car won A/Altered at the NHRA U.S. Nationals, and only failed to face the Knochs' other car, the A/Roadster ''Walt's Puffer Too'', for Junior Eliminator due to rain.&lt;ref name="Genat" /&gt; When NHRA realigned divisions in 1963, it required Knoch to change the car's number to 385. He refused, and Wally Parks and Ed Eaton banned him. The car would not run again.&lt;ref name="Genat" /&gt;

''Walt's Puffer II'' was taken out of storage in 1999 and given a complete resoration by Knoch and Jerry Dotson.&lt;ref name="Genat" /&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[Aluminum Model Toys|AMT]]'s ''Double Dragster'' [[model kit]], a Chrysler-powered Topolino, was issued with the number 285 on the door, the number ''Walt's Puffer II'' wore.&lt;ref name="Genat" /&gt;

'''''Winged Express''''' is a [[supercharger|supercharged]] A [[Nitromethane|Fuel]] [[Altered (drag racing)|Altered]] (AA/FA). On 28 September 1967, it was the first Altered to exceed {{convert|200|mph|abbr=on}}.

== History ==
''Winged Express'' was built in 1960 by driver [[Willie Borsch|William "Wild Willie" Borsch]] and partner [[Al Marcellus]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motorsport.com/nhra/news/nhra-s-50-greatest-drivers-willie-borsch/61147/ Motorsport.com] (retrieved 14 September 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; assisted by [[Howard Johansen]] ([[Howard's Cams]]), Don Reynolds, Phil Johnson, Dale Young, and Jerry Hyatt.&lt;ref&gt;McClurg, Bob. ''Diggers, Funnies, Gassers and Altereds: Drag Racing's Golden Age''. (CarTech Inc, 2013), p.47.&lt;/ref&gt; The car's [[Chrysler Hemi engine#392|392 hemi]] was built by [[Jim Harrell (drag racer)|Jim Harrell]] (of Jim's Auto Parts).&lt;ref&gt;McClurg, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The body, donated by [[Curt Hamilton]],&lt;ref&gt;McClurg, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt; was the first [[Cal Automotive]] fiberglass 1923 [[Ford Model T|Model T]] used on an Altered.&lt;ref&gt;McClurg, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;  When completed, the car had a simple hoop rollbar and narrow slicks, with the engine tilted upward to aid traction, and was missing the rollbar-mounted wing that later became its trademark.&lt;ref&gt;McClurg,  p.47 &amp; caption.&lt;/ref&gt;

The car was first entered in [[National Hot Rod Association|NHRA]]'s A/Roadster class, at [[Riverside International Raceway|Riverside]] in 1960, where it set an A/R class record of 10.28 at {{convert|148.27|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;McClurg, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Borsch raced ''Winged Express'' for ten years, winning AA/FA at the [[NHRA Winternationals]] in 1967 and 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motorsport.com/nhra/news/nhra-s-50-greatest-drivers-willie-borsch/61147/ Motorsport.com] (retrieved 14 September 2019)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since AA/FA was not recognized as a class by NHRA until 1967, ''Winged Express'' never earned a national title.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motorsport.com/nhra/news/nhra-s-50-greatest-drivers-willie-borsch/61147/ Motorsport.com] (retrieved 14 September 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September 1967 at Irwindale, ''Winged Express'' made the first {{convert|200|mph|abbr=on}} pass by an Altered, at 7.91 seconds and {{convert|200.44|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce, Doug. ''1001 Drag Racing Facts'' (North Branch, MN: CarTech, Inc, 2015), p.175, item #513.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Winged Express'' qualified for the [[1968 NHRA Winternationals]], a 32-car field in [[Top Fuel]], at an AA/FA record [[elapsed time]] of 7.29 seconds, only to have the rest of the field refuse to race Borsch, for fear of the ill-handling Altered. It turned out they were right: in Round One of Super Eliminator, Borsch went from guardrail to centerline, in a wild ride, captured, and made famous, by photographer Bob McClurg; it "became one of the most famous drag racing photos of all time".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motorsport.com/nhra/news/nhra-s-50-greatest-drivers-willie-borsch/61147/ Motorsport.com] (retrieved 16 September 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;
