The '''Pontiac Astre''' is a [[Subcompact car|subcompact]] automobile that was marketed by [[Pontiac]] as a [[badge engineering|rebadged]] variant of the [[Chevrolet Vega]]. Initially marketed in Canada for [[model year]]s 1973–1974, the Astre debuted in the U.S. for the 1975 model year, competing with other domestic and foreign subcompacts that included the [[Mercury Bobcat]], [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1|Volkswagen Rabbit]], and [[Toyota Corolla (E30)|Toyota Corolla]].

Built on the [[GM H platform (RWD)|H-body platform]], the car was available in [[hatchback]], [[notchback]], [[Station wagon|wagon]], and [[Sedan delivery|panel delivery]] [[body style]]s. The Astre shared the aluminum-block 2.3&amp;nbsp;liter [[inline-four]] engine with the Vega through 1976, while the final 1977 models used Pontiac's all-iron 2.5&amp;nbsp;liter inline-four engine. The Astre was cancelled with the Vega at the end of the 1977 model year, although the wagon continued for 1978 and 1979, rebadged as part of the [[Pontiac Sunbird]] line. The word ''"[[wikt:astre|astre]]"'' is [[French language|French]] for "star", a shared naming convention for the Vega.

==Design==
In 1968 GM chairman [[James Roche (General Motors)|James Roche]] announced that General Motors would produce a new [[subcompact car|mini-car]] in the U.S. in two years. Pontiac's own small car program had been rejected. Not only did corporate management make the decision to enter the mini-car market, it also decided to develop the car itself. It was a corporate car, not a divisional one. [[Ed Cole]] formed a GM corporate design team exclusively for the Chevrolet Vega headed by William Munser, who had worked on the [[Chevrolet Camaro#First generation: 1967-69|Camaro]]. The Pontiac Division was given its own version of the Vega for the [[Canada|Canadian]] market, named Astre for the 1973 model year. U.S. Pontiac dealers finally had a subcompact to sell when the Astre made its U.S. debut for the 1975 model year.

The Astre used the Vega [[GM 2300 engine|140&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in (2.3-liter)]] inline-four engine through 1976. The engine features an aluminum-alloy cylinder block and cast-iron cylinder head with a single overhead camshaft [[overhead camshaft|(OHC)]]. 1977 models featured Pontiac's [[GM 2.5 Liter inline-4 engine (Iron Duke)|151&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in (2.5-liter)]] inline-four engine with a cast-iron block and head with  overhead valves [[overhead valve|(OHV)]]. Transmissions are the three- and four-speed [[manual transmission|manual]], five-speed manual with overdrive (1976–1977 option) and the three-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]].

The Astre has a {{convert|97.0|in|mm|sing=on}} [[wheelbase]] and a {{convert|65.4|in|mm|sing=on}} width.
The front suspension is short and long control arms with [[coil springs]]; the rear suspension is a four-link design with coil springs. A torque-arm design rear suspension replaced the four-link design starting with the 1976 models. The Astre is a [[rear wheel drive]] vehicle with a [[live axle|live rear axle]]. Steering is of a [[recirculating ball]] type with a power assist option. The brake system features front [[disc brakes]] with solid rotors, and rear [[drum brakes]]. Power assist was optional starting in the 1975 model year.

==Models and changes==
[[File:73 Astre.jpg|thumb|left|1973 Pontiac Astre Coupe]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1974 Astre Coupe and Wagon.jpg|thumb|left|1974 Astre GT Hatchback &amp;&lt;br&gt; Astre GT Safari Wagon]] --&gt;

The Astre features Pontiac's [[Brand|trademark]] split grill, emblems and steering wheel with an upgraded interior trim to help differentiate itself from the Chevrolet Vega. Other styling differences compared to the Vega include &amp;mdash; 1973 model Astres have a black-finish grill and clear parking lamp lenses on ''all'' models, and chrome headlight bezels on non-GTs. Taillight lenses (same as the Vega) have a chrome trim piece surround. The 1974–1977 models have first generation Firebird-styled taillights (also shared with the 1973–1974 Ventura) on the notchback and hatchback.&lt;ref&gt;1973–1977 Pontiac Astre sales brochures.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hatchback#North America|hatchback]] coupe features a lower roofline and a fold-down rear seat. The [[Notchback#North America|notchback]] sedan had the lowest price and is the only Vega model with an enclosed trunk.&lt;ref&gt;1975 Pontiac Astre brochure specifications&lt;/ref&gt; The Safari [[Station wagon#Two-door wagons|wagon]] has fixed rear-side glass and a swing-up liftgate.&lt;ref&gt;Motor Trend-August 1970&lt;/ref&gt; A [[sedan delivery#1970s|panel delivery]] based on the wagon was sold through the 1975 model year. It has steel panels in place of the rear-side glass, and an additional enclosed storage area. An auxiliary front passenger seat was optional.

The SJ hatchback and SJ Safari wagon models feature soft [[nylon]] upholstery, cut pile carpeting, padded and cloth covered door panels, and a fabric headliner, plus rally instruments, the higher-output two barrel engine, four-speed or automatic (over a three-speed manual) gearbox and [[radial tires]]. A GT package option for the hatchback and Safari wagon combined the lower-line interior with the SJ's performance and handling features.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1974 Pontiac Astre.jpg|thumb|1974 Pontiac Astre hatchback]] --&gt;

The 1974 model year brought the only major body [[automotive design|design]] changes, due to revised front and rear {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} bumper standards-A slanted header panel with a new split grill and recessed headlamp bezels complement the larger, front 5&amp;nbsp;mph aluminum bumper. Front and rear license plate brackets were relocated and a larger rear 5&amp;nbsp;mph aluminum bumper was used increasing the overall length three inches compared to the 1973 models.
A revised rear panel on notchback and hatchback models had new Firebird-styled taillights and ventilation extractor grills were eliminated on trunk and hatch lids.&lt;ref&gt;1974 Pontiac brochure.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1975 Astre, introduced in the United States September 1974, gave U.S. Pontiac dealers a needed fuel efficient subcompact. A budget "S" series was added during 1975. More than 267 changes were made including new High-energy [[electronic ignition]] system and a [[catalytic converter]]. Power brakes and a tilt steering wheel were new options.&lt;ref&gt;1975 Pontiac Astre sales brochure.&lt;/ref&gt; The Astre panel delivery was discontinued the end of the model year.

[[File:Pontiac Astre Lil Wide Track.jpg|thumb|left|1975 Astre Li'l Wide Track]]

A unique Astre package was offered in 1975. Dubbed the 'Lil Wide Track, it was the creation of Jerry Juska of Dymar to help with lackluster Astre sales. Juska took his ideas to Dave Landrith of Motortown Corporation specializing in custom auto work. The package includes a front air dam, [[rear spoiler]], appliance wire mag rims, window louvers, a chrome exhaust tip, and bright stripe decals for the hood, body sides, rear spoiler, door handles, and wheel centers. They assembled a couple of cars in Jan. and Feb. 1975 and took pictures to local [[Detroit]] dealers where the package gained acceptance. It added a little over $400 to the price of the Astre but dealers felt the difference in looks was worth the price. Production was later switched from an old warehouse in suburban Detroit to a factory beside the [[Lordstown Assembly]] Vega/Astre plant. An estimated 3,000 Lil Wide Track Astres were ordered by dealerships. The package components were later offered as a dealer installed kit.&lt;ref&gt;1975 Pontiac Astre "Lil Wide Track" folder/mailer&lt;/ref&gt;

Astres were confined to a single series for 1976, but they were refined with extensive engine, chassis, and body integrity improvements. A modest facelift included a revised grill. The 2.3&amp;nbsp;L engine, named Dura-built 140, received improved cooling and durability refinements, and a five years/60,000 mile [[warranty]]. The chassis received the new [[Pontiac Sunbird#1976–198|Pontiac Sunbird's]] upgraded components including the box-section front cross-member, larger rear brakes and torque-arm rear suspension, replacing the four-link design, and effectively eliminating wheel-hop on rough roads. The body received extensive anti-rust improvements.

The last-of-the-line 1977s were treated to Pontiac's new 151&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in "Iron Duke" inline-four engine. Both the cylinder block and cylinder head are cast-iron. Standard in the Astre and Sunbird, they were the first [[General Motors|GM]] vehicles to utilize the engine which was widely used into the 1990s. 1977 Astre models also featured a new vertical design grill and aluminum wheels (13-inch) were a new option. The "Formula" option was also introduced for the Astre's final year, which included the handling package, chrome valve cover, three-piece spoiler, Formula T/A steering wheel and special decals.&lt;ref&gt;1977 Pontiac full line catalog&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1978–1979 Pontiac Sunbird wagon was a rebranded continuation of the Astre wagon, continuing with a modified 1977 Astre grille rather than taking on the Sunbird coupe's square headlights and flat hood.

==Reviews==

''[[Car and Driver]]'' in a 1975 Astre road test, said, "For $180 over the price of a Vega, the Astre features upgraded interior trim-primarily the items for which Chevrolet charges $134 in their custom interior. You also have the opportunity to go one big step up in luxury if you choose the SJ line which is available in hatchback and wagon body styles."&lt;ref&gt;Car and Driver-July 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

''Car and Driver'' in a 1977 Astre road test, said, "The Astre ''is'' the Vega-polished and refined and significantly improved, but still a Vega in perhaps its ultimate state of development..It remained for Pontiac to do what Chevrolet probably should have done in the first place: the substitution of the marvelous old Chevy II cast-iron four-cylinder econo-motor for the much-troubled aluminum-block Vega engine. Sliding in and starting the engine was a revelation because its so quiet and smooth compared to the Vega. Also the Astre's interior trim was judged more plush than Vega's.

''Car and Driver'' in its 35th anniversary issue in 1990, amusingly recalled the Astre U.S. debut: "Detroit Fights Back - The Pontiac Astre is introduced. It's a Vega with better decals."&lt;ref&gt;Car and Driver-July 1990. 35th Anniversary 1970-1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pontiac Tempest''' is an [[automobile]] that was produced by [[Pontiac]] from 1960 to 1970, and again from 1987 to 1991.

The Tempest was introduced as an entry-level [[compact car|compact]] in October 1960 at the [[Paris Auto Show]] for the 1961 model year.&lt;ref&gt;''Road Research Report: Pontiac Tempest'' Sports Car Illustrated, vol. 6, March 1961, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; A highly innovative design, it shared the new [[unibody]] [[GM Y platform|Y platform]], GM's first, with the [[Buick Special]]/[[Buick Skylark|Skylark]] and [[Oldsmobile F-85]]/[[Oldsmobile Cutlass|Cutlass]], came with a standard four-cylinder engine, and offered a two-speed rear-mounted [[transaxle]] automatic transmission.

The line offered the optional [[Pontiac LeMans|LeMans]] trim upgrade, beginning with a few 1961 LeMans coupes and adding a performance aspect in 1962. In 1964, the Tempest was redesigned as a [[Mid-size car|mid-size]] built on the new GM [[GM A platform|A-body]] platform, with its LeMans version spawning the industry-changing signature muscle car, the [[Pontiac GTO|GTO]]. Originally options, both the LeMans and GTO were subsequently split off as their own model lines, the LeMans in 1969 and the GTO in 1965.

In Canada, Pontiac also marketed a [[badge engineering|rebadged]] version of the compact [[GM L platform|L-body]] [[Chevrolet Corsica]] under the name ''Tempest'' from 1987 to 1991.

The genesis of the Tempest began when the Pontiac division wanted an entry into the compact market following the success of the Chevrolet Corvair; the division wanted to produce a clone of the Corvair but instead GM gave Pontiac the green light to manufacture a new creation.&lt;ref&gt;''Grand Delusions'' by Hillel Levin p. 36 {{ISBN|0-670-26685-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tempest's designer, auto industry icon [[John Z. DeLorean]], Pontiac's chief engineer and general manager, went to work on a unique car that would meld components GM already produced.&lt;ref name="Levin, p.36"&gt;Levin, p.36&lt;/ref&gt;
He wanted the Tempest to be more than just a compact,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1961-1963-pontiac-tempest1.htm|title=DeLorean and the Pontiac Tempest - HowStuffWorks|work=HowStuffWorks}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he apparently convinced the American motoring press of that: The Tempest was ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's 1961 [[Car of the Year]]. ''[[Road &amp; Track]]'' praised the Tempest as "exceptionally roomy" and "one of the very best utility cars since the [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Ford Model A]]." But in hindsight, DeLorean admitted that the Tempest was "less than successful," adding, "there was no mechanical problem, but the car rattled so loudly that it sounded like it was carrying half-a-trunkful of rolling rocks."&lt;ref name="Levin, p.36"/&gt;

Despite sharing some sheet metal with the Oldsmobile F-85, the first-generation Tempest had several unique features that made it stand apart from the other compact GM cars. Power came from a 195&amp;nbsp;cubic inch (3.2&amp;nbsp;L) [[straight-4]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1962_Pontiac/1962_Pontiac_Tempest_Brochure/1962%20Pontiac%20Tempest-15.html |title=Directory Index: Pontiac/1962_Pontiac/1962_Pontiac_Tempest_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; engine, marketed as the "[[Pontiac Trophy 4 engine|Trophy 4]]," derived from the right cylinder bank of [[Pontiac V8 engine#389|Pontiac's 389 cubic inch "Trophy 8" V8 engine]].&lt;ref name=hemmings&gt;[https://www.hemmings.com/magazine/hmn/2010/08/1961--63-Pontiac-Trophy-4/3632031.html 1961-'63 Pontiac Trophy 4, ''Hemmings Motor News'' August, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;  The other part of the pioneering Tempest drivetrain was a rear-mounted [[transaxle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1962_Pontiac/1962_Pontiac_Tempest_Brochure/1962%20Pontiac%20Tempest-13.html |title=Directory Index: Pontiac/1962_Pontiac/1962_Pontiac_Tempest_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was coupled to a torque shaft arcing in a {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}} downward bow within a longitudinal tunnel. Using the torque shaft was the result of being forced to use the Corvair underbody which, being a rear engine platform, had no drive shaft tunnel.&lt;ref name="Levin, p.36"/&gt; To combine flexibility with strength in the proper proportion, the shaft was forged of SAE 8660 steel (high nickel, chrome and [[molybdenum]] alloying percentages) for torsion bar specifications. For automatic cars, the shaft was {{convert|0.65|in|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|87.25|in|m|abbr=on}} long, while the manual-box shaft was {{convert|0.75|in|mm|abbr=on}} by {{convert|82|in|m|abbr=on}}. This joined the forward engine and the rear transaxle (therefore no transmission hump) into a single unit, helping to reduce vibration.&lt;ref name="nyt1"&gt;{{cite news| title=Auto Ego, 1961 Pontiac Tempest, When Half a V-8 Is Enough|work=The New York Times|date= April 9, 2010|first=Richard S.|last=Chang|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/automobiles/collectibles/11EGO.html?ref=global-home}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design, known as "rope drive," had only been seen previously on General Motors' 1951 [[Le Sabre concept car|Le Sabre]] [[Concept vehicle|concept car]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flory|first=J.

The combination of a rear-mounted transaxle and front-mounted engine very nearly gave the car an ideal 50/50 front/rear weight distribution. This, along with a four-wheel independent suspension, helped make the Tempest a nimble-handling car for the era. The front engine/rear transaxle design also eliminated the driveshaft/transmission tunnel in the front of the passenger compartment, while lowering the driveshaft tunnel in the rear compared with a conventional front engine/front transmission layout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XNsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Popular Mechanics|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trophy 4 four-cylinder engine was promoted for its economy, but Pontiac also saved money on its assembly: Because it was based on the right cylinder bank of the Pontiac 389 V8 engine, both engines could be built on the same assembly line. There were three versions of the Trophy 4: An economy version with a relatively low 8.6:1 compression ratio and a single-barrel [[carburetor]]; a hotter version with a 10.25:1 compression ratio and a single-barrel carburetor; and the most powerful Trophy 4 engine, which had a 10.25:1 compression ratio and a four-barrel carburetor. While both Trophy 4 engines (low and high compression) equipped with single-barrel carburetors produced {{convert|110|-|140|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, the high-compression, four-barrel Trophy 4 engine produced {{convert|166|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 4,800&amp;nbsp;[[Revolutions per minute|RPM]] and {{convert|215|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of [[torque]] at 2,800&amp;nbsp;RPM (all ratings are SAE Gross). The three Trophy 4 engine versions offered fuel economy ratings ranging from 18-22&amp;nbsp;MPG. Popular Mechanics reported fuel economy of 21.3 MPG at 60 MPH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e98DAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Popular Mechanics|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trophy 4 engine was generally reliable, but could be harsh when it was out of tune, due to its inherent lack of secondary balance and absence of balancer shafts.

The Tempest was offered with quite a few options such as air conditioning, transistor radios, windshield washers, a parking brake warning light, padded safety dash, child-proof door locks, and dealer-installed seat belts, as such restraints were not yet Federally required at the Tempest's introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Pontiac/1961-Pontiac/1961-Pontiac-Tempest-Accessories-Booklet/1961-Pontiac-Tempest-Accessories-04-05-06-07|title=1961 Pontiac Tempest Accessories-04-05-06-07|work=oldcarbrochures.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204172607/http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Pontiac/1961-Pontiac/1961-Pontiac-Tempest-Accessories-Booklet/1961-Pontiac-Tempest-Accessories-04-05-06-07|archivedate=2015-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1962PontiacSlantFour.jpg|thumb|left|{{convert|194.5|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Pontiac Trophy 4 engine|Trophy 4]] engine in a 1962 Pontiac Tempest LeMans]]
Another departure from the other Y-body cars was the Tempest's {{convert|9|in|cm|abbr=on}} drum, which used five studs on the same bolt circle ("five-on-four-and-a-half") and {{convert|15|in|cm|abbr=on}} wheels - a configuration unique among General Motors cars. Both Buick and Oldsmobile had standardized their Y-body cars on an odd {{convert|9.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} brake drum with four lug studs on a {{convert|4.5|in|cm|abbr=on}}-diameter circle (a "four-on-four-and-a-half" bolt pattern), with {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on}} wheels. This arrangement was also not used by other General Motors cars at the time.

Along with the Trophy 4 engine line another optional engine for the Tempest in 1961 and 1962 was the innovative aluminum [[Buick V8 engine#215|Buick-built 215 cubic inch (3.5 L) V8]], an engine that had first appeared on the Buick LeSabre.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p.1021.&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that just 3,662 Tempests were ordered with the 215 engine, or about 1% of production. This engine produced, in its various incarnations, from {{convert|155|-|215|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} despite weighing just {{convert|330|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} installed.

The engine blocks used for 215-V8 engines installed in Tempest models were distinct from 215-V8 engine blocks used in other models because, in addition to Buick factory markings, they were also hand-stamped at the Pontiac plant with the [[Vehicle Identification Number]]s of the individual vehicles that they were installed in. Thus, in 1961, all Pontiac 215 engine blocks begin with "161P"; for 1962 the stamping began with "162P". Further code numbers indicated the car's transmission (manual or automatic).

In 1961, the transmission choices were a three-speed column-shifted manual with a non-synchronized first gear, or a two-speed automatic [[transaxle]] controlled by a small lever to the right of the ignition switch on the instrument panel. Called ''TempesTorque'' in company literature but unmarked on the unit itself until 1963, it was similar in concept to the Chevrolet [[Powerglide]] automatic transmission used on the [[Chevrolet Corvair]], though few parts overlapped. For 1962, a floor-mounted, fully synchronized four-speed manual transmission became available.

At its introduction, the Tempest was only available as a four-door pillared sedan and as a station wagon that, like other Pontiac station wagons of the time, had the name ''Safari'' added to it. A pair of two-door coupes (one of which was named [[Pontiac LeMans|LeMans]]) were added at the end of 1961, both in the 1961 body style.

[[File:'62 Pontiac Tempest Convertible (Destination Décarie '12).JPG|thumb|1962 Pontiac Tempest convertible]]
For the 1962 model year there were four Tempest models available: a sedan, a coupe, a station wagon, and a convertible. Customers wanting something fancier could opt for the LeMans [[trim package]] upgrade, which featured front bucket seats. Tempest LeMans models were available with either the coupe or the convertible; there was no LeMans sedan or station wagon. And although Oldsmobile and Buick offered pillarless [[hardtop]]s on the Cutlass and Skylark respectively, Pontiac did not offer a pillarless hardtop LeMans model.

In 1963, the LeMans became a separate series; its sales were nearly 50 percent of combined Tempest and Le Mans production. 1963 models, referred to as ''senior compacts'', were slightly larger and heavier than the 1961 and 1962 models had been. These new models featured a redesigned transaxle that improved handling, as well as a high-performance option that was much more powerful than the rarely-ordered 215-V8. This new V8 option for 1963 was Pontiac's [[Pontiac V8 engine#326|326 cubic inch (5.3 L) V8]], an engine with the same external dimensions as the venerable "Trophy 8" 389, but different internal components designed to produce more torque. A new version of the automatic transmission (now officially stamped ''TempesTorque'' on the case) was redesigned to handle the new V8's additional torque. The four-speed manual transmission had not been redesigned, and very few V8-equipped Tempest models were built with this transmission. The three-speed manual transmission remained available for all engines.

The high-compression 326 V8 engine's output was {{convert|260|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|352|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque (SAE Gross). The actual displacement was 336 cubic inches, but according to lore, since General Motors management edict declared that no GM compact was allowed to have an engine that was larger than the Chevrolet [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]] 327 V8, the advertised displacement for the Tempest V8 was 326 cubic inches. However, for 1964, the engine's displacement was adjusted so that it actually was 326 cubic inches, making the 1963 "326 V8" a single-year engine.

The cast-iron V8 engine increased the Tempest's weight by {{convert|260|lb|kg|abbr=on}} over the weight of a Tempest equipped with a Trophy 4 engine; front/rear weight distribution changed somewhat to 54/46. Performance with a 326 V8-powered Tempest was strong enough that ''Car Life'' magazine wrote "No one will wonder why they didn't use the 389." Fuel economy with the 326 V8 could be as high as 19&amp;nbsp;mpg. The 326-V8 option proved popular: 52 percent of the 131,490 Tempests and LeMans models sold in the 1963 model year were ordered with the 326-V8 option.

===Super Duty===
Perhaps the most famous of all Tempests were the 12 1963 "Super Duty" cars built to compete in the [[NHRA]] Factory Experimental class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hemmings.com/mus/stories/2008/05/01/hmn_feature9.html |title=Hemmings Motor News: Master Wagon |publisher=Hemmings.com |date=2008-05-01 |accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These were put together at the Pontiac plant in Michigan over Christmas 1962 with the knowledge of an impending General Motors ban on factory racing. Among those who successfully raced them was [[Wild Bill Shrewsberry]], who turned low 12-second quarter-mile runs in the 1963 [[NHRA]] Winter Nationals driving for [[Mickey Thompson]]. Shrewsberry still owns his car and it is still equipped with Pontiac's "Powershift" transaxle as retrofitted later in the 1963 season. Developed specifically for the Super Duty model, this was essentially two Chevrolet  [[Powerglide]] automatics in a single four-speed unit, allowing clutchless shifting in much the same manner as modern drag racing transmissions do.

On October 31, 2008, one of the most rare factory race cars, the missing [[Stan Antlocer]] Super Duty Tempest Le Mans Coupe, was auctioned on eBay. The seller started the auction at $500 being unaware of the car's true value. Eventually, the car was sold for $226,521.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Tutor|first=Chris|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2008/11/10/ebay-find-of-the-day-1963-lemans-tempest-sells-for-226-521|title=eBay Find of the Day: 1963 Le Mans Tempest sells for $226,521|publisher= Autoblog.com|date=2008-11-10|accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130121191056/http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/Pontiac-Le-Mans-TEMPEST-63-PONTIAC-LeMANS-TEMPEST-1-4-MILE-CAR-W-O-MOTOR-TRANS_W0QQitemZ110306170567QQcmdZViewItemQQptZUS_Cars_Trucks?hash=item110306170567&amp;_trksid=p4506.c0.m245&amp;_trkparms=72:727 |65%3A12|39%3A1|240%3A1318 eBay Motors: 1963 Pontiac Le Mans TEMPEST]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportscarmarket.com/Profiles/2009/March/American/|title=Report on the "barn find" 1963 Super Duty which also chronicles Wild Bill Shrewsberry's accomplishments at|publisher=Sportscarmarket.com|date= 2009-02-28|accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sportscarmarket.com/profile/1963-pontiac-super-duty-lemans-coupe|title=1963 Pontiac Super Duty LeMans Coupe|publisher=Sportscarmarket.com|accessdate=2019-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, the Tempest was redesigned as a more-conventional vehicle and enlarged from a compact to an intermediate-sized car with a {{convert|115|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase and an overall length of {{convert|203|in|mm|abbr=on}}. The unibody, curved driveshaft and transaxle were gone, replaced by a traditional front engine, front transmission, body-on-frame, and solid rear axle design used by all of GM's other cars but the Corvette and Corvair. Together with its sister cars (the [[Oldsmobile F-85]]/[[Oldsmobile Cutlass|Cutlass]] and [[Buick Special]]/[[Buick Skylark|Skylark]]), the Tempest/Le Mans moved to the new [[GM A platform (RWD)|A body platform]] shared with the new [[Chevrolet Chevelle]], and all three cars received updates and modifications standardizing them throughout—including the wheels—by GM edict. The Le Mans name was discontinued as a separate series, so now the cars were, in ascending order, base Tempest, Tempest Custom, and Tempest Le Mans.

Replacing the previous "Trophy 4" inline four-cylinder engine as standard equipment was a new 215&amp;nbsp;in³ [[Pontiac straight-6 engine#215|Pontiac straight six]] with one-barrel carburetor and {{convert|140|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. This six was basically a smaller bore (3.75") version of the {{convert|230|cuin|L|abbr=on}} Chevrolet straight-6 offered as Pontiac exclusive. Optional engines included two versions of the 326&amp;nbsp;in³ Pontiac V8 introduced the previous year, a two-barrel {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} regular fuel option; or the {{convert|280|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 326 HO engine with four-barrel carburetor and 10.5:1 compression ratio which required premium fuel. Transmissions included a standard three-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] with column shift, four-speed manual with floor-mounted Hurst shifter or a two-speed automatic; the latter was a version of Buick's [[Super Turbine 300]].

The popularity of the high-performance 326/336 V8 in the Tempest-based LeMans package the year before prompted Pontiac to give the option a special, sporty name: the [[Pontiac GTO|GTO]], after the Italian abbreviation "Gran Turismo Omologato" used to designate specially equipped street cars [[homologated]] for racing (though the opposite, producing a mandated minimum of street-legal race cars to meet the homologation requirement, is the norm). Available with Pontiac's largest V8, the 389 cu. in. (6.4L), and equipped with a four-barrel carburetor (producing 325&amp;nbsp;hp) or the soon to become iconic 345&amp;nbsp;hp 3 x 2 barrel [[Tri-Power]] set-up, the GTO proved to be the defining [[muscle car]] of the 1960s.  Unlike other 1964 Tempests, the GTO was available as a pillarless [[hardtop]] coupe.

Unsurprisingly, the success of the GTO prompted Oldsmobile to rush out its own high-performance option package for the F-85/Cutlass called the [[Oldsmobile 442|442]], and the next year for Buick to release a high-performance version of the Skylark called the Skylark [[Buick GS|Gran Sport]], or GS. Both cars would enjoy success and join Chevrolet's [[Chevrolet Chevelle#Chevelle SS|Chevelle SS]] in GM's effort to capitalize on the exploding muscle car era.

Engine offerings for the 1965 Tempest were the same as 1964, except the 326 HO was uprated to {{convert|285|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and the GTO 389's uprated to 335HP and 360HP via higher rise intake manifolds. Styling changes included a new split grille with vertical headlights similar to the larger Pontiacs, revised taillights and a more slanted rear deck. A two-door hardtop [[coupe]] was added to the Tempest Custom line, while the Le Mans got a four-door sedan with a plush interior done in Preston Cloth trim similar to the full-sized Bonneville Brougham.

A major facelift was made on the 1966 Tempest that included more rounded bodylines with a Coke-bottle effect similar to the full-sized Pontiacs. New four-door pillarless hardtop sedans were added to the Tempest Custom line. Under the hood, the Chevy-derived 215 six was replaced by a new 230&amp;nbsp;in³ [[Pontiac straight-6 engine#Overhead Cam|Pontiac overhead cam six]], the only such engine found in an American production car at that time. This was also the first American-built engine to use a [[Timing belt (camshaft)|belt]] to time the [[camshaft]] to the [[crankshaft]] rather than a chain. The base OHC had a one-barrel carburetor and was rated at {{convert|165|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, designed for economy buyers. Optionally available as part of the Sprint option package on two-doors was a four-barrel, high-compression {{convert|207|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} version of the OHC six, marketed as an alternative to higher-priced European sport sedans, which had similar OHC engines. For those wanting V8 power, the 326 and 326 HO options continued with horsepower ratings of 250 and {{convert|285|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, respectively, and GTO engines stayed the same.

Only minor changes were made to the 1967 Tempest, Custom and Le Mans models. The GTO 389 cu. in. V-8 was replaced by a new [[Pontiac V8 engine#400|400 cu. in. V-8]]. The Rochester 4bbl. carburetor replaced both the standard GTO Carter AFB 4bbl and the 3 × 2bbl. carburetor option. The Turbo Hydromatic TH-400 replaced the previous Buick Super Turbine two speed automatic. The 326 cu. in. V-8's remained unchanged. The 4bbl. OHC six was uprated to {{convert|215|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. Front disc brakes were a new option along with a stereo 8-track tape player and hood-mounted tachometer. All 1967 Pontiacs got GM's safety package, mandated by Federal law, which included a dual-circuit braking system, energy absorbing steering column, wheel, and interior, shoulder belt anchors, four-way hazard flashers, and a new directional signal control that could be "flicked" for lane changes.

A completely restyled Tempest was introduced for 1968 with streamlined [[Coke bottle styling]], concealed windshield wipers, and a return to horizontal headlights. Two door models rode on {{convert|112|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbases and four-door on {{convert|116|in|mm|abbr=on}}. The 230 cu. in. overhead cam sixes were enlarged to [[Pontiac straight-6 engine#250|250 cu. in.]], with horsepower ratings unchanged while the 326 V8 was replaced by a new 350&amp;nbsp;in³ V8 with horsepower ratings of 250 with two-barrel or 320 with four-barrel carb. The same lineup of models including the base Tempest, Tempest Custom and Le Mans continued as in previous years.

Other than elimination of vent windows on hardtop coupes, styling only received minor revisions for 1969, when the Tempest Custom was renamed the [[Pontiac Custom S|Custom S]] for this one year. However, model offerings were the same as 1968. A new three-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM350|Turbo Hydra-matic 350]] automatic transmission was introduced and available with all engines as an alternative to the older two-speed. Engine offerings were the same as before except for the 350 HO V8 engine gaining five-horsepower to 325. A new locking steering column with relocated ignition switch was introduced and front seat headrests became standard equipment. A new GTO option became available, ''The Judge''. Featuring special decals, two Ram Air versions of Pontiac's [[Pontiac V8 engine#400|400 engine]], and a rear spoiler, The Judge was originally conceived as a barebones muscle car based on the Tempest to compete with the new sub-$3,000 [[Plymouth Roadrunner]]; however, the plans for a new model fell through and Pontiac division head John DeLorean opted to create a GTO variant instead.

Minor styling revisions, that included a new front grille treatment, highlighted the 1970 Tempest, which would be the final year for the nameplate in the U.S. Initially, the line was down to just two- and four-door sedans but expanded at mid-year with the introduction of the low-priced T-37 hardtop coupe, billed as GM's lowest-priced hardtop coupe.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The Custom S became the Le Mans this year and the previous Le Mans series was renamed the Le Mans Sport. The Pontiac-built OHC six-cylinder engine was replaced by a [[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#250|Chevy-built 250&amp;nbsp;in³]] [[Straight-6|inline six]] while the 350 V8 was down to a two-barrel {{convert|255|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} version. New engine offerings included 400&amp;nbsp;in³ V8s rated at {{convert|265|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} with two-barrel carburetor and 8.6:1 compression ratio or 330 with four-barrel and 10.25:1 compression.

The Tempest nameplate was phased out after the 1970 model year. For 1971, it would be replaced by a new T-37 series that included each of the three bodystyles offered on the 1970 Tempest and T-37. After this year, the T-37 would be dropped and for 1972 all Pontiac intermediates took the Le Mans nameplate except the GTO.

Pontiac marketed a [[badge engineering|rebadged]] version of the compact [[GM L platform|L-body]] [[Chevrolet Corsica]] as Tempest, for Canada and Israel only, beginning in model year 1987. Discontinued in 1991, the Tempest was replaced with the [[Pontiac Grand Am|Grand Am]] sedan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Terauds|first=John|title=The Canadian Car Buyer's Survival Guide: How to Buy Or Lease the Right Vehicle at the Right Price|year=1996|publisher=Dundurn|page=109|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mm2IOpFn-h8C&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=gm%20%22L-body%22%201992&amp;pg=PA109#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1987-1991 Pontiac Tempest came in two trim levels, base (equivalent to the U.S. Corsica LT) and LE (equivalent to the U.S. Corsica LTZ) The main differences that separates the Tempest from its L-Body twin are different grille, emblems and taillights (the taillights were later adopted as the U.S. Corsica's taillights). The only other differences were wheel options, [[Daytime running lamp|DRL]]s and a metric instrument cluster. This model was also sold briefly in Israel, as there are brochures showing Canadian-spec models from 1990/1991.

The '''Pontiac Parisienne''' is a [[full-size]] [[rear-wheel drive]] vehicle that was sold by [[Pontiac]] on the [[GM B platform]] in Canada from 1958 to 1986 and in the United States from 1983 to 1986.  For most of its run, the Canadian Parisienne was nearly mechanically identical to the American [[Chevrolet Impala]]. The Parisienne wagon continued under the [[Pontiac Safari|Safari]] nameplate until 1989. ''Parisienne'' or ''La Parisienne'' means a [[Grammatical gender|grammatically female]] person or thing from [[Paris]], France.

==Differences from US Pontiacs==
[[File:1958 Pontiac Parisienne (34816351216).jpg|thumb|1958 Pontiac Parisienne Sport Coupe]]
The Parisienne entered the production lineup as a sub-series within the Laurentian line in the 1958 model year. Parisienne became a separate model in 1959.

For most of its life, the Parisienne was the Canadian nameplate for the top-of-the-line model sold in GM of Canada's Pontiac showrooms. Parisiennes were distinct from other Canadian Pontiac models by their standard features: the luxuriousness of upholstery fabrics; standard equipment such as courtesy interior and trunk lights; bright trim mouldings in the interior; distinct exterior accent chrome pieces; and availability of two- and four-door hardtops and convertibles.

In particular, Canadian "full size" Pontiacs were actually closely related to Chevrolets, making use of the economical Chevrolet chassis and drivetrain, though with the American Pontiac-styled exterior body panels (They weren't the same as U.S. Pontiac panels since they had to fit the shorter-wheelbase 119-inch Chevrolet "X" frame.  U.S. Pontiacs used a full perimeter frame.) and interior instrument panels. As Chevrolets under the skin, Canadian Pontiacs including the Parisienne used the same engines and transmissions as full-size Chevys, including the 230 and 250 cubic inch [[Straight-6|6 cylinder]] and 283, 307, 327, 350, 396, 400, 409, 427 and 454 cu inch [[V8 engine|V8]]s. These engines were mated to the same transmissions as Chevrolet, including 3 and 4 speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] and the 2 speed Powerglide and later the three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic [[automatic transmission]]s.

The first Parisienne, offered for the 1958 model year, was a super deluxe [[halo car|"halo" model]] in the Laurentian line, much like Chevrolet's Bel Air Impala of the same year. Chevrolet's Ramjet fuel injection system, introduced in 1957 in the U.S., was a Parisienne option as well. It was marketed as the "Power Chief" option, but it was identical to Chevy's Ramjet.  Also available for the first year Parisienne was Chevrolet's Turboglide automatic transmission.

Built in the same GM of Canada assembly plant in Oshawa, Ontario, Pontiacs had parallel model lineups as "full size" Chevrolets: the Pontiac "Strato Chief" had similar trim level and upholstery as Chevrolet's "Biscayne", the "Laurentian" matched the trim level of the Chevrolet "Bel Air" and while the Parisienne offered similar amenities as Chevrolet's "Impala", the Pontiac version had unique and more costly upholstery fabrics, and beginning in 1964 the "Custom Sport" (later rebadged the "2+2") two-door hardtop and convertible model line was in lock-step with Chevrolet's "Super Sport". Finally, starting in 1966 Pontiac offered the "Grande Parisienne", a two-door and four-door hardtop models parallel to Chevrolet's luxurious "Caprice," although Grande Parisiennes through 1967 used the styling of the US-market Grand Prix. Also for 1967 and 1967 a Grande Parisienne wagon was offered. Though most of its life, the Parisienne resembled the US-market Bonneville despite its Chevrolet underpinnings.

In contrast, the Pontiac Motor Division of GM in the US manufactured models with drivetrains, chassis and equipment unique from the other GM stablemates—Chevrolet, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac. Through much of the 1950s through 1970s, the American Pontiac model lineup included the "[[Pontiac Catalina|Catalina]]", "Ventura", "Executive", "Star Chief" and as the top of the line model, the "Bonneville". Additionally, unique to the US lineup until 1969 was the "Grand Prix", a distinct 2-door hardtop model with unique styling features and both luxury and "sporty" accoutrements such high output V8s, bucket seats, tachometers and flashy trim pieces.

The mix of Pontiac exterior styling on an economical Chevrolet chassis and drivetrain at a price point marginally higher than Chevrolet, was a huge marketing success for GM of Canada. For decades "full-size" Pontiacs took third place behind Chevrolet and Ford in sales, typically 70,000 plus units annually. In contrast, heavier and bulkier American Pontiacs, with far higher sticker prices and higher operating costs due to large displacement V8s requiring high octane fuel, would have little appeal in the Canadian marketplace for a number of reasons: a population base one tenth the size of the US, a less stratified society with lower disposable incomes, more prudent spending and savings sensibilities and far higher taxes and gasoline prices.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} On the manufacturing side, maintaining unique part availability for a low sales vehicle along with import-export tariffs and barriers between the U.S. and Canada would make the sale of American Pontiacs unprofitable in Canada. 
[[File:Pontiac Parisienne 1969.jpg|thumb|European version of the Parisienne]]

In 1977, GM had downsized its full-sized lineup. Pontiac continued with the Catalina and Bonneville nameplates it had used since 1973, but the cars failed to manage the sales volume of their divisional siblings and were dropped completely in 1981. However, the Bonneville name was then simply switched to the smaller G-body Pontiac (the cousin of the Chevrolet Malibu, Oldsmobile Cutlass, and Buick Regal) for 1982. Previously, those cars had been sold as the LeMans, but sales were poor and GM decided to swap nameplates on the grounds that Bonneville carried higher name recognition among customers.

With the recession of 1979–82 lifting and gas prices beginning to drop, sales of larger cars began to pick up and so Pontiac dealers began demanding the return of the full-sized B-body line. However, the assembly plants used for the Catalina/Bonneville had been converted over to other uses, thus GM had to now source Pontiac B-bodies from Canada, where the line had not been discontinued.

Even though the re-sized Bonneville was also sold in Canada, the full-size Parisienne continued for 1982, although its distinct Pontiac front- and rear-end treatments and interiors were largely replaced with Chevrolet components (described in detail below). At the request of US Pontiac dealerships who still wanted a full-size rear wheel drive car to replace the lost U.S. market share and gain back traditional Pontiac customers who longed for a large rear wheel drive car, the Parisienne was imported from [[Oshawa, Ontario]], Canada and sold in the United States beginning in the 1983 model year, retaining the model name "Parisienne" and specs from the Canadian original. Externally, it was a rebadged [[Chevrolet Impala]] (1983-84 models (and 1982 in Canada) had the Impala rear taillight panel fitted with Pontiac-spec taillight lenses, whereas the nose was borrowed from the [[Chevrolet Caprice]] fitted with a Pontiac grille). The 1985 and 1986 models resumed use of the rear-end styling from the 1980 to 1981 Bonneville. Two Parisienne ranges were sold: a base model (similar to the former Catalina and the then-current [[Oldsmobile 88|Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale]]) in four-door sedan and Safari [[station wagon]] form, and a more-luxurious Brougham four-door sedan (with velour upholstery that featured loose-pillow fitted seats). The two-door version of the 1977-81 B-bodies did not return to the US market, although it persisted in Canada through 1983.

In 1965 Pontiac Parisienne grille appeared as the Bonneville grille, with the exception of the Custom Sport grille which was taken from US 1965 Pontiac Grand Prix. Although the powertrain offerings paralleled the Chevrolet full size powertrain lineup, 1965 was an exception. The Canadian full size Pontiacs never came with a 396 in 1965 but continued with the 409 as an optional engine until the 1966 model year was introduced. 
1967 brought new styling including new grills.&lt;ref&gt;http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---October/1967-Pontiac-Parisienne-Brochure-Aus/1967-Pontiac-Parisienne-Aus--04-05{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were also new safety features, such as a collapsible steering column and dual braking system.&lt;ref&gt;http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---October/1967-Pontiac-Parisienne-Brochure-Aus/1967-Pontiac-Parisienne-Aus--10-11{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1968 model was the last model for right-hand-drive assembly in those markets as supplied by the Oshawa plant, following General Motors in the United States decision to cease all RHD exports in 1968. Nevertheless, the 1968 model continued to be locally assembled for a further year in Australia and New Zealand, and for two more years in South Africa.

For 1971, GM's new "B" and "C" bodies were the largest ever produced. During this generation, the Chevrolet engines were replaced for the first time with the same powerplants as U.S. market Pontiacs. Thus, the Pontiac 455 cubic-inch V8 was now offered as an option on all models.

The Grande Parisienne name was no longer used after 1970 and the Parisienne became the Parisienne Brougham in 1971, which was virtually the same car as the American Catalina and its 123.5 inch wheelbase.  The Canadian Laurentian model continued.

In 1971 the.Grand Ville and Bonneville models were introduced to Canada, with their 126 inch wheelbase, along with the Catalina model.

The Grand Ville had a front bench seat with a center armrest or an optional 60/40 divided seat with armrest.  The Bonneville and Parisienne Brougham had a front bench seat without an armrest.

Starting with the 1972 model year, all V8-powered Canadian Pontiacs got the Turbo Hydra-Matic as the standard transmission.  Six cylinder models (Laurentian only) got a 3-speed  manual as standard.

In 1973 all full-size Pontiac models were given a 124 inch wheelbase before being down-sized for the 1977 model-year.

While the Bonneville remained for 1976, 1975 was the last year for the Grand Ville in both the U.S. and Canada, with the Bonneville Brougham replacing the Grand Ville in 1976.

Starting in 1977, all full-size GM cars were downsized, losing hundreds of pounds in weight and featuring smaller but more trim and squarish bodies. This allowed for smaller displacement engines, which made these new cars more fuel-efficient.

Pontiac of Canada continued to offer the Parisienne in this new size. Like before, Canadian Pontiacs were virtual clones of the Chevrolet Caprice, with a slightly different grille insert, and different taillight trim. The new Pontiacs featured V6 and V8 engines.

Coupe, sedan and wagon models were available. These cars were available virtually unchanged (except for minor styling updates) through 1986.

This is the only generation of the Parisienne that was available in the United States, and assumed the full-size role when the [[Pontiac Bonneville#Seventh generation (1982–1986)|Pontiac Bonneville]] was downsized in 1982.

==Exports==
The Oshawa plant was responsible for export of Chevrolet and Pontiac vehicles to Right-hand drive markets and Pontiac Parisiennes and Laurentians were exported in [[Knock-down kit]] form to those markets until 1968. 

The '61-'64 models had the '61 Pontiac dash reversed for RHD (also shared with Chevrolets) and '65 to '68 used an adapted version of the 1965 Chevrolet Impala dash panel, again shared with Chevrolets. 

Parisiennes and Laurentians were shipped to Australia and assembled at GM's [[Holden]] plant in [[Dandenong]], Victoria until 1969, using some domestic parts such as seats, heaters, opposing windscreen wipers and 2 speed ventilation systems. Australian cars were assembled from Complete Knock-down (CKD) kits (welded and painted locally.) As red rear turn signals were illegal in Australia, Australian cars had to have amber lenses drilled into the rear bumper or trunk lid (depending on the model) with the turn signals rewired to flash through them. The 1968 model was the last RHD model to be exported internationally, hence all Australian 1969 cars are 1968 models assembled for a further year. 

Canadian Parisiennes, Laurentians, and [[Chevrolet Impala|Impalas]] were sent as Semi Knock-down (SKD) kit cars (completed body locally assembled to frame) to New Zealand and assembled at [[Holden New Zealand|GM New Zealand's]] [[Petone]] plant until 1969. As with Australia, New Zealand 1969 models are 1968 models assembled for one more year. 

Pontiac "kit cars" were also assembled by G.M. Continental, in Antwerp, Belgium&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hemmings.com/blog/article/continental-bites-the-dust/&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[General Motors South Africa]] in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. Oshawa plant assembly of RHD Chevrolets and Pontiacs ceased after 1968 at the behest of General Motors in the United States, but the last 1968 Parisienne models were assembled in South Africa well into 1970.&lt;ref&gt;https://canadianponcho.activeboard.com/t29544547/the-last-right-hand-drive-cars/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Successor==
The Parisienne still sold well when [[General Motors|GM]] decided to drop the line after the 1986 model year with no replacement. A front wheel drive model with the Bonneville name had similar dimensions versus the 1982 mid-size model, classifying the car as a [[full-size]] by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]; however, the wagon model (known just as "Safari") continued until 1989.

While the Parisienne name was retired in 1986, big Pontiac fans got a completely new, but full-sized, Bonneville for 1987. This car featured front-wheel drive and a V6 as standard, in line with the contemporary Cadillac, Buick and Oldsmobile big models. Rear-wheel drive sedans returned to the Pontiac lineup with the Holden-sourced [[Pontiac G8]] in 2008.

{{clear}}GM did retain the Parisienne name into the late 80's on exports to the Middle East which were re-badged Caprices.

The '''Pontiac Vibe''' is a [[compact car|compact]] automobile that was sold by [[Pontiac]] from 2002 to 2010. It was jointly developed by [[General Motors]] along with [[Toyota]], who manufactures the mechanically similar [[Toyota Matrix]]. Manufactured by the Toyota-GM joint venture [[NUMMI]] in [[Fremont, California]], the Vibe succeeded the [[Geo Prizm|Chevrolet Prizm]] in production at NUMMI and like the Prizm, it was derived from the [[Toyota Corolla]], making it the last of the GM and Toyota developed [[GM S platform|S-body]] cars.

From 2002 to 2004, a rebadged [[Right- and left-hand traffic#Terminology|right-hand drive]] variant of the Vibe was exported as the [[Toyota Voltz]] to the [[Japanese domestic market]]. The Voltz was not popular in Japan and discontinued after two model years.

Production of the Vibe ended in 2009 with the discontinuation of the Pontiac brand and the closing of NUMMI under the [[General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization]]. Its twin, the Toyota Matrix, was in production for another three years for the American market and four years for the Canadian market, as the Matrix was manufactured by [[Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada]] in [[Cambridge, Ontario]], and was unaffected by NUMMI closing down operation.

[[File:2003 Pontiac Vibe (First Generation) rear 4.6.18.jpg|thumb|left|Pre-facelift Pontiac Vibe]]

The 2003–2006 Vibe was available in an economical base trim, an [[Front-engine, four-wheel-drive layout|AWD]] mid-trim, and the more powerful GT sport trim.

Powertrains available for this car are a Toyota-built 1.8&amp;nbsp;[[Liter|L]] [[Inline-four engine|straight-4]] [[Multi-valve|16-valve]] engine producing {{Convert|126|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} on the base model ([[Manual transmission|manual]] or [[automatic transmission]]), 118&amp;nbsp;[[Horsepower|hp]] on the [[all-wheel drive]] model (automatic only), or a version with [[VVT-i|VVTL-i]] producing {{Convert|164|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the GT (manual 6-speed only). The Vibe was at one time the most fuel efficient vehicle sold by GM in [[North America]], but ceased to be the case with the revised [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] testing procedures in 2008.

Although the Vibe and Matrix are similar designs, the two brands actually use several different components, which are brand-specific, for their heating and air conditioning systems. These components include the air conditioning compressor and related hoses, the heater hoses, the heater core, and the serpentine belt.

There were some minor changes between model years. The Vibe was first produced in 2002 and went on sale as a 2003 model. Power ratings for the first three model years were slightly higher, with the GT up to {{Convert|180|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, the base model rated at {{Convert|130|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, and the all-wheel drive model rated at {{Convert|123|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Engine power claims were decreased for 2006 as a result of Toyota's re-testing of its [[Internal combustion engine|engines]] for the new [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE) ratings standard. The GT and all-wheel-drive trims were discontinued for the 2007 model year due to poor sales and new federal emissions standards.

[[File:2007 Pontiac Vibe -- NHTSA.jpg|thumb|left|2007 Pontiac Vibe]]

The front fascia was freshened in the 2005 model year. In an attempt to 'converge' the [[Pontiac]] look, the front grille was restyled to resemble the look of the [[Pontiac Solstice]], also adopted by other vehicles in the Pontiac line.  The 2003-2004 Vibes had a front grille more closely resembling the discontinued [[Pontiac Aztek]].

First generation Vibe/Matrix/Corolla odometers do not have the ability to "roll over" 299,999&amp;nbsp;km or 299,999&amp;nbsp;mi.  No recall or "fix" is currently available for this.  Mileage must be kept track of manually until a solution is found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wheels.ca/news/odometer-dies-at-299999-km/|title=Odometer Dies at 299,999 km|website=wheels.ca|date=October 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toyota Voltz===

The Vibe was also produced in right-hand drive configuration and exported to the Japanese market as the Toyota Voltz from 2002 to 2004.

The Vibe was redesigned, along with the Matrix, for the 2009 model year, and debuted at the December 2007 [[LA Auto Show]]. 
First deliveries to dealerships were posted on GM's Website in April 2008, with comments that initial sales were brisk. The first units were delivered to buyers in early March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press|publisher=GM |url=http://archives.media.gm.com/servlet/GatewayServlet?target=http://image.emerald.gm.com/gmnews/viewmonthlyreleasedetail.do?domain=6&amp;docid=44734 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120701174849/http://archives.media.gm.com/servlet/GatewayServlet?target=http://image.emerald.gm.com/gmnews/viewmonthlyreleasedetail.do%3Fdomain=6&amp;docid=44734 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 1, 2012 |title=GM Reports 282,732 Deliveries in March; 805,720 In First Quarter |date=April 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The new Vibe's design is sporty yet completely functional," according to Ron Aselton, chief designer. "Clean lines, minimal overhangs and wheels pushed to the corners give the vehicle a muscular stance."

The GT trim and [[four-wheel drive|AWD]] options return, and two new [[inline-four engine]]s (Toyota's 2.4 litre [[Toyota AZ engine|2AZ-FE]] was also used on the [[Toyota Camry|Camry]] for the AWD and GT trims as well as optional on the base trim, and a new 1.8 litre [[Toyota ZR engine|2ZR-FE]] standard on the base trim) are offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2007/10/09/leaked-2009-pontiac-vibe/ |title=&lt;s&gt;Leaked&lt;/s&gt; Officially Official: 2009 Pontiac Vibe GT |publisher= Autoblog |first=Alex |last=Nuñez |date=October 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also Pontiac's last new model and remained as the brand's only remaining car for the 2010 model year. GM ceased Vibe's production in August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/gm-to-end-pontiac-vibe-production-in-august/ |title=G.M. to End Pontiac Vibe Production in August |first=Jerry |last=Garrett |work=The New York Times |date=June 23, 2009 |access-date=June 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second generation FWD Vibes also offer computerized traction-control and anti-lock brakes. Rear disc brakes are standard on all models. Luggage racks are no longer standard order. Power outputs of the two engines are {{convert|132|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|158|hp|kW|abbr=on}} respectively.

The Vibe offers {{convert|91.4|cuft}} of passenger volume (all seats up) and {{convert|20.1|cuft}} of cargo volume, for a total of {{convert|111.5|cuft}} with rear seats that fold completely flat. The cargo area is {{convert|30|in}} high and {{convert|40|in}} wide, which is large enough to accommodate a standard-sized, North American washing machine or clothes dryer with enough extra room for an appliance dolly.

== Discontinuation ==
On April 27, 2009, GM announced the discontinuation of Vibe production, as well as all other Pontiac models, by the end of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ray|last=Wert|date=April 27, 2009|title=Pontiac Vibe, Solstice Are Dead, Won't Live On As Chevys|url=http://jalopnik.com/5229396/pontiac-vibe-solstice-are-dead-wont-live-on-as-chevys|publisher=[[Jalopnik.com]]|accessdate=April 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later announced that Vibe production would end in August 2009, and the last Vibe left the assembly line on August 17, 2009, according to a source at genvibe.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Frank|last=Wert|date=June 18, 2009|title=Bye-Bye Vibe|url=http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/bye-bye-vibe/|publisher=[[The Truth About Cars]]|accessdate=June 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This left Toyota with a major problem as they had to scramble to relocate some of the tooling that was jointly used to produce the Matrix in another factory.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

GM did not initially produce a compact hatchback to succeed the Pontiac Vibe, choosing to bracket it with the [[Chevrolet Sonic]] hatchback and [[Buick Encore]] small crossover.  In Canada, GM followed the Vibe with the larger [[Chevrolet Orlando]] [[compact MPV]], which replaced the [[Chevrolet HHR]].  Chevrolet introduced a hatchback version of the [[Chevrolet Cruze]] to North America in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/2016-chevy-cruze-will-also-be-available-as-hatchback-in-u-s/ |title=2016 Chevy Cruze Will Also Be Available as a Hatchback in U.S. |first=Joe |last=Lorio

== Recalls ==
In January 2010, [[Autoblog (website)|Autoblog.com]] reported that the 2009 and 2010 model year Pontiac Vibes are also included in the [[2009–2010 Toyota vehicle recalls]] related to unintended acceleration due to shared components with the Toyota Matrix.&lt;ref name="pontiac.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pontiac.com/fileDownload.do?filename=/content/en/PDF/Pontiac_Vibe_Safety.pdf|title=GM Statement on Pontiac Vibe Recalls|accessdate=April 2, 2010|work=pontiac.com|format=PDF|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715103914/http://www.pontiac.com/fileDownload.do?filename=%2Fcontent%2Fen%2FPDF%2FPontiac_Vibe_Safety.pdf|archivedate=July 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another recall for the Vibe was issued in the Fall of 2009 due to floormat interference with the accelerator pedals. This is also part of the Toyota recall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2010/01/25/dont-forget-me-pontiac-vibe-also-included-in-toyota-recall/ Don't Forget Me! Pontiac Vibe also included in Toyota recall] January 25, 2010, Web site accessed January 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://detnews.com/article/20100130/AUTO01/1300318/Pedal-complaints-reach-recalled-Vibes Pedal complaints reach recalled Vibes] ''Detroit News''.{{Dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 26, 2010, another recall was issued for 2005 to 2008 model year Vibes, equipped with the 1ZZ-FE engine and two-wheel drive. The recall notices states that an improperly manufactured Engine Control Module (ECM) can develop a crack in its circuitry, potentially causing the "Check Engine" light to illuminate, harsh shifting, and stalling and/or failure of the engine to start.

In mid October 2014 the Vibe along with the Saab 9-2x was recalled due to the faulty [[Takata airbag]]s supplied from the large airbag supplier company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gmtakataairbag.com/product/public/us/en/takata_recall/home.html|title=The Takata Airbag Safety Recall and How it Affects Your General Motors Vehicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is undetermined how many Vibes have been recalled.

The '''Pontiac Grand Am''' is a [[mid-size car]] and later a [[compact car]] that was produced by [[Pontiac]]. The history of Grand Am starts with Pontiac executives noting incursion into the US market by Mercedes and BMW. Notably, the American sports car was usually without luxury features and the luxury car without sport features. Foreign makes mixed these features. Pontiac hybridized the Trans Am with the Grand Prix to create the Grand Am. Built on the A-body platform, the intended GTO body was re-badged and fitted with the Grand Prix interior. As the 1973 was produced, OPEC levied an oil embargo to the USA. This resulted in a dichotomy of buyers: total luxury or total economy. Since Grand Am was a “in-betweener “, its sales died and it was discontinued in 1975. The Grand Am had two separate three-year runs in the 1970s: from 1973 to 1975, and again from 1978 to 1980. It was based on the [[GM A platform (RWD)|GM A platform]]. Production of the Grand Am was canceled in 1980 when it was replaced by the [[Pontiac 6000]]. The Grand Am was reintroduced in 1985 when it replaced the [[Pontiac Phoenix]]. It became Pontiac's best selling car and was later replaced by the [[Pontiac G6]], so named as it was intended to be the 6th generation of the Grand Am.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://car-reviews.automobile.com/Pontiac/review/2005-pontiac-g6/4704/ |title=2005 Pontiac G6 |publisher=automobile.com |first=Jim |last=McCraw |date=2007-09-25 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071113095315/http://car-reviews.automobile.com/Pontiac/review/2005-pontiac-g6/4704/ |archivedate=2007-11-13 |accessdate=2014-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All 1973–1975 Grand Ams were built in [[Pontiac, Michigan]] at Pontiac's main assembly plant. The 1978-1980 Grand Ams were built in [[Pontiac, Michigan]] at Pontiac's main assembly plant and in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] at GMAD Lakewood. All Grand Ams between 1985 and 2005 were built in [[Lansing, Michigan]] at the [[Lansing Car Assembly]].

The original Grand Am was introduced in the fall of 1972 as a 1973 model. It was based on the [[GM A platform]] (A-body) along with other cars such as the [[Chevrolet Chevelle]], [[Pontiac LeMans]], [[Pontiac GTO]], [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]], and the [[Buick Century]]. The GM A-body platform had major design revisions in 1973 that included the elimination of pillarless hardtops due to proposed Federal rollover standards, but with frameless windows similar to that of a hardtop. No convertibles were produced due to the rollover standards (that never were enacted). In addition to Federal emissions regulations, new safety standards required a {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} impact-resistant front bumper and a {{convert|2.5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} impact-resistant rear bumper, which increased to {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} for 1974.

===1973===
[[File:'73 Pontiac Grand Am.jpg|thumb|left|1973 Grand Am]]
The Grand Am, coined by Pontiac with a name derived from two other cars in its lineup ("Grand" signifying "Grand Prix luxury" and "Am" for "Trans Am performance") was designed as America's answer to European luxury/sport sedans and available as a four-door Colonnade [[sedan (car)|sedan]] or a two-door Colonnade [[coupe]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vorderman |first=Don |year=1973 |title=Pontiac's Great Grand Am: Get One Quick Before They Change It! |journal=Automobile Quarterly | volume=11 |issue=2 – Second Quarter |pages=146–153|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 43,136 Grand Ams were built during the first year of production (both two-door and four-door models).

The Grand Am could be had with a standard 2-bbl {{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine]] with single exhaust producing {{convert|170|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, an optional 4-bbl version of this engine with single exhaust producing {{convert|200|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} that was only available with a 4-speed manual transmission, an optional 4-bbl version of this engine with dual exhaust producing {{convert|230|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, or an optional 4-bbl {{convert|455|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} with dual exhaust {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. Availability of {{convert|310|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} Super Duty version of the 4-bbl 455 V8 did not materialize.{{Sfn|Vorderman|1973|p=151}} The engine displacement, expressed in liters, was displayed on the bootlid in an effort to accentuate the car's supposedly European character.

All engines were available with a [[Turbo-hydramatic]] 400 automatic transmission as standard equipment. A 4-speed manual transmission was available with the 400/4-bbl engine in 1973 and 1974, but this was not popular.

The 1973 Pontiac Grand Am style had a unique flexible urethane front fascia center nose (known as the 'Endura' nose) that was squeezable and could return to its original shape following a minor collision&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1974%20Pontiac/1974_Pontiac_Grand_Am_Folder/1974%20Pontiac%20Grand%20Am%20Folder-04.html |title=1974 Pontiac Grand Am Folder |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Vorderman|1973|p=148}} along with the new energy-absorbing bumpers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/new/120311/1973%20Pontiac%20Grand%20Am/1973%20Pontiac%20Grand%20Am-06.html |title=1973 Pontiac Grand Am brochure |page=6 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1973-1975-pontiac-grand-am.htm |title=1973 Pontiac Grand Am Development |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=2007-09-13 |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; a total of six grille openings with vertical bars, round front turn signals with a cross-hair design, horizontal rear tail lights, and chrome rear bumper. Additionally, Grand Ams featured a Radial Tuned Suspension (RTS) as standard equipment that included radial-ply tires, Pliacell shock absorbers, and front and rear sway bars. The springs were advertised as being computer selected.&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2007"/&gt; The Grand Am was one of only three GM cars to have standard radial tires and appropriate suspension tuning in 1973, with the others being the Oldsmobile Cutlass Salon and Chevrolet Monte Carlo S.

The Grand Am included Strato bucket seats upholstered in [[Naugahyde]] vinyl or corduroy cloth featuring manual recliners and adjustable lumbar supports - both features common on European-style sports/luxury sedans, but unusual for American cars of that time. Also included were an instrument panel from the [[Pontiac Grand Prix]] featuring a Rally gauge cluster with fuel, oil, water and volt gauges (a tachometer or fuel economy gauge was optional, and on cars so equipped, the clock was moved to a space on the lower instrument panel under the radio), three-spoke padded steering wheel with brushed-stainless spokes, and Genuine Crossfire African Mahogany trim on the dash facing, radio and clock surrounds, as well as the center console between the front seats.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite magazine | magazine=Popular Mechanics |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=e9QDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=pontiac+grand+am |title=To Pontiac, it's a 'European GT,' but do owners agree? |first=Michael |last=Lamm |pages=50–52D |date=March 1973 |volume=139 |number=3 |accessdate=November 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1946"&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975 |publisher=Krause Publications |isbn=0-87341-027-0 |editor-last=Gunnell |editor-first=John A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grand Ams also were among the first U.S.-built cars with a turn-signal mounted headlight dimmer switch that had been common on imported cars for decades.{{Sfn|Vorderman|1973|p=152}} Other standard equipment included concealed windshield wipers, a {{convert|1.12|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} front stabilizer bar, and an in-the-windshield radio antenna.&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2007"/&gt; Upscale options included air conditioning, tinted glass, power windows-locks-seat, rear defogger, various sound systems, and tilt-steering-wheel. AM/FM stereo with a tape player was optional.&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2007"/&gt;

Pontiac also produced a single 1973 Grand Am station wagon as a feasibility study. This was a LeMans wagon converted to a Grand Am. A functional ram-air induction system was developed for the Pontiac A-bodies utilizing twin [[NACA]] openings in the hood, but the option was dropped due to inability to pass federally mandated drive-by noise standards. A few functional Ram Air systems were sold over the counter. The twin-scoop NACA hood was an option for any Pontiac A-body for all three years, but was non-functional.

In a ''Popular Mechanics'' Owners survey, 67% rated the build quality as good to excellent and 79% liked the handling.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; However, 22.1% disliked the fuel economy.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

===1974===
[[File:1974 Pontiac Grand Am two-door Hardtop in red, rear right.jpg|thumb|1974 Grand Am hardtop, rear]]
Described as "The mid-sized Pontiac with Foreign Intrigue ... American Ingenuity" on the front cover of the four-page 1974 Grand Am brochure that featured a green four-door sedan, only minor styling changes highlighted this year's model including a redesigned nose and grille with 12 openings with horizontal bars.&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2007"/&gt; The 1974 Grand Am's rear-end styling was redesigned for the new 5&amp;nbsp;mph crash standards and had vertical rear taillights with relocated license plate and fuel filler above the bumper. Engine and transmission offerings were the same as 1973, but four-speed manual transmissions were no longer offered in California, where only the Turbo Hydra-matic automatic was available. Inside, the genuine African crossfire mahogany trim on the instrument panel was replaced by a simulated material due to delamination problems on the 1973 models but the real wood was continued on the center console, optional console clock, and radio bezel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1974%20Pontiac/1974_Pontiac_Grand_Am_Folder/1974%20Pontiac%20Grand%20Am%20Folder-04.html |title=1974 Pontiac Grand Am folder |page=4 |website=oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=November 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engine choices were {{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} 2-barrel single exhaust producing {{convert|190|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, 400 cubic inch 4-barrel single exhaust producing {{convert|200|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, 400 cubic inch 4-barrel dual exhaust producing {{convert|225|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, and 455 cubic inch 4-barrel dual exhaust producing {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.

Sales were down more than 50 percent due to the [[1973 oil crisis]], and while the recession continued, prices increased for all 1974 model cars. Only 17,083 Grand Ams were built.

{{clear-left}}

===1975===
The 1975 Grand Am looked the same as the 1974 model, but had vertical front grille bars, a body-colored rear bumper, and a [[catalytic converter]] single-exhaust, which mandated the use of unleaded fuel, along with GM's High Energy Ignition and other items promoted as part of Pontiac's maximum mileage system.&lt;ref name="Spontiac"&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of Pontiac, 1926-2002 |edition=2nd |first1=John |last1=Gunnell |first2=Ron |last2=Kowalke | ref=GunKow |publisher=Krause Publications |location=Iola, WI |page=132 |date=2012 |isbn=978-1-4402-3234-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the standard roofline with louvered rear side windows, Grand Am coupes with the optional vinyl roof could be ordered with a full triangular rear side window or a vertical opera window similar to that found on the Grand Prix.

Inside, the Strato bucket seats received revised vertical trim patterns, the adjustable lumbar support controls were dropped, and only the passenger seat had a recliner, a "safety practice" which would continue at GM for a decade. New this year as a no-cost option was a 60/40 bench seat with center armrest.

Engines were also detuned to meet the [[Vehicle emissions control#History|1975 emission regulations]] with the [[compression ratio]] dropping to a new low of 7.6 to 1 on some engines. Standard was the {{convert|170|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with two-barrel [[carburetor]], optional were a {{convert|185|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 400, or a {{convert|200|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|455|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} - both with four-barrel carburetors. Turbo Hydra-matic was standard equipment and the only transmission offered this year. Performance from 0-60 was 7.7 seconds.&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2007"/&gt;

A total of 10,679 Grand Ams were built in 1975&lt;ref name="autogenerated1946"/&gt; and the series was dropped after this year due to declining sales and rising gas prices as a result of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. Also a factor leading to the Grand Am's cancellation, were plans for all 1976 Pontiac A-body cars receiving the newly approved rectangular headlights, which would necessitate a complete redesign of the Grand Am's Endura nose and Pontiac officials decided that the expense of such a redesign could not be justified based on low production numbers. The basic GM A-body design remained until 1977.

===1978===
The Grand Am returned for 1978 based on the Grand Prix's G platform, downsized from the previous generation, and offered in both two- and four-door models featuring a vertical bar grille and other trimmings to differentiate it from the LeMans, upon which it was based. Like the 1973-75 models, this generation of Grand Ams also featured standard radial tires plus an upgraded Radial Tuned Suspension with front and rear sway bars. Interiors were similar to the Grand LeMans with either a standard notchback bench seat, optional 60/40 bench or Strato bucket seats with console and recliner on passenger side, an optional tachometer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1978%20Pontiac/album/1978%20Pontiac-13.html |title=1978 Pontiac brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=2012-05-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510162940/http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1978%20Pontiac/album/1978%20Pontiac-13.html |archivedate=2013-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a choice of either cloth or Morrokide vinyl upholstery.

Standard equipment included power steering, power front disc brakes, Turbo Hydra-matic transmission, full instrumentation and Pontiac's {{convert|301|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine with two-barrel carburetor producing {{convert|140|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. Optional was a 4-bbl {{convert|155|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} version, along with numerous extra cost items such as snowflake wheels, whitewall or white-lettered tires, power windows and seats, tilt steering wheel, sunroof, and cruise control.

In California, where more stringent emission regulations made Pontiac V8 engines unavailable since 1977, Chevrolet V8 engines were substituted including a standard {{convert|135|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|305|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with two-barrel carburetor or optional four-barrel version with {{convert|145|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.

===1979===
Very few changes were made for 1979 other than the normal trim revisions and the demotion of the standard powertrain to a Buick {{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V6 and floor-mounted three-speed manual transmission as standard equipment. The 301 V8, rated at {{convert|135|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hotrod.com/articles/hppp-0710-1979-pontiac-grand-am/&lt;/ref&gt; with a two-barrel carburetor or {{convert|150|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} with four-barrel, and Turbo Hydra-matic transmission were now optional. In terms of appearance, the only difference was that the park/signal and marker lenses were changed to amber ones.&lt;ref name=pont155&gt;[[#GunKow|Gunnell and Kowalke]], p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

New for 1979 was a four-speed manual available with the 150-horsepower 301 four-barrel in 49 states. In California, only an automatic transmission was available and engine offerings included the standard Buick {{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V6 engine with two-barrel carburetor and {{convert|115|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} or optional Chevrolet 305 V8 rated at {{convert|160|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} with four-barrel carb.

The woodgrained instrument panel was replaced by brushed aluminum trim, while the gauge faces changed from silver with black letters and numbers to black with white letters and numbers. The same seating choices in either cloth or Morrokide trims were offered including the standard notchback bench seat, or optional 60/40 bench or Strato bucket seats with console. An AM/FM CB radio combo was available and a heated rear window was optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World Cars 1979|publisher=Herald Books|isbn=0-910714-11-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, the Grand Am was featured in the [[NASCAR]] [[NEXTEL Cup|Grand National]] circuit.

===1980===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}

The year 1980 was the finale for the second-generation Grand Am. The four-door sedan was dropped, leaving only the two-door coupe, which received only minor appearance changes. Strato bucket seats in cloth or Morrokide upholstery were standard equipment along with a center console with floor shifter for the Turbo Hydra-matic transmission.

The V6 engine, two-barrel V8s and manual transmissions were dropped leaving the four-barrel Pontiac 301 V8 with {{convert|170|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} the only engine offered in 49 states or, in California, the {{convert|160|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} Chevrolet 305 V8. Slow sales of the Grand Am led to its discontinuation after the 1980 model year.

In the first year of the NASCAR Busch Series (1982) the championship was won by Jack Ingram, in a 1980 Grand Am.

For the 1985 model year, Pontiac reused the Grand Am name for a new compact car to replace the aging and unpopular [[Pontiac Phoenix|Phoenix]] (based on GM's [[GM X platform (FWD)|X Body]]) using the new-for-1985 [[GM N platform|N Body]]. The Grand Am shared the same front-wheel drive platform as the [[Buick Somerset]] (renamed [[Buick Skylark|Skylark]] in 1987) and the [[Oldsmobile Calais]]. Initially, the Grand Am was available in base or LE trim in coupes only. The 2.5 L [[GM Iron Duke engine#Tech IV|Tech IV]] was standard, while a 3.0 L [[Buick V6]] was optional. A 5-speed manual was standard, and a 3-speed automatic was optional, the latter required if the V6 engine was ordered. In 1986, a sedan and sportier SE trim were added. The SE trim had the V6 engine standard, lower body cladding, composite headlamps, a slightly revised interior with different cloth used on all seats and door panel inserts, analogue instrumentation (base and LE models had digital), and came standard with 14" aluminum wheels.

[[File:1991 Pontiac Grand Am.jpg|thumb|left|1991 sedan]]

1987 models brought more power to the base engine, and a [[Family II engine#LT3|new Turbocharged four-cylinder engine]] taken from the Sunbird GT. The [[Family II engine#LT3|2.0L turbo engine]] became the base engine for the SE model for 1987. If one were to get the turbo engine, then the turbo boost gauge would take the place of the voltmeter. Popular Mechanics did the quarter-mile with the Turbo engine and five-speed manual in 15.73 seconds and the automatic transmission 16.02 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=euMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=pontiac+grand+am |journal=Popular Mechanics |title=Freewheeling |date=November 1987 |page=47 |first=Joe |last=Oldham |volume=164 |issue=11 |accessdate=November 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; They noted large amounts of torque steer from a dead stop. This was also the last year that the Buick sourced 3.0 L engine would be available in the Grand Am, as it was discontinued in mid-1987. New for styling were composite front headlights, but only on the LE models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1987%20Pontiac/1987%20Pontiac%20Brochure/1987%20Pontiac-09.html |title=1987 Pontiac album |page=9 |website=oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=November 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1988, front seat belts were moved from the [[Pillar (car)|b-pillars]] to the doors, to meet the passive restraint mandate for 1989. The [[GM Quad-4 engine#LD2|Quad-4 ''LD2'']] engine became available for Grand Am's in 1988, replacing the previous model years 3.0L V6 on the options list. It is worth noting that 'Sport buckets' borrowed from the Trans Am GTA, were added to the option list this year for SE's. Other options included a Driver Information Center, electronic trunk release, and a moon roof. The base model was dropped after this model year.

The 2.3L 'LD2' Quad 4 replaced the [[Family II engine#LT3|2.0L Turbo engine]] as standard equipment in the SE midway through the year. This was the final year that the 'Sport Bucket' seats were available to SE's.

The 2.3&amp;nbsp;L ''LG0'' Quad 4 was announced as being available late in the model year on Grand Am SE's; in fact this was a limited run car, of which only 200 were built.&lt;ref name=pont207&gt;[[#GunKow|Gunnell and Kowalke]], p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; All 1989 ''LG0'' Quad&amp;nbsp;4 Grand Am's were red on grey coupes, with standard appointments including (but not limited to) 16" machined face wheels. The 16" wheels were only optional to SE's. This would be the first year that the Grand Am could be ordered with either 16" wheels, or a factory installed CD player.

NHSTA safety ratings for frontal crashes are as follows: Driver: 3-stars; Passenger: 4-stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.safecarguide.com/mak/pontiac/idx.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106111339/http://www.safecarguide.com/mak/pontiac/idx.htm |archive-date=2010-01-06 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes were minor for 1990 and 1991; &lt;br /&gt;
For 1990, a new High-Output version of the Quad 4 (mated to only a 5-speed manual) became the standard engine for the SE (opting for the automatic transmission changed the engine to the less powerful ''LD2'' Quad&amp;nbsp;4). The 16" wheels moved from the option list to standard equipment for the SE's this year. The LE gained a 'Sport Performance Package' (RPO: W32) late in the 1990 model year run. The W32 option included SE ground effects (minus wheel well flares), the same standard (as well as optional) "SE" drive train, 14" aluminum wheels, a larger front larger sway bar and a rear swaybar that were only otherwise available on the SE model.&lt;br /&gt;
For the most part, the final year of this body style was essentially a carry over year. The only changes were the addition of an Anti-lock Brakes System (ABS) as standard equipment for all Grand Am SE's (not available to LE's), and all 1991 model year cars received a redesigned "short throw" shifter (if opted with a five-speed transmission).

The Grand Am was redesigned for 1992.

For 1992 the Grand Am's chassis was widened to match the Corsica's; the suspension and braking systems are about eighty percent in common.&lt;ref&gt;Padgett, Martin, Jr. "Pontiac Grand Am SE", in ''Car and Driver'', January 1992, p.109.&lt;/ref&gt; On the SE, an [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS VI) was available.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Padgett, p.109.&lt;/ref&gt;  It also received new body work and a revised interior. A V6 option returned in the form of the {{convert|160|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 3.3&amp;nbsp;L 3300 V6, mated to a three-speed transmission.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  The 2.3 inline four came as either a SOHC or DOHC. A high output version of the DOHC was offered as well. A new GT trim was offered that featured sportier wheels, smoother, yet larger cladding, and more standard equipment.

1993 brought further refinement to the Quad 4. This resulted in a loss of {{convert|5|hp}} to all engines. In 1994, the V6 and standard 3-speed powertrain were effectively replaced by GM's new [[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#L82|3.1 L 3100]] series V6 engine and new 4-speed automatic transmission. A driver's side airbag also became standard for '94, but the door-mounted automatic seatbelts remained. In 1995, the Quad 4 engines received balance shafts, and a direct driven power steering off the intake camshaft. The four-speed automatic that was mated to the 3.1 in '94 became optional as a step-up from the three-speed for '95 on the new Quad 4 engine.

For 1996, the Grand Am received a mid-generation facelift. Outside, an updated front fascia, rear fascia,and side skirts gave the Grand Am a smoother, more rounded look. The interior was redesigned and featured dual airbags, easier to use audio system and HVAC controls, and softer plastics. The Quad 4 was replaced by a new 'Twin Cam' 2.4 L DOHC (Dual Over Head Cam) four-cylinder engine. Still based on the Quad 4, this was a re-engineered version of the previous year's 2.3 L with SFI fuel injection. The new engine made {{convert|155|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque at lower rpm than the older 2.3 L.  The 3.1 L V6 remained optional. The 3-speed automatic was dropped for 1996, and the 4-speed automatic featured standard traction control. Daytime running lamps with automatic lighting control were newly standard on all Grand Ams. 1997 models featured standard air conditioning. The Grand Am was redesigned for 1999.

Available in late spring 1998, the basic design of the fifth-generation Grand Am was shared with the [[Oldsmobile Alero]] (also new for 1999) and [[Chevrolet Malibu]] (introduced in 1996). The length was shortened slightly, but the wheelbase grew by more than three inches (76&amp;nbsp;mm). The suspension was now fully independent, with a revised MacPherson-Strut design up front. The rear suspension is a more refined Multi-link design. The new Grand Am was offered in five trim levels: SE, SE1, SE2, GT, and GT1. The 2.4&amp;nbsp;L Twin Cam engine was carried over, with {{convert|150|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|155|lb·ft|N·m|0|abbr=on}} of torque. GM's 3400 V6, previously exclusive to their minivans, became available as an option on the SE and SE1, and was standard on all other trim levels. For 1999, all the Grand Ams featured a four-speed automatic transmission. The GT and GT1 also included 4-wheel disc brakes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandayum.com/grand-am-information.html |title=Pontiac Grand Am Information |publisher=Grandayum.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all Grand Ams until 2003 included standard ABS and Traction Control (made optional on SE from 2003). The GTs also had a Ram Air induction system, providing an extra five horsepower and 5&amp;nbsp;lb/ft of torque over the 3.4&amp;nbsp;L V6 when installed in any of the SE-level trims. The 2000 models added a Getrag five-speed manual transmission as standard equipment with the four-cylinder. On GT models, the badge on the front fenders now read "RamAir V6", instead of "V6H.O." on 1999 GT's. ASC Creative Services designed the Grand Am SC/T for the SEMA show circuit, which was the concept design for the Ram Air hood and body package. The SC/T later became an appearance package, beginning in 2003. A road test by ''Car and Driver'' showed a 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph time of 7.7 seconds in a GT sedan with an automatic.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopedia of American Cars"/&gt;

For 2001, the SE2 trim level was dropped, a new family of Delco stereos and new wheel designs was introduced. The radio size in 2001 also changed from a 1.5 DIN size to a full 2 DIN size.  Half way through 2002, the Twin Cam 2.4&amp;nbsp;L engine was replaced by a new 2.2&amp;nbsp;L [[GM Ecotec engine|''Ecotec'']] four-cylinder, which had improvements over the engine it replaced, but produced less output; {{convert|140|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|150|lb·ft|N·m|0|abbr=on}} of torque. Changes for 2002 also included a stationary cup holder in the center console as opposed to a removable one.

The body cladding on SE models was removed in 2003, a change which affected other models throughout Pontiac. Anti-Lock Brakes and Traction Control were made optional on the SE in 2003 as well. An MP3 player was added to the uplevel CD player in 2004. In 2005, Pontiac began phasing out the Grand Am lineup for the new G6  replacement. SE sedans were retained for fleet sale and GT coupes were the last Grand Am model available for public sale.

The final Grand Am rolled off the line at Lansing Michigan's, Lansing Car Assembly plant on May 10, 2005, shortly before the Lake Orion, Michigan plant began assembling G6 coupes. This was also the last car to be made at Lansing's old Fisher Body plant.

The '''Pontiac Aztek''' is a [[mid-size]] [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover]] marketed by General Motors from model years 2001 to 2005, along with its corporate cousin, the [[Buick Rendezvous]].

As a 4-door crossover with a front engine and four-wheel drive, the Aztek featured a four-speed automatic transmission with a V-6 engine. Marketed by [[Pontiac]] as a "sport recreational vehicle,"  the Aztek used a shortened [[automobile platform|platform]] shared with GM's minivans (e.g., the [[Pontiac Montana]]) featuring 94 cubic feet of cargo room with its rear seats removed.  The design employed conventional rear swing-open [[kammback]] rather than sliding doors and a bi-parting rear tailgate, the lower section formed with seat indentations and cupholders. Other features included a front center console that doubled as a removable cooler, rear stereo controls in the cargo area, a sliding cargo floor with grocery compartments and an available camping package with an attachable tent. 

The Aztek was initially poorly received by the public, owing to its poor styling, and it has appeared on several "worst-of" lists concerning automobiles. It has, however, seen a resurgence in popularity and public interest in recent years due to its association with the TV series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' as the car driven by main protagonist [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]]. When filming ended in 2013, one of the Azteks used in filming, which was wrecked and undrivable, sold at auction for US$7,800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://autos.yahoo.com/blogs/motoramic/walter-white-pontiac-aztek-menace-driveway-breaking-bad-143741331.html |title=Walter White's Pontiac Aztek can menace your driveway in "Breaking Bad" prop auction |author=Justin Hyde |publisher=Motoramic - Yahoo Autos |date=Sep 20, 2013 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://screenbid.auctionserver.net/view-auctions/catalog/id/6/lot/50/?url=%2Fview-auctions%2Fcatalog%2Fid%2F6%2F%3Fpage%3D2%26sort%3D5%26dir%3D1 |title=Lot 20 of 514: Walter White's 'Breaking Bad' Aztek |publisher=ScreenBid LLC |date=2013-09-29 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original concept==
First shown to the public in 1999, the Pontiac Aztek [[concept car]] was well received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pontiac Aztek 2000-2005|publisher=autoevolution|url=http://www.autoevolution.com/cars/pontiac-aztek-2000.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured "Xtreme" futuristic styling and promised maximum versatility in support of a young and active lifestyle for its intended "[[Generation X]]" buyer demographic.

The Pontiac Aztek went on sale in summer 2000 as a 2001 model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000304112829/http://www.pontiac.com:80/aztek/index.html|title=Aztek Home Page|date=March 4, 2000|website=web.archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production edition of the Aztek was launched with the tagline "Quite possibly the most versatile vehicle on the planet" in conjunction with [[CBS]]'s hit game show ''[[Survivor (US TV series)|Survivor]]'' in 2000.&lt;ref name="cbs.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Survivor recap: Season 2, Episode 13|publisher=CBS|url=http://www.cbs.com/primetime/survivor/recaps/213/recaps.php?season=2|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018095815/http://www.cbs.com/primetime/survivor/recaps/213/recaps.php?season=2|archivedate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styling==
[[File:Aztek1.JPG|thumb|left]]
[[File:Pontiac Aztek IMG 20180408 125542.jpg|thumb|left]]
The Aztek was styled under the direction of Tom Peters, who would later design the [[Chevrolet Corvette (C7)]].&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;{{cite web | title = 2014 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray Convertible
  | publisher =Tellmenews.com, April 11, 2013, Sharon Wagner

  | url =http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2000-12-17/gms-aztek-born-to-be-a-little-too-wild}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an analysis in 2000, ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' said the Aztek was to signal a design renaissance for GM,&lt;ref name="Peters3" /&gt; and to "make a statement about breaking from GM's instinct for caution."&lt;ref name="Peters3" /&gt; One designer said that during the design process, the Aztek was made "aggressive for the sake of being aggressive."&lt;ref name="Peters3" /&gt; Peters, the Chief Designer said "we wanted to do a bold, in-your-face vehicle that wasn't for everybody."&lt;ref name="Peters3" /&gt; The 2000 Business Week study said the Aztek was "the first awkward step toward innovation by a company that has avoided that path," likening "the debacle to Ford's remodeling of its [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|1996 Taurus sedan]]."&lt;ref name="Peters3" /&gt; The front of the vehicle seems to be an attempt at reviving an appearance Pontiac used in the 1970s with the [[Pontiac GTO#1971|Pontiac GTO]], and was a shared appearance with the [[Pontiac Grand Am#1992–1998|Grand Am]].

Ultimately, the Aztek was criticized for its styling. [[Mickey Kaus]] described the Aztek as having "awkwardly empty and square front wheel wells" and a "gratuitous, fierce animalistic snout, which may have been what prompted incoming GM executive [[Bob Lutz (businessman)|Bob Lutz]] to famously say that many of the company's products looked like 'angry kitchen appliances.'"&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Advance to the Rear
  | publisher =Slate
  | url =http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/gearbox/2003/05/advance_to_the_rear_2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  James Hall, vice-president at  AutoPacific Inc&lt;ref name="Peters3"/&gt; ranked the Aztek as one of the ten ugliest cars of all time, Karl Brauer, CEO and editor-in-chief of TotalCarScore.com said the Aztek featured "atrocious proportions wrapped in plastic body cladding," and "looked like a station wagon stretched out by a car bomb."&lt;ref name="brauer"&gt;{{cite web

A poll in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in August 2008 placed the Aztek at number one of the "100 ugliest cars" of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 100 Ugliest Cars|work=The Daily Telegraph |date= August 25, 2008|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/main.jhtml?xml=/motoring/2008/08/29/mfcars5.xml&amp;page=2 | location=London | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;   An article by [[Edmunds.com]] placed the car first of the "100 Worst Cars of All Time" not only because of its styling but also because it "destroyed an 84-year-old automaker."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=100 Worst Cars of All Time|work=Edmunds.com|date=December 12, 2011 |url= http://www.edmunds.com/car-reviews/features/100-worst-cars-of-all-time.html|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[TIME Magazine|Time]]'' magazine in 2007 named the Aztek one of the 50 worst cars of all time (adding that underneath "was a useful, competent crossover"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 50 Worst Cars of All Time|work=Time|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1658545_1658544_1658540,00.html | date=September 7, 2007 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2010 as one of the 50 worst inventions of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 50 Worst Inventions|work=Time|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1991915_1991909_1991765,00.html | date=May 27, 2010 | accessdate=May 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology and notable features==
The Aztek was produced at General Motors' [[Ramos Arizpe]], Mexico, assembly plant, where it shared an assembly line with the [[Buick Rendezvous]].  In Canada, it filled the gap left since the [[Chevrolet Tracker (Americas)|Sunrunner]]'s discontinuation in 1997, while in the US and Mexico it was the first Pontiac-badged SUV ever sold. At launch, the Aztek was available with either [[front-wheel drive]] or Versatrak, a full-time, fully automatic [[all-wheel drive]] system which provided traction in the snow or rain and could handle moderately rough off-road surfaces.

The Aztek was one of the first automobiles to be designed entirely using computerized rapid-prototyping/rapid-visualization tools.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The dashboard was designed by [[Johnson Controls]], and featured Pontiac's trademark red lighting scheme along with an optional [[heads-up display]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press |agency= Johnson Controls |date= August 7, 2000 |title= Versatile Features in Pontiac Aztek Interior Reflect Johnson Controls' Outstanding Capabilities | publisher= PRNewsWire| url= http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/08-07-2000/0001284297&amp;EDATE=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aztek was able to carry within its interior a standard {{convert|4|ft|m}} by {{convert|8|ft|m}} sheet of [[plywood]] and was available with two rear cargo area options: a pull-out cargo tray that held up to {{convert|400|lb}} that rolled on built-in wheels when removed from the vehicle, or a versatile [[cargo net]] system that held up to {{convert|200|lb}} and could be configured (a claimed) 22 different ways. Options included a center console that doubled as a removable cooler and a tent/inflatable mattress package that, along with a built-in [[air compressor]], allowed the Aztek to double as a [[Campervan|camper]]. Extending this image was a seat-back mounted [[backpacks|backpack]], and a number of specialty racks for [[bicycle]]s, [[canoe]]s, [[snowboard]]s, and other such items. An optional 10 speaker [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]] stereo system provided a set of controls located at the rear of the vehicle for tail-gate parties as well as an unusual 2-piece tailgate with built-in cup-holders and contoured seating area for added comfort.

==Safety==
The [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS) gave the Aztek a ''Marginal'' overall score in the frontal offset test.  However, they did not conduct a side-impact test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pontiac Aztek|publisher=IIHS-HLDI|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/ratingsbyseries.aspx?id=286|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404031133/http://www.iihs.org/ratings/ratingsbyseries.aspx?id=286|archivedate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Praise and criticism==
GM forecast sales of up to 75,000 Azteks per year and needed to produce 30,000 annually to break even. Just 27,793 were sold in 2002, which was the model's best-selling year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2003 Pontiac Aztek |first=Jim |last= Flammang |date=February 10, 2003|publisher=Cars.com|url=http://www.cars.com/go/crp/research.jsp?section=reviews&amp;crpPage=reviews.jsp&amp;makeid=40&amp;modelid=4810&amp;year=2003&amp;myid=&amp;acode=&amp;mode=&amp;aff=national}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pricing of the Aztek was also an issue at launch: the vehicle was too expensive for its intended "[[Generation X]]" audience and was priced significantly higher than competing vehicles. After the 2001 model year, the GT model was dropped and pricing was slashed, in addition to extremely generous rebates and cut-rate financing instituted by GM in the wake of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The Aztek had among the highest [[American Customer Satisfaction Index|CSI]] (Customer Satisfaction Index) scores in its class, and won the appellation of "Most Appealing Entry Sport Utility Vehicle" in 2001 from [[J.D. Power and Associates]], an independent consumer survey organization which noted: "The Aztek scores highest or second highest in every APEAL component measure except exterior styling."

Matthew DeBord of ''The Big Money'' argued that despite its poor reviews and sales, the Aztek was the car that, in the long run, could save GM. He praised GM for being daring and trying to create an entirely new market in vehicles, rather than simply copying successful formulas. He argued that the Aztek's failure is similar to the failure of the [[Apple Newton|Apple's Newton]] and [[Mac Portable]] – two failed products that revolutionized the computer industry and became the basis for later successful products made by Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Montezuma's Aztek Revenge |author=Matthew DeBord |date=November 17, 2009 |work=The Big Money |url=http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/judgments/2009/11/17/montezuma-s-aztek-revenge |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118152245/http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/judgments/2009/11/17/montezuma-s-aztek-revenge |archivedate=November 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aztek's "Design by Committee" was criticized in [[Steve McConnell]]'s [[software design]] book, ''[[Code Complete|Code Complete 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000321.html The Pontiac Aztek and the Perils of Design by Committee], ''[[Coding Horror]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In its final model year, the Aztek gained hands-free operation of its [[On-Star]] system. Exterior color offerings also changed.

The Aztek was discontinued after the 2005 model year, and was replaced by the [[GM Theta platform|''Theta'' platform]] [[Pontiac Torrent]]. The Aztek's production line in [[Ramos Arizpe]], Mexico, was retooled to build the [[Chevrolet HHR]], although Buick Rendezvous production continued for another two years.  The last Pontiac Aztek finally rolled off the assembly line on August 31, 2005.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The '''Pontiac Safari''' is a [[station wagon]] that was produced by [[Pontiac]]. The Safari name was first applied to Pontiac's version of the 2-door [[Chevrolet Nomad]] station wagon.  The body style, originally exhibited as a 1954 [[Chevrolet Corvette]] Motorama concept car, was shifted to [[Chevrolet]] and Pontiac full-size 1955 production vehicles because of the perceived greater sales potential.

During its run, the Safari would be sold as its own station wagon model as well as a designation applied to Pontiac's various other station wagon vehicles. The name "[[safari]]" is derived from the [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word ''safari'', which means ''journey,'' originally from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] سفر (safar) meaning ''a journey''; the verb for "to travel" in Swahili is ''kusafiri''.

===1955===
The 1955 Safari was built using the [[Pontiac Chieftain]], and shared body components with the [[Chevrolet Nomad]] station wagon, which would also allow both divisions to share in the tooling costs for the special bodied wagons. The Safari was fitted with Pontiac's unique front-end bumper/grille assembly and sheet metal and rear tail light design, both created by Pontiac stylist Paul Gillan. Gillan received a United States patent for the bumper/grille design.

The Safari featured sport-coupe front doors, extra chrome adorning the tailgate and interior, and sliding rear-seat windows.  Like the Nomad, the [[B-pillar|"B"]] pillar of the station wagon was raked forward, a flourish not shared with other GM two-door station wagons from that era.

Interior trim, upholstery and bright work were equal to Pontiac's top line [[Pontiac Star Chief|Star Chief]] range of models, however the Safari was actually the only model in the '''Star Chief Custom''' (Series 27). Production of the 1955 Safari stood at a model year production of 3,760, making it the lowest production Pontiac for 1955.

===1956===
[[File:1956 Pontiac Star Chief Custom Safari.jpg|thumb|left|1956 Pontiac Star Chief Custom Safari 2-door station wagon]]
With its unique body style only a year old, Pontiac limited changes to the Safari to match those of the 1956 Star Chief.  Again as in 1955, the Safari was the only model in the Star Chief Custom series (27). Sales of the Safari improved slightly for 1956, with 4,042 vehicles produced; still the lowest production Pontiac for 1956.

===1957===
[[File:1957 Pontiac Star Chief Custom Safari.jpg|thumb|right|1957 Pontiac Star Chief Custom Safari 2-door station wagon]]
For 1957, Pontiac applied the Safari nameplate to all of its station wagons in all of its product lines (Chieftain, Super Chief and Star Chief Custom).

While the high-trim unique two-door body style was still available, Pontiac added a four-door high-trim version to the Star Chief Custom series mid-year which was named '''Safari Transcontinental'''.  This half year series featured special exterior trim to set it apart from other Pontiac station wagons.  Despite only being on the market for the last half of the 1957 model year, the '''Safari Transcontinental''' outsold the special-bodied two-door Safari 1,894 to 1,292.

At the end of its three-year run, the specially bodied two-door sport wagon sold only 9,094 vehicles compared to the Chevrolet Nomad which sold 20,092 copies in its three-year run.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:GMClamShellRgate.jpg|thumb|150px| Instructional image demonstrating GM's 1971 "Hide-A-Way" tailgate design on a 1971 Pontiac Safari [[station wagon]] ]] --&gt;
General Motors discontinued its unique sport wagon body at the end of the 1957 model year, and henceforth, all full-size station wagon models produced by Pontiac would be named for their series, and as Safaris.  While a two-door Safari was fielded in 1958 in Pontiac's Chieftain range, it shared its body with Chevrolet's price leader [[Chevrolet Delray|Delray]] station wagon.  Both models came with few features and were popular with tradespeople and small businesses.

Many Pontiac models fielded Safari labeled variants including the Astre, Bonneville, Catalina, Executive, Grand Ville (Grand Safari), LeMans/Grand LeMans, Parisienne, 6000, Sunbird, and Tempest.

For 1966 Pontiac dropped the Safari name on the full sized B-body, Catalina and Bonneville, and named them only as station wagon. For 1967 the Safari name plate returned for the new Executive wagon, which were placed between Catalina and Bonneville in range. Catalina and Bonneville continued to have the station wagon label only. 

The Safari name was also used on the 1975-77 Astre 2 door wagon and the 1978-79 Sunbird Sport Safari 2 door wagon which were derived from the GM H-body platform

The last Pontiac to carry the Safari name alone was the late 1980s station wagon version of the full-size [[Pontiac Parisienne|Parisienne]].  After Parisienne sedans were discontinued in 1986, the station wagon continued on for three more model years renamed and sold as simply Safari.

1989 was the last year Safari was sold as its own Pontiac model but not the last year the Safari name was used.  The 1991 [[Pontiac 6000|6000]] station wagon, sold as the Pontiac 6000 LE Safari, was Pontiac’s last model to carry a Safari designation.   Also, [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] continued to use the Safari name for its [[minivan]] model through 2005.

==1971–1978 Grand Safari==
{{Main|Pontiac Grand Safari}}
[[File:1974 Pontiac Grand Safari.jpg|thumb|left|1974 Pontiac Grand Safari]]
The Grand Safari was Pontiac's top-of-the-line full-size station wagon offered from 1971 to 1978. The Grand Safari used the grille and interior trim of the Bonneville and Grand Ville passenger car series, and most (but not all) examples were trimmed with woodgrain paneling on the sides and tailgate.

The 1971 to 1976 models were the largest Pontiacs ever built. The 1971-76 GM full-size bodies, at 64.3" front shoulder room and 63.4" rear shoulder room set a record for interior width that would not be matched by any car until the full-size GM rear-wheel drive models of the early to mid-1990s. The Grand Safari wagons, as did other GM full-sized wagons during these years, used a unique rear suspension with multi-leaf springs instead of the coil springs used on other full-sized Pontiacs, and other full-sized GM cars. The Grand Safari wagons also featured a new '[[Station wagon#Tailgate evolution|Clamshell]]' tailgate design where the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof as the tailgate (manually or with power assist), slid into a recess under the cargo floor. The power tailgate, the first in station wagon history, ultimately supplanted the manual tailgate, which required marked effort to lift from storage. It was operated by switches on the instrument panel or a key switch on the rear quarter panel. The Clamshell system, heavy and complex, made it easier to load and unload the extremely long wagons in tight spaces. But it remained un-adopted by any other manufacturer, and would be eliminated when GM reduced the length of their wagons by about a foot in 1977, and the overriding concern became increased fuel economy.

The 1971-76 Grand Safaris, shared their {{convert|127.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase with the [[Buick]] and [[Oldsmobile]] [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] cars but were designated as B-body models. At {{convert|231.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} in length the 1974-76 Grand Safaris are the longest Pontiacs ever built. And at {{convert|5112|lb|kg|abbr=on}} shipping weight, or about {{convert|5300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} curb weight, the three-seat 1974 Grand Safari wagons are easily the heaviest Pontiacs ever built.

These wagons ran with [[V8 engine|V8]] engines of either 400 or 455 cubic inches.

The 1977 Grand Safari was downsized considerably, with wheelbase cut to 115.9 inches, length to less than 18 feet and weight to just over 4,000 pounds. These wagons thus could run with smaller engines, either a standard 301 or optional 403 [[V8 engine|V8]]; a 350 V8 was additionally offered on 1978 models. Replacing the Glide-Away Tailgate was a three-way tailgate not unlike that used on Ford station wagons. In 1979, the Grand Safari's name was changed to Bonneville Safari.

==Discontinuation of the Safari==
[[File:1980s Pontiac Safari.jpg|thumb|left|250px|1989 Pontiac Safari]]
In 1989 the Safari model was discontinued due to the decreasing popularity of [[full-size]] [[station wagon]]s. Pontiac was rather late to come to this decision, as [[Chrysler]] produced its last full-size station wagon in 1977. [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] discontinued its [[Ford Country Squire|Country Squire]] and [[Mercury Colony Park]] wagons in 1991. The other GM wagons were the last to go with the [[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]] being discontinued after the 1992 model year, and finally the [[Chevrolet Caprice|Chevrolet Caprice Wagon]] and the [[Buick Roadmaster|Buick Roadmaster Estate Wagon]] being discontinued in 1996. The Safari name lived on with the [[Chevrolet Astro|GMC Safari]] minivan, which largely served the same demographic as the Pontiac Safari. In 1990, the passenger and cargo space of the Safari was replaced largely by the [[Pontiac Trans Sport]], their first minivan.

The '''Pontiac G6''' is a [[mid-size car]] that was produced by [[General Motors]] under the [[Pontiac]] brand. It was introduced in 2004 for the 2005 model year to replace the [[Pontiac Grand Am|Grand Am]]. The car was built on the [[GM Epsilon platform]] which it shared with the [[Chevrolet Malibu]] and [[Saab 9-3]] along with other General Motors vehicles. Features included a remote starting system (standard on GT, optional on base model), traction control/ABS, [[electronic stability control]], automatic headlights as well as a panoramic sunroof option. Production ended in 2010 with the [[General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization|discontinuation of the Pontiac line]].

Its name derives from being the successor to the [[Pontiac Grand Am]], and serves as the "sixth generation" of the Grand Am, hence G6.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pontiac Grand Am#cite note-1]]&lt;/ref&gt; The name change from Grand Am to G6 also served as a standard for most future models. For example, the [[Pontiac G8]] was a class above the G6, while the [[Pontiac G5]] was a class below.  The nomenclature also hearkens back to the [[Pontiac 6000]], another midsize car.

==Overview==
[[File:Pontiac G6 GTP VoF1.jpg|thumb|left|Pontiac G6 GTP sedan]]
[[File:2009.5 Pontiac G6 coupe -- 07-09-2009.jpg|thumb|left|Pontiac G6 coupe]]
[[File:PontiacG62006DartmouthDash.jpg|thumb|left|Interior]]
The Pontiac G6 was first introduced at the 2003 [[North American International Auto Show]] as a concept car. The concept used a {{nowrap|3.5 L}} supercharged V6 that made 285 horsepower and 272&amp;nbsp;lb ft of torque mated to a 4T65-E electronically controlled automatic transmission. When the G6 was introduced in 2005, it had two trim levels, base "V6" and sportier "GT". Both trims, however, used a {{nowrap|3.5 L}} pushrod V6 producing {{convert|200|hp|kW|lk=on}} and {{nowrap|220 lb&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;·ft}} {{nowrap|(300 N·m)}} of torque. Matched to a four-speed [[automatic transmission]], the GT featured TAPshift, where the driver could select the gears manually.

Base models were well equipped, featuring power locks, windows and mirrors with keyless entry, six-speaker CD stereo, power drivers seat, air conditioning and split folding rear seat. GTs added an eight-speaker Monsoon stereo, premium cloth seats with six-way adjustment, remote start, ABS and traction control.

In 2006, the G6 added two new trim levels and two new bodystyles, a coupe and a [[Retractable hardtop|retractable hard top convertible]]. The new trim levels were a new base four-cylinder trim (sometimes referred to as "SE"), and the high performance "GTP". Coupes and convertibles were available in GT and GTP trims only. The new base model used a 169-horsepower, {{nowrap|2.4 L}} DOHC [[inline-4]], mated to a four-speed automatic transmission. The {{nowrap|3.5 L}} V6 was now part of a sport-package on the base/SE, and remained standard on the GT. The new GTP used a {{nowrap|3.9 L}} version of the GT's {{nowrap|3.5 L}} V6, but also utilizes [[variable valve timing]] (VVT), increasing output to 240 horsepower. A four-speed automatic transmission was standard, but for no cost, a six-speed manual transmission was available. The GTP convertible was not available with the manual transmission and reduced its power to {{nowrap|227 hp}}, due to a more restrictive exhaust system. The GTP also featured standard electronic stability control.

The 2007 G6 saw more engine changes, and standard side torso and side curtain airbags (actually introduced late in the 2006 model year) were new. The GT now featured VVT on its {{nowrap|3.5 L}} V6, raising power from {{nowrap|200 hp}} to {{nowrap|224 hp}}. The {{nowrap|3.9 L}} [[V6]] became an option on the GT, producing 227 horsepower in automatic transmission form and 240 horsepower in [[manual transmission]] form. The GTP was given a new {{nowrap|3.6 L}} DOHC V6 with 24 valves and VVT, producing 252 horsepower at 6300 RPM. It is mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. Midway through the model year the six-speed manual was dropped with the {{nowrap|3.9 L}}, along with its 240-horsepower output. The GTP convertible was also discontinued. For 2008, the GTP became the GXP with more dramatic styling cues, and the {{nowrap|3.9 L}} engine became an exclusive convertible option, with horsepower down to 222. SAE ratings also dropped the horsepower ratings on the {{nowrap|2.4 L}} and {{nowrap|3.5 L}} models to {{nowrap|164 hp}} and {{nowrap|219 hp}} ({{nowrap|217 hp}} on convertibles), respectively. 

For 2009, 2.4 L four-cylinder engines were added to the coupe lineup. An all new 6 speed automatic transmission, which debuted on the [[Chevrolet Malibu]], became optional on 4 cylinder models. GM revised the G6 in the middle of 2009, creating a "2009.5" model year. Changes consisted of a revised front and rear fascia as well as a revision of the dashboard, most notably adding an updated radio with [[Bluetooth]] capability.  Coupes and convertibles ceased production at the end of the 2009 model year, making examples with the 2009.5 changes fairly rare. Subsequent to this model's introduction, General Motors entered bankruptcy, and announced that the G6 sedan would be discontinued in 2010. Most other Pontiac models had been discontinued, but the G6 was in high-demand for fleet vehicle orders, facilitating production to continue while the brand was wound down. In 2010, the G6 had white back-lit dashboard lights instead of the traditional red, Pontiac color scheme.

GM began marketing the [[Buick]] brand in [[Mexico]] to replace [[Pontiac]] after the 2009 model year, GM replaced the Pontiac G6 competitively with the [[Buick Regal]], and later in the [[United States]] &amp; [[Canada]], the G6 &amp; the [[Saturn Aura]] were ultimately replaced by GM's revived [[Buick Regal]] nameplate. The convertible Pontiac G6 was later replaced by the [[Opel Cascada]], marketed as a Buick in the U.S. in early 2016.

==Safety==
The [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] gave the Pontiac G6 an overall ''Good'' score in the frontal offset crash test&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=564|title=IIHS-HLDI: Pontiac G6|publisher=Iihs.org|date=2008-11-25|accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; but an ''Acceptable'' score in the side impact crash test even though side airbags were introduced late in the 2006 model year. The lower side impact score was due in part to a marginal rating for the structure/safety cage category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=957|title=IIHS-HLDI: Pontiac G6|publisher=Iihs.org|date=2008-11-25|accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2005 GXP concept==
The 2005 GXP concept was built by General Motors Performance Division. It includes a {{nowrap|3.6 L}} HO VVTI V6 engine rated at {{Convert|275|hp|0|abbr=on}}, F40 six-speed manual transmission, performance intake, GM Performance cat-back exhaust with bright tips, and 19-inch wheels with Bridgestone Potenza RE040 255 series tires. It was unveiled at the [[SEMA Show#2004|2004 SEMA Show]], and was later sold on the eBay Motors website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Joseph |first=Noah |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/04/30/ebay-finds-of-the-day-pontiac-vibe-gt-r-and-g6-gxp-sema-showcar/ |title=eBay Finds of the Day: Pontiac Vibe GT-R and G6 GXP SEMA showcars |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=2009-04-30 |accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The auction ended on May 3, 2009 with winning bid price of {{nowrap|{{US$}}{{gaps|16|500.00}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem=&amp;item=130302605109|title=http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=1303026…|date=21 January 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
The launch of the G6 was a major [[publicity stunt]]: 276 of the cars were given away to audience members of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' on the [[talk show]]'s fall 2004 season premiere. This promotion, alongside a reported US$110 million publicity campaign, attempted to garner national attention for the brand-new G6.

On September 12, 2014, ''Autoblog'' did a follow up on the individuals who won the vehicle on the tenth anniversary of the telecast. The winners interviewed learned that although they did "get a car" from Winfrey during the broadcast, in actuality they had to go to the Pontiac dealership in their area to pick up the G6 because the vehicles that were shown outside the studio's parking lot were used as a promotion. One couple had to sell their G6s because they learned of tax implications that came with owning the car, while another kept hers even though her two friends who came with her to the taping no longer have theirs (one was sold, another was totaled in an accident) and hopes to give the G6 to her daughter in time for college, saying "I'm hoping to drive it until we can't drive it any more."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2014/09/12/oprah-free-car-giveaway-10-years-later-featured/ "Looking back at Oprah's free-car giveaway 10 years later"] From Autoblog (September 12, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motorsports==

The G6 was used in the GT class of [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] as a replacement for the [[Pontiac GTO|Pontiac GTO.R]] after the GTO went out of production. The cars are referred to as ''GXP.R''s and built by GM's endorsed chassis constructor, [[Pratt &amp; Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seriouswheels.com/cars/top-2008-Pontiac-G6-GXP-R.htm |title=2008 Pontiac G6 GXP.R press release |publisher=Seriouswheels.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is powered by LS2 [[V8 engine|V8]] engine that produces approximately {{convert|450|hp|kW}}. Weight saving features include carbon fiber body panels, shatter-resistant polycarbonate windows. The custom tube-frame chassis is not at all based on the road car's chassis and the 6-speed gearbox delivers power to the rear wheels. The front and rear fenders flared to cover the wide, 18-inch wheels and class-spec Hoosier racing tires. A rear wing reminiscent of sports option package on the race car is fitted at the back, underneath the proper racing rear wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auto-power-girl.com/cars-2007/pontiac-specifications/pontiac_gxp_r-1504 |title=Pontiac GXP.R review: |publisher=Auto-power-girl.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The G6 GXP also races in the [[NHRA]] [[Powerade]] Drag Racing Series Pro Stock class for Warren Johnson Racing.

==Recalls==

There have been four NHTSA formal recalls for the Pontiac G6.

The first recall (NHTSA Campaign 06V417000) was for Pontiac G6 cars with aftermarket seat upgrades. To expedite sales at some dealerships, GM authorized seats to be replaced with leather seats as a dealer-installed option. This change could cause the passenger air bag sensor to not detect an occupant. GM took the rare step of buying back any cars that had this dealer installed option.

The second recall (NHTSA Campaign 09V036000) affected 8,012 MY 2005-2006 G6 vehicles, and corrected a potential corrosion that affected brake light wiring, and could cause brake lights to not illuminate.

On September 21, 2012, General Motors recalled 473,841 vehicles involving the [[Chevy Malibu]], Pontiac G6 and [[Saturn Aura]] from model years 2007 through 2010 equipped with four-speed automatic transmissions. The problem is a condition that could make cars roll when in park. The recall affects 426,240 in the United States, 40,029 in Canada and 7,572 in other markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klayman|first=Ben|title=GM recalls nearly 474,000 cars over gear shift problem|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/21/us-gm-usrecall-idUSBRE88K0II20120921|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This recall is an expansion of a much smaller 2011 recall on certain 2009/2009.5 MY vehicles which experienced the same condition. GM expanded the recall in 2012 after finding the problem was not isolated to that model year.

In 2014 GM has recalled the vehicle regarding a condition in which the transmission shift cable may fracture.  The fracture prevents the driver from selecting gears and may cause the vehicle to move in an unintended direction.

The '''Pontiac Star Chief''' is an [[automobile]] model which was manufactured by [[Pontiac]] between 1954 and 1966. It was Pontiac's top trim package on the [[Pontiac Chieftain]], with later generations built on longer wheelbases, and serving as the foundation platform for the [[Pontiac Bonneville]]. The car was easily identified by its chrome star trim along its sides, a feature all Star Chiefs were equipped.

Between 1954 and 1957, the '''Star Chief''' was Pontiac's prestige model and was based on the [[Pontiac Chieftain]]. When the storyline of ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' pointed towards a [[Hollywood]] setting in the 1954-1955 season, the characters "drove" (in episode 110, "California Here We Come") to the West Coast in a 1955 Star Chief convertible, that in the previous episode "Lucy Learns to Drive" was "bumped together" with a 1922 [[Cadillac Type V-63]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45Cq47ToLg4 1922 Cadillac Lucille Ball]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, Pontiac also introduced air conditioning with all the components under the hood, a first for the price range.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; Seat belts were added as options in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975|publisher=krause publications|isbn=0-87341-027-0|editor=Gunnell, John A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Star Chief was available in Deluxe and pricier Custom trim, with the top trim level hardtop called the [[Pontiac Catalina|Catalina]].

Prior to the introduction of the Star Chief, all Pontiacs had shared the modest wheelbase of the Chevrolet since the beginning of Pontiac.  The introduction of this new premier model in 1954 was the first application of the longer 123.5 inch (313.7&amp;nbsp;cm) wheelbase of the junior Oldsmobiles and Buicks to the Pontiac division. The car was still on the A platform, but with {{convert|11|in|cm|abbr=on}} added towards the rear of the frame.&lt;ref name="Spontiac"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Standard Catalog of Pontiac, 1926-1995 | first = John | last = Gunnell | first2 = Ron | last2 = Kowalke | ref = GunKow | publisher = Krause Publications, Inc | location = Iola, WI | page = 63 | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-87341-369-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Power the first year came from Pontiac's venerable straight eight engine, with the six-cylinder not available.

Along with an all-new body, the straight-eight was superseded by the new V-8 power in 1955.&lt;ref name=GK64&gt;[[#GunKow|Gunnell and Kowalke]], p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Typical for the 1955 Pontiacs is the design with two wide "Silver Streaks" running the length of the hood. The hood ornament “Indian” was amber plastic that lit up when the headlights were turned on.  Also for 1955, the new Star Chief [[Pontiac Safari|Safari]] two door hardtop wagon, which was similar to [[Chevrolet]]'s [[Chevrolet Bel Air|Bel Air]] Nomad, was introduced, shared with the [[Pontiac Chieftain]]. This variant lasted through 1957; after that the Safari name was used for all of the division's standard four door wagons. The Safari was introduced on January 31, 1955, over three months behind the rest of the 1955s.

[[File:Pontiac Star Chief 1957 4.jpg|thumb|left|1957 Pontiac Star Chief]] 
The Safari was not quite part of the Star Chief line, as it sat on the shorter Chieftain {{Convert|122|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase. It was officially part of the "27 series", whereas the longer Star Chief received the "28 series" designation.&lt;ref name=GK64/&gt; In January 1957, some time after the rest of the new models, the four-door "Custom Safari Transcontinental" was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;[[#GunKow|Gunnell and Kowalke]], pp. 67-68&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1956 the design was lightly revised, with heavier looking bumpers and a vertical slash on the front door above the swage line. In 1957, the high performance '''[[Pontiac Bonneville|Star Chief Custom Bonneville]]''' was introduced as part of its divisional head's push to raise the marque out of the doldrums. The silver streaks running down the hood were dropped for the new "Star Flight" design. All gauges were placed in an oval on the dash and the side trim had a missile-shaped spear behind the front door.

In 1958, the [[Pontiac Bonneville|Bonneville]] was first given its own position in the Pontiac lineup as the ultimate Pontiac, and was only available as a two-door [[hardtop]] and two-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]. While no longer Pontiac's prestige model, the Star Chief remained a well-appointed car, and the division's finest four door hardtops and sedans. The 1958 Star Chief, as with the rest of the Pontiac lineup, received all-new bodywork and an updated chassis. The body was considerably longer and lower, and featured a new honeycomb grille design and twin headlamps.&lt;ref name=GK70&gt;[[#GunKow|Gunnell and Kowalke]], p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; The sedans and coupé models all shared the longer 124&amp;nbsp;inch wheelbase, while the Custom Safari model remained on a chassis two inches shorter, shared with the lesser [[Pontiac Chieftain|Chieftain]].&lt;ref name=GK70/&gt; In spite of the new bodywork, sales of the 1958 Star Chief dropped precipitously; down by around 60% while Pontiac's overall sales dropped by more than a third.

[[File:1958 Pontiac Star Chief Custom Safari.jpg|thumb|left|1958 Star Chief Custom Safari (model 2793&amp;nbsp;SD)]]
The engine was updated from the {{convert|347|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} unit used in 1957 to a slightly bored out {{convert|370|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} version. Power only increased marginally, to {{convert|255|hp|kW|abbr=on}} for the manual version, while the most powerful "PM" option was now up to {{convert|330|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[#GunKow|Gunnell and Kowalke]], p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, when the Bonneville gained a full range of body styles, the Star Chief was limited to sedans and hardtops, while the Bonneville and the new [[Pontiac Catalina|Catalina]] models received the lion's share of Pontiac's attention in the marketplace. In 1959, the Star Chief made 17.97% of Pontiac sales.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; This was also the first year of the "wide-track" Pontiacs.

In 1960, the new [[Pontiac Ventura|Ventura]] was introduced, and the Star Chief was thereafter limited to four door sedans and hardtops.  This was a novel, but unsuccessful approach. The Star Chief was equipped and powered in a manner similar to the lower-priced, slightly smaller [[Pontiac Catalina|Catalina]] series. The Ventura was more lavishly equipped in the manner of the high-line [[Pontiac Bonneville|Bonneville]], but was available with only two doors and rode the [[Pontiac Catalina|Catalina]]'s slightly shorter wheelbase. This gave sedan buyers of modest means a larger choice than Catalina for only slightly more money, and gave upscale coupe buyers a lighter, sprightlier alternative to the big Bonneville. The Ventura lasted only through 1961, and was replaced by the even sportier new [[Pontiac Grand Prix|Grand Prix]]. The Star Chief continued to be available only with four doors through the end of production.  Compared to the Catalina, the Star Chief was equipped only very slightly more lavishly; the major additional interior feature was the electric clock.

For 1962, Pontiac offered a {{convert|421|cid|l|0|abbr=on}} Super Duty V8 with two four-barrel carburetors, rated at {{convert|405|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, as a US$2,250 option (when the base Star Chief listed at US$3,097).&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960-1972'' (Jefferson, NC:  McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), pp.191 &amp; 193.&lt;/ref&gt;  A rare option, it was probably never ordered on this somewhat heavy sedan.  As in the other Pontiac series, the 4-door [[hardtop]] was designated the Star Chief Vista.  Bonneville taillights and the three chrome stars on each side continued to distinguish the car from the Catalina.  The stars were located either on the roof or rear fender, depending on year.  No wagons were offered.  All [[Pontiac Safari|Safari]] wagons during this period (including the Bonneville Safari) rode the four and a half inch shorter wheelbase shared by [[Chevrolet]] and Catalina.  This made a Star Chief Safari too redundant to bother with.

For 1966, the car was renamed the '''Star Chief Executive''' as the first step towards retiring the name, which by the mid-1960s had become dated. For 1967, Pontiac dropped the Star Chief name for United States sales and renamed the mid-priced model the [[Pontiac Executive|Executive]].

In [[Canada]], Pontiac models used Chevrolet drivelines for greater economy.  To ensure that used car buyers in the U.S. were not sold less expensive Canadian models, different series names were used.  The Canadian equivalent to the Star Chief was called Laurentian.  Nonetheless, Pontiac offered a similarly-named series called the Strato Chief, but this model was the lowest-priced big Canadian Pontiac.

The '''Pontiac Executive''' is an automobile model that was produced by [[Pontiac]] from 1967 to 1970. 

The Executive name replaced Pontiac's long running mid-range [[Pontiac Star Chief|Star Chief]], beginning for 1966 when all Pontiacs in this range were named '''Star Chief Executive''' for this one year only, before the series became simply the Executive for 1967. 

Executives featured more deluxe trim, more standard amenities and a longer wheelbase and overall length than the lower-priced [[Pontiac Catalina|Catalina]] models, but were not quite as luxurious as the top-line [[Pontiac Bonneville|Bonneville]], whose wheelbase and other dimensions the Executive shared. 

Mechanically, the Executive was virtually identical to the Catalina, sharing similar standard and optional V8 engines starting with the base 400&amp;nbsp;CID V8 with two-barrel carburetor rated at {{Convert|265|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, and ending with a 390&amp;nbsp;hp 428&amp;nbsp;CID HO V8 through 1969 and a larger 455&amp;nbsp;CID V8 rated at {{Convert|370|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in 1970. The standard transmission each year was a three-speed manual with column shift, with a floor-mounted four-speed with [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] shifter optional in 1967 and 1968. However, 98 percent of Executives were equipped with the three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic during the model's four-year run. 

Executives were available as a four-door pillared sedan, two-door hardtop coupe, four-door hardtop sedan, and [[Pontiac Safari|Safari]] [[station wagons]] in two and three-seat versions. The Executive Safari wagons differed from the Catalina and Bonneville Safari wagons by featuring simulated wood paneling. No Executive convertibles were offered.

Total output of the Executive was: 
*1967: 35,491 units
*1968: 32,597 units
*1969: 25,845 units
*1970: 21,936 units

Through its four years, the Executive was the lowest-volume full-size Pontiac. It was replaced for 1971 by the newly downgraded [[Pontiac Bonneville|Bonneville]].

The '''Pontiac Ventura''' is an automobile that was produced by [[Pontiac]]. The name was derived from [[Ventura, California]]. Until 1992, [[General Motors]] had an assembly plant that manufactured [[GM X platform (RWD)|X-body]] models in the district of [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles]] at [[Van Nuys Assembly]].

The Ventura was first introduced for 1960 as a new higher priced model on Pontiac's standard [[full-size]] 122-inch [[GM B platform|B-body]] wheelbase, shared with the [[Pontiac Catalina]]. It was available as the Vista (a four-door [[hardtop]]) and the Sports Coupe (a two-door hardtop).&lt;ref&gt;[http://storm.oldcarmanualproject.com/pontiac19602.htm 1960 Pontiac brochure, storm.oldcarmanualproject.com] Retrieved 19 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt; It had unique exterior identification, deluxe wheel covers, a sport steering wheel, and distinctive tri-tone seats done in "Morrokide" (Pontiac's leather-like vinyl upholstery). 

The Ventura continued for 1961 as a series, but for 1962 through 1965, it was a custom trim option on the [[Pontiac Catalina|Catalina]]. It returned as a series for 1966, continuing through 1969. Once again for 1970, it was a custom trim option on the [[Pontiac Catalina|Catalina]]. It was replaced by the Catalina Brougham series for 1971.

In 1971, Pontiac moved the name to their new [[GM X platform (RWD)|X-body]] [[Chevrolet Nova|Nova]] clone, the '''Ventura II'''.

[[File:Puyallup, WA, USA - panoramio (2).jpg|thumb|left|1971 Pontiac Ventura II Coupe]]
Ventura II production ran from 1971 to 1977. The "II" suffix was dropped after 1972, and the [[Pontiac Phoenix|Phoenix]] name replaced Ventura in 1978. Engine offerings for the abbreviated 1971 model year included a [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine#250|250 cu in.]] [[Straight-six engine|six cylinder]] or [[Chevrolet small-block engine#307|307 cu in.]], only the 307 was available for the Sprint option in '71. For 1972, a [[Pontiac V8 engine#350|Pontiac-built 350 cu in. V8]] with two-barrel [[carburetor]] was added to the option list and became the base V8 for 1973 and 1974. [[Transmission (mechanics)|Transmission]] offerings consisted of a standard column-shift three-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] with options including a four-speed manual, two-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] (with six-cylinder) or three-speed [[Turbo Hydra-Matic]] automatic (with V8s). The 1973 six-cylinder Ventura was the last Pontiac model to offer the two-speed automatic, a [[badge-engineered]] Chevrolet [[Powerglide]], which was dropped completely from all GM cars and trucks after this model year in favor of the Turbo Hydra-Matic.

[[File:1973 Pontiac Ventura Sprint Coupe 350 in orange, front right.jpg|thumb|left|1973 Pontiac Ventura Sprint coupe]]
A '''Ventura Sprint''' option package was offered on two-door models 1971 to 1975, including three-speed transmission with floor shift and optional [[Chevrolet small-block engine#350|350 cu in. V8]] equipped four-speed, body color mirrors, custom carpeting, all-vinyl upholstery with either the standard bench or optional Strato bucket seats, Custom Sport steering wheel, blackout-grille trim, special striping, blackout grille, and 14x6" (36&amp;nbsp;cm diameter, 15&amp;nbsp;cm wide) wheels.

In mid-1972, Pontiac introduced the limited production Ventura SD for the Southern California market as sort of a sporty-luxury compact to counter imported luxury sedans then taking the U.S. market by storm. The SD option added the high-back Strato bucket seats from the Firebird along with a Custom Sport steering wheel, Rally II wheels, uprated suspension and other items. Some 250 Ventura SD's were built for 1972, all at the GM Nova/Ventura assembly plant in Van Nuys, California plant.

In 1973, higher spec cars received a new split grille in the Firebird/GTO style. Lower grade cars retained the split level grille used in 1971 and 1972. The Ventura Custom became a separate series (2Z, versus 2Y for the regular Ventura), carrying a "Custom" script on the rear roof pillar. In addition to the two-door coupe and four-door sedan, a three-door hatchback coupe was added to the lineup.&lt;ref name="Spontiac"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Standard Catalog of Pontiac, 1926-2002 | edition = 2nd | first1 = John | last1 = Gunnell | first2 = Ron | last2 = Kowalke | ref = GunKow | publisher = Krause Publications | location = Iola, WI | page = 139 | date = 2012 | isbn = 978-1-4402-3234-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, the [[Pontiac GTO]] name moved to the Ventura from the intermediate LeMans line.  The GTO package gave the basic Ventura a [[Pontiac V8 engine#350|350 cu in. (5.7L)]] engine with a four-barrel carburetor of about 200&amp;nbsp;hp (149&amp;nbsp;kW).  The package also came with a functional "[[shaker scoop|shaker]]" hood scoop, tri-color GTO decals, Rally II wheels, and special grill-mounted driving lights.  The GTO package could be ordered on the [[hatchback]] Ventura as well as the base and Custom [[coupe]]s.

[[File:1975 Pontiac Ventura -- 09-24-2010.jpg|left|thumb|1975 Pontiac Ventura]]
The GTO was dropped in 1975, along with the Pontiac 350. The Ventura could be optioned with the [[Buick V8 engine#350|Buick 350 V8]] instead.

The '''Ventura SJ''' was a new offering for 1975, when the Ventura and other GM compacts were restyled with new rooflines along with improved suspensions shared with the second generation F platform (Camaro/Firebird), plus standard front disc brakes. The Ventura SJ was marketed as an American rendition of a Euro-style luxury sport sedan that Pontiac created with the larger mid-sized [[Pontiac Grand Am|Grand Am]] in 1973, as well as a competitor to the new-for-1975 [[Ford Granada (North America)|Ford Granada]] and [[Mercury Monarch]], both marketed as luxury compacts designed to compete with the more expensive imports such as Audi and Mercedes. As such the Ventura SJ included an upgraded interior with reclining bucket seats in either cloth or vinyl along with a center console, rally instrumentation and other items.

[[File:1976 Pontiac Ventura rear (14302730249).jpg|thumb|left|1976 Pontiac Ventura Coupe]]
Only minor appearance changes were made to the Ventura for 1976 and 1977 including new grilles and revised taillights. 1976 saw the inclusion of the Oldsmobile 260 cubic inch V8. For 1977, the Chevy 250 six was replaced by [[Buick V6 engine|Buick's 231 cu in V6]] as the base powerplant and the Chevrolet 305 cubic-inch V8 was introduced as an option; the 2.5 liter "Iron Duke" 4-cylinder was also (and unusually) optional along with the 301 cu in V8. One unique feature for 1976 was the availability of a 5-speed manual transmission (Borg Warner T-50) with the 260 cubic inch V8; it was the standard transmission with the Iron Duke. Under 700 units total with this combination were built in 1976.  

At the beginning of the 1977 model year, the Ventura SJ was the top-line model but at mid-year was replaced by the [[Pontiac Phoenix|Phoenix]], which featured a distinctive center grille and rectangular headlights and the most luxurious interior available in a Pontiac X-body car. Otherwise, the Phoenix was basically a plushed up Ventura much like the Chevrolet Concours was related to the more mundane Nova.

For 1978, the Ventura nameplate was retired and all X-body cars were sold under the Phoenix nameplate through that year and into 1979 with a top-line Phoenix SJ designated as the top-line series.

The '''Pontiac Phoenix''' was a [[compact car]] that was sold from 1977 to 1984 by [[Pontiac]]. There were two generations of the Phoenix, both based on popular [[Chevrolet]] models, and both using the [[GM X platform]] designation. It was named for the mythological [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]], which would die in a self-inflicted fire and be reborn from the ashes. The Phoenix was replaced by the [[Pontiac Grand Am|Grand Am]] in 1985.

The [[rear-wheel drive]] Phoenix was introduced for 1977&lt;ref name=encyc&gt;Encyclopedia of American Cars (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; as an upscale version of the [[Pontiac Ventura]], and replaced the Ventura entirely for 1978.&lt;ref name=encyc /&gt; The Phoenix differed from the Ventura in only minor details such as the grille and its square headlights and yellow rear turn signals. The Phoenix was available as a 2-door [[coupe]] or a 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]], with a 3-door [[hatchback]] available beginning in 1978. There were two trim levels available, the base and LJ, with a performance-oriented SJ package as an option.

Available engines included Pontiac's then-new {{convert|151|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[GM Iron Duke engine|Iron Duke]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]], a {{Convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine|Buick]] [[V6]], a {{Convert|140|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|305|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chevrolet small-block engine|Chevrolet ''LG3'' V8]], and a {{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chevrolet small-block engine|Chevrolet V8]].

For 1980, the Phoenix was downsized and moved to the [[front-wheel drive]] [[GM X platform (1980)|X platform]], and was available as a 2-door [[coupe]] or a 5-door [[hatchback]].

Available engines were a 2.5 L ''[[GM Iron Duke engine|Iron Duke]]'' [[Inline-four engine|4-cylinder]], carried over from the previous Phoenix, and a new 2.8 L ''[[General Motors 60° V6 engine|LE2]]'' V6, both of which were mated to a standard 4-speed manual transmission or optional 3-speed automatic.

As with its sister cars (the [[Chevrolet Citation]], [[Buick Skylark]] and [[Oldsmobile Omega]]), the Phoenix's image suffered because of poor workmanship,&lt;ref name=encyc /&gt; two recalls for 1981,&lt;ref&gt;1981 Pontiac Phoenix Recalls, http://www.carcomplaints.com/Pontiac/Phoenix/1981/recalls/ (retrieved 22 July 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[GM X platform (1980)#Mechanical problems|a dangerous tendency for the car to lock the rear wheels upon braking]].

The Phoenix was replaced for 1985 by a revived [[Pontiac Grand Am|Grand Am]]&lt;ref name=encyc /&gt; on the front-wheel drive [[GM N platform|GM N-body platform]].

The '''Pontiac Chieftain''' is an automobile which was produced by [[Pontiac]] from 1949 to 1958. The 1949 Chieftain and [[Pontiac Streamliner|Streamliner]] models were the first all new car designs to come from Pontiac in the post [[World War II]] years. Previous cars had been 1942 models with minor revisions.

In 1949 the [[GM A platform|A-body]] Chieftain replaced the [[Pontiac Torpedo]] as Pontiac's smaller and lower priced model. However, the newly redesigned [[GM B platform|B-bodied]] [[Pontiac Streamliner]] was now very similar (if not exact) in dimensions, engines, trim levels and options. This was the first time since 1934 that all Pontiacs had the same wheelbase. They had standard automatic interior lighting.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt;

The Chieftain was initially introduced with four models: [[Sedan (car)|Sedan]], [[Coupé|Sedan Coupe]], Business Coupe, and Deluxe Convertible Coupe. In 1950, a Catalina Coupe was added to the range while a [[station wagon]] was added in 1952, with the demise of the top of the line Streamliner wagon.&lt;ref name=Gunnell&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975, Revised 4th Edition, pages 695-708&lt;/ref&gt;

1949 Chieftains came with a choice of four engines:
* a 239.2 cu in L-head [[Straight-six engine|6-cylinder]] engine making {{convert|90|hp}} at 3400&amp;nbsp;rpm
* a 239.2 cu in L-head 6-cylinder engine making {{convert|93|hp}} at 3400&amp;nbsp;rpm
* a 248.9 cu in L-head [[Straight-eight engine|8-cylinder]] making {{convert|103|hp}} at 3800&amp;nbsp;rpm
* a 248.9 cu in L-head 8-cylinder making {{convert|106|hp}} at 3800&amp;nbsp;rpm

The horsepower differences between each of the 6- and 8-cylinder engines were due to changes in compression ratios.

Some of the more interesting optional items available for the first generation Chieftain included a radio with seven vacuum tubes,&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; tissue dispenser, under seat heaters, and a Remington Auto-Home shaver. In 1951, the horsepower on the 8-cylinder rose to 116.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; The Chieftain came with a gas gauge, ammeter, oil pressure gauge, and a temperature gauge which had marks for 160, 180, and 220 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1950_Pontiac/1950_Pontiac_Owners_Manual/1950%20Pontiac%20owner%20s%20manual%20-%20Pg%2006%20-%2007.html |title=Directory Index: Pontiac/1950_Pontiac/1950_Pontiac_Owners_Manual |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 1952 model year, Pontiac discontinued the Streamliner leaving the Chieftain as their only offering. The Chieftain continued with the 120 inch wheelbase. Engine offerings were basically the same except for the [[Straight-8|8-cylinder]] which got a .2 cubic inch enlargement. Horsepower did increase by 10 on the [[Straight-6|6-cylinder]] and by 15 on the 8-cylinder. Also, a red light to remind the driver that the parking brake was on was new.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|title=Popular Mechanics|date=August 1937|publisher=Hearst Magazines|issn=0032-4558|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_79oDAAAAMBAJ|accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the May 1952 issue of [[Popular Mechanics]], the Chieftain was rated 14.9 seconds for a 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph time.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; Front head room was 36 inches, while rear head room was 35.75 inches.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

In 1953, Pontiac came with a new body style. An offering a 122-inch wheelbase, and sleeker lines. The windshield was now a one piece, and a standard "panoramic" windshield
Adorned the rear for all models. Pontiacs sported accentuated bubbled up fins in the rear for the first time in 1953. The six-cylinder engine was standard. There was a less equipped Chieftain Special and the better equipped Chieftain Deluxe line, as well as the Custom Catalina two-door hardtop coupe. A light-up plastic Chief Pontiac hood ornament that illuminated when the headlights were on adorned the front end.&lt;ref name="Spontiac"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Standard Catalog of Pontiac, 1926-2002 | edition = 2nd | first = John | last = Gunnell | ref = GunPon | publisher = Krause Publications | location = Iola, WI | page = 70 | date = 2012 | isbn = 978-1-4402-3234-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pontiac Star Chief|Star Chief]] was added to the Pontiac line in 1954 and the Chieftain was moved down to entry level status. Both cars were built on the A-body shell but the new Star Chief had an {{convert|11|in|mm|adj=on}} extension added to its frame. Also in 1954, 8-cylinder engines increased by about nine horsepower due to carburetor changes, up to {{convert|122|hp|kW|abbr=on}} for the manual and {{convert|127|hp|kW|abbr=on}} for the Hydra-Matic. The 6-cylinder engines remained unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;[[#GunPon|Gunnell (2012)]], p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

Pontiac was the last GM division to abandon its prewar inline eight engines as Oldsmobile and Cadillac had adopted modern OHV V8s in 1949 and Buick in 1953. The 1953-54 Pontiacs had been meant for the division's new OHV 287 V8, however Buick division managers succeeded in delaying its launch until 1955 to avoid upstaging their "Nailhead" Buick V8.

Partially because of competition from Chevrolet, Oldsmobile, and Buick, and partially because Pontiac still lacked a V8, total sales fell by 30% in 1954.

Also in 1954, power brakes, "power lift" windows (only for the front doors), as well as air-conditioning were offered as extra cost options for the first time. The 1954 Pontiacs have the distinction of the first production car in the US to have an air conditioning system in the modern sense with in-dash controls. In addition, a far more responsive and fully adjustable front seat was added.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt;

The 1955 model Chieftains featured completely new chassis, body and engine. The engine was the biggest news as this was Pontiac's first V8. The {{convert|287.2|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine made 173 or {{convert|180|hp}} at 4400&amp;nbsp;rpm depending on which version was ordered (again, the difference was due to changes in compression ratios). Six cylinder models did not return and the 1955 lineup was V8-only. A six-cylinder model had been considered, but Pontiac management decided not to retain it due to slow sales—six-cylinder Pontiacs had accounted for only around 10-15% of volume since 1951. The traditional appearance five-chrome strips running down the hood and trunk were updated with a twin-stripe design.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt;

The biggest change for 1956 was again in the engine. The new for 1955 V8 was drastically enlarged to {{convert|316.6|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}. Horsepower made a considerable increase, jumping to 192 and 205 respectively. Otherwise, the 1956 model Chieftains received only minor updates. A padded safety dashboard was added as an option. Sales for 1956 fell off by as much as 20% over record-setting 1955, in part due to tighter credit guidelines instituted by American banks that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1956_Pontiac/1956_Pontiac_Brochure/1956%20Pontiac-10-11.html |title=Directory Index: Pontiac/1956_Pontiac/1956_Pontiac_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New "Star Flight" styling graced the 1957 Chieftains. This new theme included missile shaped side trim, extended rear fenders with V-shaped tips, lower hoods and massive bumpers. A new Super Chief sub-series debuted within the Chieftain line. These were the meant to be the top of the line Chieftain models. Sales were 58.02% of all Pontiacs in 1957. The first "[[Tri power|Tri-Power]]" Pontiac engines were offered.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1946"/&gt;&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; Once again the Pontiac [[V8 engine|V8]] was enlarged. The 1957 model year saw the engine increase to {{convert|347|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=srsunad57&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rp5WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TucDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7316%2C3604590 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=(advertisement) |title=Pontiac Chieftain|date=March 10, 1957 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; with horsepower increasing to 290 for the Chieftain models. This generation didn't experience the popularity as much as the Chevrolet [[Tri-Five]] during the same years, even though the models were very similar.

===Australian production===
The 1957 Pontiac, badged as the Pontiac Super Chief, was also assembled in Australia, by [[General Motors-Holden]].&lt;ref&gt;Norm Darwin, 100 Years of GM in Australia, 2002, pages 150-151&lt;/ref&gt;

Chieftains went through another major styling change in 1958. All models were given honeycomb grilles, quad head and tail lamps, concave rear fenders, and longer, lower lines, but the traditional chrome streak installed on the hood and trunk was no longer used on all Pontiacs starting in 1958. The Super Chief sub-series was promoted to full model status leaving just the standard array of Chieftains as the entry level Pontiac. The "Sportable" transistor radio became an option (a portable, removable radio),&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt; along with air-suspension and a limited slip differential.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1946"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1958%20Pontiac/1958%20Pontiac%20Prestige%20Brochure/b_1958%20Pontiac%20Prestige-26-27.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

As in years past, the V8 engine was enlarged. For 1958 it grew to {{convert|370|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} and made {{convert|240|hp}} and {{convert|270|hp}} depending on version.

The 1958 models were the last Chieftains to be produced. It was replaced with the all-new [[Pontiac Catalina|Catalina]] in 1959.

The '''Pontiac Grand Safari''' was [[Pontiac]]'s top-of-the-line [[full-size]] [[station wagon]] offered from 1971 to 1978. The Grand Safari used the grille and interior trim of the [[Pontiac Bonneville|Bonneville]] and [[Pontiac Grand Ville|Grand Ville]] passenger car series, and most (but not all) examples were trimmed with woodgrain paneling on the sides and tailgate.

The 1971 to 1976 models were the largest Pontiacs ever built. The 1971-76 GM full-size bodies, at {{convert|64.3|in|mm|adj=on}} front shoulder room and {{convert|63.4|in|mm|adj=on}} rear shoulder room set a record for interior width that would not be matched by any car until the full-size GM rear-wheel drive models of the early to mid-1990s. The Grand Safari wagons, as did other GM full-sized wagons during these years, used a unique rear suspension with multi-leaf springs instead of the coil springs used on other full-sized Pontiacs, and other full-sized GM cars.

The Grand Safari wagons also featured a new '[[Station wagon#Tailgate evolution|Clamshell]]' tailgate design, marketed as the ''Glide-away Tailgate'', where the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof as the tailgate (manually or with power assist), slid into a recess under the cargo floor. The power tailgate, the first in station wagon history, ultimately supplanted the manual tailgate, which required marked effort to lift from storage. The power system was operated by switches on the instrument panel or a key switch on the rear quarter panel. The Clamshell system, heavy and complex, made it easier to load and unload the extremely long wagons in tight spaces. But it remained unique to GM, and would be subsequently eliminated when GM reduced the length of their wagons by about a foot in 1977, and the overriding concern became increased fuel economy.

The 1971-76 Grand Safaris, shared their {{convert|127.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase with the [[Buick]] and [[Oldsmobile]] [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] cars but were designated as B-bodies. At {{convert|231.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} in length the 1974-76 Grand Safaris are the longest Pontiacs ever built. And at {{convert|5112|lb|kg|abbr=on}} shipping weight, or about {{convert|5300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} curb weight, the three-seat 1974 Grand Safari wagons are easily the heaviest Pontiacs ever built.

These wagons ran with [[V8 engine|V8]] engines of either 400 or 455 cubic inches.

The 1977 Grand Safari was downsized considerably, with wheelbase cut to {{convert|115.9|in|mm|adj=on}} inches, length to less than {{convert|216|in|m|adj=on}} and weight to just over {{convert|4000|lb|kg|adj=on}} pounds. These wagons thus could run with smaller engines, either a standard {{convert|301|cuin|l|adj=on}} or optional {{convert|403|cuin|l|adj=on}} V8; a {{convert|350|cuin|l|adj=on}} V8 was additionally offered on 1978 models. Replacing the Glide-Away Tailgate was a three-way tailgate not unlike that used on Ford and Chrysler station wagons. In 1979, the Grand Safari's name was changed to Bonneville Safari.

[[Image:CustomS002.jpg|thumb|Overhead Cam Inline 6 with the "Sprint" Package.]]

The '''[[Pontiac]] Custom S''' was a  one-year only [[Pontiac]] nameplate offered during the 1969 model year car as a replacement for the "Tempest Custom" trim level in the Division's line-up. Originally to be called the "Pontiac TC",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pontiacpower.net/fact1.html Pontiac Facts] Retrieved on: July 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; it was slotted between the [[Pontiac Tempest|Tempest]] and [[Pontiac LeMans|LeMans]] in price and features.

==Overview==
The Custom S was available in six different body designs: two-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]], [[hardtop]] coupe, sports coupe, a 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]], a 4-door hardtop, and a station wagon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cardomain.com/ride/356367/3 Information about Custom S models, VIN numbers, and production numbers]. Retrieved on: July 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The sports coupe can be differentiated from the hardtop by the presence of a [[Quarter glass|vent window]] in the front door. Interior and exterior appointments fell between the Tempest and the LeMans and GTO.

The Custom S came standard with Pontiac's unique [[overhead camshaft]] [[Pontiac_straight-6_engine#Overhead_Cam|OHC-6]] 175&amp;nbsp;hp 250&amp;nbsp;in³ engine. Also available was a {{convert|230|hp|abbr=on}} {{convert|265|ftlbf|Nm|abbr=on}}  TQ OHC inline 6-cylinder with the "Sprint" package, a {{convert|265|hp|abbr=on}} overhead valve pushrod [[V8 engine|V8]] 350&amp;nbsp;in³, and a {{convert|330|hp|abbr=on}} version of the same engine with higher compression and a 4-barrel [[carburetor]].

{{original research|paragraph|date=February 2017}}
Originally planned for 1969 was a lower-priced "econo" muscle car to be based on the Custom S series intended as a competitor to the fast-selling sub-$3,000 [[Plymouth Road Runner]], well below the base $3,500 to $4,500-$5,000 optioned-out [[Pontiac GTO|GTO]] and similar upscale muscle cars. This car was to be built on the two-door pillared coupe body style and be powered by the 330-horsepower 350 HO V8 with other equipment including the Custom S's bench-seat interior and exterior with Carousel Red paint, Rally II wheels sans trim rings and sporty striping. This car, which was said to have been named the "Pontiac ET" (for elapsed time), was presented to division officials but rejected as presented. Instead of the lower-priced muscle car concept, Pontiac decided to retain the flamboyant paint job and striping ... and offer it as the expensive "The Judge" option on the GTO.

The Custom S nameplate was dropped after the 1969 model year. For 1970, that series was replaced by a new base LeMans line with the same bodystyles, while the previous up-level LeMans became the LeMans Sport. The entry level Tempest continued for one more year with a new T-37 hardtop coupe added at mid-year, that included a GT-37 option package as lower-priced junior musclecar available with 350 and 400 V8s somewhat similar to the abortive '69 ET series. The T-37 nameplate replaced Tempest entirely for the entry-level Pontiac intermediate series in 1971.

The '''Pontiac Torrent''' is a [[mid-size]] [[crossover SUV]] produced by [[General Motors]] for the 2006 to 2009 model years. A replacement for the [[Pontiac Aztek|Aztek]], it was a mildly restyled version of the first-generation [[Chevrolet Equinox]].

The Torrent shared its basic body structure and mechanicals with the Equinox. However, the Torrent has a different front and rear end to distinguish it visually from the Equinox. The suspension was also modified to be firmer and sportier, and the electronic power steering was recalibrated to deliver a firmer, less artificial feel. The Torrent shared the Equinox's {{Convert|185|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 3.4 L [[V6]] with the 5-Speed Aisin AF33 automatic transmission.

Like other [[Pontiac]] models in the lineup, trim levels of the Torrent were entry-level '''Base''', mid-level '''GT''', and performance-oriented '''GXP'''. The '''GXP''' featured a more powerful 3.6L DOHC SFI V6 engine and a six-speed automatic transmission, along with a unique body kit and other exterior styling cues. 

The Pontiac Torrent was featured as one of the prizes in the [[reality television series]] ''[[Survivor (US TV series)|Survivor]]'' in 2005 as well as ''[[Criss Angel Mindfreak]]'' in the same year.

==GXP==
[[File:2008 Pontiac Torrent GXP.jpg|thumb|left|2008 Pontiac Torrent GXP]]
The GXP trim came with a new 6 speed automatic transmission (with Manual Tap Up/Down shifting capability) paired to a 3.6&amp;nbsp;L DOHC SFI V6 with {{convert|264|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} engine, (with a reported 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph time of 6.9 seconds).{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Other features include: 18&amp;nbsp;inch 5-spoke chrome wheels, twin hood scoops, and a unique front and rear body kit. The GXP edition Torrent is {{convert|188.80|in|mm}} long overall, {{convert|71.40|in|mm}} wide, and {{convert|68.30|in|mm}} tall. The GXP Torrent sits {{convert|1|in|mm}} lower to the ground and has {{convert|6.6|in|mm}} of ground clearance. The lower stance is accented by the 18&amp;nbsp;inch wheels and the absent roof rack, giving the Torrent a smoother design flow compared to the standard Torrent. The GXP model also features a performance-tuned suspension, hydraulic power-assisted steering (as opposed to the electric power-assisted standard Torrent), improved interior trim (featuring piano black and chrome trim on the console and dash gauges), dual chrome-tipped exhaust, and GXP specific gauges and console trim. A navigation system is an option along with heated sport leather seats, DVD entertainment system, and Sunroof. The GXP became available for sale in the fall of 2007 as a 2008 model.

General Motors has repeatedly advertised the Torrent GXP on TV commercials claiming that the Torrent GXP had more of a horsepower advantage than the [[BMW X3]] in an effort for GM to make Pontiac a low-cost rival to BMW.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Podium Edition==

|}
For the 2008 model year, the Torrent got the '''Podium Edition''' trim for the [[Vancouver 2010]] [[Winter Olympic Games]]. The Torrent Podium Edition was only sold in Canada.

==Discontinuation==
The Pontiac Torrent was discontinued after the 2009 model year. The last Torrent rolled off the assembly line on September 2, 2009 as a result of General Motors discontinuing the Pontiac division in 2010.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Originally, a new Buick SUV built on the [[GM Theta platform]] was going to be introduced in 2010 to serve as a replacement for the Torrent, but General Motors decided to replace the Torrent with a new GMC SUV built on the GM Theta platform called the [[GMC Terrain]], which went on sale in 2009 for the 2010 model year.

The '''Pontiac 6000''' is a [[mid-size car|Mid-size]] automobile manufactured and marketed by [[Pontiac]] for model years 1982-1991 in 2-door coupe, 4-door sedan and 5-door wagon body styles &amp;mdash; as one of four [[badge engineering|rebadged]] variants, including the [[Buick Century]], [[Chevrolet Celebrity]], and [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera]].  

The 6000 was manufactured at [[Oshawa Car Assembly]] in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] from 1981 to 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/end-of-the-line-the-last-pontiac-6000-made-by-general-news-photo/502821983|title=End of the line. The last Pontiac 6000 made by General Motors of...|website=Getty Images}}&lt;/ref&gt;, at [[Oklahoma City Assembly]] until production ended, and briefly at [[North Tarrytown Assembly]]. 

For model year 1984, the 6000 led Pontiac's sales, with a production over 122,000 and was the last Pontiac to carry a numeric designation.  The 6000 was offered in a sporty variant, marketed as the 6000 STE, which was named to the [[Car and Driver Ten Best]] three times, from 1983 to 1985.

==Year to Year Changes==
[[File:'82-'84 Pontiac 6000 Coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1982-1984 Pontiac 6000 Coupé]]

*1982: Two trim levels were offered: 6000 and 6000 LE. Both came standard with the new-for-1982 {{convert|151|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|disp=flip}} [[GM Iron Duke engine|Tech IV]] four-cylinder with throttle body injection. It made {{convert|90|hp||abbr=on}}. Optional engines were GM's {{convert|173|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|disp=flip}} V6 with a 2-barrel [[carburetor]] which made {{convert|112|hp||abbr=on}}, or a {{convert|263|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|disp=flip}} [[Oldsmobile Diesel V6 engine|Oldsmobile]] diesel V6 which made {{convert|85|hp||abbr=on}}.
*1984: A station wagon known as the '''6000 Safari''' was introduced to replace the rear-wheel drive Bonneville Safari wagon.
*1985: A facelift meant a new fascia with a body-colored center section housing the Pontiac logo. The 2.8 in the STE model was updated with multi-port fuel injection, raising output to {{convert|135|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The Tech IV was given various updates over the years but was mostly unchanged. The 4.3-liter diesel V6 was problematic and unpopular and was discontinued after 1985.
*1986: The fuel-injected 2.8 made its way into the Base and LE models for the 1986 model year, however in these trims it only made {{convert|125|hp||0|abbr=on}}. An S/E model arrived with the STE powertrain but fewer features; it was also available as a station wagon.&lt;ref name="Spontiac"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Standard Catalog of Pontiac, 1926-2002 | edition = 2nd | first1 = John | last1 = Gunnell | first2 = Ron | last2 = Kowalke | ref = GunKow | publisher = Krause Publications | location = Iola, WI | page = 189 | date = 2012 | isbn = 978-1-4402-3234-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1987: The quad-rectangular headlamps were replaced with the composite headlamps.&lt;ref name=pont192&gt;[[#GunKow|Gunnell and Kowalke]], p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;
*1988: The coupe model was dropped; the rest of the line received equipment changes such as new "contour seats" for the LE.&lt;ref name=pont200&gt;[[#GunKow|Gunnell and Kowalke]], p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;
*1988: In Canada, an Olympic edition was offered on S/E models as a tie-in to the Calgary Winter Olympics. Offered only in monochrome white, with all blackout trim exterior painted white to match the body. The only interior colour trim was saddle, with an Olympic logo mounted on the B pillar.
*1989: The 6000 received a more-rounded roofline, along with the Buick Century and Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera, and was facelifted for the final time with slightly wider headlamps and a new grille. 
*1990: Passive front seatbelts were introduced and the {{convert|191|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|disp=flip}} V6 originally only seen in the STE replaced the 2.8 across the board. After the STE model was dropped from the 6000 line for 1990, the S/E model gained its all wheel drive option. This was later dropped for the 1991 model year. 
*1991: The 6000 is dropped, being replaced by the [[Pontiac Grand Prix|Grand Prix]] sedan. In addition, the Pontiac 6000 wagon was the final GM designed station wagon offering from Pontiac, as it was replaced by the [[Pontiac Trans Sport]] in 1990. The last Pontiac 6000 was assembled on July 22, 1991.{{cn|date=May 2019}}

==STE version==
[[File:1985 Pontiac 6000 STE sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1985 Pontiac 6000 STE]]

By 1984, Pontiac was in the midst of a resurgence as the division began to reassert its 1960s role as GM's performance brand. The 6000STE (Special Touring Edition) was introduced for the 1983 model year. 5-passenger seating with front captain seats and power windows were standard on this trim level (optional on some other trim levels). It featured a High-Output version of the 6000's optional 2.8&amp;nbsp;L V6. Like that engine, it sported a 2-barrel [[carburetor]], though it delivered {{convert|135|hp||0|abbr=on}}, rather than the usual 112 horsepower. Although intended to compete with similar entries from [[BMW]] and [[Audi]], the 6000 used older technologies by comparison. The fuel system was carbureted (competitors had [[fuel injection]]) and gauge cluster lacked a tachometer. The 1984 6000STE featured a digital gauge cluster featuring a bar-graph tachometer. The STE featured a driver information center with a system which monitored functions such as lights, doors, tune-ups and tire rotations. For 1984, ''[[Road &amp; Track]]'' called the 6000 STE one of the top twelve enthusiast cars.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} 

Special steering rack, and suspension tuning with a self-leveling rear air suspension yielded handling performance comparable to European vehicles.  Four wheel disc brakes improved stopping as did standard Goodyear Eagle GT tires, size 195/70R14 (large for the time).

In 1985, the carbureted engine was replaced by a multi-port fuel injected version of the 2.8&amp;nbsp;L V6, still delivering {{convert|135|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Although the 3-speed automatic remained standard (a [[Getrag]] 5-speed manual was a no charge option), the new engine accelerated faster than the previous engine.

For 1986, a revised front fascia with composite headlamps, anti-lock brakes, a revised tachometer, steering wheel mounted audio controls (the first of their kind) and a new 4-speed automatic transmission became available. Following this was a two-position memory seat for the 8-way power drivers seat for 1987. New for 1988 was an optional [[All Wheel Drive]] system. It was mated to a new 3.1&amp;nbsp;L [[GM 60-degree V6 engine#LH0|LH0]] V6 (the first use of GM's then-new 3.1&amp;nbsp;L in a production car) but only a 3-speed automatic transmission, which did not help acceleration or fuel economy. The all-wheel-drive system became standard for 1989, but was moved to the SE model for 1990, since the STE model name was discontinued from the 6000 line and moved to the new four-door Grand Prix lineup that year. The STE trim level was later discontinued from the Grand Prix after 1993.

The '''Pontiac Bonneville''' is an [[automobile]] built by [[Pontiac]] from 1957 to 2005. Bonnevilles were [[full-size car|full-sized]], with the exception of a brief period of [[mid-size car|mid-size]] between 1982–1986. The brand was introduced as a limited production performance convertible during the 1957 model year. The Bonneville (known as the Parisienne in [[Canada]] until 1981), and its platform partner, the [[Pontiac Grand Ville|Grand Ville]], are some of the largest Pontiacs ever built; in station wagon body styles they reached just over {{convert|230|in|m}} long, and at {{convert|5000|lb|kg}} and more were also some of the heaviest cars produced at the time. Also, they came with a Jetaway 315 and also were available as hearses.

== Early development ==
[[File:PONTIAC-BONNEVILLE.jpg|left|thumb|1954 [[Pontiac Bonneville Special]]]]
[[File:Pontiac Bonneville Convertible 1957.jpg|right|thumb|1957 Pontiac Star Chief Custom Bonneville convertible]]
The Bonneville name first appeared in 1954 on a pair of bubble-topped GM [[Motorama]] [[concept car]]s called the [[Pontiac Bonneville Special|Bonneville Special]], sharing an appearance with the [[Chevrolet Corvette (C1)|Chevrolet Corvette]].

It entered the production lineup as a high-performance, [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] luxury convertible version of the [[Pontiac Star Chief|Star Chief]] in 1957, and was loaded with every available option as standard equipment with the exception of air conditioning and a [[Continental tire|continental kit]].&lt;ref&gt;Pontiac they built excitement by thomas bonsall&lt;/ref&gt; This put the Bonneville in a Cadillac-like price range of $5,782.00 - more than double the base price of the [[Pontiac Chieftain|Chieftain]] on which it was built, with the result being a fully equipped Bonneville could cost more than a larger, entry-level Cadillac. Only 630 units were produced that first year, making it one of the most collectible Pontiacs of all time. The following year it became a separate model, and it would endure until 2005 as the division's top-of-the-line model. The name was taken from the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] in [[Utah]], the site of much early auto racing and most of the world's land speed record runs, which was named in turn after U.S. Army officer [[Benjamin Bonneville]].

Bonneville became a separate model in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1958%20Pontiac/album/1958%20Pontiac-06-07.html |title=Directory Index: Pontiac/1958 Pontiac/album |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=2011-12-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426223636/http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1958%20Pontiac/album/1958%20Pontiac-06-07.html |archivedate=2013-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; available as a two-door [[hardtop]] or a [[convertible (car)|convertible]]. It paced the [[Indianapolis 500]] in its first year. As a separate model Bonneville had a significantly lower price tag of around $3,000 thanks to the demotion of most of the luxury items found on the 1957 [[Pontiac Star Chief|Star Chief]] bodystyle from standard equipment to the option list. Also a {{convert|300|hp}} {{convert|370|CID}} V8 with four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts was now standard equipment. The fuel-injection system offered with the standard engine on the 1957 Star Chief bodystyle was now listed as an extra cost option but very few 1958 Bonnevilles were so equipped due to a towering price tag of over US$5000, which was not considered a very good value considering that for less than US$100, a [[Tri-Power]] option was available with three two-barrel carburetors and even more power. The electric clock was standard.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt;

For 1958, GM was promoting their fiftieth year of production, and introduced Anniversary models for each brand; Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Chevrolet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmphotostore.com/1958-Chevrolet-Impala-50th-Anniversary-Art-Poster/productinfo/P8367/ Image of 50th Anniversary promotional photo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017224216/http://www.gmphotostore.com/1958-Chevrolet-Impala-50th-Anniversary-Art-Poster/productinfo/P8367/ |date=2015-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1958 models shared a common appearance on the top models for each brand; Cadillac Eldorado Seville, Buick Roadmaster Riviera, Oldsmobile Holiday 88, Pontiac Bonneville Catalina, and the all-new Chevrolet Bel-Air Impala.

In its third year, the 1959 Bonneville became a full top-line series with the addition of the four-door hardtop sedan and Safari station wagon body styles. The Bonneville played an important part that year in the introduction of two of Pontiac's greatest marketing inspirations — the split grille and the Wide Track slogan. The latter was not just ad copy, either, as Pontiac pushed its wheels further out toward the fenders than anyone else and created what were considered to be the best-cornering full-size cars in the industry. Both the grille design and the Wide Track phrase remained part of Pontiac's image up to its termination. A "[[Limited slip differential|Safe-T-Track]]" differential, used to minimize wheel spin, was an option beginning in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1959%20Pontiac/1959_Pontiac_Prestige_Brochure/1959%20Pontiac%20Prestige-26-27.html |title=Directory Index: Pontiac/1959 Pontiac/1959_Pontiac_Prestige_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bonneville remained Pontiac's costliest and most luxurious model throughout the 1960s and was instrumental in pushing Pontiac to third place in sales from 1962 to 1970.

The distinctive protruding grille made its appearance on all Pontiac products during the early 1960s, and was a modern revival of a similar appearance on Pontiac products during the 1930s and early 1940s, as demonstrated on the [[Pontiac Torpedo]].

The Bonneville differed from its lesser [[Pontiac Catalina|Catalina]] and [[Pontiac Star Chief|Star Chief]] counterparts by featuring more luxurious interior trim with upgraded cloth and Morrokide vinyl or expanded Morrokide upholstery in sedans and coupes, expanded Morrokide in Safari wagons and genuine leather seating in convertibles. Bonnevilles (with the exception of Bonneville Safari station wagons) were also (along with Star Chiefs) built on a longer wheelbase version of GM's B-Body. Also found in the Bonneville were instrument panels and door panels with walnut veneer trim, carpeted lower door panels, grab bar on the passenger side of the dash and courtesy lights and a rear arm rest. Beginning in 1964, a Bonneville Brougham option package was available that included an even more luxurious interior trim level with front and rear seats featuring center armrests, upgraded door panels and a standard Cordova (vinyl) roof with "Brougham" nameplates. The two-door hardtop was marketed as the "Sports Coupe", the four door pillarless models were called "Vistas".

Bonneville models were standard equipped with [[Hydra-Matic]] (through 1964) or [[Turbo Hydra-Matic]] (1965-on) [[automatic transmission]]s. Other options included power steering and power brakes as well as [[air conditioning]]. Other popular options included power windows, power seats, radio, cruise control, and 8-lug aluminum wheels that included integral brake drums for improved stopping power. The Bonneville also had more powerful standard V8 engines than other full-sized Pontiacs including the {{convert|389|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} or {{convert|400|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8s]] with four-barrel carburetors (power ratings of {{convert|303|to|340|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} depending on year) with many optional V8 offerings available including Tri-Power (three two-barrel [[carburetor]]) options on both the {{convert|389|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|421|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} V8s that offered up to {{convert|376|hp|kW|abbr=on}} through 1966. For 1963 only&lt;1963 Pontiac shop manual&gt;, Pontiac also offered the {{convert|421|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} Super Duty with two four-barrel carburetors, rated at {{convert|425|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, as a US$2,250 option (when the base Bonneville listed at US$3,349).&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J.

For 1965, All GM "B" body cars were dramatically restyled.  Swooping rooflines, rakish fender lines and the "[[Coke bottle styling|Coke bottle]]" profile contributed to making one of the most popular body styles ever produced.  The Bonneville got the new styling, with plenty of bright trim on the lower body sides and on the rear deck.  Inside, new upholstery and instrumentation were featured.  Drivetrains were essentially the same as 1964, except the Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission quadrant, which now featured "reverse" in between "park" and "neutral", instead of at the bottom of the selections (below "L"), the old arrangement having been sharply criticized as a safety hazard.

A General Motors corporate edict that took effect with the 1967 model year led Pontiac to discontinue the Tri-Power engine options on all of its cars. That year also brought a larger {{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 as the standard engine for Bonnevilles and other full-sized Pontiacs to replace the previous 389, while the {{convert|421|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 was replaced by a new {{convert|428|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine that offered as much as {{convert|390|hp|0|abbr=}}. Also beginning in 1967, carburetion was changed. The previous standard 600 cfm Carter square bore four-barrel and optional Tri-Power was replaced with the new Quadarajet spread bore carburetor delivering 800 cfm, equivalent to the previous 1966 Tri-Power set-up. For 1969, a {{convert|360|hp|abbr=on|0}} 428 became the standard Bonneville engine, which in turn was replaced for 1970 by an even larger {{convert|455|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 rated at {{convert|370|hp|abbr=on}}.

For 1971, the Bonneville was downgraded in the model hierarchy, as a new top line [[Pontiac Grand Ville|Grand Ville]] series was introduced. In effect, it replaced the discontinued [[Pontiac Executive|Executive]] above the lower-priced [[Pontiac Catalina|Catalina]]. The Bonneville had new "Monocoque" styling&lt;ref&gt;[http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/NA/Pontiac/1971-Pontiac/1971-Pontiac-Full-Line-Prestige-Brochure Pure Pontiac!] 1971 Pontiac Full Line Prestige Brochure&lt;/ref&gt; and was offered in three body styles, a pillared four-door sedan, four-door hardtop [[sedan (car)|sedan]] and two-door hardtop [[coupe]]. The standard engine for 1971-72 was a 455 cubic-inch V8 with two-barrel carburetor that was rated at 280 gross horsepower for 1971 and 185 net horsepower for 1972 and optionally available was the four-barrel version of the 455 rated at 325 gross horsepower in 1971 and 250 net horsepower in 1972. The on-paper power ratings reflect the change in power measurement undertaken by the industry for 1972. 1971 was also the first year for Pontiac and other GM divisions to reduce compression ratios on all engines across the board to operate on lower-octane regular leaded, low-lead or unleaded gasoline, reflecting a corporate edict anticipating the introduction of catalytic converters in 1975 to help meet increasing stringent federal (and California) emission requirements.

In mid-1971, a [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] transmission, power steering and power front-disc brakes became standard equipment on Bonneville and other full-sized Pontiacs (as well as other full-sized GM cars).

From 1973 to 1976, the Bonneville's standard engine dropped to a 170-horsepower 400 cubic-inch [[V8 engine|V8]]. Optionally available was the 455 four-barrel V8 rated at {{convert|250|hp|0|abbr=}} for 1973-74 and 200 for 1975-76. In 1973, Bonneville was the only full-sized Pontiac to offer a "Radial Tuned Suspension" option package which included the steel-belted radial tires along with an upgraded suspension with Pliacell shock absorbers and front and rear sway bars. The RTS option was expanded for 1974 to all full-sized Pontiacs and radial-ply tires became standard on all 1975 models though an upgraded "RTS" package was still available as an option.

1975 saw the end of the pillarless 2-door hardtop model, replaced by a coupe with frameless door glass but with a thick "B" pillar and fixed rear "opera" window. The 1975 model year introduced rectangular headlights - its frontal appearance was similar to the Cadillac DeVilles and Fleetwoods of the same era.

With the demise of the Grand Ville series after 1975, Bonneville once again became the top-line full-sized Pontiac series, with a Bonneville Brougham model featuring the luxurious interior appointments from the departed Grand Ville.

1976 was the last year of the Bonneville pillarless 4-door hardtop body style. Henceforth, all models would have a thick "B" pillar and metal-framed door glass. Adjustable pedals were optional.&lt;ref&gt;http://oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1976%20Pontiac/1976_Pontiac_Full_Line_Brochure/1976%20Pontiac%20Full%20Line-30.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonneville would continue its flagship duties on the downsized big car line that was introduced for 1977. Bonnevilles (and Catalinas) were {{convert|14|in|mm}} shorter in length, over four inches (102&amp;nbsp;mm) narrower and 800 pounds lighter compared to their 1976 counterparts, but had increased headroom, rear seat legroom and trunk space, and much-improved fuel economy – a major selling point in the years following the 1973-74 energy crisis.

Only a pillared four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] and two-door [[coupe]] (with optional opera windows) were offered as the hardtop sedans and coupes offered in previous years were discontinued across the board at all GM divisions. The Bonneville also regained the Safari station wagon as part of its model lineup for the first time since 1970 with woodgrained exterior trim and interior appointments shared with Bonneville coupes and sedans. The Safari was available in both 6 and 9-passenger configurations and featured a dual-action tailgate that could be opened to the side as a door or downward as a tailgate, rather than the disappearing clamshell tailgates found in 1971-76 full-sized Pontiac wagons.

[[File:1978 Pontiac Bonneville sedan rear left.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of a 1978 Bonneville sedan]]
For 1980, all GM B-bodies received revised styling and aerodynamic improvements along with reduced weight.

The standard engine for Bonneville was Pontiac's new 301 cubic-inch V8 rated at {{convert|135|hp}} and optional engines included a 170-horsepower 350 or 180-horsepower 400 cubic-inch V8. A 185-horsepower Oldsmobile 403 cubic inch V8 was also an option. In later years, increasingly stringent fuel-economy standards mandated by the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulations would lead to the discontinuation of the larger engines with a 231 cubic-inch Buick V6 becoming the standard engine on Bonneville coupes and sedans for 1980 and 1981 with the only optional V8s offered including 265 and 301 cubic-inch Pontiac-built gasoline engines or an Oldsmobile-built 350 cid diesel powerplant.

The Bonneville and Catalina, already the smallest-selling of GM's B-body line, suffered a serious drop in demand following the economic recession that began in the spring of 1979. With that, GM decided to pull the plug at the end of the 1981 model year. Along with them went the 301 engine, marking the end of Pontiac V8s. From now on, the division would use Chevrolet engines.

The Bonneville nameplate didn't go anywhere following the discontinuation of full-sized Pontiacs and instead was simply swapped onto the midsized LeMans, which also suffered from poor sales, thus GM planners reasoned that attaching a more well-known model name to it would spark demand. This model had been produced since 1978 along with its siblings the [[Chevrolet Malibu]], [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]], and [[Buick Century]], and sported a Buick 231 cid V6, Chevrolet 305 cid V8, or Oldsmobile 350 cid diesel V8. (A Buick 4.1 liter V6 was available in 1982.) The 1982-1986 models were officially known as the '''Pontiac Bonneville Model G''' (built on the [[GM G platform (RWD)|GM "G" platform]]), although later models were not badged as such. Styling was revised to bear a closer resemblance to the departed B-body Bonneville and coupes were dropped. GM also began marketing the Bonneville in [[Canada]] for the first time starting in 1984 (1982 and 1983 Canadian models carried the '''Grand LeMans''' name), as GM's full-size Bonnevilles in [[Canada]] were referred to as '''[[Pontiac Parisienne#Fifth generation: 1977–1986|Parisienne]]'''.

While the previous LeMans, on which the new Bonneville was based, was classified as an A-Body, introduction of GM's new front wheel drive A-bodies (e.g. [[Pontiac 6000]]) in 1982 prompted the change to "Model G" on these RWD cars. 1983 was the last year for the G-body station wagon as the Pontiac 6000's wagon replaced it. The Bonneville sedan continued in base, Limited Edition (LE), and Brougham versions through 1986. The 1982-1986 Bonnevilles are direct descendants of the 1964 Pontiac Tempest. These 1982-1986 Bonnevilles were the smallest and the last of the old breed of Bonnevilles, having rear wheel drive, full perimeter frame (body on frame), and old-fashioned American car ride and styling.

[[File:Pontiac Bonneville Model G by night rear.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of Bonneville "Model G"]]
Some Pontiac customers did not take to the "downsized" Bonneville as a portion of new-car buyers were switching their preferences from compact and mid-sized cars back to full-sized, V8-powered cars thanks to improving gasoline prices. Late in the 1983 model year, Pontiac reintroduced a full-sized car to the [[United States|American]] market by bringing over the Canadian-built [[Pontiac Parisienne]] (which was essentially a restyled [[Chevrolet Caprice]] and powered by [[Chevrolet]] [[V6]] or [[V8 engine]]s). The Bonneville was then again one notch below the top of the line from late 1983 through 1986.

However, exactly as before, a downsizing proved its salvation. In 1987, the Parisienne was discontinued and the Bonneville was completely redesigned as a front-wheel drive car, rejoining its pre-1982 platform mates: the [[Buick LeSabre]] and [[Oldsmobile Delta 88]] and it regained its status as the senior Pontiac.

[[File:1987 Pontiac Bonneville SE, rear left.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of a 1987 Pontiac Bonneville SE]]
For 1987, Pontiac decided to change the car from the rear wheel drive G-body with the V8 to the more economical front wheel drive one-year-old [[GM H platform (1986)|H Body platform]] with the [[Buick LeSabre]] and [[Oldsmobile 88]]. Initially, a {{convert|150|hp|abbr=on|0}} [[Buick V6 engine#LG3|3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6]] was the sole engine, mated to a four-speed Hydramatic 4T60 automatic and performance was adequate from this pairing. The new Bonneville was placed on ''[[Car &amp; Driver]]'s'' “10 Best” list for 1987, offering both a base model and LE model. For LE models, an SSE sport package was also available that featured a quicker gear ratio, sportier suspension and more standard features, as the Bonneville was intended to have a more sporty, European flavor than the LeSabre and 88.

A host of trim level changes and a new engine became standard for the front wheel drive Bonneville's second year. First, for the 1988 model year, Pontiac replaced the LG3 with a revised version of the same engine platform, with an increase of 10&amp;nbsp;hp and 10&amp;nbsp;ft⋅lbf (14 N⋅m) of torque. This engine has the RPO code of LN3 and is the first time the Buick 3.8 is called the 3800 V6. Other models on the H-body platform were fitted with the updated engine one year later, in 1989. The LN3 was used through 1991, until the Bonneville was once again redesigned for the 1992 model year. It features sequential-port [[fuel injection]], the LN3 produced {{convert|165|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|210|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. Also new for 1988, the base model is dropped making LE the base model. Two new models are added, the midlevel SE (went from option package to trim) and line-topper SSE. The latter features an extra deep rear valence, a spoiler, lower body cladding, a digital compass/trip computer, an eight speaker premium sound system and much more. One notable feature of the SSE was the addition of automatic leveling rear air suspensions, which also included an inflator in the trunk. For 1989, a [[compact disc]] player became optional and in 1989 a [[remote keyless entry]] system was added to the options list for all 1990 models. A facelift was also introduced for the Bonneville in the 1990 model year, with revisions to the grille &amp; headlights. Suspension revisions were introduced in 1990 for the 1991 model year. 
[[File:Greysse.jpg|thumb|A grey 1990 Pontiac Bonneville SSE.]]

They also revised the trim levels for the remaining part of this generation, removing the base trim only used for 1987, keeping the LE which makes the change of going from the top trim to the base trim, and adding the SE and SSE trims which were then available with many more comfort and convenience options standard such as, electronic climate control, a digital compass, Driver Information Center, 8-way (14-way for the SSE according to GM material) power leather seats, heated power mirrors, CD player with the premium sound package and many more. The SSE trim was exclusively equipped with an exterior sport appearance package that included body cladding, assorted ground effects, a body color grille and removal of the Bonneville door badges and Pontiac trunk badge, replacing the Bonneville trunk badge with an SSE Bonneville badge.

Unveiled on February 8, 1991, at the 1991 Chicago International Auto Show and launched in July 1991 for the 1992 model year, the interior and exterior of the car were completely redesigned. Developed over a 4 1/2 year period from 1986 to early 1991 under program director Dave Mitchell, styling work took place from 1987 to 1988, with a final design by John Folden being chosen in 1988 and frozen for production that same year. The first prototypes were built in 1989 and went into testing in mid-1989. In August 1990, production preparation began, with early production "builds" being constructed during late 1990. The first series production models were assembled in May 1991, with SE variants being launched in July 1991.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pontiacregistry.com/members/viewtopic_chapter.php?p=7421&amp;sid=b585aab6f2dd4f9a441be9679d73108c&lt;/ref&gt;

The trims were redone once again, the LE trim (which had standard six-passenger seating) was removed, the SE was now the base model (the only model to offer six-passenger seating as an option), the SSE was now the mid grade and a new top of the line trim was now added, the SSEi, which received a standard passenger-side airbag. According to GM's Pontiac division, these trim acronyms have no implied meaning.

The base and midlevel models were provided with GM's naturally-aspirated [[Buick V6 engine|3.8-liter V6]], while the SSEi received the supercharged version. All engines came paired with a 4-speed overdrive automatic transmission. SSEi models got dual airbags and antilock brakes. SE and SSE models made due with a driver-side airbag and optional ABS. This generation hosted quite a few Bonneville firsts, becoming quicker and considerably safer. One of the most notable improvements over the previous generation was that the Bonneville SE now came standard with a driver airbag and was the first General Motors product equipped with a passenger airbag, while ABS was available as part of the sport appearance package. The SSE models came with standard ABS and traction control.

The new N/A 3800 Series I (RPO: L27) engine was used, producing {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|225|lbfft|abbr=on}}, as well as the newly designed force inducted Series I 3800 (RPO: L67) equipped with an [[Eaton Corporation|Eaton]] M62 roots type [[supercharger]] which made {{convert|205|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|260|lbfft|abbr=on|0}}.  The newly revised N/A L27, for the 1992 model year only, was not equipped with an [[EGR valve|EGR Valve]], and can be distinguished by its white intake manifold, as opposed to black from 1993 and on.

For 1993, the Sport Luxury Edition (SLE RPO: H4U) was offered. This is essentially an SE sub-trim with more standard features such as leather seats, electronic climate control, automatic headlights, premium sound, and "crosslace" alloy wheels, though certain items such as electronic climate control and premium sound could be deleted from an SLE equipped car. This option package designation remained only on the RPO sticker until 1998, when SLE badges were added to the exterior of the vehicle. This continued onto the '99 model year. Many more standard options were available with the SSE. The SSEi came standard with most of the available options in the lower models, including the supercharged 3800 (RPO: L67).

For 1994, a new Generation III [[Eaton Corporation|Eaton]] M62 [[Roots type supercharger|supercharger]] came, along with new OBD-1.5 capabilities, raising the horsepower to {{convert|225|hp|abbr=on}}, while torque was raised to {{convert|275|lbfft|abbr=on}}. Also, this year introduced the new five-spoke "Torque Star" wheels. A resonator also became standard on the exhaust to lower the raspy tone that the engine produces. Passenger airbags also became standard on all models.

For 1995, the car retained the same appearance, but the SE and SSE trims received a new [[naturally aspirated]] engine, the Series II (RPO: L36). This engine made {{convert|205|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|230|lbfft|abbr=on}}. The SSEi remained equipped with the Series I SC 3800 (RPO: L67) engine until the 1996 model year, when it too was updated.

In March 2008, GM announced that these engines and other GM engines supplied with Dexcool antifreeze coolant might be prone to intake manifold failure and other problems with the cooling system if proper regular maintenance is not correctly performed. After settlement of a class-action lawsuit, GM agreed to compensate owners of many vehicles that suffered damage, regardless of negligence on the part of the consumer, if the consumer can prove damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.girardgibbs.com/docs/cases/100_Dexcool%20Long%20Form%20Notice.pdf|title=Class Action Lawsuit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1996–1999===
[[File:Bonneville 06-19-2019 2.jpg|alt=1996-1999 Pontiac Bonneville photographed in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada|thumb|1996-1999 Pontiac Bonneville]]
In September 1995, styling changes were introduced for the 1996 model year facelift. Some things were subtly reshaped, and other things, such as the tail lights, headlights, grille, and lower body cladding were drastically changed. The gap narrowed quite a bit regarding the exterior trim between packages. The previous generation showed an entirely different style of cladding and rear lighting for the SSE and SSEi, while this generation, at first glance, remains the same between the trims, with of course, the exception of the unique front bumper and grille. Also for 1996, the supercharged version of the 3800 Series II engine was introduced for the Bonneville. The SSEi and optionally the SSE got a new Eaton M90-supercharged L67, producing {{convert|240|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|280|lbfft|abbr=on}}. This engine was used from 1995 until it was retired from the Bonneville in 2003.

In 1997, Pontiac made a 40th Anniversary Edition to mark the 40th year of production of the Bonneville.  Pontiac made six models: the SE, the 40th Anniversary SE, the SSE, the 40th Anniversary SSE, the SSEi, and the 40th Anniversary SSEi. The 40th Anniversary SSEi is the rarest model with a total production of 637 units. The 40th anniversary models all had a VIN with Y40. According to GM, all L67 equipped SE's are just SE's. But, it also means that in order to have this engine, they had to have RPO H4U: Sport Luxury Edition (SLE). But since this was not a model, it had no badging in 1995 (and supposedly not for 1996-1997), it was just an option for the SE. Since the L67 was not part of the SLE option, ordering an SE with H4U would get you the mini console in the headliner, the cobra head shifter, performance/normal shift selection buttons, leather interior, chrome delete side and bumper moldings, center shift console, and touring suspension—but no supercharger. But in order to get the supercharger in an SE, you had to also pay for the SLE option. The SLE optioned SE was supposed to compete with European sedans in appearance and performance, whereas the SSEi was to be more of an American muscle sedan. A new transmission, the [[GM 4T65-E transmission|4T65-E]] was introduced in 1998 for the naturally aspirated 3800 installed in SE and SSE models, and the heavy-duty version, otherwise known as the [[GM 4T65E-HD transmission|4T65E-HD]] was introduced in 1997 for the supercharged 3800 installed in the SSEi models.

[[File:2000 Bonneville SLE Wikipedia.JPG|thumb|left|Pontiac Bonneville SLE]]
The 2000 Bonneville was redesigned from the ground up with significant advancements in design, engineering and technology which Pontiac dubbed "luxury with attitude."{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The Bonneville was now built on [[General Motors|GM's]] [[GM G platform (FWD)|G platform]],but GM chose to continue to refer to it as the H platform.&lt;ref name="Frame"/&gt; Staying true to [[Pontiac]]'s ''Wide Track'' heritage it had the widest overall track in its competitive class at 62.6&amp;nbsp;inches up front and {{convert|62.1|in|mm}} in the rear. GM's [[StabiliTrak]] stability control system was introduced on the top-of-the-line supercharged SSEi model, later replaced by the GXP.

The Bonneville regained a [[V8 engine|V8]] option on the GXP trim for 2004, its first since 1986, as a result of the discontinuation of the [[Oldsmobile Aurora]]. This opened up a "hole" in the GM lineup between Pontiac and Buick, allowing Pontiac to expand upmarket somewhat. The engine is Cadillac's {{convert|4.6|L|cuin|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac Northstar engine|Northstar]] V8, producing {{convert|275|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|300|lbfft|abbr=on}} and as Pontiac's website said, "With GXP, V8 power gets reintroduced into the Bonneville line in the form of the world-renowned 4.6 L (279 in³) Northstar V8 engine, giving {{convert|0|to(-)|60|mph|abbr=on}} in 6.5 seconds demonstrates better performance than BMW 330i and 530i, and Lexus ES. Its 3.7:1 final drive ratio is the most aggressive found on any car in its class."

NHTSA crash tests for the 2005 Pontiac Bonneville resulted in a safety rating of 4-stars for the Driver and 5-stars for the Front Passenger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/5-Star+Safety+Ratings/1990-2010+Vehicles/Search-Results?searchtype=model&amp;make=PONTIAC&amp;model=BONNEVILLE&amp;year=2005 |title=5-Star Safety Ratings |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pontiac Bonneville GXP.jpg|thumb|left|Pontiac Bonneville GXP]]For the last year of production, Pontiac gave the mid-level SLE the new GXP styling. The 2005 SLE featured all GXP styling cues, except the wheels, badging, muffler tips and engine all remained unique to the GXP.

=== Discontinuation ===
GM announced on February 8, 2005, that the Bonneville would be dropped from Pontiac's lineup for 2006. The last Bonneville left the assembly line on May 27, 2005. Only about 12,000 Bonnevilles were sold in 2005. With more than half of Pontiac dealers also selling [[Buick]] models, the [[Buick Lucerne]] along with the [[Chevrolet Impala]] continued as GM's only mainstream [[full-size car]]s until the introduction of the 2008 [[Pontiac G8|G8]].

It was the brand's first two-seater since the [[Pontiac Fiero]] was discontinued in 1988. [[File:Pontiac Solstice Dash.jpg|thumb|Interior of a 2006 Pontiac Solstice]] The Solstice was nominated for the ''[[North American Car of the Year]]'' award and ''Design of the Year'' award from the Automobile Journalists Association of Canada (AJAC) for 2006. It was a runaway hit for Pontiac, with 7,000 orders in the first 10 days of availability and 6,000 more orders before winter. Although first-year production was planned at 7,000, GM apologized to customers for delays and increased production, delivering 10,000 by March 1.

Following the 2008 economic recession, GM discontinued the Pontiac division. Production ended with the closure of the [[Wilmington Assembly]] plant in July 2009.

The ''GXP'' version of the Solstice debuted at the [[Los Angeles Auto Show#2006|Los Angeles Auto Show]] in January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press|publisher=Media.GM.com|date=January 1, 2006|url=http://archives.media.gm.com/us/gm/en/news/events/autoshows/06la/brands/pontiac/index.html|title=Pontiac Debuts 2007 Solstice GXP at LA Auto Show}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is powered by a new 2.0&amp;nbsp;Liter (121.9&amp;nbsp;[[Cubic inch displacement|cu in]]) [[Inline-four engine|I4]] Ecotec engine equipped with a dual-scroll [[turbocharger]].  The engine's output is {{cvt|260|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|260|ftlbf|0|abbr=on}}. This is the highest specific output of any engine by cubic inches in the history of General Motors at 2.1&amp;nbsp;hp (1.6&amp;nbsp;kW) per cubic inch, and it is the first [[gasoline direct injection]] engine from an American automaker. According to pontiac.com, the GXP goes 0 to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in under 5.5 seconds. A significant improvement over the 2.4 Liter versions 0-{{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} of 7.0 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pontiac 0-60 &amp; 1/4 Miles Times|url=http://www.zero2sixtytimes.com/pontiac-0-60/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other GXP features include standard [[Stabilitrak]] [[traction control system|traction control]], a [[limited-slip differential]], and [[anti-lock brakes]]. Summer tires on 18&amp;nbsp;inch wheels are standard. An available dealer installed option was a modified computer tune and two new sensors that resulted in an increased output to {{convert|290|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|340|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}, further enhancing the performance of the GXP model.

==Solstice Coupe (2009-2010)==
[[File:2009 Pontiac Solstice GXP coupe rear -- 11-13-2009.jpg|thumb|right|2009 Pontiac Solstice GXP coupe]]
A [[targa top|targa]] coupe version of the Solstice was unveiled at the [[New York Auto Show#2008|2008 New York Auto Show]]. Engine choices are the same as the convertible versions. The roof can be removed, but the hard roof cannot be fitted into the trunk. An optional cloth top is available, which can be fitted into the trunk.

The car went on sale in early 2009.&lt;ref name=ny08/&gt; The Pontiac Solstice Coupes are considered to be quite rare: There were a total of 1,266 Solstice Coupes that were able to be manufactured before the production line in Wilmington, Delaware was shut down: 102 pre-production 2009 models, 1,152 sequentially vin'd regular production 2009 models, and 12 pre-production 2010 models. This is in contrast to over 64,000 of the Pontiac Solstice Convertibles that were manufactured.

==2010 production==
Starting in April 2009 the Wilmington, DE. plant was business as usual and pre-production builds began for the 2010 model year. Between April 21, 2009 and May 28, 2009 thirty 2010 model year VIN-coded cars were built on the Kappa platform. Of those, were 12 Pontiac Solstice Coupes and 8 Pontiac Solstice roadsters. Of the other remaining, 8 were Saturn SKYs and 2 were Opel GTs. They were then used as GM company vehicles to be evaluated and also as special event display vehicles. These vehicles were built to the 2010 model year specs with 2010 model year changes and had legal 2010 VIN numbers. Following the end of use term within the GM fleet, the vehicles were sent to auction. After these 30 2010 models, more 2009-spec Solstices were produced and were the last ones made at the plant.

* The five-speed [[manual transmission]] is the same as in the [[Hummer H3]], [[GMC Canyon]], and [[Chevrolet Colorado]]
* The five-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]] is identical to those of the [[Cadillac CTS]], [[Cadillac STS|STS]], and [[Cadillac SRX|SRX]]
* The seat frames are from the previous generation [[Opel Corsa]]

==Discontinuation==
In April 2009, after GM announced the discontinuation of the Pontiac brand by the end of 2010, CEO Fritz Henderson stated that the Solstice would not continue under another GM brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ray|last=Wert|date=April 27, 2009|title=Pontiac Vibe, Solstice Are Dead, Won't Live On As Chevys|url=http://jalopnik.com/5229396/pontiac-vibe-solstice-are-dead-wont-live-on-as-chevys|publisher=[[Jalopnik.com]]|accessdate=April 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although they considered selling the Wilmington plant and the Solstice/Sky products to an outside business,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Greg|last=Migliore|date=May 11, 2009|title=GM’s Henderson offers a ray of hope for Sky, Solstice|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20090511/CARNEWS/905119989|publisher=[[AutoWeek]]|accessdate=May 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Wilmington assembly plant closed in July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press|date=June 1, 2009|title=GM Pulls Ahead U.S. Plant Closures; Reaffirms Intent to Build Future Small Car in U.S.|url=http://archives.media.gm.com/servlet/GatewayServlet?target=http://image.emerald.gm.com/gmnews/viewpressreldetail.do?domain=827&amp;docid=54632|publisher=GM Media Online|accessdate=June 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2009, the new DeLorean Motor Company expressed interest in continuing production of the Solstice, going so far as to release concept artwork for a 2011 DeLorean Solstice. These plans were shelved shortly thereafter, when [[Fisker Automotive]] instead acquired the Wilmington Assembly where the Solstice was produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EXCLUSIVE: DeLorean Motor Company Contemplating Building Pontiac Solstice|first=Matt |last=Hardigree|date=October 6, 2009|accessdate=October 8, 2009|url=http://jalopnik.com/5375647/exclusive-delorean-motor-company-contemplating-building-pontiac-solstice|publisher=[[Jalopnik]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pontiac Fiero''' is a [[Mid-engine design|mid-engined]] [[sports car]] that was built by [[General Motors]] from 1983 to 1988 for the 1984 to 1988 model years. The Fiero was designed by George Milidrag and Hulki Aldikacti as a sports car. The Fiero was the first two-seater [[Pontiac]] since the 1926 to 1938 coupes, and the first, mass-produced [[mid-engine]] sports car by a U.S. manufacturer. Many technologies incorporated in the Fiero design such as composite  panels were radical for their time. Other features included [[hidden headlamps]] and, initially, integrated stereo speakers within the driver and passenger headrests.

A total of 370,168 Fieros were produced over the relatively short production run of five years; by comparison, 163,000 [[Toyota MR2]]s were sold in their first five years.&lt;ref name="spotters_guide"&gt;{{cite book| first=Mark|last=Corbin|title=Fiero Spotter's Guide|year=1996|location=Galion, OH|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, its reputation suffered from criticisms over performance, reliability, and safety issues.

The word ''fiero'' means "proud", "fierce", "bold", "haughty" "cruel", "severe" in Italian, and "wild", "fierce", or "ferocious" in Spanish. Alternative names considered for the car were Sprint (which had previously been used on [[GMC Sprint / Caballero|a GMC]] and would later end up on [[Chevrolet Sprint|a Chevrolet]] instead), P3000, Pegasus, Fiamma, Sunfire (a name which would later be applied to [[Pontiac Sunfire|another car]]), and Firebird XP.&lt;ref name="Witzenburg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Witzenburg|first=Gary|title= Fiero|year=1986|publisher=HPBooks, Inc.|location=Tucson, Arizona|edition=First|isbn= 0895864878}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fiero ''2M4'' (two-seat, mid-engine, four-cylinder) was on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 1984. The 1984 Fiero was the Official [[Pace Car]] of the [[Indianapolis 500]] for 1984, beating out the new 1984 [[Chevrolet Corvette]] for the honor.

==History==
The Fiero was conceived as a small, two-seat sports car with all new suspension and V6 engine. While [[General Motors]] management and accountants were opposed to investing in a second two-seater sports car that might compete with the Corvette, they perceived the [[1979 energy crisis|oil crisis]] as a market opportunity for a fuel-efficient sporty commuter car. To this end, the Fiero was redesigned to use a fuel efficient version of GM's {{cvt|151|CID|L|1|disp=flip}} [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] [[Iron Duke engine]] capable of {{convert|31|mpgus|abbr=on}} in the city and {{convert|50|mpgus|abbr=on}} on the highway with the economy-ratio transmission option. These figures are [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] test-circuit results, published by Pontiac, and confirmed from multiple sources.&lt;ref name="mileage"&gt;{{cite book|last=Witzenburg|first=Gary|title= Fiero: Pontiacs Potent Mid-Engine Sports Car|publisher=Motorbooks International Publishers| location=Osceola, WI |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was impressive mileage for a 2.5&amp;nbsp;L engine of the period, and still good by today's standards, but the three-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] reduced highway mileage to only {{convert|32|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}}. With respect to fuel economy, the Fiero was intended to appeal to a market niche for which the Corvette with its [[V8 engine]] was unsuitable.

A mid-engine layout was originally chosen as a way to reduce both aerodynamic drag and vehicle weight to improve fuel efficiency, and also for its handling, traction, and braking benefits. However, the sports car potential of the mid-engine layout was not realized when the Fiero debuted. As a cost-saving measure commonly employed at GM, the tires, brakes, and suspension components were carried over from other GM economy cars (like the [[GM X platform (1980)|X]] and [[GM T platform (1973)|T platforms]]). As a result, the handling and cornering abilities of the initial Fiero were merely on par with other contemporary sporty coupes (''Road &amp; Track'' 1985). Additionally, the Iron Duke I4 motor, which was designed for optimal running at low RPM, was unsuited to drivers who purchased the Fiero expecting a quick, high-revving motor more in keeping with the design of the car. As drivers attempted to frequently run the engine at greater RPM than it was designed for, the engines experienced a number of reliability problems and breakdowns were frequent.

The public had high expectations for the Fiero with its mid-engine layout and aggressive styling, which resembled exotic mid-engine sports cars like the [[Ferrari 308 GTB/GTS|Ferrari 308GTB]]. While initially garnering good reviews for its handling (Motor Trend 1984), the Fiero soon received negative reviews from other automotive critics who expected higher performance from a mid-engine two-seater. Despite the critical press, the Fiero sold well and although Pontiac operated three shifts at the factory during 1984, they could not keep up with initial demand.&lt;ref name="speech"/&gt;

The sharing of [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] and other components with other GM cars meant the rear suspension and [[powertrain]] was virtually identical to that of the Citation and [[Pontiac Phoenix]]; the Fiero even included rear [[tie rod]] ends attached to a "steering knuckle", although these were hard-mounted to the engine cradle and only used for maintaining the rear tire alignment. The front suspension was derived from the [[Chevrolet Chevette|Chevette]], and Chevette enthusiasts found that they could upgrade their undersized front brakes and rotors using Fiero parts.

By 1985, the oil crisis was long past and demand developed for a Fiero having more engine power and better sports car performance. Pontiac responded by introducing the GT model which included upgraded suspension tuning, wider tires, and a [[V6 engine|V6]] engine having {{convert|43|hp|kW|abbr=on}} more than the base four-cylinder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nQAAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=pontiac+Fiero#v=onepage&amp;q=pontiac%20Fiero&amp;f=false|title=Popular Science|work=google.com|date=February 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in 1988, numerous changes were made to the Fiero to bring it in line with its original design. The most significant was a completely redesigned suspension (and parts of the space frame) to realize the potential of the mid-engine layout. The unique suspension included new two-piece brake calipers and upgraded brake rotors.  These had been part of Fiero's initial design, but cost-cutting kept them from being implemented sooner.&lt;ref name="CanadianDriver1"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.canadiandriver.com/articles/bv/fiero.htm|title=Motoring Memories: Pontiac Fiero, 1984–1988|publisher=Canadian Driver|date=May 3, 2004|last=Vance|first=Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; The available I4 and V6 engines benefited from evolutionary improvements, but the planned availability of [[turbocharger]]s and newer [[Overhead camshaft#Dual overhead camshaft|DOHC]] engines did not happen before production stopped. In spite of the much-improved car which finally had realized its potential after years of mismanagement, GM ended production after the 1988 model year due to declining sales figures. Bad press and consumer sentiment frequently cited [[#Engine fire reputation|heavy media coverage of Fiero engine fires]], as well as the poor reliability and performance of the 1984–1987 models.

==Design==
The Fiero turned out to be an unusual design for GM, one which stood out from the rest of their product lines. The company had rejected development of a sporty, two-seater Pontiac since the late 1960s, as they believed it would steal sales from the [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]]. However, young Pontiac engineers in 1978 were able to sell the Fiero concept to the corporation as a fuel-efficient four-cylinder "commuter car" that just happened to have two seats, rather than a muscle car. When the engineers brought back a running [[prototype]] in less than six months, corporate bought it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ingrassia|first=Paul|author2=Joseph B. White|title=Victim of success|journal=AutoWeek|date=19 September 1994|volume=44|issue=38|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the budget for the car, from design to building the machines for making the parts, was 400 million dollars, just a fraction of what GM generally spent on bringing a typical prototype car into production. Pontiac assigned oversight of the Fiero to Hulki Aldikacti, a Turkish immigrant with a master's degree in mechanical engineering from the [[University of Michigan]] and an MBA from [[Michigan State University]] along with nearly 22 years of experience.&lt;ref name="Witzenburg" /&gt;

Aldikacti's initial challenge was with GM's corporate structure, which split its engineers into two categories: the car engineers who would create blueprints for the car, and manufacturing engineers who would work out the fabrication and assembly issues. Fiero blueprints traveled back and forth between the two engineering branches, using up time and money. Aldikacti was forced to sit the two teams of engineers down next to one another, allowing for no excuses as to why there was “no build” after his design was done. Many modifications in the Fiero's production needed to be made; for instance, despite his long-standing interest in manufacturing body panels from plastic, Aldikacti consented to metal body pieces, the dies for which were much less costly.&lt;ref name="Witzenburg" /&gt;

As the prototypes took shape, the exterior lines resembled more of a Ferrari or Porsche than a typical GM car, but the tight budget was taking its toll on the design, particularly on Aldikacti's dream of a high performance, aluminum-block V6; the cost of developing a new engine would be more than the production of the whole car itself. Instead, Aldikacti was forced to settle for the already manufactured four-cylinder engine GM produced for the Pontiac, the “Iron Duke,” nicknamed for its heavy iron block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vasilash|first=Gary S.|title=How the Pontiac Fiero helped save the North American steel industry|journal=Automotive Manufacturing &amp; Production|date=January 1999|volume=111|issue=1|pages=62–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; This engine was too blocky to fit into the tiny car so it was equipped with a smaller oil pan, causing the engine to always run a quart low. {{Dubious |2.5L L4 Oil Pan Capacity|date=July 2019}}

Aldikacti's unorthodox design methods and personal manner made him unpopular to most of GM's bureaucracy. Three times he was told by counterparts at other GM divisions that his project had been cancelled by corporate management. However, the Fiero project was kept alive at the wishes of certain high-ranked defenders, chief among them [[William Hoglund]], who took over Pontiac in 1980. Hoglund took the reins as the division was suffering from the loss of their hot rods in the late 1970s; Pontiac's cars were said to be bland, outdated, and what customers of the past would buy. In 1983 Hoglund told his top three dozen staffers that Pontiac would rebuild itself with cars that were “exciting” and “different.” These terms only described one of Pontiac's cars in their current lineup, Aldikacti's "commuter car." In order to build the 100,000 cars a year Hoglund's marketing team committed to sell, Hoglund negotiated a deal to reopen a plant once shut down in the heart of [[Pontiac, Michigan]]. He and his staff wanted to prove that cooperation between management and labor could be solved without the use of robots on the assembly line, which GM's top executives wanted to use. Hoglund allowed hourly workers to name Aldikacti's car; "Fiero" was their choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tegler|first=Eric|title=Woulda, Coulda, Shuolda|journal=AutoWeek|date=3 December 2007|volume=57|issue=49|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production years==

===1984===
[[File:1984 Pontiac Fiero 2M4 SE (21717695095).jpg|right|thumb|1984 Fiero 2M4 SE]]
[[File:1984 Pontiac Indy Fiero at Belmont, front right.jpg|thumb|1984 Pontiac Fiero Indy Pace Car replica]]

The Fiero began production in August 1983. In an effort to sell the car as economically sensible, GM equipped and sold the Fiero as a commuter car; although the marketing build-up leading to initial release indicated anything but a regular commuter. The car also proved uncomfortable for some drivers because of the lack of power steering.&lt;ref name="Witzenburg" /&gt;

At the beginning of production the Fiero was only available in Red (M71) and White (M40) with Black (M41) and Light Gray Metallic (M14) introduced later, the paint shop was only able to handle four different colors at a time. All 1984s came with the same 2.5&amp;nbsp;L I4.&lt;ref name="Witzenburg" /&gt;

Although sales literature listed only two models available in 1984, there were at least three models available with different option packages. There was the Fiero Coupe, the Sport Coupe and the SE. The Fiero Coupe, also called "Fuel Economy Leader", came with the MY-8 4-speed manual transaxle that had a 0.73 overdrive top gear along with a high mpg 3.32:1 axle ratio. This gave it an [[EPA]] highway/city rating of 50/31 mpg. Air conditioning and automatic transaxle could not be ordered. The starting price for the Fiero Coupe was $7999. The Fiero Sport Coupe, also referred to as the "base car", came with the M-19 four-speed manual with a 0.81 top gear along with 4.10:1 differential, giving it better acceleration at the cost of fuel economy, 42/26 mpg. An automatic 3-speed transmission, MD-9 Hydramatic 125-C, was available along with A/C. The starting price was $8499 for the Sport Coupe. The top model was the Fiero SE, starting at $9599, it included the WS-6 handling package along with other trim upgrades.&lt;ref name="Witzenburg" /&gt;

Fiero marketing included title sponsorship of [[Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates]] tour supporting the release of their ''[[Big Bam Boom]]'' album.  From November 1984 through 1985, each tour venue had Fiero banners and signage above the main stage, new Fieros on display, and Pontiac dealer ticket giveaways. Sales managers at Pontiac dealerships also received a limited edition "Pontiac Fiero Presents Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates" vinyl greatest hits album enticing them to participate in the sponsorship tour. The LP was ''[[Rock 'n Soul Part 1]]''. The album cover featured Hall &amp; Oates standing with a red 1984 Fiero SE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, for marketing reasons, the 1984 base model was featured in a 1983 episode of the television show "Hardcastle &amp; McCormick".

Concurrent with the development of the production car was the development by Huffaker Engineering of a Fiero to compete in IMSA's GTU road racing series. Clay Young was the team entrant and primary driver, with occasional guest appearances by [[John Oates]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The 1984 model line included a limited "Indy Pace Car" edition, consisting of an [[Indianapolis 500]]-themed option package on ''SE''-model vehicles (a package that was specially reissued in 1985). Approximately 2,000 of these vehicles were sold. The Indy had aero body cladding and new front and rear fascias that would be used on the 1985 GT. Only the underpowered four-cylinder engine was available, though a few prototypes could be seen driving around the Greater Detroit area with a unique periscope-style inlet sprouting from the engine compartment and curving up and over the roof. This "periscope" style inlet was used on the three actual Indy Pace Car Fieros used at the 1984 Indianapolis 500. This inlet scoop, and the [[Pontiac V8 engine#SD4|{{cvt|165|CID|L|1|disp=flip}} Super Duty engine]] that they fed, were not available on the production model Pace Car Edition. The Super Duty engine produced {{cvt|232|bhp}} at 6500 rpm and {{cvt|210|lbft}} of torque at 5500 rpm. Pontiac's General Manager Bill Hoglund named John Callies to drive the actual pace car at Indy. Callies was the factory's lead engineer on both the pace car and IMSA programs. Fiero became the first 4-cylinder car to pace the 500 since a Stoddard-Dayton paced the 1914 race.&lt;ref name="Witzenburg" /&gt;

The production of the 1984 model ran from July 1983 until almost the end of 1984, this resulted in Pontiac exceeding its first year goal of 80,000 units, which was 28,000 more 2-seaters anyone had sold before in the US, by about 56,000 cars.&lt;ref name="Witzenburg" /&gt;

===1985===
[[File:1985 Pontiac Fiero GT rear right.jpg|thumb|1985 Pontiac Fiero GT (rear)]]
The 1985 Fiero did not appear in showrooms until January 1985, with the introduction of the GT model, which looked very similar to the 1984 Indy model without the decals or body color wheels. The three models, and four colors, from the previous year were still available, but the problem with insufficient power was addressed, much to the satisfaction of the general public. A [[GM 60-degree V6 engine#L44|{{cvt|2.8|L|CID}} V6 engine]] rated at {{cvt|140|hp}} and {{cvt|170|lbft}} was put into the car, satisfying most critics of the base engine. The High Output V6 was paired with a modified Muncie 4-speed transmission. The four-cylinder engine was slightly modified, adding roller lifters and about {{cvt|2|hp}}. It could now also be paired with a Japanese-designed [[Isuzu]] five-speed transmission as used in the [[GM J platform|J-body platform]], also produced at the [[Muncie, Indiana]] plant.&lt;ref name="Witzenburg" /&gt;

[[File:1986 Pontiac Fiero GT (9798747455).jpg|right|thumb|1986 Fiero GT]]

The 1986 Fiero arrived on 12 September 1985, however, the GT model was not originally listed. The previous year's GT became the 1986 SE. The 1986 GT was delayed until 3 January 1986. This was the first time the fastback roofline was offered, sometimes referred to as a "1986½" model, as the new fastback body restyle was not yet ready for release at the start of the model year. Though originally conceived by Pontiac insiders as a new model, possibly called the "GTP" or "GTU," it has been said that GM management at the time felt that using "GTP" or "GTU" suggested a racing car and thus an image they did not want to promote. Individuals present at the unveiling of the new fastback roof style, in February 1984, at [[General Motors Proving Grounds#Desert Proving Ground Yuma|GM's Arizona test track]], actually thought it was a new Corvette at first. The [[Getrag 282 transmission|Muncie/Getrag 5-speed transaxle]], which did not arrive until June 1986, became the standard transaxle in V6 models. Models equipped with the four-cylinder engine remained largely unchanged. Red and Light Gray Metallic were dropped as colors with Light Gold Metallic (M56), Silver Metallic (M16) and Bright Red (M81) being added. The clutch hydraulic systems were redesigned with new master and slave cylinders.&lt;ref name="Witzenburg" /&gt;

===1987===
[[File:PontiacMera1987.jpg|alt=Pontiac Mera|thumb|Pontiac Mera]]
1987 saw changes to the front and rear fascias on the "base coupe" with the SE and GT models keeping the same "Aero" nose. The new non-aero noses lost the black bumper pads of the earlier models and had a smoother look. The four-cylinder engine's power rating increased to {{cvt|98|hp}} with some major modifications which included a roller cam, redesigned intake manifold, [[Distributor#Direct and distributorless ignition|distributorless ignition system]] (DIS), open combustion chamber cylinder head and upgraded throttle-body fuel injection system. This was the last year for the spin-on oil filter on the four-cylinder. Bright Blue (M21) and Medium Red Metallic (M77) were added and replacing the ribbed black molding was the round style found on the GT models. As a side note, the SE models retained the ribbed molding, and added the aero nose found on the GT.&lt;ref name="Witzenburg" /&gt; Redesigned headlight motors appeared in 1987. Additionally, starting with the 1987 model Pontiac dealerships offered an upgrade in the form of an "option" that changed the original body to a [[Pininfarina]] [[Ferrari 308 GTB/GTS|Ferrari 308]]-type body, called the Fiero Mera. Corporate Concepts completed the "Mera" transformation and none were sold as kit form. The Mera body change was offered only on new Fieros, sold through Pontiac dealers and is considered a model in its own right. Only 247 Meras were produced by Corporate Concepts before production was halted when sued by Ferrari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For $9,900, You're Still Not Tom Selleck|url=http://jalopnik.com/5655696/for-9900-youre-still-not-tom-selleck|website=jalopnik.com|publisher=Kinja|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dickman|first1=Rodney|title=Pontiac Fiero Mera|url=http://www.fiero.net/mera/article.html|publisher=Fiero.net|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1988===
[[File:White 1988 Fiero Formula.jpg|thumb|1988 Fiero Formula]]
The 1988 Fiero brought a new suspension design, thought by many to have a striking resemblance to those designed by [[Lotus (car)|Lotus]], which at the time, was about to be acquired by General Motors. The suspension was never a Lotus design though; it was the suspension the Pontiac engineers had designed in the beginning, along with what they learned from the racing program. Up front were revised control arms and knuckles that reduced steering effort and improved the scrub radius. In the back, the old Citation parts were replaced with a real tri-link suspension with all new knuckles. This new suspension came with staggered wheel sizes on WS6 suspension equipped models, with {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on}} by {{convert|6|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide wheels up front and {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on}} by {{convert|7|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide wheels in the rear for improved handling balance and to offset the slightly increased front track that resulted from the improvements. Topping off the package were the new vented disc brakes at all four corners, which addressed braking complaints of road testers. A variable effort electro-hydraulic [[power steering]] unit, the same design later found on the [[GM EV1]], was also to be a late addition. This option never made it to production&amp;nbsp;– one reason cited is that models with the prototype power steering were noted as being too loud. The four-cylinder engine received an in-pan oil filter element and balance shaft. A "Formula" option was added, which offered many of the GT features with the standard coupe body, including the {{convert|120|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} speedometer, WS6 Suspension (which includes offset crosslace wheels) and the rear spoiler. 1988 marked the end of production for the Fiero, and is also considered to be the best Fiero produced. Improvements to suspension, brakes, steering, and improvements to both the four-cylinder and V6 engines took the car to a level far beyond the 1984 model that had received much criticism. 1988 was also the only year a yellow exterior color was available as a factory option. During the Fiero's final model year (on August 16, 1988) the last window sticker was placed on the last Fiero to roll off the [[Pontiac, Michigan]] plant line. The 1988 Fiero is the most desired by automotive collectors because of the improvements made to the 1988 model year, and this being the last year of production. The 1988 Mera seen as the most sought after model and tops the Fiero list in resale value this model is commonly used to create "kit cars" (replicas of high end sports cars).

===1990 (prototype)===
[[File:90 Proto (Small).JPG|left|thumb|1989/1990 Fiero Prototype, displayed at the 2006 Michigan Fiero Club show, "Fieros at the Hall".]]

[[File:90 dash pod (Small).JPG|right|thumb|1989/1990 Fiero Prototype, Interior.]]

A prototype of the never-produced 1990 Fiero was displayed at the 20th Anniversary show in July 2003, at Fierorama 2005, at the Michigan show in 2006 and most recently at the 25th Anniversary Show in Pontiac, Michigan in 2008. Continued showing of the prototype may no longer be an option in the near future, as GM has taken to cutting funding to relieve the pressure of its financial woes. GM Heritage Center continues storing the 1989/1990 Fiero. Many of the 89/90 coupe prototypes have been demolished in a scrap yard in Australia.

Much of its design influence is apparent in the [[Pontiac Firebird#Fourth generation (1993–2002)|Fourth Generation Firebird]]. New engines were proposed for the 1990 model year, from the then new DOHC {{convert|190|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Quad 4 engine|"Quad 4" four-cylinder]] as a base engine to replace the 2.5&amp;nbsp;L "Iron Duke" to a new 200+ hp DOHC V-6 for the GT models. Even a 231&amp;nbsp;CID (3.8&amp;nbsp;L) Buick Turbo V6 powered Fiero is rumored to have been seen at a test track.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The single 1990 Fiero GT prototype had an early version of the upcoming DOHC V-6 that would be put into production in the [[Pontiac Grand Prix|Grand Prix]] and [[Lumina Z34]] in the early 1990s. This engine developed more than {{convert|200|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.

GM cited slumping and unprofitable sales of the Fiero as the reason for its demise following its 5th model year.

==Technical features==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}

===Suspension design===
84–87 front suspension is a wider direct derivative of the [[Chevrolet Chevette]] and Pontiac T1000. It employs a double A-arm (or double wishbone) design common prior to the advent of struts, and has naturally good geometry. A drawback of this design, however, means that the car's front suspension has four [[ball joint]]s. Nevertheless, the tie-rods allow toe-in/out adjustability. Minimal camber adjustments exist on 1984 to 1987 models without an after-market upgrade that replaces the upper ball joints with slotted mounting points units. The joints have typical grease fittings for regular lubrication commonly found on pre-2000 autos.

The rear suspension is essentially a GM X-car's (Chevrolet Citation, Buick Skylark, Oldsmobile Omega and Pontiac Phoenix) front suspension moved to the rear of the Fiero. The uppers are top-plates and [[Chapman strut]]s, while the lowers are attached with ball joints. In lieu of the steering rack which would have been installed in an X-car, tie rod ends are attached to the engine cradle and used to align the rear wheels.

The four-wheel independent suspension provides uncharacteristically accurate handling for a vehicle of its size and price range. However, due to the use of multiple suspension pivot and attachment points (similar to the Corvette's suspension architecture), maintaining the suspension is more costly than some less technical suspension systems.

With the 1988 model year came a completely new front and rear suspension with vented disc brakes at all four corners- what Pontiac's engineers had planned for the car to have from the beginning. The front suspension geometry was changed to decrease the scrub radius thus decreasing steering effort without adding a bulky power steering system. The camber curve was also much improved, the dampers are moved inside the coil springs, and new sealed bearing/hub units were used in 1988. The rear suspension featured multi-link (two lateral links and one trailing arm) Chapman strut suspension, and the tie-rod related bump steer experienced with the earlier suspension design was fixed. The brakes were also upgraded to {{convert|10.5|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} vented rotors on the front and rear with an improved slide caliper design having larger diameter slides. The Fiero Formula (new for 1988) and Fiero GT models also received a rear anti-sway bar to complement non-progressive rate springs.

The 1984–1987 frames will accept a 1988 rear cradle. However, the struts must be replaced with a narrower diameter [[Carrera coil-over]] unit with a steel tube extension and offset mounting plates added to replace the Chapman strut unit, thus yielding a larger, 1984–1987 engine compartment with the ride-quality benefits of the 1988 suspension.

In the August 1985 issue of ''[[Road &amp; Track]]'', the Fiero was tested against six other sports cars. The slalom results (MPH): [[Honda CRX|Honda Civic CRX Si]]: 62.5 [[Toyota MR2]]: 61.6
Pontiac Fiero: 61.5 [[Alfa Romeo Spider|Alfa Romeo Graduate]]: 58.4
[[Fiat X1/9|Bertone X1/9]]: 58.3 [[Mazda RX-7|Mazda RX-7 GSL]]: 57.2

**2nd Gear: 1.60
**3rd Gear: 1.00
**Reverse: 2.07

====Four-speed manual====
All four-speed [[manual transmission]]s were built at the [[Muncie, Indiana]] [[Allison Transmission|Allison]] plant. The 1984 production line saw two transmissions, a performance four-speed with a final drive ratio of 4.10, and an economy four-speed with a final drive ratio of 3.32. The V6 on the 1985 model and part of the 1986 production year came with a four-speed with a final drive ratio of 3.65. The lower-geared 4.10 four-speed transmission showed improved acceleration, but sacrificed fuel economy.

====Five-speed manual====
[[Isuzu]] and Muncie (Getrag)- five-speed transmissions were available, depending on model and equipment beginning in 1985 for the Isuzu five-speed which came on four-cylinder cars and in 1986 for the Muncie five-speed which came on V6 equipped cars. The [[Getrag 282]] five-speed is sometimes referred to as the Muncie 282 or the Muncie Getrag 282, as the design was licensed to General Motors for manufacture by Muncie (Getrag never built the 282). This Muncie transmission is the stronger unit, designed for use with the higher output of the V6.

===Crash safety===
The Pontiac Fiero, being popularly known as being "made entirely of fiberglass," is wrongly accused of being unsafe in a collision.

The Fiero, with its unique plastic body-on-spaceframe design, helped the Fiero achieve a NHTSA NCAP frontal crash test rating of five stars, the highest rating available.

According to Hemmings Motor News, the exceedingly sturdy, {{convert|600|lb|kg|abbr=on}} space frame consisted of roughly 280 separate galvanized and high-strength steel stampings joined by 3,800&amp;nbsp;welds and, when assembled with the Fiero's mechanicals, was fully driveable without its skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hemmings.com|url=http://www.hemmings.com/hmn/stories/2009/08/01/hmn_feature21.html|title=Space Age Space Frame &amp;#124; Hemmings Motor News|publisher= Hemmings.com|accessdate=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fiero's body panels are purely cosmetic and carry no structural load. The Fiero was the second safest vehicle sold in America from 1984 to 1988, bested only by the Volvo 740DL station wagon.

The official crash test scores were as follows:

*Head Injury Criterion – 356.5/308.6
*Chest Deceleration (G) – 30.9/29.9
*Femur Load (LB) – Left 840/800 Right 800/740&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/database/aspx/searchmedia2.aspx?database=v&amp;tstno=667&amp;mediatype=r&amp;r_tstno=667|title=NHTSA VSR &amp;#124; Search Media Page|publisher=Nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov|accessdate=September 22, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304105526/http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/database/aspx/searchmedia2.aspx?database=v&amp;tstno=667&amp;mediatype=r&amp;r_tstno=667|archivedate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safecarguide.com/mak/pontiac/idx.htm|title=Pontiac Crash-Test Results, Pontiac Safety Information, Pontiac Insurance Data, NHTSA, NCAP, IIHS, Bonneville, Montana, Vibe, GTO, Firebird, Aztec, Fiero, LeMans, Trans Am, Grand Prix, Grand Am, Sunfire, Transport, Sunbird, 6000, 2000|publisher=Safecarguide.com|accessdate=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fiero's technologically advanced spaceframe technology went on to be incorporated in the Saturn S-Series cars and the 1990-96 GM U platform minivans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=the Auto Editors of Consumer Guide|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/pontiac16.htm|title=HowStuffWorks "Pontiac Fiero"|publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com|date=June 8, 2007|accessdate=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems and issues==

===Engine fire reputation===
Of the total production of the Pontiac Fiero of 370,168,&lt;ref name="spotters_guide"/&gt; 135 (.036%) of them were reported to have had engine fires, 122 of these occurred while driving, according to the [[NHTSB|NHTSA]].

The engine fires almost exclusively pertained to the 1984 model year. Later model years were produced with upgraded equipment, and frequency of engine fire was significantly reduced.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

According to AutoWeeks publication of Fiero firing squad, on October 6, 1983 a Pontiac engineer wrote an urgent memo to report that two Fieros had suddenly caught fire during test drives. This was only 3 months after the production of the Fiero began at the Pontiac plant. It was thought to be caused by antifreeze leaking out of badly installed hoses but in reality it was defective connecting rods. After one meeting with the [[Saginaw]] foundry manager, he wrote that “…60 percent to 90 percent of the rods produced do not exhibit defects.” This means at least every 1 out of 10 rods produced were defective and possibly 4 out of 10 were also defective.
The Associated Press quoted the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] as saying it had "...received 148 complaints regarding Pontiac Fieros catching fire including reports of six injuries.... Low levels of engine [[oil]] may cause a connecting rod to break, allowing oil to escape and come into contact with engine parts. The oil would catch fire when it contacted the exhaust manifold or hot exhaust components.... David Hudgens, a GM spokesman in [[Detroit]]... said, 'If you ran out of oil, and then that coupled with some aggressive driving, perhaps, and maybe not changing the oil very often, you end up with a broken rod, and that's where the connecting rod came in; it is still the owner's responsibility to check the oil.' "&lt;ref name="fire_danger"&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Steps Up Probe of Alleged Fire Danger in Pontiac Fieros| agency=Associated Press|work=Fiero Owner newsletter|date=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pontiac]] division claimed in a 1988 press release that "GM tests have shown that running these 1984 cars with low engine oil level can cause connecting rod failure which may lead to an engine compartment fire.... Pontiac is aware of 260 fires attributable to the condition, along with ten reported minor injuries."&lt;ref name="pontiac_division"&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Pontiac Division of GM|date=November 25, 1987|title=Pontiac Division Release|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The larger of the two reported numbers of cars with fires (260) amounts to 0.07% of Fiero models produced. The fires affected the 2.5&amp;nbsp;L engine almost exclusively, and mostly 1984 models (although there may have been additional occurrences after the above reports were published).

There are several possible contributors to Fiero engines catching fire. The primary cause is thought to be a batch of poorly cast connecting rods, produced in GM's [[Saginaw]] plant, which failed when the oil level became too low. One theory is that the sports car styling attracted buyers who would drive the car hard, most notably by excessively revving the engine. Another factor was the incorrectly listed three-quart oil capacity; the actual oil capacity is 4.5&amp;nbsp;quarts, but a misprint on the [[dipstick]] and in the owner's manual resulted in owners using only three quarts, any leakage or consumption would allow the oil level to decline over time to a dangerously low level. If the proper oil level was not maintained, the bearings could seize, snapping the porous castings of the connecting rods. This could result in a hole being punched in the engine block, allowing oil to spray onto hot exhaust components where it could ignite.

Alternatively, some fires may have been because of the engine wiring harness bulkhead connector (C500) being located in the center of the engine bay above the exhaust manifold, where heat could possibly melt and ignite the wiring. The 1984 model had a magnesium grille over this area. In later models, the main engine harness connector (C500) was moved to the battery area, and was improved to some degree with better heat shielding wrapped around the wiring harness.

A third cause might be cracks in the engine block from overtightening the head bolts. Some engines developed cracks in the block that would leak coolant and/or oil, sometimes accompanied by broken head bolts directly above the crack. The leak would spray coolant or oil, the latter resulting in fire if sprayed onto the hot catalytic converter or exhaust manifold at the front of the engine compartment.

Most vehicles existing today have been serviced by GM during one of the safety recalls on the car.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} For the fire-related recall, shields and drip-trays were added to prevent leaking fluids from contacting hot surfaces. The presence of drip shields between the engine block and the exhaust manifold are a clue that the car has been retrofitted. The addition of the longer [[AC Delco]] PF51 oil filter and a re-calibrated dipstick added extra oil capacity to the oiling system, and enabled running four quarts of oil in the crankcase instead of three, to help prevent oil starvation to the rods. Certain vehicles also had their connecting rods or entire block replaced.

Any fires that happen today would most likely not be caused by the aforementioned causes, but instead due to faulty repairs and failure of engine components, wiring, etc. due to age.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Cooling system issues===
With a normal [[operating temperature]] of {{convert|220|F|C|abbr=on}} prior to the recall switching to a {{convert|195|F|C|abbr=on}} thermostat, the midmounted engine utilized long pipes to carry coolant to the front-mounted radiator. This demanded that a special coolant filling procedure be followed to prevent air pockets, as with many modern cars. Simply pouring coolant into the thermostat housing (on the engine) might leave an air bubble in the radiator, while adding coolant just to the radiator might leave an air bubble in the engine's coolant passages. Proper procedure (with engine idling and the thermostat removed, filling the thermostat housing, popping the bubble out of the radiator by cracking open the radiator cap until coolant exits) must be followed in order to ensure an air-free cooling system.

Another problem has become common since more Fieros are being serviced by auto repair shops not familiar with their design. The underbody coolant tubes are positioned in a manner in which not even a casual glance underneath the vehicle could determine their vulnerability. As a result, many of them have been crushed by shop lifts, resulting in a near complete lack of engine cooling.

==Today==

[[File:Fiero with LS3 Corvette Engine.jpg|right|thumb|Customized Fiero with Corvette LS3 engine.]]

Currently the Fiero has a cult following of owners and customizers. While all Fiero models are considered to be collectible, the 1988 model year is particularly sought after by collectors due to its limited production numbers and vastly improved underpinnings. Because of an abundance of replacement parts available from other General Motors vehicles, there are many upgrades that can be done to improve performance and reliability of the cars. Additionally, a multitude of different General Motors engines have been installed by enthusiasts, from the [[Quad-4]] engine to the [[Chevrolet small-block V8]] to the Cadillac 4.9&amp;nbsp;L and Northstar V8s. The GM 3800 Supercharged is also a very popular choice, as well as the 3.4&amp;nbsp;L found in the 1993, 1994, and 1995 Camaro/Firebird. One shop in particular that pioneered and now specializes in V8 installations has even gone so far as to install the famed Z06 Corvette powerplant, the 505&amp;nbsp;horsepower LS7, into a Fiero. Installation of the 4.9&amp;nbsp;L V8 or smaller engines is possible with few modifications to the car itself, because Fiero prototypes were tested with a similar small aluminum V8 prior to production.&lt;ref name="speech"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Aldikacti|first=Hulki|date=July 2003|title= Speech given to the Classic Fiero Owners Group, International (CFOGi)|booktitle=20th Anniversary of the Introduction of the Fiero Celebration}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the engine bay is large enough to accommodate engines of that size.
[[File:Fiero ChopTop &amp; StockTop Compare.jpg|right|thumb|Chopping the top on a Fiero is a popular modification.]]
A large following of owners still exists with many web pages, groups, and clubs devoted to the car, and the basic chassis is commonly used as a kit-car platform from wild custom rebodies to [[Ferrari Testarossa]] and [[Ferrari F355]] replicas.

===Legacy===
When the Fiero's 1984 model was introduced, it played a major role in building the “excitement” image that the Pontiac Division Motor Company wanted to establish in its car buyers.  This car pioneered new concepts such as the participation of autoworkers in production methods as well as new materials provide a showcase as the first production car in the world to use a space/frame chassis with a separate body shell composed of SMC Sheet Molded Composite. According to Design News, Pontiac engineers pointed out that the Fiero experience helped the company to develop the sporty look of the [[Pontiac Grand Am|Grand Am]] and [[Pontiac Sunbird|Sunbird]], as well as “road car” features in the once-traditional [[Pontiac Bonneville|Bonneville]] and [[Pontiac Grand Prix|Grand Prix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pontiac Bids farewell to the Future|journal=Design News|date=3 October 1988|volume=44|issue=19|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such Fiero advances as the composite skin lived on in new GM products like the [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fierosails.com/BodyPanels.html|title=Body Panels|work=fierosails.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scale models===
Fiero models and die-cast replicas have come and gone over the years. [[Hot Wheels]] released a 1984 Fiero 2M4 under many paint schemes. These Hot Wheels cars are now very rare. [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]] and [[Majorette (toy manufacturer)|Majorette]] also released Fiero models during the car's heyday. [[Monogram models|Monogram]] has released and re-released a 1985 Fiero GT model (the re-release is currently available). In recent years, a large 1:18 die-cast model of a 1985 GT has been released in red and silver. In 2007 the [[Motor Max]] toy company began releasing small die-cast Fiero GT toys under the 'American Graffiti' and 'Fresh Cherries' lines. Select [[Wal-Mart]] locations sold a special "Since '68" Fiero made by Hot Wheels, which uses the original 1984 mold with a new paint job.
The [[Kenner]] toy line [[M.A.S.K.]] had a black Fiero GT that converted into a glider craft and three wheeled chopper, called "Fireforce." [[Tonka|Tonka's]] toy line [[Gobots]] included a character, "Sparky", who converted into a 1984 Fiero 2M4 (called a "P-car" on the packaging). Also worth mention is the ''Transformers'' character [[Punch/Counterpunch]], a spy who converts into a vehicle looking similar to a 1985 Fiero GT, but modified to avoid trademark issues.
Other plastic-kit display models were released by MPC-[[Ertl Company|ERTL]] in 1:25 scale. One was a 1984 2M4 kit 10883, the other was 1987 (essentially identical to 1986) GT kit 6401.

The '''Grand Prix''' is a line of automobiles produced by the [[Pontiac|Pontiac Division]] of [[General Motors]] from 1962 through 2002 for coupes and 1988–2008 for sedans. First introduced as part of Pontiac's [[full-size car]] model offering for the 1962 model year, the marque varied repeatedly in size, luxury, and performance during its lifespan.  Among the changes were positioning in the [[personal luxury car]] market segment and [[mid-size car]] offering from the 2nd generation to the 5th generation for the sedan and from the 2nd generation to the 6th generation from the coupe; it returned to a full-size car from the 6th generation to the 7th generation for the sedan, positioned below the larger [[Pontiac Bonneville|Bonneville]] in Pontiac's model lineup.

The Grand Prix first appeared in the Pontiac line for the 1962 model year, as a performance-oriented replacement for the [[Pontiac Ventura|Ventura]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1962_Pontiac/album/1962%20Pontiac-22-23.html |title=1962 Pontiac album |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=2012-01-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509182210/http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1962_Pontiac/album/1962%20Pontiac-22-23.html |archivedate=May 9, 2013 }}{{Verify source|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became a luxury trim level of the [[full-size car|full-size]] [[Pontiac Catalina|Catalina]] It was essentially a standard Catalina coupe with minimal outside chrome trim and a sportier interior (bucket seats and a center console). The performance-minded [[John DeLorean]], head of Advanced Engineering at Pontiac, contributed to the development of both the Grand Prix and the [[Pontiac GTO|GTO]]. Early models were available with Pontiac performance options, including the factory-race [[Pontiac V8 engine#421|Super Duty 421]] powertrain installed in a handful of 1962 and 1963 cars.

The full-size Catalina-based Grand Prix sold well through the 1960s.

===1962===
[[File:1962 Pontiac Grand Prix in red.jpg|thumb|left|1962 Pontiac Grand Prix]]
The first Grand Prix was a Catalina hardtop coupe trimmed to standards similar to the larger top-line Bonneville, with a distinctive grille and taillights. The bucket seats were upholstered in Morrokide vinyl, while nylon loop-blend carpeting covered the floor and lower door panels. The center console-mounted transmission shifter included a storage compartment and a tachometer. The rear bench seat included a center fold-down armrest and a speaker grille that could be made functional with the extra-cost Bi-Phonic rear speaker. Included were a padded instrument panel, deluxe steering wheel, courtesy lights, and other features.

Base price was US$3,490. The standard engine was the Bonneville's {{convert|303|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{convert|389|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, which came with four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts. [[Tri-Power]] carburation (with three two-barrels) raised output to {{convert|318|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. Two other high-performance 389s were offered, including a four-barrel version rated at {{convert|333|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and a {{convert|348|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Tri-Power. Late in the model year a "street" version of the race-orientated 421 Pontiac offered in 1961-62 became available, but only in a four-barrel form rated at {{convert|320|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. Pontiac also offered the {{convert|421|cid|L|0|abbr=on}} Super Duty with two four-barrel carburetors, rated at {{convert|405|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, as a US$2,250 option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flory|first=J.

===1963===
[[File:63 Pontiac Grand Prix (9122487434).jpg|thumb|left|1963 Pontiac Grand Prix Sports Coupe]]
For 1963, the Grand Prix received revised sheetmetal shared with other full-size Pontiacs, but with its own squared-off roofline with a concave rear window that contrasted with the convertible-like roofline of the 1962 Grand Prix and continued on the 1963 to 1964 Catalina and Bonneville. Also new was a Pontiac-trademark split grille with vertical headlights and round parking lights and "hidden" taillights. Aside from grillework, taillight covering and bumpers, chrome trim was limited to lower rocker panels, wheel arches and roofline.

Inside, the GP continued with luxurious interiors featuring real walnut trim on the instrument panel and bucket seats upholstered in Morrokide vinyl.  The center console was now built into the instrument panel and featured a vacuum gauge to go along with a dash mounted tachometer (manual transmission). Pedals received revised custom trim plates. A wide assortment of options were available including power steering, brakes, windows and driver's seat; air conditioning, eight-lug aluminum wheels with integrated brake drums, Safe-T-Track differential and other items. New options this year included an AM/FM radio, cruise control and a tilt steering wheel adjustable to seven positions.

The {{convert|303|hp|abbr=on}} 389 four-barrel V8 remained the standard engine. A new lineup of optional engines was introduced this year which included the {{convert|330|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 389 Tri-Power and three versions of the larger 421&amp;nbsp;in³ V8 including a standard four-barrel version rated at {{convert|320|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, a {{convert|350|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Tri-Power option, and the 421 HO option with Tri-Power carburetion and {{convert|370|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. The same selection of transmissions continued including the standard three-speed manual, optional four-speed manual, or three-speed Roto Hydra-matic. Brakes were {{convert|11|in|cm|abbr=on}} drums.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1963"/&gt;

===1964===
[[File:Pontiac Grand Prix ('11 Auto classique Laval).JPG|thumb|left|1964 Pontiac Grand Prix]]

The 1964 Grand Prix received minor appearance changes from the 1963 edition. Those included a revised grille (based on the 1964 Bonneville/Catalina) with new "GP" logos and rear deck trim with new taillights, still hidden, again following the shape of the other big '64 Pontiacs.

Revised upholstery trims highlighted the interior, still featuring expanded Morrokide vinyl bucket seats and console as standard equipment.

Engine offerings were mostly unchanged from 1963 except that the standard {{convert|303|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 389 four-barrel V8 gained three {{convert|3|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, with the extra-cost Hydra-matic transmission. The standard three-speed manual and optional Hydra-matic transmissions were unchanged from 1963, however, a new GM-built Muncie four-speed available in either a wide-ratio M-20 or close-ratio M-21 options replaced the Borg-Warner T-10.
{{-}}
===1965===
[[File:'65 Pontiac Grand Prix (Auto classique Salaberry-De-Valleyfield '11).JPG|thumb|1965 Pontiac Grand Prix]]
Grand Prixs and all other full-sized Pontiacs were completely restyled for 1965 featuring more rounded bodylines with [[coke bottle styling|Coke-bottle profiles]], and a {{convert|1|in|mm|abbr=on}} increase in wheelbase to {{convert|121|in|mm|abbr=on}} (for Grand Prix, Catalina, and all Safari station wagons — Bonneville and Star Chief increased proportionally from {{convert|123|in|mm|abbr=on}} to {{convert|124|in|mm|abbr=on}}). While other Pontiac coupes received the semi-fastback rooflines shared with other GM divisions, Grand Prixs retained the exclusive squared-off roofline with concave rear window but a bit more rounded than the 1963-64 version. 

Interiors were revised with all-new instrument panels featuring a larger dose of walnut trim which now extended to the center console standard with bucket seats, along with a new steering wheel with horn bars replacing the horn ring used in previous years. The standard bucket seats could be upholstered either in expanded Morrokide vinyl or a new cloth-and-Morrokide trim. New for 1965 was a no-cost bench seat option with center armrest available with either upholstery choice.

New options included an automatic air conditioning system. This system, first introduced by [[Cadillac]] in 1964, was available in addition to the regular Circ-L-Aire Conditioning. Hazard flashers were also optional.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1965"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1965%20Pontiac/album/1965%20Pontiac-48.html |title=1965 Pontiac album |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=2012-01-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508073240/http://oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1965%20Pontiac/album/1965%20Pontiac-48.html |archivedate=2012-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engine offerings were revised for 1965. The standard four-barrel 389&amp;nbsp;in³ V8 was uprated to {{convert|333|hp|kW|abbr=on}} with a manual transmission or {{convert|325|hp|kW|abbr=on}} with automatic. Optional engines included a 389 Tri-Power and 421 four-barrel — both rated at {{convert|338|hp|kW|abbr=on}}; a 421 Tri-Power rated at {{convert|350|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and the 421 HO Tri-Power with {{convert|376|hp|abbr=on}}. The standard three-speed and optional four-speed manual transmissions were carried over from 1964, however, a new three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic transmission with torque-converter that was similar in principle to Ford's Cruise-O-Matic and Chrysler's Torqueflite replaced the older three-speed fluid coupling Roto Hydra-matic (along with the four-speed Super Hydra-matic in Bonneville and Star Chief models). The Turbo Hydra-matic also featured the now-standardized P-R-N-D-S-L shift quadrant pattern in place of the P-N-D-S-L-R setup of previous Hydra-matics.

A 1965 Grand Prix road test was featured in the February, 1965 issue of ''Motor Trend'' magazine, much of which was devoted the entire Pontiac lineup receiving M/T "Car of the Year" honors for 1965. Other Pontiac road tests in that issue included a GTO convertible, Tempest Custom sedan, Catalina Vista hardtop sedan, and Bonneville hardtop coupe.

===1966===
The 1966 Grand Prix received only minor appearance revisions from the 1965 edition including a new more rounded split grille and new taillight trim. Inside, a revised instrument panel included a squared off gauge panel and new Strato bucket seats in either Morrokide or cloth upholstery with higher seatbacks and more contoured cushions for improved lateral support. The Strato buckets were standard equipment along with a console, but a notchback bench seat with center armrest was a no-cost option.

Engine offerings were largely unchanged from 1965 except that the {{convert|338|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Tri-Power 389 option was discontinued, leaving only the larger 421 available with the three two-barrel carb option, which was offered for the last time this year due to a new General Motors edict that banned the use of multi-carb options on all GM cars with the exception of the Chevrolet Corvette starting with the 1967 model year.

===1967===
[[File:1967 Pontiac Grand Prix.JPG|thumb|right|1967 Pontiac Grand Prix on display at the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History]]

Revised sheetmetal with rounded yet even more pronounced Coke bottle styling highlighted the 1967 Grand Prix and other full-sized Pontiacs.  A convertible was new; this lasted only for the 1967 model year. Also new to the G.P.-concealed headlights with horizontal mounting (all other full-size '67 Pontiacs retained the vertical headlights for one more year), concealed windshield wipers and ventless front windows on hardtop coupes. Out back were louvered taillights similar to those found on the GTO.

Inside, Strato bucket seats and console were still standard equipment with Morrokide vinyl or cloth upholstery, or a no-cost optional notchback bench seat with either trims. Other changes included a revised instrument panel and door panel trim.

Under the hood, the 389 V8 was replaced by a new {{convert|400|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with four-barrel carburetor, dual exhausts and {{convert|350|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. Similarly, the 421 V8 was replaced by a new {{convert|428|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 rated at {{convert|360|hp|kW|abbr=on}} or an HO version with {{convert|376|hp|kW|abbr=on}} - both with four-barrel carburetors. Both the 400 and 428 V8s were basically bored out versions of the older 389/421 block but with various internal improvements including bigger valves and improved breathing capabilities.

New this year was a dual master-cylinder braking system and optional front disc brakes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1967%20Pontiac/1967%20Pontiac%20Full%20Line%20Brochure-01/1967%20Pontiac%20Full%20Line-54.html|title=1967 Pontiac Full Line Brochure-01|publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com|date=|accessdate=2012-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with Rally II wheels. Also new for 1967 was an energy-absorbing collapsible steering column.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1967"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1967%20Pontiac/album_001/1967%20Pontiac%20Grand%20Prix-08.html |title=1967 Pontiac album 001 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=2012-01-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509234741/http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1967%20Pontiac/album_001/1967%20Pontiac%20Grand%20Prix-08.html |archivedate=2013-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plus, Pontiac added an [[8-track tape|8-track]] Stereo tape player.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1967"/&gt;

===1968===
The 1968 Grand Prix received a more pronounced"beak-nose" grille in shock-absorbent plastic, and new front bumper. The concealed headlights were carried over, and a revised rear deck/bumper with L-shaped taillights and side reflector markers to meet a new federal safety mandate were new. The convertible was discontinued, leaving only the hardtop coupe for '68.

The standard {{convert|350|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{convert|400|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 was revised to meet the new 1968 Federal and California emission regulations. Both optional {{convert|428|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8s received higher power ratings of {{convert|375|hp|kW|abbr=on}} for the base version and {{convert|390|hp|kW|abbr=on}} the HO.

Interior trim only received minor changes from 1967 aside from revised door panels.

This would be the final year for the B-bodied, full-sized Grand Prix. The 1969 GP would feature a dramatic new body shell atop a chassis based on the smaller Pontiac A-body intermediates.

===1969===
Pontiac's general manager [[John Z. DeLorean]] ordered the development of an all-new Grand Prix for the 1969 model year.  It featured dramatic bodywork and a highly pronounced grill, and rode on a slightly stretched version of the intermediate [[GM A platform (RWD)|GM A platform]] dubbed the [[GM G platform (RWD)|G-Body]].

====Market====
DeLorean and other [[Pontiac]] planners saw a way to reverse the declining sales of the full-sized Grand Prix by creating a new niche in the burgeoning [[personal luxury car]] market. Smaller than the hulking [[Cadillac Eldorado]] and [[Oldsmobile Toronado]], but positioned to be nimbler and more performance oriented than the slightly less bulky [[Ford Thunderbird]] and [[Buick Riviera]], the new Grand Prix  was designed to outshine the upscale [[Mercury Cougar|Mercury Cougar XR-7]] ''[[Pony car]]'' and B-bodied performance-oriented [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Dodge Charger]] intermediate.

Sales reached over 112,000 units, almost quadruple the 32,000 full-sized models built in 1968. The similar but less luxurious [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] followed in 1970. Ford and Chrysler responded by producing plusher versions of their intermediate [[Ford Torino|Torino]] and Charger, but both eventually created newer entries to the intermediate personal luxury car battle—the [[Ford Elite]] in 1974 and [[Chrysler Cordoba]] in 1975.

====Development====
The new intermediate-based 1969 Grand Prix began to take shape in April 1967, with a few prototype models built on the full-sized Pontiac platform before the G-Body was ready. To save both development costs and time in much the same manner Ford created the original 1964 Mustang using the basic chassis and drivetrain from the compact Falcon, the revised Grand Prix would have a unique bodyshell but share the A-body intermediate platform and mechanicals with the Tempest, Le Mans and GTO. This reduced development time from the usual 36&amp;nbsp;months required for a new model to less than 18&amp;nbsp;,{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} allowing Pontiac to concentrate upgrading styling and interior appointments.

[[File:PontiacGrandPrixSJ-rear.jpg|thumb|left|The rear end was much more subtle than the aggressive front]]
Shortened by three inches from the previous Catalina wheelbase, the {{convert|118|in|mm|abbr=on}} 1969 Grand Prix finally had its own body &amp;ndash; and Pontiac's longest-ever hood.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p. 632.&lt;/ref&gt; Like all but the short-lived 1967 convertible, the new Grand Prix was a 2-door hardtop. Model names borrowed suggestive [[Duesenberg Model J]] nomenclature for "J" and "SJ" levels of trim.

The basic 1969 body shell saw a major facelift in 1971 bracketed by minor detail revisions in the 1970 and 1972 model years.

====Features====
The new Grand Prix sought to deliver performance as attention-getting as its styling, with increased installation percentages for [[manual transmission]]s and engine options up to the {{convert|390|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Pontiac V8 engine#428|428 HO]]. Two engine sizes were offered with two power options were available in each engine size; a {{convert|265|hp|kW|abbr=on}} or {{convert|350|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{convert|400|cid|L|1|abbr=on}}, as well as a {{convert|370|hp|kW|abbr=on}} or {{convert|390|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{convert|428|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8.

The 1969 Grand Prix debuted a dramatic "Command Seat" wraparound cockpit-style instrument panel that placed most controls and gauges within easy reach of the driver. Enhancing the interior's sporty look, the "Strato" bucket seats were separated by a console integrated into the instrument panel that slanted toward the driver, which included a floor shifter, storage compartment, and ashtray. A leather trim option which also replaced nylon loop rug with cut-pile carpeting was finally offered in addition to the redoubtable Morrokide vinyl and cloth and Morrokide upholstery offerings.

Innovations in 1969 included a radio antenna embedded in the windshield, flush-mounted "pop-open" exterior door handles, side-impact beams inside the doors, and an optional built-in electrically heated rear window defogger.

====Steam powered prototype====
Pontiac also in 1969 built a [[Steam car#Modern steam cars|steam powered]] '''SE 101''' concept car with a {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine designed by GM engineering in conjunction with the [[Doble steam car#Besler Brothers|Besler brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FyoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=popular+science+1930&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RJLlTt-gB8edgweY-smBBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwADhu#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "GM Takes Its Wraps Off Its Steam Cars."] ''Popular Science'', July 1969, p. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt; The engine, however, was {{convert|450|lb|abbr=on}} heavier than a V8, and three times more expensive to make.

===1970===
Vertical grille inserts replaced the horizontal bars of the 1969, movement of "Grand Prix" nameplates from the lower cowls to the rear C-pillars and the vertical chromed louvers from the C-pillars down to the lower cowls, highlighted the 1970 Grand Prix. The optional {{convert|428|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 rated at 370 and {{convert|390|hp|kW|abbr=on}} in 1969 was replaced by a new {{convert|370|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{convert|455|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} with {{convert|500|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque at 3,100&amp;nbsp;rpm. The base 350&amp;nbsp;hp {{convert|400|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} engine was still standard, but a low-compression 400&amp;nbsp;CID engine was available with a two-barrel carburetor. An automatic transmission was offered as a no cost option.

Interior trim also received minor revisions, and a bench seat with center armrest returned as a no-cost option to the standard Strato bucket seats and console. Bench seat-equipped Grand Prixs got a steering column-mounted shifter with the automatic transmission along with a dashboard-mounted glovebox, replacing the console-mounted shifter and glovebox of bucket-seat cars. Power front disc brakes became standard equipment this year.

Due to the success of the 1969 Grand Prix, other GM divisions followed suit and introduced similar cars for 1970. The [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] used the same basic G-body as the GP but with a two-inch shorter wheelbase (116 vs. the GP's 118) and a long hood, though still shorter than the Grand Prix's, but still considered an upscale vehicle for GM's lowest-priced division. Oldsmobile, whose larger and more expensive front-drive Toronado was a direct competitor to the Thunderbird, decided to further capitalize on strong sales of its intermediate Cutlass line by introducing a new [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme|Cutlass Supreme]] coupe with a formal roofline similar to the GPs but on the standard {{convert|112|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase used for two-door A-body intermediates and the same lower sheetmetal used on other Cutlass models. Both the Monte Carlo and Cutlass Supreme were also much lower in price, primarily due to smaller {{convert|350|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} standard engines for both, and that many items standard on the GP were optional on those models — however, all three cars with similar equipment were actually much closer in price than the base sticker prices suggest. The introduction of the Monte Carlo and Cutlass Supreme did, however, cut into the Grand Prix's dominance, and sales dropped 40%. 65,750 Grand Prixs were built in 1970.

Variations of the 1969 GP's central V-nose grille appeared on other 1970 Pontiacs including the full-sized cars and intermediate Tempest/Le Mans series. The 1970 Ford Thunderbird styling change was reportedly ordered by Ford Motor Co. president Bunkie Knudsen, who moved from GM to Ford in 1968 after a long career at GM which included the position of general manager for the Pontiac Motor Division from 1956 to 1961 and ordered the addition of the Grand Prix to the 1962 model lineup.

===1971===
[[File:1972 Pontiac Grand Prix (2871879060).jpg|300px|thumb|right|The Grand Prix lost two of its headlights in 1971 and 1972 as shown here.]]
A new integrated bumper/grille and larger single headlights replacing the quad lights of 1969-70 models marked the introduction of the 1971 Grand Prix along with a new slanted boattail-style rear with taillights built into the bumper. Interior revisions amounted to new trim patterns for cloth and vinyl upholstery patterns for both the bench and bucket seats, but the leather interior option was discontinued.

Engine choices included the standard {{convert|400|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts, rated at {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}}; and the optional four-barrel {{convert|455|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 rated at {{convert|325|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Both engines received substantially lower compression ratios (8.4:1 for 1971 compared to 10.25:1 in 1970) as part of a GM-corporate edict that required engines to use lower-octane regular leaded, low lead or unleaded gasoline beginning with the 1971 model year. Transmission offerings initially were carried over from previous years, including the standard three-speed manual, or optional four-speed stick or Turbo Hydra-Matic. However, at mid-year, Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic became standard equipment and the manual shifters were dropped. Variable-ratio power steering was made standard equipment as well.

New power ratings were put into effect, requiring manufacturers to post net horsepower with all accessories installed (vs. gross rating without the accessories). This system gave a more realistic measure of power that customers actually saw. The base {{convert|400|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} four-barrel engine then produced {{convert|255|hp|kW|abbr=on}} after the switch to the net-rating system, and the {{convert|455|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} in SJ models also dropped in power to {{convert|260|hp|kW|abbr=on}} (net). Customers who wanted the higher powered 455 SJ model paid $195 to get Rally gauges, body-colored mirrors, SJ badging, a no-maintenance AC Delco battery and other amenities. 1971 looked to be a good sales year for the Grand Prix, but in mid-September 1970, a corporate wide labor strike halted all GM production for 67&amp;nbsp;days. The strike also delayed the production of the third generation Grand Prix by one year in 1973. Production numbers for 1971 were lower than 1970 with only 58,325 units being produced. The strike cut into production and sales along with other possible factors including lower horsepower ratings and intense competition from Chevy's Monte Carlo and Oldsmobile's Cutlass Supreme.

===1972===
Minor styling revisions included a new cross-hatch grille up front and triple cluster taillights in back. Inside, the burled-elm trim was replaced by a new teakwood design and upholstery trim patterns for vinyl and cloth selections were revised for both bucket and bench seat offerings. Engine offerings remained the same as before with the major change being the change in power measurements from the previous gross method on a [[dynamometer]] to the new net ratings as installed in a vehicle with accessories and emission equipment which made the horsepower ratings of 1972 models much lower "on paper" than their 1971 counterparts though actual performance did not change much between the two years. Under the net horsepower measurement system, the standard {{convert|400|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with four-barrel carburetor was rated at {{convert|250|hp|kW|abbr=on}} while the optional {{convert|455|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} with four-barrel carb was rated at {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.

At mid-year, Pontiac released a radial tire option for the Grand Prix, which increased the wheel diameter from the standard {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on}} to {{convert|15|in|cm|abbr=on}}. The radial donuts, provided by the division's usual tire suppliers, included Firestone 500s and B.F. Goodrich Lifesaver T/As. This was the first time that Pontiac offered a radial tire option which actually became a reality. In 1968, Pontiac announced a radial tire option for the GTO that was quickly discontinued due to production problems.

Also at mid-year, a new "Fasten Seat Belts" light with buzzer was added per Federal safety regulation. This light was located in the speedometer pod and the speedometer was changed from displaying a high of {{convert|140|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, back to {{convert|120|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.

An all-new Grand Prix was scheduled for 1972. However, a 67-day corporate-wide strike at GM in late 1970 that hobbled the 1971 model introduction set back 1972 model production plans and the new A and G-body cars planned for 1972 were delayed for introduction by one year to the 1973 model year. Production numbers increased substantially after two years of decline, reaching 91,961 units and only second place to the 1969 model.

===1973===
[[File:1973 Pontiac Grand Prix (2).JPG|thumb|left|1973 Pontiac Grand Prix]]
All [[GM A platform|A-bodies]], including the Grand Prix, were redesigned for 1973. This generation was larger and heavier, due partly to the federally mandated {{convert|5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} crash bumpers. Although large V8s were still available, performance was on the decline due to another federal standard—a new emissions control system. The most notable styling feature of this generation was the appearance of the fixed opera window, replacing the previous disappearing rear side glass. This year's Grand Prix switched from pillarless hardtop design to a pillared "Colonnade" hardtop with frameless door glass as did all GM intermediates in response to proposed federal safety standards regarding roll-over protection that would have ultimately spelled the end of pillarless and convertible bodystyles, a mandate that never materialized.

Front and rear styling of the 1973 Grand Prix turned out be an evolution of the 1971 and 1972 models with a vertical-bar V-nose grille and single headlamps along with the new federally mandated 5&amp;nbsp;mph (8&amp;nbsp;km/h) front bumper. The rear featured a revised boattail-like trim with square-taillights above the bumper.

Inside, a new instrument panel continued the wraparound cockpit theme of previous models with new African Crossfire Mahogany facing on the dashboard, console and door panels, which was "real" wood in contrast with the simulated woodgrain material found in most car interiors during that time. The Strato bucket seats were completely new with higher seatbacks and integrated headrests in Morrokide or scivvy cloth trims, and optional recliners and adjustable lumbar support, with a notchback bench seat offered as a no-cost option.

The standard drivetrain consisted of the four-barrel {{convert|400|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 rated at {{convert|230|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and the Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission. Also standard were power steering and power brakes. A four-barrel {{convert|455|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} was optional and included with the "SJ" option that also added a rally gauge cluster and a radial tuned suspension with front and rear sway bars, Pliacell shock absorbers, and radial-ply tires.

Although the Third Generation Grand Prix was indeed bulkier and heavier than its predecessor, handling was good for a large car, due to improvements in suspension design. The introduction of radial-ply tires was also a boon for handling. GM's "A" body cars' front suspensions were based on the [[Chevrolet Camaro]] and [[Pontiac Firebird]] during this production run.

Grand Prix production set a new record of over 150,000&amp;nbsp;units, despite intense competition from a similar restyled Chevy Monte Carlo, and "near" personal luxury coupes such as Buick's all-new Century Regal and Oldsmobile's Cutlass Supreme — both of whose styling and appointments were very similar to the GP and Monte Carlo, and even shared the same squared-off formal roofline with opera windows - but used the standard A-body coupe body and {{convert|112|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase shared with lower-priced models. The success of the GP (and Monte Carlo) led to direct responses from Ford Motor Company the following year with a larger  [[Ford Elite]] and [[Mercury Cougar#Third generation .281974.E2.80.931976.29|Mercury Cougar]], which were followed by Chrysler entries in 1975, the [[Dodge Charger (B-body)#Fourth generation|Dodge Charger]] and [[Chrysler Cordoba#First generation .281975.E2.80.931979.29|Chrysler Cordoba]].

===1974===
[[File:1974 Pontiac Grand Prix SJ - 6cf.jpg|thumb|left|1974 Pontiac Grand Prix Model SJ]]

The 1974 Grand Prix received a revised split grille with vertical bars that was entirely above the bumper. Out back, the boattail effect was softened somewhat due to a new federally mandated {{convert|5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} bumper that was added to the similar mandated front bumper introduced in 1973. The license plate and fuel filler were moved above the bumper and taillight lenses were revised.

The interior trim remained virtually unchanged from 1973, with standard seating choices, including Strato bucket seats with center console or notchback bench seat with an armrest and cloth or Morrokide upholstery. The bucket seats were available with optional recliners and adjustable lumbar support. However, the real African Crossfire Mahogany trim was replaced by a simulated material for the instrument panel due to splintering problems on 1973 models; the "real" wood was continued on the console and door panels for another two years. Also, a new cut-pile carpeting replaced the nylon loop rugs of previous years.

Also new for 1974 was a federally mandated interlock system that required the driver and front-seat passenger to fasten their seat belts in order to start the car. This regulation, which was very unpopular with the buying public, was offered only this one year and on some early 1975 models. It was rescinded by Congressional action.

Engines were carried over from 1973, including the {{convert|400|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 (standard on the Model J) and {{convert|455|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} (standard on the Model SJ, optional on the Model J). A Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission, variable-ratio power steering, and power brakes were standard equipment on both models. In addition to the 455 V8, the Model SJ also added a Rally Gauge Cluster, "SJ" identification, and a radial-tuned suspension similar to Pontiac's Grand Am. Radial tires were also a new option on the Model J this year.

Sales of Grand Prixs for the 1974 model year dropped from 1973's record of around 150,000&amp;nbsp;units to just under 100,000&amp;nbsp;units primarily due to new competition in the intermediate personal-luxury car market from a new upsized [[Mercury Cougar]] XR-7 coupe and [[Ford Elite]], both based on the Dearborn's intermediate Torino/Montego platform. Still, 1974 was the third best-selling year to date for the Pontiac Grand Prix.

===1975===
[[File:'75 Pontiac Grand Prix (Cruisin' At The Boardwalk '14).jpg|thumb|1975 Pontiac Grand Prix]]
A revised grille with fewer vertical bars and revised taillight lenses marked the 1975 Grand Prix. Changes included the addition of GM's High Energy electronic ignition and a catalytic converter that mandated the use of unleaded gasoline. Radial tires became standard on all models.

A new luxury LJ model was added as the new top model. The base Model J remained available, as well as the SJ. The LJ included pinstriping and a velour interior trim. Speedometers were revised with numerals now topping at {{convert|100|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} rather than the 120 or {{convert|140|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} readings found in previous years and speed readings in kilometers were added.

The addition of the catalytic converter spelled the end of dual exhaust for 1975 and detuning of engines. The {{convert|400|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 (standard on J and LJ models) dropped from 230 to {{convert|180|hp|kW|abbr=on}} while the {{convert|455|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} (standard on SJ, optional on J and LJ) was detuned from 250 to {{convert|200|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. New for 1975 was a more economical {{convert|170|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{convert|400|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} with two-barrel carburetor, which was available as a no-cost option on J and LJ models.

Early 1975 models featured the seat belt interlock system introduced on all 1974 models that required both the driver and front passenger to fasten their seat belts in order to start the vehicle. However, Congressional action to rescind that regulation, which led automakers to discontinue the device and permitted dealers and garages to disconnect the device on cars so-equipped.

Sales dropped to 86,582&amp;nbsp;units thanks to an aging design, continued recession resulting from the 1973-74 energy crisis, substantially higher prices for all 1975-model cars due to that year's safety and emission control regulations, and intense competition from Ford's Cougar and Elite, and Chrysler Corporation's two new entries in this class including the Chrysler Cordoba and Dodge Charger SE.

Model mix was 64,581 base J models, 7,146 SJs, and 14,855 of the new LJ.

===1976===
[[File:Pontiac-GP-LJ-Golden-Anniversary-1976.jpg|right|thumb|1976 Pontiac Grand Prix LJ Golden Anniversary Edition]]

A new split vertical bar "waterfall" grille and quad rectangular headlights in front and revised taillight lenses out back highlighted the 1976 Grand Prix. The same three model designations continued (J, SJ and LJ) with the LJ and SJ offering the same trim and equipment levels as in 1975 with the exception being the SJ downgraded to a standard {{convert|400|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8.

The base Model J underwent a number of content changes to cut the base price by around $500 to be more competitive with other mid-sized personal luxury cars. Those changes for the "J" included a smaller {{convert|160|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{convert|350|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 as the base powerplant and some downgrading of interior trim that included a new notchback bench seat made standard equipment and the Strato bucket seats/console became optional. Features such as a cushioned steering wheel and custom pedal trim plates became optional on Model J, but remained standard on LJ and SJ, both of which also continued to include Strato bucket seats as standard equipment. All models got a new simulated rosewood trim for the dash, door panels and console (with bucket seats) that replaced the African Crossfire Mahogany trim of previous years. Upholstery choices included cloth or Morrokide vinyl bench or bucket seats on the Model J, velour buckets on the LJ or Morrokide buckets on the SJ. Leather interior trim was a new extra-cost option available with the Strato bucket seats and LJ and SJ models.
Both the "LJ" and "SJ" models came standard with a {{convert|180|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{convert|400|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 that was optional on the Model J. The {{convert|200|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{convert|455|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} was optional on all models.

In celebration of Pontiac's 50th anniversary in 1976, a number of special edition Grand Prix were produced. Technically a LJ trim option, these models featured removable [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] T-tops, color-keyed Rally II wheels, special "Anniversary Gold" paint (actually the new Cadillac Seville's "Autumn Gold) accented by a white opera roof and white side protection. The only available interior color was Light Buckskin. Among the other distinctions was special badging with Golden hood and trunk medallions and a Golden "arrow head" logo in the steering wheel. Buyers could opt for other accessories available for the LJ. Many chose sport instrumentation, sport steering wheels, or leather upholstery. Mechanically, they were similar to the regular models. This was one of two anniversary models offered by Pontiac, the other was a special trim Firebird.

Grand Prix production increased: sales went up to 228,091&amp;nbsp;units total (a plus of 226%), making this Bicentennial year the best in Grand Prix' history — and second in its class only to the Chevrolet Monte Carlo with 353,272&amp;nbsp;units. This included 110,814 base model Js, 88,232&amp;nbsp;SJs, and 29,045&amp;nbsp;LJs (including 4,807 Golden Anniversary editions and a single demonstrator with Pontiac's not yet introduced {{convert|301|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine.

===1977===
[[File:1977 Pontiac Grand Prix in white, front right (Hershey 2019).jpg|right|thumb|1977 Pontiac Grand Prix]]

A complete reworking of the front header and bumper highlighted the 1977 Grand Prix, which was the final year for the 1973-vintage bodyshell that was set to be replaced by a downsized GP for 1978.  The parking lamps were now positioned between the quad headlamps (same setup as a 1967 or 1968 Oldsmobile Cutlass), and the previous year's 'waterfall' grille was replaced by a narrower one that extended into the lower portion of the bumper.  Behind the bumper were new reinforcements (mounting panels) made from aluminum rather than steel to reduce weight.  In back the taillights were simplified to eliminate the weighty pot metal bezels that created the horizontal stripe effect in 1976.  The same three models (J, LJ and SJ) were carried over with engine revisions. The base Model J got Pontiac's new {{convert|135|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{convert|301|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 as standard equipment, which was much too small and underpowered to propel a 4,000-pound car. Optional engines included a {{convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|350|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 or {{convert|180|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{convert|400|cid|L|1|abbr=on}}; those two engines standard on the LJ and SJ models, respectively.  The original thinking on the 301 CID engine was that the weight savings from using a significantly lighter engine would cancel out the horsepower loss from the smaller displacement.  This turned out to be a major miscalculation and 301 equipped cars became much less desirable among Grand Prix enthusiasts and collectors in later years.  The 301 also had a knocking (pre-ignition) problem that was later determined to be caused by the shape of the combustion chamber.

Each of those engines were Pontiac-built units as in previous years, but offered in 49 of the 50 states. Because Pontiac's own V8 engines could not meet the more stringent California emission standards set for 1977, all Grand Prixs (and other Pontiac models) sold in California were powered by Oldsmobile-built engines including Lansing's {{convert|350|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} "Rocket V8" for J and LJ, and the {{convert|403|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} Rocket V8 standard on the SJ and optional on the other two GPs in California. Due to a shortage of Olds 350 engines resulting from record sales of Cutlasses and reduced production of that engine due to a plant conversion to build a Diesel V8 beginning in 1978, a few 1977 Grand Prixs destined for California reportedly came off the line with a Chevrolet-built {{convert|350|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8.

Grand Prix sales increased to an all-time high of over 270,000&amp;nbsp;units for 1977, the last year for this bodystyle, despite competition from a newly downsized and lower-priced Ford Thunderbird introduced this year and a restyled Mercury Cougar XR-7 whose bodyshell switched to the T-Bird this year from the discontinued Ford Torino/Mercury Montego.

===1978===
1978 brought a downsizing of the Grand Prix and the other [[GM A platform|A-bodies]]. This version of the A-body also received some sheetmetal revisions for 1981. The 1978 GP was about {{convert|1|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} shorter and {{convert|600|lb|kg|abbr=on}} lighter than the 1977 model with an overall length of {{convert|200|in|mm|abbr=on}} and a {{convert|108|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase.

For the first time in Grand Prix history, a V8 engine was not standard equipment. In order to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) mandates set after 1973-74 energy crisis, a Buick-built {{convert|231|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V6 was standard equipment on the base model (formerly the Model J) and two versions of the Pontiac {{convert|301|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 (Chevy {{convert|305|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 in California) were optional. The luxury LJ model came standard with the {{convert|135|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 301 V8 with two-barrel carburetor while the sporty SJ was powered by a {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 301 V8 with four-barrel carburetor. Top speed for the six-cylinder was about {{convert|96|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, while the top-of-the-line {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}} V8 was {{convert|109|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1978"/&gt;

A floor-mounted three-speed manual transmission was standard equipment with the V6 on the base model and the three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic was optional. Turbo Hydra-Matic was standard on LJ and SJ models and base models with either of the optional V8 engines.
Standard seating choices by model included a notchback bench seat with cloth or Morrokide vinyl in the base GP, a pillowed velour cloth notchback bench seat in the LJ or Strato bucket seats in cloth or Morrokide in the SJ. The Strato buckets were optional on the base GP and a 60/40 split bench was optional on both base and LJ models. Viscount leather upholstery was available with bucket seats on SJ models.

===1979===
A new crosshatch grille and revised taillight lenses were the only appearance changes made to the 1979 Grand Prix. The same models, base, LJ and SJ continued as before as did the basic engine lineup including the {{convert|231|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} Buick V6 standard on base and LJ models, the {{convert|135|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{convert|301|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} Pontiac V8 with two-barrel carburetor that was optional on both of those models, and the {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 301 V8 with four-barrel carburetion that was standard on the SJ and optional on the other models. Transmissions remained the same as before with the three-speed manual standard with the V6 engine on the base model and automatic transmission optional. The automatic transmission was standard on LJ and SJ models and all models when a V8 engine was ordered. Again, the Pontiac V8s were not available in California, where they were replaced by Chevy {{convert|305|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} rated at 140 and {{convert|160|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.
A new and one-year-only option this year was a four-speed manual transmission available with the {{convert|301|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} four-barrel or two-barrel V8 on all models. Only 232 4-speed/301 V8 cars were built.

===1980===
The 1980 Grand Prix returned to a vertical bar grille and featured new taillight lenses with "GP" logos. Automatic transmission was standard equipment on all models and the two-barrel {{convert|301|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} Pontiac V8 was replaced by a new {{convert|265|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 rated at {{convert|125|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. The Buick 231 V6 and the four-barrel version of the Pontiac 301 V8 were carried over from the previous year as was the Chevy 305 V8 offered in California.

===1981===
A minor reskinning of the sheetmetal for improved aerodynamics marked the 1981 Grand Prix along with a new grille design and revised tail section. The SJ model was dropped and a new Brougham series was now the flagship of the Grand Prix line. The Brougham models came standard with all power options, a plush cloth interior similar to the full-sized Bonneville Brougham, and a half roof vinyl top with coach lamps. The base and LJ models continued as before. All models now came standard with the Buick {{convert|231|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V6 with the {{convert|265|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} Pontiac V8 available as an extra cost option (Chevy {{convert|305|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 in California). The {{convert|301|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 was discontinued and a new option this year was the Oldsmobile-built {{convert|350|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} Diesel V8, which was not often ordered due to high cost of around $700 and poor reliability. The year 1981 was also the last for Pontiac Motor Division to offer its own V8 engine due to an emerging GM corporate engine policy that determined Pontiac would build only four-cylinder engines and Buick only V6 engines, leaving Chevrolet and Oldsmobile to build V8 engines for most GM cars and trucks, while Cadillac would produce its own aluminum-block V8 that debuted in 1982. From 1982-on, all V8-equipped Pontiacs were equipped with Chevy or Olds engines.

===1982===
The 1982 Grand Prix was a virtual rerun of the 1981 model with no appearance changes to note. No gasoline-powered V8 engines were offered this year (in the U.S. only — Canadian GPs were available with the Chevy 305 V8 as an option in '82), leaving only the standard {{convert|231|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} Buick V6, a larger Buick {{convert|252|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V6 and the Olds {{convert|350|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} Diesel V8. The A-body line became front-wheel-drive, leaving the rear-wheel-drive midsize platform as the [[GM G platform (RWD)|G-body]]. The downsized four-door [[Pontiac Bonneville|Bonneville]] was now related to the Grand Prix. The automatic climate control option was also dropped in 1981, leaving just a manual climate controls on all models. Also most 1982 models had a two tone interior. Front suspension was independent with wishbones, coil springs, antiroll bars and telescopic shocks while the rear still had a [[live axle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World Cars 1982|publisher=Herald Books|isbn=978-0-910714-14-3|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1983===
1983 Grand Prix models specifically had no hood ornament and trim, and no rear trunk lock cover. One significant engine change to note was the {{convert|252|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V6 was discontinued and the gas-powered V8 returned after a one-year absence (on U.S. models) in the form of a {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Chevy {{convert|305|cid|L|1|abbr=on}}. 1983 also marked the end of the LJ series, as the LE model would be added in for model year 1984.

===1984===
Some minor changes and revisions marked the 1984 Grand Prix, including the return of the octagonal Pontiac hood ornament (which originally debuted in 1976), gauges with orange needles and red markings (previous 1978–1983 Grand Prix gauges had white needles), a T-shaped console shifter, an updated bucket seat design, as well as a woodgrain plate above the glove box (previous 1978–1983 Grand Prixs used a black plate). A new optional four spoke steering wheel was also available. The base and Brougham models continued as before but the LJ was replaced by a new LE model. Same engines continued as before including the Buick {{convert|231|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V6, [[Chevy]] {{convert|305|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 and [[Oldsmobile|Olds]] {{convert|350|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} Diesel V8≈. A new option this year was the Turbo Hydra-Matic 200-4R four-speed overdrive automatic available with the 305 V8 for improved highway gas mileage.

===1985===
[[File:1985 Pontiac Grand Prix LE, front left (Hershey 2019).jpg|right|thumb|1985 Pontiac Grand Prix LE coupe]]

For 1985, Grand Prix's now included a new checkerboard grille design, as well as an optional two tone paint scheme with a fading body stripe. The octagonal 'GP' logo also returned to the taillights. 1985 marked the last year for the flat rear deck panel in the interior, as by 1986 laws mandated cars to have a third brake light installed. New rectangular digital ETR stereo system options were introduced and replaced the dial pushbutton stereos. Some more rarer options specific for the 1985 Pontiac Grand Prix include a factory rear spoiler, rare aluminum turbo finned wheels, and a full size spare tire. The standard engine for 1985 was the {{convert|110|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Buick built 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 with a {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Chevy 5.0&amp;nbsp;L V8 optional. The 5.7&amp;nbsp;L Olds Diesel V8 was dropped from the option list. Equipment levels were Standard, LE, and Brougham.

An ad for the 1985 GP promoted the fact that its instrument panel still used dials for gauges. It was highlighted by a question similar to one long used in advertisements for [[Dial (soap)|Dial]] soap since the late 1950s, "Aren't You Glad We Use Dials. Don't You Wish Everybody Did?"

===1986===
[[File:1986 Pontiac Grand Prix 2+2.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of 1986 Grand Prix 2+2]]
An updated taillight design with three sections was the only major change to the 1986 Grand Prix. A new 2+2 model was offered for [[homologation]] of an aerodynamic coupe body for [[NASCAR]] competition, like Chevrolet's 1986 Monte Carlo SS Aerocoupe. (Pontiac never used the term "Aerocoupe").  2+2-specific pieces are an aero nose, bubble rear glass and a fiberglass trunklid with integral spoiler. All 2+2 models came equipped with a corporate {{convert|305|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} four-barrel engine, the 200-4R four-speed automatic transmission and 3.08:1 rear axle ratio. They have a two-tone paint job with silver on top and gray on the bottom, with 2+2 decals and striping and 15x7 steel Rally II wheels.  Modestly successful on superspeedways, where its bulbous rear end earned it a nickname of "the whale", the 2+2 design was seriously flawed for street use. Since the enormous rear glass was fixed (not an opening hatch), it forced the adoption of a dramatically shortened trunk opening.  Although it had modest horsepower, benign handling and design compromises, there were only 1,118 Grand Prix 2+2s built in 1986 and dealers were able to ask 20 percent above the list price for this limited production version. The cars were all allotted to dealers in the [[Southeastern United States]].&lt;ref name="Spontiac"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Standard Catalog of Pontiac, 1926-2002 | edition = 2nd | first1 = John | last1 = Gunnell | first2 = Ron | last2 = Kowalke | ref = GunKow | publisher = Krause Publications | location = Iola, WI | page = 213 | date = 2012 | isbn = 978-1-4402-3234-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 remained standard for the regular Grand Prix, a fuel-injected 4.3&amp;nbsp;L [[Chevrolet 90-Degree V6 engine#LB1 and LB4|Chevrolet 90° V6]] was added to the option list for models other than the 2+2. This engine was available with a three-speed or a four-speed automatic transmission.

===1987===
The 1987 Grand Prix was basically a rerun of the 1986 model aside from the discontinuation of the 2+2 model. The same three models were continued including base, LE and Brougham. Engine offerings again included the standard Buick 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6, the Chevrolet 4.3&amp;nbsp;L V6 or optional Chevrolet 5.0&amp;nbsp;L V8.

This would be the last year for the G-body Grand Prix, which would be replaced by the all-new W-body version in 1988. The 1987 was also the last GP to feature rear-wheel-drive, V8 engines (until late-2005) and separate body-on-frame construction.

===1988===
[[File:1988 Pontiac Grand Prix Pike's Peak.JPG|left|thumb|This special 1988 Grand Prix was an experimental [[turbocharged]] model. Production models were produced for the 1989 and 1990 model year. The car seen here was raced at [[Pike's Peak]].]]

The first [[front-wheel drive]] [[GM W platform|W-body]] Grand Prix coupes were built in October 1987, and released on January 12, 1988 for the 1988 model year. This generation Grand Prix was built in [[General Motors Fairfax Assembly Plant|Kansas City, Kansas]]. The Grand Prix was introduced as base, LE and SE coupes. All featured GM's MPFI [[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#LB6|2.8 L V6]] that made {{convert|130|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|170|lbft|abbr=on}} of torque. A five-speed manual or four-speed automatic were the transmissions offered. The LE was well equipped with power windows and door locks and digital dashboard with analogue tachometer. SE models upgraded with power front seats with multiple lumbar, side bolster, side wing adjustments, an AM/FM Cassette stereo, and a trip computer and compass located in the center of the dash. Some models of this generation have the rare feature of a split front bench seat with a column shifter. Another unique feature only found on the Grand Prix is the combination lock for the glove box, rather than a key. Grand Prix was Motor Trend's [[Car of the Year]] for 1988.

===1989===
A host of changes upgraded the Grand Prix for 1989. Air conditioning was standard, and the 2.8&amp;nbsp;L was replaced by GM's new [[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#LH0|3.1 L MPFI V6]] that produced {{convert|140|hp|kW|abbr=on}} midway through the model year. For 1989, the 3.1&amp;nbsp;L was only mated to a four-speed automatic transmission, while the remaining 2.8 was mated to either manual or automatic transmissions. A new trim level was offered for 1989, a limited-edition turbo coupe that featured an [[American Specialty Cars|ASC]]/[[McLaren Group|McLaren]] turbocharged version of GM's 3.1&amp;nbsp;L V6 (Only 749 were produced). Output was {{convert|205|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, 65 more than the previous year. A four-speed automatic was the only transmission offered. The coupe was an SE model with body work such as hood louvers and extra body cladding (which would be the most controversial design element in the years to come). The interior featured more equipment, and only seated four, in contrast to the LE's five seats. The full analog gauges would become the 1990-93 sport cluster, and the basis for the new instrument cluster to replace the digital cluster for 1990.

===1990===
[[File:Wiki cars 112.jpg|thumb|left|1988–1990 Pontiac Grand Prix coupe]]

In 1990, the base model was dropped in favor of a sedan version (replacing the [[Pontiac 6000|6000]] which ended production the next year and the [[Canada]]-only [[Pontiac Tempest|Tempest]]), entering production on September 12, 1989. A notable introduction for the Grand Prix in 1990 is the new STE (Special Touring Edition) which replaced the STE model of the Pontiac 6000. In contrast to that model, it trades in all-wheel-drive for the available Turbo 3.1&amp;nbsp;L V6. Standard features include a cassette stereo with equalizer and eight speakers (a compact disc player was optional), [[remote keyless entry]], eight-way power driver's seat with multiple lumbar and sidewing adjustments for both front seat occupants, and a compass/trip computer that was more informative than the units in the SE and turbo coupes. An LE sedan was also available for 1990, standard with a 2.3&amp;nbsp;L [[Quad 4]] engine and a 3-speed automatic, the first use of an [[inline 4]] cylinder engine in a Grand Prix. The 2.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 engine was discontinued, while the 3.1&amp;nbsp;L engine gained widespread availability and a standard five-speed manual transmission.

===1991===
For 1991, the Grand Prix Turbo coupe was replaced by a new GTP version. This model sported a 3.4&amp;nbsp;L [[GM LQ1 engine|DOHC V6]] that produced {{convert|210|hp|kW|abbr=on}} with a five-speed manual transmission or 200 with the optional four-speed automatic. Inside, the GTP was essentially the same as the Turbo. One notable exception was the available optional Heads Up Display only shared with the Cutlass Supreme. The exterior used mini-quad headlamps (along with all other Grand Prix coupes), "GTP Grand Prix" and "24 Valve V6" badges. The STE Turbo was replaced by a 3.4&amp;nbsp;L STE and could be ordered with the [[automatic transmission]] or [[manual transmission]]. For the SE coupe, the B4U package featured GTP bodywork and aluminum wheels. An SE sedan also became available, and featured STE-like styling at a lower price. The LE coupe was discontinued for 1991.

===1992===
[[Anti-lock braking system]] (ABS) is optional on all models for 1992, the 2.3&amp;nbsp;L Quad 4 engine was dropped, and the LE sedan gained the SE/STE front lightbar.
Most LE Sedans ordered for Rental fleets had full power options.
A special edition only for 1992 was "Richard Petty Edition" of only 1000 units. This edition featured a special red, white or blue paint, the 210&amp;nbsp;hp Chevy LQ1 3.4l DOHC, special badging featuring Richard Petty's signature, special wheel well and ground effects, spoiler, Richard Petty black and white center caps, transmission shift modification which allowed a button for 2nd gear start or normal use, combination locking glove box, blue paint on inner web on wheel matching exterior paint, and "fan appreciation tour" badging making it one of the rarest Grand Prix ever produced.

===1993===
This was the last year of the old style B4U bodykit. There was a special edition model with metallic green paint, as well as gold wheels and pinstriping. It was also the last year that a manual transmission could be ordered as an option. This was also the last year for the style of dashboard used 1988–1993.
[[File:5th Pontiac Grand Prix.jpg|thumb|left|Pontiac Grand Prix sedan]]

===1994===
For 1994, Grand Prix went through a mid-generation "facelift" inside and out, as well as a reshuffling of the lineup. First, LE and STE models were discontinued. The GT and GTP became option packages on the SE sedan and coupe, respectively. These option packages included the revised 3.4&amp;nbsp;L V6, sport suspension, ground effects. Outside, there was a new front and rear fascia and new ground effects. Inside, a new instrument panel hosted dual airbags, much larger and easier to use controls, and seatbelts were moved to the B-pillars rather than the doors on sedans only; coupes retained the automatic seatbelt design. Under the hood, the 3.1&amp;nbsp;L V6 was changed to the [[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#L82|3100 SFI V6]] with {{convert|160|hp}}, while the 3.4&amp;nbsp;L V6 had {{convert|210|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. The Grand Prix Sedan also had a slight tail light revision using the amber over red pattern as opposed to the red over amber in years past; however, the coupe's tail lights remained the same. Mirrors on some models were painted in body color.

===1995-1996===
For 1996 the center console on floor shift models received a minor redesign. This was also the last year for the BYP body cladding package. The 3.4&amp;nbsp;L DOHC V6 gained {{convert|5|hp|kW|abbr=on}} with intake and exhaust improvements. All Grand Prix [[coupe]]s received a sport package with five-spoke alloy wheels and  dual exhaust. This is the last year for the fifth generation Grand Prix and this is the last year for the 5th generation [[mid-size car|mid-sized]] Grand Prix [[sedan (car)|sedan]].

[[File:Black Pontiac Grand Prix.jpg|thumb|left|1997 Pontiac Grand Prix SE Sedan]]
[[File:Pontiac Grand Prix GT coupe -- 10-12-2009.jpg|thumb|left|Pontiac Grand Prix GT coupe]]
In 1990, work began on a redesigned Grand Prix alongside other [[GM W platform|W-body]] [[full-size car|full-size]] vehicles under design chief John Manoogian II. It was the first year for the full-sized Grand Prix [[sedan (car)|sedans]]. By 1993, a final design was approved and show concept developed during the latter half of 1994. On January 4, 1995, General Motors unveiled the 300 GPX Concept at the 1995 [[North American International Auto Show|Detroit Auto Show]] in Detroit. This was a near-exact preview of a redesign for the Grand Prix, due within the 1996 calendar year. In January 1996, the 1997 Grand Prix was unveiled at the [[Detroit Auto Show]]. Promoted for its "wide track" appearance and racy styling, this second generation W-body Grand Prix sold well. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-01-08/travel/9501080142_1_taurus-and-sable-gm-models-v-6|title=The Edge|author=|date=|website=chicagotribune.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;articles.orlandosentinel.com/1995-10-26/topic/9510250297_1_new-grand-prix-pontiac-1997-grand&lt;/ref&gt;

The first 1997 Grand Prix was built on August 12, 1996. There were two trim levels available from 1996; the SE and GT (GT available in coupe and sedan body styles). The Grand Prix came as a base SE sedan, or sportier GT coupe or sedan options, as well as with a GTP trim package—available for GT models in either body style. Coupes and sedans shared similar styling, except for rear doors and quarter panels. The base 3.1L v6 engine on the SE was the only engine carried over from the previous generation. The GT 3.4 L V6 was replaced by a Buick 3.8 L V6. This engine in 3800 Series II form was an option on the SE with 195 horsepower. The 3800 Series II was on the Ward's 10 Best Engines list for 1995–1997. Replacing the Chevy LQ1 3.4l DOHC v6, an Eaton M90 supercharger option was available on the 3.8L from 1997-2003 (also used in the 1996–2003 Bonneville), with compression ratio decreased from 9.3 to 8.5, boosted horse power to 240. GTP interior trim level featured a "performance shift" button on the shifter that raised the transmission shift points. Front bucket seats came standard, while a 45/55 split bench seat was available as an option on the SE sedan only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/pontiac/97gp/bilder/16.jpg |page=16 |title=1997 Pontiac Grand Prix brochure |publisher=www.lov2xlr8.no |date= |accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1998===
[[File:John Andretti Petty car Pocono June 98.jpeg|thumb|left|Pontiac supplied Grand Prix sheetmetal and engine parts to [[Petty Enterprises]] for years to field their #43 race car and this particular car was driven by [[John Andretti]] at the 1998 [[Pocono 500]].]]

Few changes occurred this year, except that traction control now was available with the supercharged engine. Airbags were "depowered" to deploy with reduced force. The tire-pressure monitor was dropped. Also on models equipped with 3.8L N/A powerplants (VIN K), the 4T65E 4 speed automatic transmission was used in favor of the 4T60E previously used. To add some excitement, Pontiac also launched a special pace car model. This model celebrated the 40th running of the Daytona 500 on February 15, 1998. The pace-car replicas had special Medium Gulf Blue Metallic paint, unique "Sparkle Silver" 16-inch torque star aluminum wheels, custom decaling, a plaque notating the specific model number and custom door panels. Also standard was a heads-up-display that projected the speed onto the windshield. 1,500 were produced, with 200 of the 1,500 getting sunroofs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===1999===
Detail changes marked the '99 editions of Pontiac's midsize coupe and sedan. New wheel choices were the main visual change this year. The non-supercharged 3800 Series V6 engine gained 5 horsepower (now 200). This was also the last year that the SE model had the optional non-supercharged 3800 V6. GT models got a standard [[spoiler (automotive)|rear spoiler]] this year. The coolant overflow reservoir was relocated from being in front of the intake box to being mounted to the passenger strut tower. Available {{convert|16|in|cm|abbr=on}} alloy wheels came in a new 5-spoke design. The one new option was a Bose 8-speaker audio system.

===2000===
The standard 3.1&amp;nbsp;L V6, installed in SE models, gained 15 horsepower (now 175). New standard equipment included rear child-seat anchors and an anti-theft system that disabled the starter unless the proper ignition key was used. Pontiac also launched a Daytona 500 pace-car replica, with silver paint, unique {{convert|16|in|cm|abbr=on}} aluminum wheels, functional hood vents, a NASCAR-inspired decklid spoiler, polished quad exhaust tips, and Daytona decals. Only 2,000 were planned.

===2001===

[[OnStar]], formerly unavailable on the Grand Prix, was made standard on GTP, optional on GT. The SE got revised frontal styling in the form of the GT and GTP front bumper cover in place of the older SE-specific front fascia, standard [[spoiler (automotive)|rear spoiler]], and in-trunk emergency release; manual dual-zone climate-control replaced the optional electronic automatic unit previously offered. A Special Edition Package was added this year that could be applied to the GT and GTP models. This package adds the [[NASCAR]]-inspired rear spoiler and roof fences, hood-mounted heat extractors, and polished dual-outlet exhaust tips previously offered on the 2000 Pace Car Replica and also adds a two tone interior, 15-spoke chrome wheels, and the requisite badging. Also available for 2001 were two dealer installed "75th Anniversary" emblems, to celebrate Pontiac's 75th anniversary, they were placed in front of the badging on each door. A new, yet not very noticed feature for 2001 was added rear strut tower "liners". This prevented common rust of the rear strut towers of the 1997-2000 models.

===2002===
New for 2002 was a $2,695 40th Anniversary option package which included the NASCAR-inspired rear spoiler and roof fences, polished dual-outlet exhaust tips, hood with heat extractors, and 15-spoke chrome wheels previously offered with the 2001 Special Edition package. Unique elements such as the Dark Cherry Metallic paint, 40th Anniversary badges, and Ruby Red and Graphite interior trim with the 40th Anniversary logo embroidered on the front seats and floormats differentiated this option package from the previous year's offering.

One 40th Anniversary Sedan was further customized with a lowering package, different wheels, and exhaust for SEMA and featured in Hot Rod Magazine as the GP40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hotrod.com/featuredvehicles/47345_pontiac_grand_prix_40th_anniversary/index.html |title=Grand Prix 40th Anniversary Edition|publisher=Hotrod.com|date=|accessdate=2010-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowering package, provided by GM Accessories, consisted of new front and rear adjustable springs, adjustable front and rear dampers and {{convert|17|in|cm|abbr=on}} Z-rated tires mounted on forged aluminum wheels. GM Accessories also provided performance brake pads, drilled and slotted brake rotors (front and rear), a cat-back exhaust system, and a low-restriction air filter. The SE gained standard cruise control and dual-zone climate control, and GTs got a standard power driver's seat and CD player. This was the last year of the two-door coupe. The SE model can be identified by a single exhaust pipe and different rear bumper cover. OnStar was now an option on the GTP. The last Grand Prix coupe rolled off the assembly line on July 19, 2002 and it was the last mid-sized 6th generation Grand Prix [[coupe]].

===2003===
Pontiac dropped the [[coupe]] version (2-door) for 2003 and made anti-lock brakes and traction control optional instead of standard on most of the remaining sedans. The Limited Edition option package was offered for GT and GTP models made this year. This optional package consisted of unique blue-tinted glass fog light lenses, "Limited Edition" badging, carbon fiber instrument cluster, two-tone cloth/leather interior, and a raised spoiler resembling the original GT/GTP/SE spoiler set atop three aerodynamic pillars. Production ceased in February 2003 and was the last GM car to have an analog odometer.

===Safety ratings===
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
The [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS) gives the 1997–2003 Grand Prix an ''Acceptable'' overall score for their frontal impact test.&lt;ref name="ratingsbyseries1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/ratingsbyseries.aspx?id=343|title=IIHS-HLDI: Pontiac Grand Prix|publisher=Iihs.org|accessdate=2009-04-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208083617/http://www.iihs.org/ratings/ratingsbyseries.aspx?id=343|archivedate=2008-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recalls===
In March 2008, GM announced a [[Product recall|recall]] on all 1997–2003 Grand Prix GTP models (as well as sister car Buick Regal GS) due to a problem that causes fires in the engine compartment. Over 230 fires were reported. This recall affected over 200,000 vehicles equipped with the supercharged 3800 Series II engine. GM sent a letter to the owners of these vehicles on March 13, 2008, instructing them not to park in garages or carports until the problem was resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lavrinc|first=Damon|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2008/03/13/recall-watch-207-542-pontiacs-and-buicks-recalled-due-to-engine/|title=Recall Watch: 207,542 Pontiacs and Buicks recalled due to engine fire fears|publisher=Autoblog.com|date=2008-03-13| accessdate=2010-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recall for the Supercharged engine involved changing the left (front) valve cover gasket, as oil leaks onto the exhaust manifold may cause engine fires. Some believed this recall did not fix the fire problem, and instead the problem is likely faulty fuel rail quick disconnect o-rings. There have been reports of fires happening after the recall has been performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.clubgp.com/newforum/tm.asp?m=4935720&amp;p=2&amp;tmode=1&amp;smode=1/|title=Another one bites the dust|journal=Nature|volume=444|issue=7116|pages=123|accessdate=2010-11-25|bibcode=2006Natur.444Q.123.|year=2006|doi=10.1038/444123a}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, the recall already posted for the Supercharged iterations of the 3800 Series II was expanded to cover all 3800 Series II engine-equipped vehicles after many fires were reported with Grand Prix GT and 3.8&amp;nbsp;L equipped SE versions, as well as the sister car Buick Regal LS. The recall for the non-supercharged V6 was to remove the front spark plug retainer and a valve cover gasket is not changed on non-supercharged 3.8 engines. The recall covered nearly 1.5 million vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/04/14/autos/gm_recall/index.htm|title=GM recalls nearly 1.5 million vehicles|publisher=Money.cnn.com|date=2009-04-14| accessdate=2010-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, GM announced a third recall for the 3800 V6 engines (RPO L26, L32, L36, and L67). This recall covers nearly 1.4 million vehicles including the 1997-2004 Pontiac Grand Prix. As of October 27, 2015, there is no remedy for this recall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/10/27/autos/gm-recall-fire/|title=GM recalls 1.4 million cars for fire risk after previous fix failed|publisher=Money.cnn.com|date=2015-10-27| accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===OnStar Disfunctionality===
As of May 2008, Grand Prixs from the model years of 01-03 that were outfitted with [[OnStar]] cannot be activated due to outdated technology. OnStar's wireless services are provided by [[Verizon Wireless]], which switched fully to digital cellular communications. Grand Prixs of model years 2001 to 2002 have OnStar systems that are Analog cellular capable only. Some 2003 models may have had modules that could be upgraded to digital-ready.

}}

===2004===
The Grand Prix was updated for 2004 on a revised version of the [[GM W platform]] and was unveiled at the 2002 [[Chicago Auto Show]] on February 7, 2002 as the Grand Prix G-Force Concept. The series production version was unveiled at the Los Angeles International Auto Show on January 3, 2003. The Grand Prix came in four different option groups; GT1, GT2, GTP, and GTP Comp-G ("Competition Group").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoautoshow.com/concepts/vehicle/2002/pontiac/g-force/|title=Concept Vehicle - Concept Car History - Chicago Auto Show|author=|date=|website=www.chicagoautoshow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GT1 and fancier GT2 have the [[Buick V6 engine#Series III|Series III]] 3800 V6 engine, putting out 200&amp;nbsp;hp (150&amp;nbsp;kW) and 230&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (310 Nm) of torque, while both GTPs have the supercharged (Eaton Gen 5 Supercharger) 3800 Series III V6 engine with 260&amp;nbsp;hp (195&amp;nbsp;kW) and 280&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (380 Nm) of torque.

A Competition Group (Comp-G) package was available for the GTP that included red painted brake calipers (same brakes as the 'standard' GTP), sport tuned suspension, heads-up display (also in GT2 model), 4-speed automatic transmission with paddle-style [[TAPShift]], StabiliTrak dynamic control system, 3.29 axle ratio, performance tires and Magnasteer II. Also, a 10-spoke light weight wheel was standard with the Comp-G package but could be 'upgraded' to the GTP optional wheel.

The newly redesigned model mostly received positive reviews from critics regarding its distinctive styling, performance, and reliability. Commencing with this generation, the 2-door coupe version of the Grand Prix was no longer an available body style. The timing of the disappearance of the Grand Prix coupe coincided with GM's reintroduction of the 2-door [[Pontiac GTO]]. The Grand Prix was offered with an optional [[head-up display]].&lt;ref name="newbury1"/&gt;

A 2004 Pontiac Grand Prix GT2 "Special Edition" was also offered in very limited supply, this model included special chrome spoke wheels, heated leather seats, the Monsoon sound system, and the heads-up display.  This Special Edition has the Pontiac SE name badging on the side of the car just behind the front wheels.

===2005===
[[File:Pontiac Grand Prix GXP .jpg|thumb|left|2005 Pontiac Grand Prix GXP]]

The Grand Prix remained basically unchanged from 2004. With the Base sedan, GT, GTP, and the new GXP. The base model and GT had the naturally aspirated 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6, with the GTP having the 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 with supercharger. The Comp-G package was still available for the GTP with an added door emblem denoting the Comp-G package.  When the GXP debuted later in the 2005 model year, the Competition Group was dropped, but several features were retained in a Sport package available on the GTP for the rest of that model year.

The GXP powerplant is the [[GM LS engine#LS4|LS4 V8]], a 5.3&amp;nbsp;L [[Active Fuel Management|Displacement on Demand]] (active fuel management) engine based on the LS1 block. Output of this version is 303&amp;nbsp;hp (226&amp;nbsp;kW)/323&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (438 N·m). It has a shortened crankshaft, and a host of other modifications to make it fit into a front-wheel-drive vehicle. The GXP also has a 4-speed automatic transmission with paddle-style TAPshift, heads-up display, vented cross drilled brakes with PBR calipers, performance tuned suspension with Bilstein gas-charged struts (sits about {{convert|9|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} lower than other GP models), Magnasteer II, and StabiliTrak dynamic control system. Also, the DIC will display G-Force (maximum achieved for lateral, acceleration, and deceleration) information when the car is not moving. Cosmetically, the GXP differs from the other models with more aggressive bodywork including a different front clip, wheel well cooling vents on the front fenders, a different rear bumper, and twin-dual polished exhaust. The Grand Prix GXP also offers a unique feature of the different-width {{convert|18|in|cm|abbr=on}} polished Alcoa forged aluminum wheels. The front wheels are {{convert|8|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide, and the rear wheels are {{convert|7|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide.

===2006===
For 2006, a "Special Edition" body package was added which came with a same colored grille, new front and rear "diffuser" type bumpers, lower side skirts, and wheels. The three options are the Grand Prix, powered by the 3800 Series III V6, the GT, now powered by the 3800 Series III Supercharged V6, and the GXP, powered by the LS4 V8. The GTP designation was discontinued from the Grand Prix line and applied as the top trim of the [[Pontiac G6|G6]]. All General Motors 3.8&amp;nbsp;L [[Buick V6]] powered cars become the first [[SULEV]] compliant vehicles. That model year gave it the car's final update by adding GM badges near the front doors until the Grand Prix was pulled from Pontiac's lineup after 2008.

===2007===
For the 2007 model year the model remained Base, GT, and GXP. Also, the active displacement management capability on the 5.3&amp;nbsp;L V8 (GXP) was renamed to "Active Fuel Management" from "Displacement on Demand", while the GXP trim includes a {{convert|303|hp|kW|abbr=on}} V8 engine with a firmer suspension, performance tires, heated leather seats, a heads-up display, and {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on}} wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.edmunds.com/pontiac/grandprix/review.html|title=Pontiac Grand Prix Overview|publisher= Edmunds.com|date=|accessdate=2010-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008===
2008 was the Pontiac Grand Prix's last year as the [[sedan (car)|sedan]]. For 2008, Pontiac did not offer the GT trim, but continued to offer both a base and GXP trim. The base trim is offered with a {{convert|200|hp|kW|abbr=on}} V6 engine and {{convert|16|in|cm|abbr=on}} wheels. Several new colors were also added for the 2008 model year.

The Pontiac Grand Prix was replaced by the [[Pontiac G8|G8]] for the 2008–2009 model year. Production of the larger [[Pontiac G8|G8]], however, ended in June 2009. The Pontiac brand was dissolved in 2010 as part of [[General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization|GM's Chapter 11 reorganization]].

==Canadian Variants==

In 1965, GM of Canada offered a de luxe version of the popular Pontiac Parisienne with the 1965 U.S. Grand Prix grille, the Parisienne Custom Sport.  It was available as a hardtop coupe or convertible, and was basically equivalent to the [[Chevrolet Impala Super Sport]].  This was followed in 1966 with the Grande Parisienne, which featured the unique American Grand Prix front (complete with hidden headlights in 1967-68), but unlike the U.S. car, was also available as a 4-door hardtop and convertible along with the hardtop coupe.  The 4-door and convertible versions had the same roofline as the standard Pontiacs while the coupe got the distinctive U.S. Grand Prix body styling.  Unlike the Grand Prix, these Canadian cars had "Pontiac" badges in the Grand Prix grille.  This model was offered until 1969, when the Grande Parisienne became a premium version of the Parisienne and the U.S. car became mid-size.  All full sized Canadian Pontiacs used the standard Chevrolet platform and drivetrains, with Pontiac-styled body panels and instrument panels.

===Safety ratings===
The IIHS gives the Grand Prix a ''Good'' overall score in the frontal impact test and a "Marginal" overall score for models equipped with side curtain airbags in the side impact test.&lt;ref name="ratingsbyseries1"/&gt;

The '''Pontiac Can Am''' is a [[Mid-size car|midsize]] muscle car built by [[Pontiac]] and based on the [[Pontiac LeMans#Fourth generation (1973-1977)|Pontiac LeMans]] and the [[Pontiac Grand Am]]. The Can Am was a special edition option package and was only available in 1977. It was named for the [[Can Am]] racing series, continuing the race theme used for the [[Pontiac Grand Prix]], LeMans and [[Pontiac Trans Am|Trans Am]].

==Background==

It was introduced midway through the production year, at the [[North American International Auto Show]] at the Detroit Auto Show during January 1977 - along with the [[Pontiac Sunbird]] Sport Hatch model. One feature of the Can Am was the [[Pontiac Firebird|Trans Am's]] [[shaker scoop|shaker hood scoop]] as standard equipment.

The car was a variation of the Pontiac Le Mans, but powered by the [[Pontiac V8 engine#400|Pontiac 400]] rated at {{cvt|200 |hp|kW PS|0}} (the T/A 6.6 "W72" version, not the base 400, which made 180). Cars specifically destined for Californian or high-altitude county dealers, featured the [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#403|Oldsmobile 403 Small Block]] making {{cvt|185|hp|kW PS|0}}.

The Can Am package was on Le Mans cars painted Cameo White which were then accessorised in orange, red, and yellow graphics, as well as blacked-out lower panels and window trim.  The standard road wheel was a color-matched Rally II with chrome trim rings. Many options were available, including the aluminum "snowflake" wheels offered on the Trans Am, and a steel or glass sunroof. Interior trim color options were the same as the base Le Mans, and included red, black, white, and tan.


The number of Can Ams produced has never been accurately determined, but the number most commonly used is 1,377. Complete Le Mans coupes were shipped by Pontiac to Jim Wangers' Motortown which carried out the various Can Am appearance modifications, including those relating to the hood, rear deck spoiler and body decals. According to the Can Am Registry in late 2007, 42 cars feature the Oldsmobile 403 engine, outwardly identified by "6.6 LITRE" decals on the hood shaker. The rest of the cars on the Registry have the Pontiac 400 engine, designated "T/A 6.6" on the hood shaker decals. The Pontiac Historical Service (PHS) can determine whether a car is a genuine Can Am, and list the options as it was delivered from the factory.

When the Can Am was first introduced to the dealers, Pontiac envisioned producing 2,500 units; the response from the buying public was much more than expected and over 5,000 orders were submitted. Unfortunately, the mold used to produce the fiberglass rear spoiler broke, and production at Motortown ended. Pontiac upper management, already worried about losing sales of their Grand Prix models (the Can Am and the Grand Prix used the same dashboard and console, so a sale of a Can Am was seen as a loss of a sale of a Grand Prix by some senior Pontiac executives), decided to scrap the project after approximately one half year of production.

Road tests commonly quoted the Can Am as having a {{convert|180|hp|abbr=on}} Pontiac 400, along with a 2.41 rear gear ratio.  This was a combination never offered to the public.  When built with the Pontiac 400 engine, the Can Am came with the three-speed automatic TH400 and 3.08 rear gears.  When built with the Olds 403 engine, the Can Am came with the three speed automatic TH350 and 2.41 rear gears.  No four-speed manual transmission cars were produced.

Performance tests from 1977 estimated 0-{{cvt|60|mph|0}} time for the Can Am with the Pontiac engine at about 10 seconds, about the same as the previous year's Le Mans with the [[Pontiac V8 engine#455|455]], and a {{convert|1/4|mi|adj=on}} time of approximately 17 seconds.

Regarding production numbers, in an interview with Jim Wangers in 2010 (http://www.pontiacsonline.com/JIM%20WANGERS.htm) he stated the total number of Can Ams produced was 1133.

Unique to Canada, the '''[[Pontiac]] Pathfinder''' was an entry-level full sized car&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first = Dusan | last = Ristic-Petrovic |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/Canada/1958%20Pontiac%20Brochure/1958%20Cdn%20Pontiac-06.html |title=File: 1958 Pontiac Brochure/1958 Cdn Pontiac-06 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; or station wagon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Dusan | last = Ristic-Petrovic |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/Canada/1958%20Pontiac%20Brochure/1958%20Cdn%20Pontiac-05.html |title=File: 1958 Pontiac Brochure/1958 Cdn Pontiac-05 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was based on the [[Chevrolet]] marque, another [[General Motors]] brand. The Chevy chassis, engine, and body panels were used, but most of the distinctive [[Pontiac]] styling parts for each model year were incorporated. This resulted in shorter front and rear fenders than on U.S. built Pontiacs and Canadian specific wheels and hubcaps. Interior trim was often unique to the Pathfinder. The last Pathfinders were built in 1958 as Pontiac's (Canada) base model. Body styles included a [[Panel van|sedan delivery]] which was Pontiac's last full-size sedan delivery, two-door coupes, four-door sedans, and a station wagon model. The Canadian built Pontiac sedan delivery was available only during the 1954 through 1958 model years since the sedan delivery was not sold in the U.S. after 1953.

[[File:'57 Pontiac Pathfinder (Rigaud).jpg|thumb|left|1957 Pontiac Pathfinder]]

The entry-level Canadian Pontiac models, from 1946 through 1953, used only the front section of Pontiac sheet metal, with the shorter Chevrolet wheelbase. This resulted in these cars appearing to be a Chevrolet with Pontiac ''Silver Streaks'' added on the trunk lid. From 1946 through 1952 these "Cheviacs" were sold as the '''Pontiac Fleetleader.''' Starting in 1954 these low-end Canadian Pontiac models (called Pontiac Pathfinders since 1953) used Chevrolet body shells, but with Pontiac features at both ends. These variants of U.S. Chevys are only recognized when compared to their U.S. Chevrolet or Pontiac equivalents, since body details often differ slightly between the U.S. versions of the two makes. Model year 1958 was the last for the Canada only Pathfinder models. The Pontiac Pathfinders (as well as some other Canadian models) usually had Chevrolet engines and drive trains, so that one can find Canadian Pontiacs with OHV [[Straight-six engine|sixes]] or 283 [[V8 engine]]s built by Chevy.

[[File:'58 Pontiac Pathfinder (Cruisin' At The Boardwalk '10).jpg|thumb|right|1958 Pontiac Pathfinder]]

Although Canada-specific models of U.S. makes were gradually phased out after Canada's "Auto Pact" treaty with the U.S. made them no longer necessary, Pontiacs manufactured and sold in Canada maintained their unique model names for many years even after the "Auto Pact" treaty took effect.

The third generation '''[[Pontiac Firebird]]''' was introduced in late 1981 by [[Pontiac]] alongside its corporate cousin, the [[Chevrolet Camaro (third generation)|Chevrolet Camaro]] for the 1982 model year. These were also the first Firebirds with factory fuel injection, four-speed [[automatic transmission]]s, five-speed manual transmissions, four-cylinder engines, 16-inch wheels, and [[hatchback]] bodies.&lt;ref name="new"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.camaro3rdgen.20m.com/1982.html |title=1982 Camaro |accessdate=2010-10-10 |publisher=camaro3rdgen |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415003743/http://www.camaro3rdgen.20m.com/1982.html |archivedate=April 15, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1982==

The 3rd Generation of Firebirds consisted of three models: Firebird, Firebird S/E, and Firebird Trans Am. The Firebird was the base model, equivalent to the [[Chevrolet Camaro (third generation)|Camaro Sport Coupe]]; the Firebird S/E was the luxury version; and the Trans Am, the high-performance version. For 1982, the new Firebird and Camaro had been completely restyled, with the windshield slope set at a dramatic, more aerodynamic 62 degrees,&lt;ref&gt;Gunnel, John ''Illustrated Firebird Buyer's Guide'' Second Edition (Motorbooks International, 1992) p.149&lt;/ref&gt; (about 3 degrees steeper than anything GM had ever tried before), flush mounted side glass, and for the first time, a large, glass-dominated rear [[hatchback]]. Electronically controlled retractable headlamps, and a rounded hoodline and front fenders were the primary characteristics that distinguished the Firebird from its Camaro sibling and its previous Firebird incarnations. The Firebird would retain hidden headlamps until the end of all production in 2002. Pontiac had also hoped to drop the "Trans Am" moniker from the redesigned cars to save royalties paid to the [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] for use of the name. Early promotional cars were marked "T/A" as an alternative, however it was decided that doing so might cause more problems than it was worth and the "Trans Am" nameplate remained. Still, with its dimensions reduced, wheelbase shortened, and weight reduced, the Third Generation Firebird was also the closest yet in size to the original 1967 model. It won "Best Sports GT" category in the $11,000 to $14,000 range (also along with the Camaro). Road &amp; Track called the fuel-injected Trans Am "a dramatic improvement on its predecessors," accelerating from 0–60 in 9.2 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Gunnel, John ''Illustrated Firebird Buyer's Guide'' Second Edition (Motorbooks International, 1992) p.152&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Firebird shrank to a 101-inch wheelbase, losing more than 8&amp;nbsp;inches in overall length, measured about an inch narrower, and weighed nearly {{convert|500|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} less than its 1981 predecessor. It also was the most aerodynamic production Firebird to date with a drag coefficient of 0.33. The new Trans Am took things a bit further, with a coefficient of .32.&lt;ref&gt;Gunnel, John ''Illustrated Firebird Buyer's Guide'' Second Edition(Motorbooks International, 1992) p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; The Trans Am body would continue to improve aerodynamically over the years, and by 1985 would be the most aerodynamic vehicle to ever be released from General Motors with a 0.29 coefficient of drag. Wind tunnels were used to form the 3rd Gen F-Body's shape, and these aerodynamic developments were fully taken advantage of by Pontiac's design team. The sleek new car had a low slung front end which featured split grilles. They fed some air to the radiator but most of the air came from an air dam underneath the front bumper. Every piece of the car was designed to reduce drag. The newly designed side view mirror housings, made of light alloy metal, were almost cone shaped, with the point facing the wind. The windshield wipers were hidden under the hood with the air intake for the climate control system. It made for a smooth flow of air over the windshield. The retractable headlamps popped up from the leading edge of the hood. The cars tended to outlive the plastic gears for the headlight doors, and since the dealers charged several hundred dollars for the repair, it was common to see Firebirds driving around with one or both headlights stuck open during the day. Smooth wheelcovers were available on the Trans Am, attached to turbine finned alloy wheels. A frameless, flush mounted, compound curved rear glass hatchback decklid provided {{convert|30.9|cuft|m3|abbr=on}}. of cargo space with the rear seats folded, and an optional wiper.&lt;ref&gt;Gunnel, John ''Standard Catalog of Firebird 1967–2002'' (Krause Publications, 2002) p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; It provided no disturbance to the airflow over the back of the car. All of these features combined together to provide a low coefficient of drag.
The front end of the vehicle featured {{convert|10.5|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} power disc brakes and were now made standard on all Firebird models. Taking styling cues from the 1981 design, the new car had full width tail lights, complete with a Firebird emblem in the center. The all-new suspension design was more advanced and aggressive than anything Detroit had offered previously, easily rivaling the Corvette's handling abilities, (but not its sophistication). The front suspension utilized MacPherson struts, with inboard mounted coil springs and lower front control arms. In the rear, coil springs and shocks were positioned between the body and solid rear axle, with twin rear lower control arms/trailing links and a torsion bar, replacing the old-fashioned leaf springs design used previously in the 2nd Gens. A huge torque arm was mounted from the transmissions tailshaft to the rear axle center to further stabilize the axle's tendency to twist.

The interior now featured aircraft inspired details and gauges, using both fake and real Torx head screws that fastened the dash and console trim panels. Optional Recaro seats were offered. The 1981, non-Formula 3 spoke steering wheel was re-used and featured a Firebird logo mounted in the center of the horn pad, with optional leather grip. Many power options could be had. Special Viscount "PMD" bucket seats were optional, featuring a small opening in the headrest and a PMD logo in the center of the backrest. Leather seats were also available on both the standard seats and Viscount "PMD" seats. A standard locking rear glovebox was mounted on the rear driver"s side of the cargo area and a mini spare tire was hidden behind the opposite panel on the passenger side. A lockable cargo door on the rear floor area and a retractable cargo area privacy shade were also available as options on all Firebirds.

The Firebird lineup was available with several engines:

# The standard fuel-injected 90&amp;nbsp;hp 2.5L 4-cylinder Pontiac "Iron Duke": This marked the first time a 4-cylinder engine was offered in the Firebird and was the last true Pontiac engine to be offered in the Firebird. This engine was only offered for the first few years of the generation. It provided almost the same power as the V6, but when coupled with the 5-speed manual transmission, provided between 31 and 34 miles per gallon on the highway, depending on the year.&lt;ref&gt;fueleconomy.gov "Find a Car; 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985 Firebird 2.5L 5-speed fuel economy Official EPA Window Sticker MPG" Web. July 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 
# There was a carbureted 102&amp;nbsp;hp 2.8L V6.
# The LG4 5.0L: Utilizing GM's improved "Computer Command Control" system, the computer assisted E4ME carburetor, and computer controlled distributor, this Chevy 305ci produced 145&amp;nbsp;hp and 240Lbs.Ft. of torque.
# The LU5 5.0L: The new high-performance "Crossfire Fuel Injection" 5.0L V8, which employed a twin throttle body fuel injection system similar to that used in the 1982 Corvette's "Crossfire" 5.7L, and produced 165&amp;nbsp;hp.

The Firebird came standard with 14-inch steel wheels, with several wheel options available unique to the base model. 14-inch turbo cast aluminum wheels were standard on the S/E and Trans Am models and featured smooth plastic hubcaps with a Pontiac "Arrowhead" in the center. The WS6 performance package option, available on the S/E and Trans Am, included 4-wheel disc brakes, P215/65R15 Goodyear Eagle GT radials with 15-inch cast aluminum wheels, stiffer springs, thicker 32&amp;nbsp;mm front &amp; 21&amp;nbsp;mm rear sway bars, a 12.7:1 quick-ratio steering box, and limited slip rear differential. Also available was the WS7 option, which was the same as RPO WS6, but utilized rear drum brake. This option was created due to a shortage of rear disc brake components.&lt;ref&gt;Gunnel, John ''Standard Catalog of Firebird 1967–2002'' (Krause Publications, 2002) pp. 99–101&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Firebird S/E was Pontiac's attempt to lure buyers interested in more luxury features; it could be had with the basic fuel saving "Iron Duke" I-4 drivetrain, but offered more options. Even the Trans Am's WS6 suspension was available on the S/E. It was delineated from the base Firebird model by "S/E" script on the sail panels, in place of the standard Firebird decals, and the Trans Am's dark tinted tail lights. The interior featured color-coded plastics to match the exterior/interior paint scheme. On S/E models equipped with the 14-inch or 15-inch "Turbocast" rims, with "Bowling Ball" hubcaps were color-coded to match the car's exterior paint.

The Trans Am came standard with a new incarnation of its traditional "Air Extractors" on the fenders. A dark-tinted version of the base Firebird's tail lights were fitted to the rear of the car and also featured a Silver or Gold "Phoenix" between them. Rubber "Mini-Spats" (stone deflectors) were mounted just before the front and rear wheels, and were toned down from the 70's design used on the earlier 2nd Gen Trans Am. Styled loosely after the earlier '80/'81 Turbo Trans Am, an optional "Turbo Bulge" hood was available on the Trans Am. Plans had originally been made to use a refined version of Pontiac's Turbo 4.9L engine. It was scrapped at the last minute, leaving many to speculate as to what could have been, had the engine been allowed to survive like its turbocharged companion, the Buick Turbo 3.8L [[V6]]. Despite this, the Turbo Bulge hood remained on the option list; on the Crossfire V-8, it was made functional, and even a lightweight aluminum version of this hood, "RPO T45", was available on the option list. It was a curved piece of pressed steel, and would be used in later years as the centerpiece of the Formula option. A new, smaller "Phoenix" was placed upon the Turbo Bulge hood or on the nose of flat hood equipped T/A's. The Trans Am came standard with one of the two 305 Chevy V8s. The well worn Borg-Warner four-speed manual transmission came mated only to the weak 145&amp;nbsp;bhp LG4 305ci, while the Crossfire-injected LU5 305ci rated at 165&amp;nbsp;hp came with the TH-200c automatic 3-speed transmission.  [[File:KITT1.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A black Pontiac Firebird Trans Am built to mimic [[KITT]] from the TV series ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]''.]]  

The new version of the Trans Am Pontiac's "RPO Y84" Black and Gold Trans Am S/E, made famous by [[Burt Reynolds]] and [[Jackie Gleason]] in 1977's "[[Smokey and the Bandit]]", carried on into 1982 as the limited edition "Recaro T/A". The package added about 25% to the price of a Trans Am. Standard with a host of options, some features included charcoal Parella cloth Recaro seats, t-tops, a black exterior with gold trim, and black "Bowling Ball" hubcaps with special Gold Pontiac Arrowhead emblems on its center, mounted on gold-painted 15-inch aluminum wheels.

Another Special Trans Am also returned: the Daytona 500 Pace Car Edition. These models are quite rare, and much is still unknown about how many were built or how they were optioned. All were bright red, with special NASCAR decals, similar to both the 1981 Daytona Pace Car and the 1983 Daytona Pace Car. 15" Aero Rims adorned with Black Bowling Ball hubcaps and a WS6 suspension. All had a black interior; it is not known if they included black Recaro seats. As it was Pontiac's debut of the still-fresh 3rd Generation 1982 Trans Am, it is possible that they would have been optioned with many of Pontiac's best amenities; however few are known to still exist at this time. Therefore, it is hard to ascertain what options they actually came with. These cars are featured in 1982 Daytona 500 race footage and in various advertisements.

A modified black third gen 1982 Firebird Trans Am appeared in the new for 1982 television series ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' as [[KITT]], voiced by [[William Daniels]], KARR, KITT's very evil twin voiced by [[Peter Cullen]], later [[Paul Frees]] in the original series in Seasons 1 and Seasons 3 of the original NBC TV  show Knight Rider was also a Modified Pontiac Firebird Trans AM as well.  For the reunion movie ''[[Knight Rider 2000]]'', KITT underwent a makeover and became the "Knight Industries 4000," a vehicle resembling the [[Pontiac Banshee]] concept car, but it was actually built using a Dodge Stealth and not a Firebird Trans Am.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jayohrberg.com/Knight_Rider_2000.html |title=Knight Rider 2000 - Jay Ohrberg's Hollywood Cars |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1983==

The Firebird remained basically unchanged from the previous model year. All automatic transmission Firebirds now received a T-handle shifter knob, and the shift indicator changed for the Automatic Overdrive 700-R4. Midyear, the L69 high output 305 was introduced. This carbureted 190&amp;nbsp;hp V8 was virtually identical to the L69 engine in the Camaro Z28, but used a different air cleaner assembly (instead of the Camaro's dual-snorkel air cleaner, the Trans Am received yet another functional cold air intake, designed to utilize the bulged hood).

The S/E Firebirds remained primarily the same outside of some color changes from the 1982 model year.

The RPO "Y84" Recaro Edition Trans Am or "Recaro T/A", was revised for 1983. It was now built to the owner's tastes, including many more, or less options, and RPO "Y81" returned as the Recaro Edition Trans Am S/E without T-Tops. The LG4 was standard as was the WS6 package. The exterior remained virtually the same, except now the Firebird logo decals on the sail panels were replaced with Gold-plated Black and Gold Firebird Logo Medallions. The interior now featured Tan leather Recaro seats, carpeting, side panels, and the headliner.

In its second year, the third generation Trans Am was again selected as the [[Daytona 500]] [[Pace Car]], and Pontiac offered a total of 2,500 Daytona Pace Car replicas through their dealerships. 
The exterior was painted with a two-tone white/charcoal paint scheme, "Official Pace Car" decals on the doors, "NASCAR" decals on the rear quarter panels, and "PONTIAC" decals on the front windshield and rear glass. 
Decorating the front fenders just above the "TRANS AM" script were "25th ANNIVERSARY DAYTONA 500" emblems. 
A new graphic adorned the power bulge of the pace car's hood, and these limited-edition cars were the first to feature a special RPO W62, full-body ground-effects package that extended around the entire car and molded plastic panels.
"TRANS AM" script appeared on the right-hand panel, in place of the standard Firebird nose grilles. 
Two different set of wheels were offered: 1) 15-inch "AERO" wheels with White "Bowling Ball" hub caps, or 2) silver-finned wheels.
The interior featured red gauge lighting, leather clad steering wheel, shifter knob, and brake handle, a special dash plaque, "Daytona 500" floor-mats, and two-tone grey leather/suede Recaro seats.
1,980 of these pace cars came with the LU5 Crossfire-injected 305 mated to the new 700R4 4-speed overdrive automatic; 520 had the carbureted LG4 305, mated to the T-5 Borg-Warner 5-speed manual.

==1984==

Total production for Firebird models increased to 128,304 units, making this the best-selling year of the 3rd Generation Firebird.
 
The Firebird's interior options and design remained virtually unchanged for 1984, the only exceptions being a slightly revised dashpad, with screwed-in speaker grilles, an optional driver's knee pad bolster on the left side of the center console for manual cars, the T-tops were also redesigned to use a pin-mounting arrangement, rather than the earlier latch-based setup, and a new 1 piece horncap embossed with the Firebird logo replaced the earlier medallion version. Base model Firebird production increased to 62,621 units.
 
The S/E Firebirds also remained virtually unchanged as well, with 10,309 units built.

The Trans Am's basic layout was very similar to the earlier 1983 Trans Am, except they were now available with the optional RPO W62 ground effects package, previously used on the 1983 Daytona Pace Car Edition. Another new for 1984 option was the "High-Tech" 15-inch, 20-slot, concave aluminum wheels, painted Gold or Silver, with Black plastic centercaps containing a Gold or Silver Firebird logo. The only drivetrain changes made for the 1984 model year were the deletion of the Trans Am only EFI Crossfire 305, a hydraulic clutch was now used on the T-5 Borg-Warner 5-speed transmission, and on L69 equipped cars, a lightweight flywheel and an aluminum belhousing were employed. L69 equipped Trans Ams also received an 8000 RPM tachometer, an 80 PSI oil pressure gauge, a high output single electric fan, a functional cold-air induction hood, a higher output mechanical fuel pump, and a secondary electric fuel pump to help prevent vapor lock. Trans Am production increased to 55,374 units.

The RPO "Y84" &amp; "Y81" Recaro Edition Trans Am S/E's were slightly revised. The H.O 305 L69 engine was now the only available engine. The exterior still featured a Black painted body, but gone was the Gold paint on the lower half of the body. All now featured Black painted, RPO W62 Aero package ground effects, the special "RECARO T/A" door handle inserts, the 1983 style Gold-plated Black and Gold Firebird Medallions on the sail panels, Gold painted High Tech 15-inch rims with a Black plastic center cap and Gold Firebird logo, WS6 package, functional cold air induction "Turbo Hood", with a Gold "fade" decal and Gold "5.0 Liter H.O." script on the turbo hood's bulge, Gold "TRANS AM" decals on the fenders and right side of the rear bumper, a special 3-row Gold pinstripe that wrapped around 98% of the lower area of the car, extending up, around the wheelwells, (similar to the 2nd Generaration Y84 S/E Trans Am's pinstripes). The interior still featured its namesake Tan leather Recaro seats. Sadly, this was to be the swan song year for Pontiac's storied Black and Gold RPO "Y84" Trans Am S/E's... a mere 1321 Recaro T/A's were produced.
 
For the 15th Anniversary of the Trans Am, Pontiac released a stunning, White and Blue Trans Am, following in the original 1969 Trams Am's striking color scheme for $3499 over the base $10,699, and limited to just 1500 units. It also only utilized the H.O. 305 L69, with 1000 automatics and only 500 with the T-5 Borg-Warner 5-speed. The exterior featured a White painted body, T-tops, White painted RPO W62 ground effects, special Blue "TRANS AM" decals on the lower rear half of the doors, Blue pinstripes similar to the Recaro T/A except they extend around the entire body, special Blue and White 15th ANNIVERSARY medallions on the sail panels, a functional cold air induction "Turbo Hood", with a Blue "fade" decal and Blue "5.0 Liter H.O." script on the turbo hood's bulge. The Black tinted Trans Am tail lights featured White paint on the horizontal bars, and a stunning Blue on White Firebird logo on the tail light center panel. Another special item featured only on the 15th Anniversary cars was the all new "Aero-Tech" 16-inch convex aluminum wheels, (front/rear specific). They wheels were painted White, with Blue pinstripes around the clear coated polished lip's outer perimeter, and were shod with Goodyear P245/50/VR16 "Gatorback" uni-directional tires (the new wheel/tire combo was very similar to the Corvette's P255/50/VR16 arrangement), marking the first appearance of 16 by 8-inch wheels on any F-body and a first for Pontiac. The WS6 package was standard with a 15th Anniversary Only 25&amp;nbsp;mm rear sway bar, (as opposed to the ordinary WS6's 23&amp;nbsp;mm bar). Interior features included: Off-White leather with grey cloth inserts Recaro seats with repeating "TRANS AM' script on the center portions, a special Off-White Leather-wrapped steering wheel with a special Blue and White 15th medallion inset in an Off-White Horn Button, Off-White leather shifter knob and parking brake handle, and Off-White pass-side map pocket w/ a Blue Firebird logo and Blue "TRANS AM" script.

==1985==

[[File:TAside-gallery.jpg|200px|thumb|left|1985 Firebird Trans Am: Pontiac would use this 15-inch "High Tech" aluminum wheel pattern until 1992.]] [[File:Pontiac red Trans Am.png|200px|thumb|right|1985's benchmark makeover: restyled nose with integrated fog lights, functional hood "nostrils" and rear edge vents to vent unwanted engine heat out of the engine bay]]
All Firebird models underwent redevelopment to boost sales as a number of power train improvements were introduced. The Firebird received a restyled nose with Black wrap-around inserts known as "bumperettes" to replace the grille inserts; wrap-around "bumperettes" were also added to the rear bumper. The tail lights remained unchanged from the previous "louvered" style design. The carbureted V6 was replaced with a new, multi-port fuel-injected 2.8L V6 making 135&amp;nbsp;hp. The interior evolved with a new dash design containing redesigned gauges that used a graph-patterned background, a slightly refined dashpad, new T-handle shifter for automatics; a padded and more ergonomic center console design, updated stereo and HVAC faceplates, and an optional version of the previous year's more ergonomic 15th Anniversary's steering wheel.

The Firebird S/E underwent some changes as well. It too used the new for '85 nose and rear bumper, but it now included some new items to set it apart. It received a new special hood, similar to the new Trans Am hood except with only the front vents, the new Trans Am tail light design, color-coded Firebird logo medallions on the sail panels, (similar to the '83/'84 Recaro version), and a color-coded rear Firebird logo on the center section of the tail lights. Cloth Recaro seats were also now available.

The Recaro T/A was no longer available, but cloth Recaro seats were optional on the Trans Am.

The Trans Am also underwent changes. The LG4 &amp; L69 continued on, but a new fuel-injected 305ci was now available in the Trans Am. The LB9 Tuned Port Injection (TPI) 305 was released, using a tuned runner design. The LB9 produced 210&amp;nbsp;hp, which brought it suitable attention from buyers despite being unavailable with a manual transmission. The "Turbo Bulge" hood was discontinued in favor of a new flat hood with twin louvered vents or "nostrils" that were functional, with heat exhaust vents on the rear edges. The Trans Am also received a restyled nose, integral fog lights, and newly redesigned ground effects. It utilized new "low density" taillight lenses with a grid-style pattern rather than the "louvered" pattern in use since 1981. The Trans Am came standard with the "High Tech" 15-inch concave aluminum wheels from the previous year, but it was also now available with the a version of the 15th Anniversary's WS6 suspension and its "Aero Tech" 16-inch aluminum wheels, but in finished Natural Silver. A Borg-Warner 9-bolt differential was made available for the first time, and was said to be stronger than the standard corporate 10 bolt axle. Further attempts to put the Trans Am into higher regard included overhead console from the Camaro lineup, which included several manually adjusted reminder wheels, a positionable map light, a removable flashlight with "FIREBIRD" script, and a small pocket for a garage door opener or sunglasses. The standard rear spoiler from previous years was still standard, but an optional wrap-around "Aero Spoiler" was now available in black and gave the car a new more modern look, (it is unique for 1985 &amp; 1986 as it had a texture). The Trans Am drag coefficient was measured at 0.32 but was as low as 0.29 with the standard Aero wheels instead of the High-Tech turbo aluminum wheels. At the time, it was the most aerodynamically efficient car GM ever produced.

==1986==

All Firebirds received center, high-mounted stop lamps to comply with Federal legislation; these were placed on top of the back hatch window. All cars received restyled, more modern instrument gauges. New tail light lenses were now introduced on the base Firebird, completing the replacement of the "slit" or "louvered" taillight lenses that had been a Firebird signature since 1967. The 2.5L 4-cylinder engine was dropped, replaced by the multi-port fuel-injected 2.8L V6 as the standard engine. The Firebird S/E model was discontinued at the end of the year. The rubber–vinyl wrap-around rear [[wing (automotive)|wing]] became standard on Trans Am (available only in black; as these wings aged, these and those offered on subsequent model-year vehicles would suffer from cracking and splitting problems), the Wing spoiler was a credit option on the Trans Am, and mandatory if the louvered rear window was ordered. Midyear, Pontiac introduced a new light-weight, cross-lace wheel, available for the Trans Am.

Only 26 Trans Ams with the 305 H.O L69 were built in 1986; it was discontinued because of fuel vapor lock (boiling) problems. Some sources indicate the 305 TPI engine output was decreased from 210&amp;nbsp;hp to 190&amp;nbsp;hp, while others maintain it stayed at 210&amp;nbsp;hp. Paint RPO's were changed to reflect the new base-coat/clear-coat paint process. American Sunroof (ASC), licensed by Chevrolet to build the 1987 Camaro convertible, also built three 1986 Trans Am convertibles as a "design exercise".

In spite of rumors, there were no 350 TPI L98 cars made in 1986 according to Pontiac.

==1987==
The Firebird body remained basically unchanged. All center, high-mounted stop lamps were relocated to a new position between the spoiler and the rear deck lid, and the large Firebird hood emblem disappeared forever. All V8s now received factory roller camshafts, and faced with consumer demands for more power, GM officially released the new 5.7L with tuned port fuel injection. Available only with an automatic transmission, it produced 215&amp;nbsp;hp and takes the top performance seat from the 5.0L TPI which was rated at 205HP. The 5.0L TPI, however, was available with a 5-speed manual transmission and, in fact, was quicker than the 5.7L TPI coupled with the automatic transmission. L69 production was stopped, leaving the LG4 as the only remaining carbureted [[V8 engine|V8]] used in the F-body. Trans Am GTA ('''G'''ran '''T'''urismo '''A'''mericano) was introduced, available with the LB9 305 TPI engine (which was returned to 205&amp;nbsp;hp) or the L98 350 TPI. Gold 16-inch, flat-mesh, diamond-spoke wheels were standard on GTA, with 16-inch, 20-slot wheels standard on Trans Am.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1987-1992 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am GTA Cloisonné Nose Emblem.jpg|thumb|Pontiac Firebird Trans Am GTA 1987-1992 Nose Emblem]] --&gt;

Firebird Formula was re-introduced, available with a choice of V8s (LG4, LB9 305 TPI, or L98 350 TPI), 16-inch convex wheels, and the earlier Trans Am "Turbo Bulge" hood. The wrap-around wing was updated and now standard on Trans Am and Formula; the regular, flat-surfaced spoiler from earlier Trans Am models was now made standard on Firebird. Trans Am and Formula were also offered with an optional 140&amp;nbsp;mph speedometer.

WS6 was standard equipment on the Formula and GTA from 1987 to 1992, and optional on the Trans Am. WS6 from 1987 thru 1992 included 36&amp;nbsp;mm front sway bars, 24&amp;nbsp;mm rear sway bars, quick ratio steering box, gas filled struts and 16" Wheels with 245/50R16 Tires. Later WS6 cars used ZR rated tires.

The Trans Am GTA was Pontiac's pride and joy with a standard 5.7L 350 Tuned Port Injection (TPI). Many people like to say, incorrectly, that the engine itself was pulled directly out of the [[Chevrolet Corvette#C4|C4 Corvette]], which itself began using the engine in 1985, but the heads on the Corvette were aluminum whereas the Firebird heads were cast Iron, although it did give the GTA performance numbers comparable to GM's flagship performance platform from whence it came. The GTA came with a standard TH-700R4 (4L60) automatic transmission, A/C, new seats with inflatable lumbar and side bolsters, special door panels, epoxy-filled emblems, body-colored ground effects, a special GTA horn button, and the WS6 performance handling package. All of these options were packaged into the Trans Am under the RPO code Y84, and the model was produced until the end of Third Generation F-body production in 1992.

Dealerships could finally order a Firebird Convertible from a recognized coach builder that was already converting other GM products (though more than a dozen other companies had been converting F-bodies into convertibles since 1982 for Pontiac &amp; Chevrolet dealers).  ASC (American Sunroof Company, Later "American Specialty Cars") (of ASC McLaren fame) offered Pontiac Dealerships a Firebird/Formula/Trans Am/GTA convertible. ASC was contracted to convert all of the official Camaro Convertibles from 1987 to 1992. However, due to fuel economy restrictions mandated by the EPA, a convertible Firebird would have been assessed a $1200 [[Gas Guzzler Tax]] because the LB9 &amp; L98 when paired with a Trans Am or GTA would have been lower than 22.5 average MPG. For this reason Pontiac did not directly offer a convertible through dealers like the Camaro. However these were not an official Pontiac offering, they are considered coach convertibles. The conversion of the Firebird was identical to the "Factory" Camaros of the same model year. The exception was the obvious cosmetic changes, the rear quarter caps, spoiler (Which was a Base spoiler Wing cut off) and the high mount 3rd brake light were Firebird convertible specific.

To order a Firebird Convertible the dealership would order a T-top Firebird and have it Drop shipped to ASC, One Sunroof Center, Southgate, MI 48195 for the conversion alongside "Factory" Camaros. Once complete, ASC would ship the now Firebird convertible to the participating dealership for delivery. This remained the procedure for dealerships through the 1989 model year. According to ASC they did not convert any Firebirds for the 1990 model year. As popularity increased and car became lighter &amp; more aerodynamic for the 1991 model year the process was simplified as Pontiac offered a convertible through normal dealer ordering channels via RPO's. A Total of 173 Firebird Convertibles were reported by ASC for 1987.

==1988==

[[File:88 notcback2.png|300px|thumb|left|1988 Trans Am GTA Notchback]]
The Firebird remained basically unchanged. The 170&amp;nbsp;hp LG4 carbureted 5.0L V8 was dropped in favor of the new 170&amp;nbsp;hp L03 5.0L V8 with throttle body injection. All V8 engines received serpentine belt systems and the A/C compressors were moved to the passenger's side of the engine, de-cluttering the engine compartment. The Firebird Formula received new high tech 16x8-inch aluminum wheels with distinctive silver "WS6" center caps. The GTA wheels were slightly restyled, and the convex 16-inch wheels were dropped as all Trans Ams received the 16x8" diamond-spoke aluminum wheels, available in different colors (white, red, charcoal, and black) in addition to the GTA's gold. The GTA received a new steering wheel with integral radio controls. The Trans Am was made available with body-colored ground effects like those on the GTA.
[[File:1988 Pontiac Trans Am GTA.jpg|200px|thumb|right|1988 Trans Am GTA equipped with a 305 TPI V8, and rare 5-speed manual transmission.]]
The optional convertible model also carried over, and now optional on the GTA was a new "notchback" hatch: rather than the large, glass hatchback that had been common to the Third Generation Firebird, the optional notchback consisted of a fiberglass trunk lid with a small, flat, vertical glass window. The notchback also incorporated redesigned rear seatbacks with integral headrests. The notchback became popular with onlookers, who often assumed the notchback-equipped GTA was a [[Ferrari]], thereby encouraging some owners of the type to dub their GTA the "Ferrari Back."  Many Trans Am owners were unaware that the $800 notchback option was even available, and for those who were, the vehicle typically had to be ordered from the factory, on a six-month waiting list, as the notchback was retrofitted to the vehicle. In rare instances, a dealership would get a notchback-equipped GTA on their lot. Another reason for the relative obscurity of the notchback is that the sales information was not very well disseminated to Pontiac salespeople, so many of them had no idea it was available as an option. As attractive as the notchback was, GTA owners were constantly plagued with structural and cosmetic issues with the design. The fiberglass would blister, causing surface bubbles resembling a bad case of acne. The Pontiac repair solutions were simply to sand the notchback down and repaint it, but the problem would always return, and GTA owners could expect multiple trips in order to achieve a final repair of the problem, or to have a new notchback installed. The notchback was intended to carry over and be standard-issue on the 1989 20th Anniversary GTA, but the plan never materialized; the aforementioned quality control issues apparently caused GM not to carry it over to the next year..

ASC continued to offer a Convertible for dealerships in 1988. A total of 104 Firebird Convertibles are reported from ASC for Pontiac Dealerships.

''Muscle Car Review'' February 1990: p.64. Print&lt;/ref&gt; Two were reportedly built, one with Leather, one with cloth.]]
1989 was the biggest year for Pontiac with respect to press coverage, promotions, and performance. It was not well known at the time, but in 1989, Pontiac produced the quickest&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Csere, Csaba "20th Anniversary Pontiac Trans Am; Gentlemen, light your tires" ''Car and Driver'' June 1989 Print&lt;/ref&gt; and fastest&lt;ref&gt;''Motor Trend'', June 1989-Volume 41 Number 6 pp. 42–47, 50, 54&lt;/ref&gt; American production car. The "Excitement Division" was also asked to provide a car to pace the 73rd running of the [[Indianapolis 500]]; sadly, it would be the final time a Pontiac would ever receive that honor. The Trans Am model was now 20 years old, and it was time for another anniversary edition, with this special 20th Anniversary Trans Am to be based on the existing Trans Am GTA. Through a unique partnership between Pontiac and an engineering firm called Prototype Automotive Services (PAS), the Trans Am GTA was equipped with a more powerful version of the [[Buick V6 engine#LD5|turbocharged Buick 3.8L V6]], originally developed for the [[Buick Regal#Grand National, T-Type and GNX|Buick Regal Grand National]], and the Turbo Trans Am (TTA) became the vehicle Pontiac supplied to pace the Indianapolis 500. Ultimately, 1,555 TTA replicas, rated at 250&amp;nbsp;hp, were produced for sale, five of those being test cars. But after ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine tested the car, logging a 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph run in 4.6 seconds, and a standing quarter-mile in 13.4 seconds at 101&amp;nbsp;mph, they called the 250&amp;nbsp;hp rating "exceedingly modest," estimating the actual output to be "closer to 300&amp;nbsp;hp." They also subsequently reported that it was the "quickest 0–60 sprinter available in any US production-car showroom – at any price."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The ''Car and Driver'' evaluation produced the best acceleration performance of any mainstream publication to test a regular TTA press car from the Pontiac fleet, partly because ''Car and Driver'' realized that the turbo boost must be "preloaded" to get maximum performance figures. But short-distance sprinting was not all this car could do well. Early in 1989, ''[[Motor Trend]]'' ran their top speed test article "Flat-out Fastest American Cars II-the Sequel."  During this test, the TTA did 162&amp;nbsp;mph, and was the fastest production car evaluated in the test. However, ''Motor Trend'' declared the winner to be a 1989 [[Chevrolet Corvette C4#ZR-1 (1990-95)|Corvette ZR-1]], which went much faster, but was not a production car (it was a prototype that Chevrolet intended to release for production in 1989, but did not come out until 1990).&lt;ref&gt;"Flat-out Fastest American Cars II-the Sequel." ''Motor Trend'' June 1989-Volume 41 Number 6: pp. 42–47, 50, 54. Print&lt;/ref&gt;  So by a slight technicality, the TTA could be called the flat-out quickest (0–60 4.6 sec.) and fastest (162&amp;nbsp;mph) American production car in 1989. The only constraint on the top speed of 162&amp;nbsp;mph was that the TTA was being limited by the engine [[redline]] and automatic transmission (with which all TTA's were equipped). When PAS installed a ZF 6-speed manual transmission into one of the cars, they were able to reach 181&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;"Pontiac Playthings" ''High Performance Pontiac'' December 1989: pp.19–22. Print&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps more importantly than the performance tests provided by the industry magazines was the fact that these cars were capable of much faster acceleration times – with minimal modifications. In fact, with $300 in new parts installed, 12.5-second quarter-mile runs were achievable – without manually shifting gears or the need to trailer the vehicle to the track!  Because of this, the TTA has gained a cult following among amateur racing enthusiasts.

Pontiac sub-contracted the job of engineering the TTA engine modifications to PAS. The narrow engine bay of the Trans Am required the use of different [[cylinder heads]], which happened to have better flow characteristics than the old Buick heads. Special stainless steel [[Exhaust manifold|headers]] were made specifically for the project as well. The heads, headers, along with more refined tuning of the boost and fuel curves, all added up to a more powerful package than the older Buicks. PAS was also in charge of testing and assembling the engines. Most TTA's came with T-tops and leather interior, but there were also hardtops and cloth-interior cars. And every TTA had an automatic transmission – the TH200-4R, equipped with overdrive and a torque converter clutch. The three actual pace cars were randomly selected from the production run, and sent to Indianapolis to pace the race. Thus, the pace car replicas were closer to the actual pace cars than any replica previously offered; the only difference between the replicas and the three actual pace cars was the addition of strobe lights and safety equipment to the latter. In addition, the TTA was relatively economical to drive; it returned 24&amp;nbsp;mpg on the highway, while the only cars (besides the [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]] [[Lotus Esprit#Turbo and S3 Esprits (1980)|Esprit Turbo SE]]) that could approach its performance at the time ([[Ferrari]]s, [[Lamborghini]]s, etc.) were far more costly, and providing only around 10 to 12&amp;nbsp;mpg. As has been proven to be the case in subsequent years, relying on a small engine for cruising, and a turbocharger for power, provides an exciting driving experience while returning impressive fuel mileage.
[[File:1989 Pontiac Trans Am Firebird GTA.png|thumb|right|1989 Trans Am GTA]]

The rarest 20th Anniversary Turbo Trans Ams are the hardtops and convertibles. Only 40 hardtops were made. Only three convertible TTA's were built by ASC,&lt;ref&gt;Heasley, Jerry "Vroom With a View; 1989 Turbo Trans Am Pace Car...convertible?" ''Muscle Car Review'' February 1990: p.65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pontiac Historic Services, Letter signed by Jim Mattison, September 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; one of which was bought by the president of PAS, with the other two falling into private hands. Only two are generally known to exist, however, as the ASC order log shows records for only two TTA convertibles.&lt;ref&gt;American Specialty Cars Inc. Firebird order log, August 21, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  The five test TTA's, because they were for pre-production use, were pulled off of the assembly line without regard to color, and therefore were not necessarily white. At least two of these test cars were sold to private individuals, so there are at least two extremely rare, non-white, factory TTA's in existence; in fact, one is known to be red.

As for the rest of the Firebird line, GM made a new dual [[catalytic converter]] exhaust system (RPO code N10) available, freeing up 13% more power from some LB9- and L98-equipped Formulas and Trans Ams; so equipped, LB9 engine output was increased to 225&amp;nbsp;hp while the L98 increased to 235&amp;nbsp;hp. The N10 option remained available throughout the balance of the Third Generation production run, however the L98 powerplant was only available with an automatic transmission, whereas the LB9/N10 combination could only be coupled to a 5-speed manual (RPO code MM5) and a [[Limited slip differential|limited-slip differential]] (RPO code G80) using a 3.45 performance [[Gear ratio|axle ratio]] (RPO code GM3). According to a March 1990 (Vol. 35, No. 9) ''Car and Driver'' article, when the latter set of options were combined into the relatively unassuming (and 300-pounds-lighter) Formula body, which shared the same WS6 suspension with the top-end Trans Am GTA, it created a "[[Sleeper (car)|sleeper]]" Firebird that could out-perform the heavier Trans Am GTA (even when equipped with the L98 engine) – at a roughly 30% lower sticker price.  ''Car and Driver'' also reported that (aside from the TTA, offered only in 1989) these "sleeper" Formulas were the fastest Third-Generation Firebirds – capable of accelerating from 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph in under 7 seconds and boasting a top speed of more than {{convert|135|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} (quite impressive for the day). Although not an exhaustive comparison, these claims would seem to be supported by a simple examination of the [[power-to-weight ratio|weight-to-power ratios]] of both models: a 225&amp;nbsp;hp Formula at a [[curb weight]] of {{convert|3300|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} versus a 235&amp;nbsp;hp Trans Am GTA at a curb weight of {{convert|3600|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}; the weight-to-power ratio for the Formula is 14.67&amp;nbsp;lb/hp compared to 15.32&amp;nbsp;lb/hp for the Trans Am GTA. According to the same ''Car and Driver'' article, very few of these "sleeper" Formulas hit the streets; only about 50 were built each model year, as almost all LB9-equipped Formulas came with an automatic transmission – which disqualified them from receiving the high-performance N10 and GM3 options.

Firebirds optioned with T-tops received new [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]] plastic tops made by Leximar for GM. The new tops were lighter in weight and tinted darker, but were more dome shaped and aged rapidly. GM replaced many sets with tops made of glass under warranty, but the acrylic tops continued as standard-issue through 1992. All Firebirds optioned with rear disc brakes now received PBR brake calipers and larger brake rotors, which resolved issues encountered with previous-model rear discs and increased stopping power. Introduction of GM's '''V'''ehicle '''A'''nti '''T'''heft '''S'''ystem (VATS) or PASS-Key made all Firebirds more theft-resistant. The system was adapted from GM's higher-end Corvette and [[Cadillac]] vehicles in response to an escalating trend among car thieves to target the Camaro and Firebird. VATS incorporated a small resistor into the ignition key shaft which was read by a sensor when the key was inserted. VATS-equipped cars also displayed anti-theft system warning decals in the lower rear corners of the side windows. A new CD player was offered, shoulder belts were added in the back seat, and the convertible model carried over.

ASC continued to make Convertibles for Pontiac dealerships. A total of 330 Convertibles were reported by ASC. A portion of those were 350 powered Convertibles. NOTE: 1989 was the First year a '''US''' Dealership could order T-top and a 350 Engine in a firebird. Since all Convertibles started as a CC1 (T-Top) car and converted by ASC 1989 would also be the only year to get a 350 powered third generation Firebird convertible.

ASC Reported a total of 330 Firebird Convertibles in 1989, 

Information comes from 1989 ASC Order log, the Order log show only 324 of the reported 330 convertibles, as of June 2018, three of those missing 6 vehicles have been identified and added to the above data. As a side note there are a known 5 L98 Powered Camaros made in 1987, making the total number of L98 Powered Firebird and Camaro Convertibles produced some of the rarest and sought after third Gens made with a total of under 200 produced for both lines all years combined.

==1990==

A driver’s side air bag was made standard. The Firebird interior again received a re-design, this time the changes were much less drastic: the lower dash and under-dash panels were altered, and accessory switches were moved to a new panel above the heater and radio controls. The deluxe contoured interior door panels that were standard in GTAs and available in Trans Ams were no longer available. All models would have to make do with the rather crude, flat, carpeted door panels, although if leather seats were ordered, genuine perforated leather was added above the armrest on the basic door panels. In GTAs the cheap door panels looked very out of place next to the exotic looking articulating seats. The console got a new shift indicator. This time, there was actually a needle to indicate what gear you had selected. Previously, you just had to line up the shifter handle with the markings. Steering wheel mounted radio controls disappeared from the GTA (due to the addition of the airbag), and the L98 engine was no longer offered in the T-top cars due to fuel economy regulations. The LB9 and L98 platforms were updated with new speed density fuel injection, and the elimination of the MAF sensor reduced production costs and supposedly improved performance. All L98-equipped cars now received the N10 dual catalytic converters as standard, which technically was a mid year change for 1989.

Like the Camaro, the 1990 Firebird only received a half-year production run, as Pontiac labored to release the re-styled 1991 model. Production ceased on December 31, 1989.

ASC reported making no Firebird Convertibles for 1990.

==1991==

[[File:1991 Pontiac Firebird.jpg|200px|thumb|right|1991 Firebird with re-styled nose.]]
[[File:91 green camel.png|250px|thumb|left|Trans Am Convertible's with Camel leather had GTA wheels and seats standard. There were no GTA convertibles from 1991 on.]]
All Firebirds received re-styled noses loosely fashioned after the "Banshee IV" show car while Pontiac was developing the all-new Fourth Generation platform. The Trans Am's ground effects were re-styled as well, and were made available on the base model Firebird, but NA on the Formula. The Trans Am and Firebird Formula received a new fiberglass-constructed, flat, wrap-around wing, The Trans Am and GTA received updated two-piece tail lights with "PONTIAC" scripted in orange across the panels, and the center, high-mounted stop lamps were moved to inside the top edge of the rear hatch.

The FORMULA was the only third Gen F-body to get to T-tops with a 350 Engine starting in MID year 1991 &amp; 1992, to get a FORMULA 350 T-top car the black cross laced wheels (as installed on the Trans AM) were mandatory.

Due to its lighter weight and improved aerodynamics the Firebird Convertible was finally available through GM's normal ordering procedures. ASC still converted T-top cars into convertibles but the ordering process was simplified and dealers would no longer need to have the cars drop shipped to ASC in Michigan. The Convertibles were offered with one of three engine options: LHO 3.1L V6, the L03 5.0L V8 for the base Firebird, or the LB9 5.0L [[V8 engine|V8]] Trans Am only.

An improvement on the T-top cars was introduced mid year on all F-bodies. T-top cars now came with new seals which greatly reduced leaks into the passenger compartment.

Beginning in 1991, SLP (Street Legal Performance) modified a factory-built Formula into what they called the "'''Firehawk'''". Once a Formula had been ordered or purchased, this limited-availability option (RPO code B4U) could be specified, and the vehicle was sent to SLP to be modified. No two cars SLP produced were alike; they all were special orders. SLP had anticipated making 250 of these special Firebird Formulas, but in fact, only 27 were ordered; and of those, only 25 were ever built (numbered 1–25 for hardtops – with numbers 18 and 23 never being built – and the only Firehawk Convertible was numbered 27 which was the only non-formula). Of those 25 Firehawks, 21 were "Mandatory" Red, 1 Aqua, 1 White, 1 Blue, and 1 Green; 11 had the Competition Package, 3 came with Aluminum Engine Blocks, 1 had T-Tops, and 1 was a Convertible.

==1992==
[[File:1992 Firebird V6.jpg|thumb|1992 Base-model Firebird (V6)]]
This marked the final production year for the Third Generation platform. Release of the Fourth Generation model was imminent, and Pontiac made few changes to the 1992 Firebird. The special edition Formula Firehawk that appeared in 1991 was still available, although a lot of dealers were unaware of its existence. The lack of awareness and a sky high price tag conspired to keep the sales figures down on the special Firehawk. As for the rest of the line, new exterior colors were available, including a bright "Jamaica Yellow". One interior color was changed, from the camel colored beechwood to a greyish beige. Convertibles were still available. One improvement made on all 1992 F-bodies was the addition of some extra bonding agents to stiffen the structure of the cars. The extra bonding was an attempt to correct squeaks and rattles that some owners had complained about. This also allowed GM to experiment with some of the new technologies which were to be implemented on the fourth generation cars. Mid-year, TPI-equipped cars only received blank throttle body plates rather than ones that had been marked "TUNED PORT INJECTION" on similar engines in prior model years; and black-painted valve covers replaced the silver components from previous years. As use of the L98 in the Corvette had come to an end, rough-cast runners found their way into L98-equipped Firebirds, and some cars received special rubber snubbers on the rear hatch frame that were designed to make the hatch more stable. This would be the last year for the light weight deep dish cross-laced wheels that had been available since 1987, and had been styled to look like expensive aftermarket rims. It would be the last year for the GTA, the last year for concealed windshield wipers, and the last year for the aerodynamic body with the long hood and low roofline. It was also the last year for full leather covering on the front seats. Some GTA's ended up with drum brakes on the rear, presumably because of a shortage of disc brake parts. Buyers were compensated for the downgrade. Ultimately, very few Trans Ams, GTA's, and Formulas were produced in this model year, as most buyers were waiting for the next-generation models.

GTA production figures:
*USA: 226
*Canada:48

The '''Pontiac Montana''' is a [[minivan]] that was sold by [[General Motors]]. Prior to the 1997 model year, it was known as [[Pontiac Trans Sport]]. In 1997, the Trans Sport added the '''Montana''' moniker as part of an available trim package. The package proved so popular the line was renamed Montana in 1998 for the US and 1999 for Canada. For 2005, the van was redesigned with a higher, less aerodynamic nose to resemble an SUV. The Montana name was also changed to '''Montana SV6'''. It was discontinued after the 2006 model year in the [[United States]] because of slow sales, but continued to be sold in Canada and Mexico until 2009. Since their introduction, the Pontiac minivans were GM's most popular minivans among consumers in Canada.

The [[Doraville Assembly|Doraville, Georgia assembly plant]] which produced the Montana closed on September 26, 2008.

The Montana nameplate was used as a trim level of the [[Pontiac Trans Sport]] van from 1997 to 1998. GM dropped the Trans Sport name for [[Model year|MY]]1999 (2000 in Canada) and the van simply became Montana. This generation was related to the previous generation [[Buick GL8]], the [[Chevrolet Venture]], the [[Oldsmobile Silhouette]], the [[Vauxhall Sintra]], and the [[Opel Sintra]]. The Opel and Vauxhall were only sold in Europe, although made in the same factory in the U.S. as the others. Chevrolet also introduced a nearly identical twin to Pontiac save for its badging for European consumption, named the Chevrolet Trans Sport. Both of the Buick GL8 minivans were only sold in China. 

The 2000-2005 GL8 is a similar version of the first-generation Pontiac Montana, and the 2005+ GL8 is similar to the Pontiac Montana SV6. The Pontiac Montana came in both short- and long-wheelbase models. The Pontiac Montana was one of the few minivans which provided seating for eight. For 2001, the Montana received a new steering wheel with the Pontiac logo which replaces the one with the PONTIAC letters. For 2003, the sport-style head restraints were dropped in favor of the conventional head restraints the Venture and Silhouette offered; and the anti-lock brakes became optional, as well as for the Venture, but remained standard for the Silhouette before Oldsmobile's demise in 2004.

New for this generation, [[cabin air filter]]s were installed, and the filters can be accessed from behind an access panel easily accessed from inside the glove compartment.

The Montana Thunder was the most up-level model of the Montana. Introduced in 2002, Thunder featured special "Thunder" badging, Thunder-specific 16" chrome 5-spoke rims, upgraded ride and handling package, and a special spoiler on the back of the roof rack. Inside, the Montana Thunder had special two-tone black and grey leather seating, and a perforated leather-wrapped steering wheel. The Montana Thunder was produced in 2002 and 2003, but for 2004 it was made an optional package on Montana GTs called the "Chrome-Sport" package. Only the "Thunder" badges were discontinued. Despite the Pontiac Montana's redesign in 2004, [[Pontiac]] continued to sell the original body style for the 2004 model year for fleet use. The last Montana rolled off the production line on March 31, 2004 as a 2004 model.

===Safety criticism===

[[File:1997 Pontiac Trans Sport SE IIHS.jpg|thumb|left|The 1997 [[Pontiac Trans Sport]] crash-tested by the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]]]

A [[crash test]] video of the 1997 Trans Sport/Montana resulted in some criticism due to extreme damage to the vehicle in the {{convert|40|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} crash test. The minivan received a "Poor" rating by the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS). It was also ranked the "Worst Performing Vehicle". Some comments made by the IIHS after the first test in 1996 were:
* Major collapse of the occupant compartment left little survival space for the driver.
* Extreme steering wheel movement snapped the dummy's head backward.
* The unnatural position of the dummy's left foot indicates that an occupant's left leg would have been seriously injured in a real-world crash of this severity.
* The forces on the left lower leg were so high that the dummy's metal foot broke off at the ankle.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wxDqG2ZSFA&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] gave the van 4 stars for driver protection and 3 stars for passenger protection in the {{convert|35|mph|km/h||abbr=on}} frontal impact test. In the side impact test, it received 5 stars for front passenger protection, and 5 stars rear passenger protection.

However, the safety issues of the Montana were addressed with the newer Montana SV6, which earned the  highest rating of "Good" given by the Insurance Institute in the frontal offset crash test.

For the 2005 model year, the Montana was updated to have a less aerodynamic design, like an SUV, resulting in its new name, '''Montana SV6'''. The 2005 Montana SV6 used a 3.5&amp;nbsp;[[Liter|L]] [[GM High Value engine#LX9|High Value 3500 LX9]] [[V6]] that generated {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on|lk=on}} and {{convert|220|ftlbf|Nm||abbr=on|lk=on}}. For 2006, a 3.9&amp;nbsp;L [[GM High Value engine#LZ9|LZ9]] V6, with 240&amp;nbsp;hp (179&amp;nbsp;kW) and 240&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (332 Nm) torque, was added as an option, and the vehicle added GM badges to the front doors. For 2007, the 3.5&amp;nbsp;L V6 was dropped, leaving the 3.9&amp;nbsp;L as the base engine. Consequently, the optional [[All-wheel drive|AWD]] system was also dropped, since it could not handle the torque of the 3.9&amp;nbsp;L engine. A [[flexible fuel|flex-fuel]] version of the 3.9&amp;nbsp;L V6 also became available for 2007, but was only available in Canada and Mexico for the SV6.

Similar to the [[Chevrolet Uplander]], [[Saturn Relay]], and [[Buick Terraza]], it was the second-costliest of its cousins.  In the United States and Mexico only the long-wheelbase version was sold.

In [[Mexico]], the Montana continued until the 2009 model year, with the 3.9&amp;nbsp;L V6 as the only engine option. General Motors marketed it as the '''Pontiac Montana SV6''', and it was almost identical to the discontinued North American version, but not the Canadian-specification model. In some parts of Canada (like Quebec), unsold 2009 models were remarketed as 2010. Some of these were also adapted for collective taxi use in Toronto and Montreal starting 2010.

==Discontinuation==
[[File:'06-'09 Pontiac Montana SV6 Short Wheelbase.JPG|thumb|left|2006–2009 Pontiac Montana SV6 short-wheelbase]]
On November 21, 2005, GM announced that it would close the [[Doraville, Georgia]] assembly plant, which produced the SV6, in 2008.  However, several months later, GM announced that the SV6 would be discontinued after 2006 in the US market due to poor sales. Production for both [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]] continued due to better sales in those two countries. The last SV6 for the U.S. market rolled off the assembly line on July 7, 2006.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}} Production ended for Canada and Mexico with the 2009 model year, with the demise of the [[Pontiac]] brand and the closing of the Doraville, Georgia plant on September 26, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/business/content/business/stories/2008/09/16/doraville_gm_plans.html |title=Four firms to present plans for Doraville GM plant |last=Duffy|first=Kevin|date=2008-09-16|publisher=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last vehicle built was a Canadian-bound Montana SV6 SWB with roof rack in Liquid Silver Metallic.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}} It was delivered to Marvin Starr dealer.

The '''Pontiac Sunbird''' is a small car manufactured and marketed by [[Pontiac]] over two generations.

The first generation was marketed as a [[subcompact]] hatchback, wagon and coupe (1976–1980) &amp;mdash; as a [[badge engineered]] variant of the [[Chevrolet Monza]], which was based on the [[Chevrolet Vega]]. 

The second generation (1982–1994) was marketed as notchback coupé, sedan, hatchback, station wagon, and convertible as a rebadged variant of [[General Motors]]' [[GM J platform|J-cars]] and was manufactured alongside the [[Cadillac Cimarron]], [[Buick Skyhawk]], [[Oldsmobile Firenza]], and [[Chevrolet Cavalier]] at GM's  [[South Gate Assembly]] and [[Janesville Assembly Plant|Janesville Assembly]] plants. 

The Sunbird nameplate ran for 18 years (with a hiatus during the 1981 and 1982 model years, as there was no 1981 model and the 1982 model was marketed as the  '''J2000''') and was replaced in 1995 by the [[Pontiac Sunfire]].

The first-generation Pontiac Sunbird is a [[subcompact]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/United%20States/Pontiac/1976%20Pontiac/1976-Pontiac-Full-Line-Brochure/slides/1976_Pontiac_Full_Line-03.html&lt;/ref&gt;, four-passenger automobile introduced in September 1975, and produced for the 1976 through 1980 model years. The first-generation Sunbird is a [[badge engineered]] version of the [[Chevrolet Monza]] which was derived from the [[Chevrolet Vega]].&lt;ref&gt;h-body.org&lt;/ref&gt; Built on the [[GM H platform (RWD)|H-body platform]], its intended competitors were other small sporty two-door vehicles including the [[Toyota Celica (A20)|Toyota Celica]], [[Nissan Silvia#S10|Datsun 200SX]], [[Mercury Capri]], and the [[Ford Mustang II]]. It did not share any mechanical relation to the [[Holden Torana|Holden LX Sunbird]].

===Overview===
[[File:Sunbird Formula.jpg|thumb|left|1978 Pontiac Sunbird Formula hatchback]]

The Sunbird has a {{convert|97.0|in|mm|sing=on}} [[wheelbase]] and a {{convert|65.4|in|mm|sing=on}} width. The first generation Sunbird is a [[rear-wheel-drive]] vehicle with a [[live axle|live rear axle]] design. The standard engine is the Vega aluminum-block [[GM 2300 engine|140 CID inline-four]]. Equipped with a single-barrel carburetor, it generates a peak power output of {{convert|78|hp}} at 4,200 rpm. the standard transmission was a four-speed manual, with a five-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] and three-speed [[automatic transmission]] options.
This engine was also available with a two-barrel carburetor that increased peak power to {{convert|87|hp}} at 4,400 rpm, as well as [[Buick]]'s 3.8 L (231 cid) V6 engine rated at {{convert|110|hp}} at 4,000 rpm. 
The front suspension is short and long control arms with [[coil springs]], and [[anti-roll]] bar; the rear suspension is a torque-arm design with coil springs and an anti-roll bar. Variable-ratio [[power steering]] was standard of a [[recirculating ball]] type. The brake system features front [[disc brakes]] with vented rotors, and rear drum brakes. Power-assist was standard.

===Model Year changes===
When the Sunbird was introduced for 1976, it was only available in a notchback coupe body-style shared with the Chevrolet Monza Towne Coupe. For 1977, the [[hatchback]] body-style was added. All Sunbirds had a new standard engine: Pontiac's 151 CID "Iron Duke" inline four-cylinder engine using a two-barrel Holley [[carburetor]] and generating {{convert|90|hp}} at 4,400 rpm. A Formula option was available on coupe, wagon, and hatchback. It includes the handling package, a chrome valve cover, three-piece spoiler, T/A steering wheel, and special body decals. EPA gas mileage rating was 28 MPG city and 34 MPG highway with the five-speed manual, exceptionally good for that  era.

[[File:Sunbird wagon.jpg|thumb|left|1979 Pontiac Sunbird Safari wagon]]
For 1978 and 1979, the station wagon from the otherwise discontinued Astre series was added to the Sunbird line. They continued to use the same front fascia as the [[Chevrolet Vega#Pontiac Astre|Astre]] with Sunbird badging. The 2.3 L engine was simultaneously discontinued.

For the 1978 and 1979 model years, the [[Chevrolet small-block engine#305|Chevrolet 5.0 L (305 cid) V8]] engine was made optional in the [[notchback]] and hatchback (RPO LG3, 481 for 1978 and 986 for 1979), while the Sunbird Safari wagon continued for its final year with a revised vertical styled grill. The 1978 and 1979 engine options included the {{convert|305|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, 3.8L V6 and a 2.5L I4. Body options included the Firebird Redbird package, Sunbird Formula package, and sunroof. Air conditioning was available as was four-speed manual transmission or three-speed automatic transmission.
 
1980 was the final production year of the H-bodied Sunbird. By this time the wagon body style and the optional V8 engine were discontinued. The year featured an unusually long production run in order to provide sufficient inventory to carry dealers into the 1981 model year, in anticipation of the Sunbird's replacement.

A total 479,967 H-body Sunbirds were produced in five model years.

}} For 1982, the rear-wheel-drive Sunbird was replaced by a new front-wheel-drive compact called the ''J2000''. Appearing as a sedan, coupe, wagon or hatchback, the J2000 was powered by either a 1.8L or 2.0L four-cylinder engine. The J2000 shared GM's internationally used [[GM J platform|J-Body]] platform with the [[Chevrolet Cavalier]], [[Oldsmobile Firenza]], [[Buick Skyhawk]], and [[Cadillac Cimarron]] in North America.

For 1983, the ''J'' prefix was dropped. This was in an effort to market the J2000 as a smaller version of the [[Pontiac 6000]], which had a similar appearance. Both engines were replaced by a new SOHC 1.8L four, imported from [[General Motors do Brasil|GM of Brazil]]. This engine used throttle-body electronic fuel injection, in contrast to the carburetor that was used in the 1982 engines, making {{convert|84|hp|abbr=on}}. A five-speed manual was newly optional. A convertible called the ''2000 Sunbird'' was also new for 1983.

1984 brought a new front fascia for a smoother, less angular look. The lineup was renamed ''2000 Sunbird'', a title used only on the convertible the previous year. A new turbocharged four-cylinder was available. Based on the standard 1.8L inline-four that powered other 2000 Sunbirds, it used multi-port fuel injection, for a total output of {{convert|150|hp|abbr=on}}. This engine was popular, and more powerful than many V6 engines in competing brands.

1985 was a carryover year, except for the ''2000'' prefix being dropped.

A GT model arrived in 1986. It featured fender flares, hidden headlamps, and the turbo engine standard. It was available in sedan, coupe or convertible. The GT sedan is very rare, with fewer than 5,000 sold. The GT convertible is the rarest variant, with fewer than 1,300 sold.
[[File:'87-'88 Pontiac Sunbird Sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1988 Pontiac Sunbird sedan]]

A redesigned gauge cluster and new engines were introduced for the 1987 model year. The gauge cluster featured different graphics, and a {{convert|120|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} speedometer on turbo equipped models, where 1984-1986 turbo models had an {{convert|85|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} speedometer. The new engines were "punched out" versions of the 1.8L, displacing 2.0L. The base engine still used throttle-body injection, for a new total of {{convert|96|hp|abbr=on}}, and the turbo still used port-injection, for a new total of {{convert|165|hp|abbr=on}}. Also, the convertible could only be ordered in GT trim. The rear fascia was redesigned in 1988, and the four-speed manual was discontinued. 1989 was the last year for the convertible GT, with the Turbo engine option dropped after 1990.

[[File:89-94 Pontiac Sunbird sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1989–1994 Pontiac Sunbird LE Sedan]]
Production under the Sunbird name was continued until 1994.  The trim levels on both the sedan and coupe were base, SE and GT. The Sunbird SE coupe, SE [[Sedan (car)|sedan]] and the GT [[coupe]] and [[convertible (car)|convertible]] had partially concealed headlamps, a feature that originally appeared on the [[Isuzu Impulse]], that gave the appearance of "raised eyebrows" when the headlights were on. The base model initially had the 1984-87 front fascia with exposed sealed beam headlamps. The engines were both the carryover 2.0L {{convert|96|hp|abbr=on}} I4 and the turbocharged 165 horsepower 2.0L four.  GM discontinued the Safari name on the Sunbird station wagon models.
 
In 1989, the base model received a smoother, more aerodynamic front fascia and the model was renamed "LE". An LE coupe joined the lineup also, with the same features as the LE sedan, but for a slightly lower price. The SE sedan was discontinued. In all models, however, a new dashboard was added. It somewhat resembled that of the larger [[Pontiac Grand Prix#Fifth generation (1988–1996)|Pontiac Grand Prix]], redesigned for 1988. The most notable change from the previous dashboard is the placement of the stereo. A redesigned AM/FM stereo unit was placed high in the dash. If a [[cassette player]] or [[compact disc player]] (new for 1989) were ordered, they were relocated at the bottom of the dash.

For 1990, the GT and SE coupes received a smoother front fascia with hidden headlamps. The GT convertible is discontinued, replaced by a turbocharged LE convertible, which also retains the GT suspension and steering. In all models, GM's passive seatbelt system was introduced. The seatbelts were mounted on the doors and would stretch out when latched.
[[File:'93 Sunbird Convertible.jpg|thumb|left|1993 Pontiac Sunbird SE Convertible]] 
The turbo four was deleted for 1991, replaced by the [[Chevrolet Cavalier|Cavalier]]'s 3.1L V6. With Multi-Port [[Fuel Injection]], it produced {{convert|140|hp|abbr=on}} at 5200 rpm, and {{convert|185|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4800 rpm. Although there was less horsepower under the hood, power came much quicker and smoother than the Turbo, with about the same fuel economy.  The V6 engine could be ordered in any model, save the new-for 1991 base value model.  The SE coupe received the LE coupe front fascia, but the GT's fascia could still be ordered with a sport package exclusive to SE coupes.

The largest change for the 1992 model year was a revision of the base engine. The 2.0 L [[SOHC]] [[Fuel injection#Throttle body injection|TBI]] four was replaced with the 2.0 L [[SOHC]] [[Fuel injection#Multi-point fuel injection|MPFI]] four resulting in a fuel economy increase and power increase. Power was increased from {{convert|96|hp|abbr=on}} to {{convert|110|hp|abbr=on}} and torque increased from 118 to {{convert|124|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. NOTE: The intake manifold casting is a bit thick and responds well to port matching the head with a stock felpro gasket. An SE sedan was once again available, and the base models were dropped and the convertible moved from LE to SE.
The only change for 1993 was the addition of a glass rear window with defroster on convertibles.

As the Sunbird came to a close, the trims were pared down. The SE sedan, SE convertible and GT coupe were dropped for 1994. The LE sedan, LE coupe and LE convertible (moved from SE to LE), and SE coupe stood pat for one more year. The SE coupe was essentially the 1993 GT coupe with a lower price.

Most Sunbirds were built in [[Lordstown, Ohio]] and [[Ramos Arizpe]], [[Mexico]]. The last one rolled off the assembly line on April 27, 1994.  The Sunbird was replaced by the [[Pontiac Sunfire]] in 1995.

==GT==
[[File:90sunbirdgt.jpg|thumb|left|1990 Pontiac Sunbird GT]]
The '''Sunbird GT''' model was introduced in 1986 as a coupe, sedan, convertible or fastback hatch with a 1.8 L [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[inline-four engine]] of the [[Family II engine#2.0|Family II]] range ([[Family II engine#1.8|LA5]]) as standard equipment. The {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 1.8-liter turbo engine had been available since 1984. In 1987 the engine was upgraded to the {{convert|165|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Family II engine#Turbo 2|LT3]].

All GTs featured semi-concealed headlamps and fender flares and "Turbo GT" badges replacing "Sunbird" badges. However, on the turbo delete cars the "Sunbird" badges were replaced by "Sunbird GT" badges. The sedan was dropped for 1988 and the interior for the coupe was redesigned for 1989. The convertible was dropped for 1990 and the turbo followed in 1991. Replacing the turbo four-cylinder for 1991 was GM's [[GM 60-degree V6 engine|3.1-liter V6]] that produced {{convert|140|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, but was quieter and smoother than the turbo. After 1993, the GT coupe became the SE coupe when the lineup was consolidated prior to the new model arriving for 1995.
{{clear}}

== Sunbird in Mexico ==
From 1988 to 1992, the US [[Chevrolet Cavalier]] was sold in the Mexican market as a replacement for the [[Chevrolet Citation]] in the compact segment, due to the dismissal of the last one in 1987. The Sunbird was first sold in Mexico in 1992 as a 1993 model; prior to this, the Sunbird had been badged as the "new" Chevrolet Cavalier, seeming like an exterior redesign for the compact, but preserving the same interior as the "previous" model, also replacing the Pontiac badges with Chevrolet bowties. A unique characteristic for the Mexican version was the offering of the second generation LB6 MPFI 2.8L V6 engine as the single powerplant for either base and top models, either attached to a 5-speed manual or a 3-speed automatic transmission.

The Pontiac Sunbird GT was also renamed, being sold as the Chevrolet Cavalier Z24, and having the LH0 3.1L MPFI V6 as the standard engine, either with the same 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic powertrains used by the regular models. Both versions of Sunbird labeled as Cavaliers were sold until 1995, when the new generation of the Chevrolet Cavalier, and the new replacement for the Sunbird, the [[Pontiac Sunfire]], were introduced both as separated models in Mexico.

==Related models==
In Europe the J200 shape (the name given by GM to this platform) was used in production of the Vauxhall Cavalier Mk II (U.K.) and [[Opel Ascona]] (Germany and other European countries). The European models received different styling from North American versions. The sports coupé variants were not marketed in Europe although it did appear in Latin America as the "Chevrolet Monza." Similar revisions were made for the J200 platform in the Australian market where it was named the "[[Holden Camira]]" - although there had also been an unrelated [[Holden Torana#LX Sunbird|Holden Sunbird]] offered from 1976 until 1980. In 1989 the Cavalier and Ascona J200 was replaced with a remodelled version known as the [[Opel Vectra|Vectra Mk1]] in Europe and the UK.

==Engines==
The 1982–1994 Sunbird came with one of these engines:
* 1982: 1.8&amp;nbsp;L ''[[GM 122 engine#L46|L46]]'' carbureted OHV [[Straight-4|I4]]
* 1982–1986: 1.8&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Family II engine#LH8|LH8]]'' TBI SOHC I4

The '''Pontiac Trans Sport''' is a series of [[minivan|minivans]] that was marketed by the [[Pontiac]] division of [[General Motors]].  The first light truck ever sold by Pontiac, the Trans Sport (a pun on ''transport'') was sold across two generations from the 1990 to 1999 model years.  The Trans Sport was slotted between the [[Chevrolet Lumina APV]] (replaced by the [[Chevrolet Venture]]) and the [[Oldsmobile Silhouette]].  The first Pontiac since the [[Pontiac T1000|T1000]] to have no direct predecessor, the Trans Sport took on the role of the [[Pontiac 6000|6000 Safari]] station wagon (in line with the Lumina APV replacing the [[Chevrolet Celebrity|Celebrity]] wagon).    

Introduced a year before the [[Chrysler minivans (AS)|second-generation Chrysler minivans]], the Pontiac Trans Sport and its counterparts marked an industry shift in the minivan segment towards adopting the form factor used by Chrysler.  Though the APV minivans used a model-specific chassis, the vehicles used a front-wheel drive, transverse-engine configuration, sharing mechanical commonality with sedans.      

During its production, the Trans Sport was assembled by GM at [[North Tarrytown Assembly]] ([[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Tarrytown/Sleepy Hollow, New York]]), shifting production to [[Doraville Assembly]] ([[Doraville, Georgia]]) for its second generation.  For the 1998 model year, Pontiac renamed the Trans Sport the [[Pontiac Montana]], deriving the name from an exterior trim package introduced for 1997; the Montana was sold in two generations through 2009 (2006 in the United States).    

==Background==
The Trans Sport and its siblings were created by [[General Motors]] in order to compete with the then-dominant [[Chrysler minivans (S)|Chrysler minivans]]. The larger [[Chevrolet Astro]] and corporate cousin GMC Safari were based on a [[body-on-frame]], [[rear wheel drive]] truck platform, and thus did not appeal to the same market segment as Chrysler's vans.

==Concept==
[[File:Pontiac trans sport concept.jpg|thumb|left|alt=mockup of the 1986 Pontiac Trans Sport concept car|1986 Trans Sport concept]]
A Trans Sport [[Concept car|concept]] was first presented in 1986, and included futuristic styling and features such as [[Gull-wing door|gullwing]] doors, a built-in [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], and a glass roof. This concept was well-received, and a production Trans Sport was greenlit in 1987. Most of the concept's standout features were not translated to the production Trans Sport, with the gullwing doors being deemed too expensive to produce, and the glass roof being traded for gloss black paneling due to weight and cost issues.

Two other GM marques, [[Chevrolet]] and [[Oldsmobile]], were also given vehicles based on the same platform as the Trans Sport, the Lumina APV and Silhouette respectively. In accordance with those brands' images, the Trans Sport was targeted at sport- and style-oriented buyers, while the Lumina and Silhouette targeted the value and premium markets respectively.

==Technology==
[[File:Pontiac TransSport dash, 1995.png|thumb|right|1995 Trans Sport dashboard]]
The Trans Sport, along with the Lumina APV and Silhouette, rode on the [[GM U platform|U-body]] platform and was constructed from a [[Hot-dip galvanization|galvanized steel]] [[space frame]], featuring dent and rust resistant [[Polymer|polymer plastic]] body panels on the side and a galvanized steel roof. Similar construction was employed on the [[Pontiac Fiero]], as well as some GM [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]] vehicles.

The Trans Sport had three seating options. The base trim featured a five-seat configuration, with three removable bucket seats in the second row (in contrast to the bench seats more commonly found in five-passenger vehicles). A seven-seat configuration, adding two removable bucket seats in a third row, was also offered. The Trans Sport in SE and GT trims offered a six-seat configuration, with two buckets per row.

[[Air suspension]] was offered as an option.

The 1994 Trans Sport featured the first powered sliding side door in a production vehicle; this was initially intended to debut in 1993, but was pushed back due to technological difficulties. The Trans Sport also added a driver's-side [[airbag]] in 1994.

For model years 1994 and 1995, [[Traction control system|traction control]] was optional with the [[Buick V6 engine|3800]] engine, and became standard in 1996 with the 3.4-liter V6.

==Reception==
[[File:Wiki cars 210.jpg|thumb|250px|Side view of the Trans Sport; "dustbuster" styling visible]]

A focal point of the U-body minivans at the time of their release was their styling. The Chrysler minivans with which they competed had more traditional, conservative styling cues, and GM felt that there existed an untapped market for a sport-styled van. This styling was received negatively by automotive critics, and the vans came to be called "dustbusters" colloquially, after the [[Black &amp; Decker DustBuster|handheld vacuum cleaner]] of the same name. Moreover, the unusually long and harshly sloped windshield, and resultant long distance to the windshield's base from the driver's position, made the vehicles disconcerting to drive for someone without prior experience. Thanks to these criticisms, as well as mediocre sales and mockery in Chrysler advertisements, the Trans Sport and Lumina APV were facelifted in 1994. The nose was shortened by 3 inches, some cladding was removed, and the interior dashboard received a ridge to lessen the perceived distance to the windshield's base. The European market did not receive this facelift, as the vans' initial styling had not been negatively received there. For model years 1994 and after, the European Trans Sport became an Oldsmobile Silhouette (which had not been facelifted in the U.S. market) with Pontiac badging.

At launch, the Trans Sport's 3.1-liter V6 was received as underpowered for the relatively large vehicle. This was rectified in the 1992 model year, with a 3.8-litre V6 offering improved torque and acceleration becoming optional. In 1995, a 1.9-liter [[Turbo-diesel|turbodiesel]] by [[Groupe PSA|PSA]] became an option in the European market.

===1990===
*All new model.
*Available as Trans Sport (with silver cladding) and Trans Sport SE ([[monochromatic]]), both offered the 120-hp 3.1L V6 and three-speed automatic.
*Launched in Europe with minor differences in exterior trim required for regulatory concerns as well as engine and transmissions appropriate for Europe's differing fuel cost and vehicle taxation structure. In some European countries sold through [[Opel]] dealers.

===1991===
*Customer complaints regarding glare reflected on the interior of the [[windshield]] from the massive expanse of the [[dashboard]] led to the addition of black carpeting in lieu of the more reflective plastic used in the previous year.
*Power windows and door locks made standard on American models.
*A manual sunroof was newly available.

===1992===
*Base model was discontinued and a sporty GT model was added. 
*Newly available for 1992 was GM's [[GM 3800 engine|3800]] V6 engine coupled with a [[Hydra-Matic]] [[Turbo-Hydramatic 125|4T60]] 4-speed electronically controlled [[automatic transmission]]. It was standard on the GT, optional for SE.
*With the departure of the base model, silver cladding was no longer available.
*Leather seating became available as an option on the GT model. Previously, leather seating was an [[Oldsmobile Silhouette]] exclusive within the [[GM U platform|U-body]] minivans.
*The cowl-mounted fixed radio antenna mast was eliminated, and an integrated roof antenna was installed, sandwiched between the roof and the [[Headliner (material)|headliner]].
*Side view mirrors were changed to the folding type and were enlarged to provide better rear-ward visibility.
*Brakes were enlarged and [[anti-lock brakes]] (ABS) was added as standard equipment.
*Steering wheel-mounted controls for the stereo system were added as an option on SE and standard on GT.

===1993===
*Due to very slow sales in 1992, the Trans Sport GT was dropped after one year. Trans Sport SE continues; it would be the only trim level available from 1993 to 1996. The SE model could be outfitted with any of the GT's options.
*The text badges were changed from black to the van's colours.
*A remote controlled power sliding side door was announced for 1993, but failed to actually make it into production that year due to quality control problems.
*A new color scheme with gold cladding, gold wheels and a body-colored roof behind the C-pillar was available as an extra-cost option with certain exterior colors.
*A redesigned center console was added this year with revamped, larger climate controls, a large storage cubby and a large storage bin at its base.

===1994===
[[File:Pontiac TransSport, 1995.png|thumb|1995 Pontiac Trans Sport SE]]
*The exterior styling was revamped, three inches (76&amp;nbsp;mm)  were trimmed off the nose. Headlights taken from the [[Pontiac Bonneville]] were installed with Bumper-mounted fog lamps added as standard equipment and cladding was made less flamboyant and stylized.
*In an effort to lessen the perceived distance to the base of the windshield, a ridge was added to the interior dash finishing panel.
*The power sliding door became available as an option, after being introduced in 1993.
*Built-in child seats for the second row became available as an option.
*A traction control system became available as an option with the 3.8L V6.
*Rear deep-tinted windows now featured a darker tint than previously used.
*A driver's side [[airbag]] became standard equipment.

===1995===
*Automatic power door locks that engaged/disengaged with the transmission shifting into or out of "park" added as a standard feature of the power door lock option package.
*Rear portion of the roof, behind the [[C-pillar]] previously painted black as standard with body color as a no-cost option, would be only available painted body color as a further effort to "normalize" the vehicles' looks as compared to competitors.

===1996===
*Both 3.1 and 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 engines dropped, a 3.4&amp;nbsp;L V6 [[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#LA1|3400]] engine became the only power plant available.
*There were few other changes, due to a completely redesigned 1997 model, to debut in summer 1996.

===1997–1999===
In the 1997 model year, the Trans Sport and its siblings got their first major redesign, ditching the one-of-a-kind construction and look to create a more conservative, conventional minivan. Gone were spaceframes, plastic body panels, and sleek styling. The new minivans were of [[unibody]] steel construction and the styling was intentionally conventional to such an extent that contemporary reviewers remarked that without looking closely at the badging and grille treatments, these minivans could be mistaken for their primary competitors, the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager, which at the time commanded a 50% share of the minivan market. During the development of this generation of the [[GM U platform|U-body]] minivan, General Motors extensively [[Benchmarking|benchmark]]ed {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}the then current [[Chrysler minivans (AS)|Chrysler minivans]]. The resultant vehicles more closely resembled the immensely successful trio; However, Chrysler would launch a [[Chrysler minivans (NS)|completely redesigned minivan line]] a year before GM. The last model year for the Trans Sport was 1998 in the U.S. and 1999 in Canada.  The [[Doraville Assembly|Doraville, Georgia assembly plant]] that produced the Trans Sport closed on September 26, 2008.

===Safety criticism===
[[File:1997 Pontiac Trans Sport SE IIHS.jpg|thumb|left|The 1997 Trans Sport crash-tested by the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS]]
A [[crash test]] video&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=StickyCheese2000 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wxDqG2ZSFA |title=Why do people buy a Montana? Another video about its safety |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2011-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the 1997-2004 Trans Sport/Montana resulted in criticism because of  extreme damage to the vehicle in the {{convert|40|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} crash test. The minivan received a "Poor" rating by the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS), and some comments made by the IIHS were
* Major collapse of the occupant compartment left little survival space for the driver.
* Extreme steering wheel movement snapped the dummy's head backward.
* The unnatural position of the dummy's left foot indicates that an occupant's left leg would have been seriously injured in a real-world crash of this severity.
* The forces on the left lower leg were so high that the dummy's metal foot broke off at the ankle.

===European market===
[[File:Chevy trans sport europe.jpg|thumb|Chevrolet Trans Sport (Europe).]]
This version of the Pontiac Trans Sport was also sold in Europe as a [[Chevrolet]], alongside the [[Opel Sintra|Opel/Vauxhall Sintra]]; however, unlike the Sintra, which was based on the Pontiac Trans Sport, [[Pontiac Montana]], [[Chevrolet Venture]], [[Oldsmobile Silhouette]] and the previous generation [[Buick GL8]], but wore the European [[Opel]] or British [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] badges and trim, the Chevrolet Trans Sport (as it was known) was trimmed and badged exactly like the Pontiac Trans Sport, the only differences being where [[Chevrolet]] badges were used in place of the [[Pontiac]] badges. In all cases, the European-market vans used different front, side and rear [[automotive lighting|lighting equipment]], different seat belts and sundry other safety items, to comply with ECE regulations which differ from US safety standards. These models were discontinued between 2003 and 2005, depending on the market. Despite limited sales in most of Europe, the vehicle was particularly successful in [[Sweden]] - where it was the best selling minivan for a while. While production ended in 2005, European stock lasted until 2007.

===1997–2005===
[[File:Pontiac-Trans-Sport.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Pontiac Trans Sport Montana]]
:''See [[Pontiac Montana]]''
For the 1997 and 1998 model year (1999 in [[Canada]]), along with the roll out of this new generation of minivans, the Pontiac (Trans Sport) Montana was debuted, which had special cladding and wheels intended to give it a more rugged SUV-like appearance. In the 1999 model year (2000 in Canada), the name "Trans Sport" was dropped due to the popularity of the "Montana" appearance package. By the time the "Trans Sport" moniker was dropped, the "Montana" package accounted for over 80% of total Trans Sport sales.  This also had to do with the fact that Montana become popular as an advertising name for several products in general around this time.

The '''Pontiac 2+2''' is a [[full size car|full size]] automobile that was manufactured by [[Pontiac]], built on the B-body chassis. It debuted for the 1964 model year as a trim-only option for the [[Pontiac Catalina]], with special door panels, bucket seats, and center console and exterior badging. Pontiac marketed the 2+2 as the "big brother" to the popular [[Pontiac GTO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=119 |title=Glory Days: When Horsepower and Passion Ruled Detroit |first=Jim |last=Wangers |year=1998 |publisher=Bentley |isbn=978-0-8376-0208-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Beginning in 1965 the name Catalina was no longer found on the car, although it was still an option on the Catalina. The 2+2 was equipped with a {{convert|421|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine, dual exhaust, heavy duty front springs as well as its own outer body trim appointments. It officially became its own series in 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=115 |title=Big Pontiac's - A Source Book |editor-first=Thomas E. |editor-last=Bonsall |year=1984 |isbn=978-0-934780-26-1 |publisher=Bookman Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the same platform, but reverted again to an option on the Catalina in 1967&lt;ref&gt;Bonsall, pg. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; and was discontinued in the United States the same year due to poor sales. 

It continued as a series in [[Canada]] until 1970. All Canadian-built 2+2's were equipped with a Pontiac body on a Chevrolet chassis, with the full range of Chevrolet engines available from inline 6-cylinder to big block V-8.

The name 2+2 reappeared briefly in 1986 on the Pontiac Grand Prix 2+2 G-body "aerobody" coupe, of which only 1,225 were built.

== Design ==
The designation 2+2 was borrowed from European sports car terminology, for a seating arrangement of two in front plus two in the rear. It was designated officially at Pontiac as a "regular performance" model,&lt;ref&gt;Bonsall, pg. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; a thoroughly confusing designation for a vehicle that was clearly intended to be to the Catalina platform what the [[Pontiac GTO|GTO]] was to the A-body Lemans: the standard drivetrain was a 2-barrel carburetor version of Pontiac's large 389 cu. in. V8 coupled to a floor-mounted 3-speed manual transmission; 3-speed automatic and 4-speed manual were options, as were a 4-barrel and Pontiac's signature 3x2 [[Tri-Power]] configuration. The suspension was stiffened with heavy duty springs and sway bar for improved handling.   Starting in 1965 the 389 was replaced by a high-compression {{convert|421|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, with displacement bumped to the 428 CID in 1967. 

Although the 2+2 was discontinued by 1968, all options (except the Tri-Power, which Pontiac discontinued after 1966 under a mandate from GM) were still available, and units could be ordered with what amounted to a 2+2 without the badges.

===Exterior===
The 2+2 was only available as a hardtop coupe or convertible. Distinguishing a 2+2 visually from a Catalina were ''faux'' louvers on the fenders or quarter panels. Annual changes meant the look and placement of the louvers were on different locations on the fenders from one year to the next. 1964 was the only year that the 2+2 came without them. Along with the badges that appeared on the fenders, hood, and interior to identify the ''2+2'', other details that appeared included a metal trim that ran the full length of the car, along the lower body line and skirt on the 1965 and 1966, and at mid-door height on the 1967. Another distinguishing feature was the pin-stripe trim package offered on 1965-67 models.
 
===Interior===
The sport interior was equipped with individual bucket seats. Automatic transmission cars had a column shift as standard equipment, console and floor shift were optional. Manual transmission cars had a floor shift as standard equipment. The console was an option. The elegant Catalina dashboard was carried over as well, and fitted with fully functional gauges. Other optional features included a console-mounted vacuum gauge, to monitor efficient engine use while driving, and a tachometer mounted at the top left corner of the dash fascia and later the hood, as an option in 1967.

== Engine ==
The Catalina and 2+2 were built on the shorter platform, but came with the same engine options as the larger [[Pontiac Bonneville]] model. The smaller {{convert|389|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine was standard in the Catalina, but not available in the 1965-1967 model 2+2s. All Canadian-built 2+2s were equipped with Chevrolet engines.{{cn|date=March 2017}} The 1986 GP 2+2's were all equipped with a 165HP 305 CID GM V-8 and automatic transmission.

=== 1964 ===
Pontiac offered the 2+2 as a trim option only in 1964. Most of the trim specifics were found in the passenger compartment. Without the 2+2 badges on the outside, it looked like the base Catalina. Standard was the {{convert|389|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}, [[Overhead valve|OHV]] ''Trophy'' V8, rated at {{convert|283|hp|abbr=on}} with a Rochester 2-bbl carburetor, and a 3-speed transmission controlled by a floor shifter mounted through the center console. A 4-speed was available at extra cost, as was an automatic.

Pontiac dropped the "Trophy" name for the 1965 model year, but it was also the year that the 2+2 was assigned its own power plant, the {{convert|421|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} "2+2 V8". Identifying the ''2+2'' was by the louvers that were incorporated into the bodywork. Standard features included heavy-duty springs and shock absorbers, a 3-speed synchromesh manual transmission (a 4-speed with a Hurst shifter was optional), dual exhausts, and a performance axle ratio of 3.42:1. A new Turbo-Hydramatic automatic transmission replaced the Hydramatic. ''[[Car and Driver]]'' (March 1965) tested a Catalina 428 and recorded a top speed of {{convert|130|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and a 0-60 time of just 3.9 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020606014913/http://www.musclecarclub.com/musclecars/pontiac-catalina/pontiac-catalina-history.shtml Muscle Car Club] On-line car registry&lt;/ref&gt;

== Canadian 2+2 ==
In 1967, [[General Motors Canada|GM of Canada]] debuted the [[Pontiac Parisienne|Parisienne]] 2+2, based on the Parisienne series that replaced the Parisienne ''Custom Sport'' from a year earlier. All Pontiacs manufactured and sold in Canada were unique from their U.S. counterparts as GM of Canada fitted re-proportioned US Pontiac bodies to the [[Chevrolet Impala]] [[chassis]] and drive trains. Canadian purchasers of the 2+2 could therefore order any Chevrolet V8 engine option like the [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#283|283]] and [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#327|327&amp;nbsp;in³ small-block engines]], or the [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#396|396]] and [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#427|427&amp;nbsp;in³ "Mark IV" big-block]]. The trim options were slightly different as well, with Chevrolet's 15-inch Rally rims were used instead of a standard 14" steel rim or the optional Pontiac Motor Division's Kelsey-Hayes "8-lug" integral wheel/brake-drum sets. A {{convert|250|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|155|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} straight-six engine was standard in 1967, which meant that the Canadian 2+2 was a Parisienne with louvers, exterior and interior badges, as well as bucket seats and center console (which were options on the Parisienne) as standard equipment.

The '''Pontiac Firebird''' was an American automobile built by [[Pontiac]] from the 1967 to 2002 model years. Designed as a [[pony car]] to compete with the [[Ford Mustang]] and [[Mercury Cougar]], it was introduced on February 23, 1967, simultaneous with [[General Motors|GM's]] [[Chevrolet]] division [[automobile platform|platform-sharing]] [[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaro]].&lt;ref name="Red Book" /&gt; This also coincided with the release of the 1967 [[Mercury Cougar]], Ford's upscale, platform-sharing version of the Mustang.&lt;ref name=MuscleCarFacts&gt;{{cite web|title=1967 Cougar|url=http://www.musclecarfacts.com/mercury-cougar/383-1967-cougar|accessdate=10 June 2015|publisher=Muscle Car Facts|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610172036/http://www.musclecarfacts.com/mercury-cougar/383-1967-cougar|archivedate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Techgen&gt;{{cite web|last=Montievo |first=Andrew |title=How the Mercury Cougar shaped today's luxury cars |url= http://techgenmag.com/2015/06/02/how-mercury-cougar-shaped-luxury-cars/ |magazine=Tech Gen Magazine |date=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Firebird" was also previously used by GM for the [[General Motors Firebird]] 1950s and early 1960s [[concept car]]s.

The first generation Firebird had characteristic [[Coke bottle styling]] shared with its cousin, the [[Chevrolet Camaro]]. Announcing a Pontiac styling trend, the Firebird's bumpers were integrated into the design of the front end, giving it a more streamlined look than the Camaro. The Firebird's rear "slit" taillights were inspired by the 1966–1967 [[Pontiac GTO]]. Both a two-door [[hardtop]] and a [[convertible (car)|convertible]] were offered through the 1969 model year. Originally, the car was a "consolation prize" for Pontiac, which had desired to produce a two-seat sports car based on its original [[Pontiac Banshee|Banshee]] concept car. However, GM feared this would cut into Chevrolet [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]] sales, and gave Pontiac a piece of the "[[pony car]]" market through sharing the [[GM F platform|F-body]] platform with [[Chevrolet]].

The 1967 base model Firebird came equipped with the [[Pontiac straight-6 engine#Overhead cam|Pontiac {{cvt|230|CID|L|1}} SOHC inline-six]]. Based on the standard 
[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#230|Chevrolet {{cvt|230|CID|L|1}} inline-six]], it was fitted with a single-barrel [[carburetor]] and rated at {{cvt|165|hp}}.&lt;ref name="Red Book" /&gt; The "Sprint" model six came with a four-barrel carburetor, developing {{cvt|215|hp}}.&lt;ref name=Kowalke_oldCars&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kowalke|first1=Ron|title=The Six-cylinder Firebird Sprint: Slouch or sleeper?|url=http://www.oldcarsweekly.com/features/bill-krause-1967-firebird-sprint|agency=Old Cars Weekly|publisher=F+W|date=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most buyers opted for one of three [[V8 engine|V8]]s: the {{cvt|326|CID|L|1}} with a two-barrel carburetor producing {{cvt|250|hp|0|abbr=}}; the four-barrel "HO" (high output) 326, producing {{cvt|285|hp}}; or the {{cvt|325|hp}} {{cvt|400|CID|L|1}} from the GTO. All 1967–1968 400&amp;nbsp;CI engines had throttle restrictors that blocked the carburetors' second barrels from fully opening.&lt;ref name="Red Book" /&gt; A "Ram Air" option was also available, providing functional hood scoops, higher flow heads with stronger valve springs, and a hotter [[camshaft]]. Power for the Ram Air package was the same as the conventional 400&amp;nbsp;HO, but peaked at 5,200 rpm.

The {{cvt|230|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engines were subsequently replaced in 1968 by the [[Chevrolet Inline 6 engine#250|Chevrolet {{cvt|250|CID|L|1}}]] stroked {{cvt|230|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engines, the first developing an increased {{cvt|175|hp}} using a single-barrel carburetor, and the other the same 215&amp;nbsp;hp with a four-barrel carburetor. Also for the 1968 model, the {{cvt|326|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine was replaced by the [[Pontiac V8 engine#350|Pontiac {{cvt|350|CID|L|1}} V8]], which actually displaced {{cvt|355|CID|L|1}}, and produced {{cvt|265|hp}} with a two-barrel carburetor. An HO version of the {{cvt|350|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} with a revised cam was also offered starting in that year, which developed {{cvt|320|hp|0|abbr=}}. Power output of the other engines was increased marginally.&lt;ref name="Red Book" /&gt;

There was an additional [[Ram-air intake|Ram Air]] IV option for the {{cvt|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine]]s during 1969, complementing the Ram Air III; these generated {{convert|345|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5000 rpm and {{convert|430|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] at 3400 rpm;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/?car=224763|title=Pontiac Firebird Trans Am, 1970 MY 2887|website=Carfolio.com |date=2014-05-01| accessdate= August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{convert|335|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} respectively. The {{Convert|350|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} HO engine was revised again with a different cam and [[cylinder head]]s resulting in {{cvt|325|hp}}. During 1969 a special {{cvt|303|CID|L|1}} engine was designed for [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] road racing applications that was not available in production cars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musclecarclub.com/musclecars/pontiac-firebird/pontiac-firebird-history-1.shtml Pontiac Firebird History 1st Generation 1967–1969 by Muscle Car Club, undated] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914133900/http://musclecarclub.com/musclecars/pontiac-firebird/pontiac-firebird-history-1.shtml |date=2008-09-14 }}, retrieved on August 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The styling difference from the 1967 to the 1968 model was the addition of [[Automotive lighting#Lateral|federally-mandated side marker lights]]: for the front of the car, the turn signals were made larger and extended to wrap around the front edges of the car, and on the rear, the Pontiac (V-shaped) Arrowhead logo was added to each side. The front door [[Quarter glass|vent-windows]] were replaced with a single pane of glass and Astro Ventilation, a fresh-air-inlet system. The 1969 model received a major [[Facelift (automotive)|facelift]] with a new front end design but unlike the GTO, it did not have the Endura bumper. The instrument panel and steering wheel were revised. The ignition switch was moved from the dashboard to the steering column with the introduction of GM's new locking ignition switch/steering wheel.&lt;ref name="Red Book" /&gt;

In March 1969, a $1,083&lt;ref&gt;Hemmings motor news Terry Shea July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; optional handling package called the "Trans Am performance and appearance package", UPC "WS4", named after the [[Trans Am Series]], was introduced. A total of 689 hardtops and eight convertibles were made.&lt;ref name="Red Book" /&gt;

Due to engineering problems that delayed the introduction of the all-new 1970 Firebird beyond the usual fall debut, Pontiac continued production of 1969 model Firebirds into the early months of the 1970 model year (the other 1970 Pontiac models had been introduced on September 18, 1969). By late spring of 1969, Pontiac had deleted all model-year references on Firebird literature and promotional materials, anticipating the extended production run of the then-current 1969 models.

The second generation debut for the 1970 model year was delayed until February 26, 1970, because of tooling and engineering problems; thus, its popular designation as a 1970½ model, while leftover 1969s were listed in early Pontiac literature without a model-year identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1970-pontiac-firebird.htm |title=1970s Pontiac Firebird |author=Editors of Publications International |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |date=December 21, 2007 |accessdate=February 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This generation of Firebirds were available in coupe form only; after the 1969 model year, convertibles were not available until 1989.

Replacing the "Coke bottle" styling was a more "swoopy" body style, while still retaining some traditional elements. The top of the rear window line going almost straight down to the lip of the trunk lid, a look that was to epitomize F-body styling for the longest period during the Firebird's lifetime. The new design was initially characterized with a large [[Pillar (car)|B-pillar]], until 1975 when the rear window was enlarged.

===1970===
There were two [[Pontiac V8 engine#Ram Air|Ram Air]] [[Pontiac V8 engine#400|{{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engines]] for 1970: the {{convert|335|hp|abbr=on}} L74 [[Pontiac V8 engine#Ram Air III|Ram Air III]] ({{convert|366|hp|abbr=on}} in GTO) and the {{convert|345|hp|abbr=on}} LS1 [[Pontiac V8 engine#Ram Air IV|Ram Air IV]] ({{convert|370|hp|abbr=on}} in GTO) that were carried over from 1969. The difference between the GTO and Firebird engines was that the secondary carburetor's throttle linkage had a restrictor which prevented the rear barrels from opening completely,&lt;ref name="Red Book" /&gt; adjusting the linkage could allow full carburetor operation resulting in identical engine performance.

For the 1970 and 1971 model years, all Firebirds equipped with radios had the antennas mounted "in-glass" in the windshield.&lt;ref name="Red Book" /&gt;

The [[Pontiac V8 engine#455|Pontiac {{convert|455|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine]] first became available in the second generation Firebird in 1971. The 455 engine was available in the L75 {{convert|325|hp|abbr=on}} version and the LS5 335&amp;nbsp;hp HO version, which was the standard, and only engine option, for the Trans Am. The HO engine also included Ram Air IV.&lt;ref name="Red Book" /&gt;

Again the 455HO was the only engine available for the Trans Am.&lt;ref name="Red Book" /&gt;

Starting in 1972, and continuing until 1977, the Firebird was only produced at the [[Norwood Assembly|Norwood, Ohio]], facility.&lt;ref name="Red Book" /&gt;

Actual production cars yielded 1/4 mile results in the high 14 to 15.0 second/98&amp;nbsp;mph range (sources: ''Motor Trend Magazine'', July '73 and Roger Huntington's book, ''American Supercar'') – results that are consistent with a 3,850 pound car (plus driver) and the engine equipped with a 4-barrel [[Rochester Products Division|Rochester]] [[Quadrajet]] [[carburetor]] rated at a maximum power of {{convert|290|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm and a maximum [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] of {{convert|395|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3600 rpm figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotrod.com/articles/pontiac-trans-sd-455-pontiac-save-best-muscle-car-last/ |title=Hot Rod: ''Pontiac save best muscle car last''|website=hotrod.com|accessdate=June 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An original rating of {{convert|310|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Horsepower#SAE net power|SAE net]] had been assigned to the SD-455, though that rating was based on the emissions non-compliant "pre-production" engines, as mentioned above. That rating appeared in published 1973 model year Pontiac literature, which had been printed prior to the "pre-production" engines "barely passing" emissions testing, and the last minute switch to what became the production engine. The 1974 model year production literature listed the specifications of the production engine (290 SAE net horsepower).

In 1973 and 1974, a special version of the 455, called the Super Duty 455 (SD-455), was offered. The SD-455 consisted of a strengthened cylinder block that included four-bolt main bearings and added material in various locations for improved strength. Original plans called for a forged [[crankshaft]], although actual production SD455s received nodular iron crankshafts with minor enhancements. Forged rods and forged aluminum [[piston]]s were specified, as were unique high-flow cylinder heads.

The 480737 code cam (identical grind to the RAIV "041" cam) was originally specified for the SD455 engine and was fitted into the "pre-production" test cars (source: former Pontiac special projects engineer McCully), one of which was tested by both ''Hot Rod'' and ''Car and Driver'' magazines. However, actual production cars were fitted with the milder 493323 cam and 1.5:1 rocker ratios, due to the ever-tightening emissions standards of the era. This cam and rocker combination, combined with a low compression ratio of 8.4:1 advertised (7.9:1 actual) yielded 290 SAE net horsepower. Production SD455 cars did not have functional hood scoops, while the "pre-production" test cars did.

A production line stock SD455 produced 253 rear wheel HP on a chassis dyno, as reported by ''High Performance Pontiac'' magazine (January, 2007). This is also consistent with the 290 SAE net horsepower factory rating (as measured at the crankshaft). Skip McCully verified that no production SD455s released to the public were fitted with the 480737 cam. When asked about the compromises for the production SD455 engine, McCully responded, "Compression, camshaft, jetting, and vacuum advance." He followed by stating that he would have preferred a [[compression ratio]] of 10.25:1, a camshaft with 041 valve timing, slightly richer carburetor jetting, and as much vacuum advance as the engine would tolerate. However, that proved to be impossible due to the emissions regulations of the era. Overlooked however, is a June 1974 test of a newly delivered, privately owned SD-455 Trans Am. This appeared in ''Super Stock and Drag Illustrated''. With an unmodified car and a test weight of 4,010&amp;nbsp;lbs the testers clocked 14.25 seconds at 101&amp;nbsp;mph. The car had automatic and A/C.&lt;ref&gt;Super Stock and Drag Illustrated June 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the factory rating of 290&amp;nbsp;hp was listed at 4,400 rpm while the factory tachometer has a 5,750 rpm redline.

Pontiac offered the 455 through the 1976 model year, but the engine could not meet tightening restrictions on vehicle emissions. A total of 7,100 were produced with the 455 engine.

[[File:74bird.jpg|thumb|right|1974 Pontiac Firebird Formula]]

Curb weights rose dramatically in the 1974 model year due to the implementation of {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} telescoping bumpers and various other crash and safety related structural enhancements; SD455 Trans Ams weighed in at {{convert|3850|lb|0|abbr=on}} in their first year of production (1974 model year; actually 1973).

The 1974 models featured a redesigned "shovel-nose" front end and new wide "slotted" taillights. In 1974, Pontiac offered two base engines for the Firebird: a {{convert|100|hp|abbr=on}} {{convert|250|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} inline-6 and a {{convert|155|hp|abbr=on}} {{convert|350|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8. Available were {{convert|175|to|225|hp|abbr=on}} {{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engines, as well as the {{convert|455|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} produced {{convert|215|or|250|hp|abbr=on}}, while the SD-455 produced {{convert|290|hp|abbr=on|0}}. The 400, 455, and SD-455 engines were offered in the Trans Am and Formula models during 1974.

A 1974 Firebird was driven by [[Jim Rockford (television character)|Jim Rockford]] in the pilot movie and the first season (1974–1975) of ''[[The Rockford Files]]'', and every following season, Rockford would change to the next model year. However, in the sixth season (1979–1980), Rockford continued to drive the 1978 Firebird from season five, as [[James Garner]] disliked the 1979 model's restyled front end. The cars in the show were badged as lower-tier Esprit models, but in reality were Formulas with the twin-scoop hood replaced with a scoopless one. Another hint was the twin exhausts and rear anti-roll bars that were not used on Esprit.

===1975===
The 1975 models featured a new wraparound rear window with a revised roofline and the turn signals were moved up from the valance panel to the grills which distinguished it from the previous year model. The Super Duty engine, Muncie four-speed, and TurboHydramatic 400 automatic were no longer available in 1975. Due to the use of catalytic converters starting in 1975, the THM 400 would not fit alongside the catalytic converter underneath the vehicle. The smaller TurboHydramatic 350 automatic was deemed enough. The 400 was standard in the Trans Am and the 455 was optional for both 1975 and 1976 models.

===1977===
[[File:Pontiac Trans Am 1977.jpg|thumb|1977 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am]]

A distinctive, slant-nose facelift occurred in 1977. There is a way to tell an early 1977 built car as there was a production change in the hood scoop. Early cars were supplied with an off-center scoop. Furthermore, early W72 cars came with the standard 180&amp;nbsp;hp air cleaner. 
Pontiac offered the [[Pontiac V8 engine#400 T/A 6.6|T/A {{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}]] with a single 4-barrel [[Rochester Products Division|Rochester]] [[Quadrajet]] [[carburetor]] [[Regular Production Option|RPO]] W72 rated at {{convert|200|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 3600 rpm and a maximum [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] of {{convert|325|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 2400 rpm, as opposed to the regular 6.6&amp;nbsp;Litre 400 (RPO L78) rated at {{convert|180|hp|abbr=on|0}}. The T/A 6.6 equipped engines had chrome valve covers, while the base 400 engines had painted valve covers. In addition, California and high-altitude cars received the [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#403|Olds 403]] engine, which offered a slightly higher [[compression ratio]] and a more usable torque band than the Pontiac engines of 1977.

From 1977 to 1981, the Firebird used four square headlamps, while the Camaro continued to retain the two round headlights that had been shared by both second generation designs. The 1977 Trans-Am Special Edition became famous after being featured in ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]''. The 1980 Turbo model was used for ''[[Smokey and the Bandit II]]''.

===1978===
[[File:Pontiac Firebird front.jpg|thumb|right|Pontiac Firebird Trans Am]]
[[File:400ci Pontiac.JPG|thumb|Pontiac 400CID V8]]

Changes for 1978 were slight, with a switch from a honeycomb to a crosshatch pattern grille being the most obvious from the outside.&lt;ref name=HBG1&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.hemmings.com/mus/stories/2011/08/01/hmn_buyers_guide1.html | title = 1977–'78 Pontiac Firebird Formula | publisher = American City Business Journals | work = Buyer's Guide from Hemmings Muscle Machines | first = David Traver | last = Adolphus | date = August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1978, the Pontiac group introduced a new special edition vehicle. The Firebird Formula LT Sport Edition which featured a revised 10% raised compression Chevy 305 V8 powertrain producing 155&amp;nbsp;hp (same as 1977 Chevy Monza Mirage) combined with a floor center console four-speed manual T-10 BW transmission coupled to a limited-slip differential final drive. The limited touring package (LT) also included a cabin roof, door, fender and hood graphics scheme, the Trans-Am sports handling package with HD gas shocks, modular alloy wheels and the SE Trans-Am rear deck spoiler with "Formula" word graphic detail. T-tops in 1978 transitioned from Hurst units to Fisher (GM) in mid year. In 1978 Pontiac also made available the Red Bird package on the Firebird Esprit model. Painted in Roman Red with a matching red interior it had a Gold pinstripe treatment with Red Bird graphics on the b-pillars. It also utilized the Trans-Am style steering wheel and dash except these were finished with gold spokes and a gold dash face which was unique to the Red Bird option.

The engineers also revised the compression ratio in the 400ci through the installation of different cylinder heads with smaller combustion chambers (1977 Pontiac 400 engines also had the 350 heads bolted to the 400 blocks, these heads were known as the 6x-4 heads and were taken from the Pontiac 350). This increased power by 10% for a total of 220 during the 1978–79 model years. The 400/403 options remained available until 1979, when the 400&amp;nbsp;CID engines were only available in the 4-speed transmission Trans Ams and Formulas (the engines had actually been stockpiled from 1978, when PMD had cut production of the engine).

===1979===
[[File:Pair of 1979 Pontiac Firebird Trans AMs.jpg|thumb|1979 Pontiac Firebird Trans AM, in T-top and coupe versions]]

The front end was restyled for 1979, which also marked the 10th anniversary of the Trans Am. A limited edition anniversary package was made available: platinum silver paint with charcoal gray upper paint accents and mirrored t-tops, and a special interior featuring silver leather seats with custom-embroidered Firebird emblems and aircraft-inspired red lighting for the gauges. The 10th anniversary cars also featured a special 10th anniversary decals, including a Firebird hood decal that extended off of the hood and onto the front fenders. Pontiac produced 7,500 10th anniversary cars, of which 1,817 were equipped with the high-output Pontiac T/A 6.6 W72 400 engine, the last of the line of the Pontiac 'big-block' V8 motors (and coupled with the four-speed Borg Warner Super T-10 manual transmission). The only option on these cars was the engine (the 400 was not certified for California, nor was cruise control available with it), which dictated the transmission and the gear ratio (3.23 on the 400 cars, 2.73 on the cars with the Oldsmobile-produced 403 engine and the TH350 automatic transmission). Two 10th Anniversary Trans Ams were the actual pace cars for the 1979 Daytona 500, which has been called the race that made NASCAR. ''Car and Driver'' magazine named the Trans Am with the WS6 performance package the best handling car of 1979. During period dyno testing, the National Hot Rod Association rated the limited-availability T/A 6.6 high-output Pontiac 400 engine at 260–280 net horsepower, which was significantly higher than Pontiac's conservative rating of 220&amp;nbsp;hp. In 1979 Pontiac sold 116,535 Trans Ams, the highest sold in a year.

===1980===
In 1980, due to ever-increasing emissions restrictions, Pontiac dropped all of its large displacement engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BtzK7Hm77sUC&amp;pg=PA20|title=Automotive Atrocities: Cars You Love to Hate|last=Peters|first=Eric|page=20|isbn=9780760317877|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1980 therefore saw the biggest engine changes for the Trans Am. The [[Pontiac V8 engine#301|301]], offered in 1979 as a credit option, was now the standard engine. Options included a [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] 301 or the [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#305|Chevrolet 305]] small block. The turbocharged 301 used a Garrett TB305 turbo forcing air through a single Rochester Quadrajet 4-barrel carburetor, which was, however, too antiquated to take full advantage of the forced air from the turbo. Also, the low-octane (87–90) fuels would have led to severe detonation, had it not been for the ECU, which led to the cars feeling not very powerful at all. Some owners have claimed quite reasonable performance numbers with the modern fuels though.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://oldcarmemories.com/1980-1981-pontiac-trans-turbo-4-9l-v8-better-think/ | title=1980-1981 Pontiac Trans Am Turbo 4.9L V8 - It's Better Than You Think| date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.2gta.com/1980ta.html |title = 1980 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1980 Turbo Trans Am was featured in [[Smokey and the Bandit II]]. However, due to the turbocharger problems, the cars used for the filming had to be fitted with [[nitrous oxide]] tanks by Marvin Miller Systems to get the desired performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.transam.me/y84_info.html |title = TRANSAM.ME - the Best Place for all TRANSAM Lovers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1981 Pontiac Trans Am 1.jpg|thumb|right|1981 Pontiac Firebird Turbo Trans Am]]

In the final year of the second generation Firebirds (1981), Trans Am still used the same engines as it had in the previous model year, with the only change being the addition of a new electronic carburetion system.

The assembly plant code for Norwood, OH is "N" (from 1972 to 1980 this would be the fifth VIN digit, for 1981 it is the 11th digit), and for Van Nuys, CA it is "L" (for Los Angeles, of which [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles]] is a district). In the later second-generation cars, Norwood used lacquer-based paint (there is an "L" on the cowl tag), and Van Nuys used water-based paint (there is a "W" on the cowl tag), due to California's tightening pollution regulations. The water-based paint often failed and delaminated during the warranty period and subsequently; cars had to be repainted.

The availability and cost of gasoline (two fuel crises had occurred by this time) meant the weight and the fuel consumption of the 3rd generation had to be considered in the design. In F-body development, both the third generation Firebird and Camaro were proposed as possible front wheel drive platforms, but the idea was scrapped. Computerized engine management was in its infancy, and with fuel efficiency being the primary objective, it was not possible to have high horsepower and torque numbers. They did manage to cut enough weight from the design so that acceleration performance would be better than the 1981 models. They also succeeded in the fuel consumption department, offering a four-cylinder Firebird that would provide 34 miles per gallon.&lt;ref&gt;fueleconomy.gov "Find a Car; 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985 Firebird 2.5 L 5-speed fuel economy Official EPA Window Sticker MPG" Web. July 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; GM executives decided that engineering effort would best be spent on aerodynamics and chassis development. They created a modern platform, so that when engine technology advanced, they would have a well-balanced package with acceleration, braking, handling, and aerodynamics. For the time being, they would have world class aerodynamics and handling, and excellent fuel economy.

The Firebird and Camaro were completely redesigned for the 1982 model year, with the windshield slope set at 62 degrees, (about three degrees steeper than anything GM had ever tried before), and for the first time, a large, glass-dominated hatchback that required no metal structure to support it. Two concealed pop-up headlights, a first on the F-Body cars, were the primary characteristic that distinguished the third generation Firebird from both its Camaro sibling and its prior form (a styling characteristic carried into the fourth generation's design). In addition to being about {{convert|500|lb|kg}} lighter than the previous design, the new design was the most aerodynamic product GM had ever released. Wind tunnels were used to form the new F-Body platform's shape, and Pontiac took full advantage of it. The aerodynamic developments extended to the finned aluminum wheels with smooth hubcaps and a functional rear spoiler.

=== 1988 ===
[[File:1988GTA1.jpg|alt=1988 Trans Am GTA|thumb|279x279px|1988 Pontiac Trans Am GTA with $800 Notchback option installed]]
In 1988 the Trans Am GTA, which was built with the standard 350 cu in 5.7 L V8 engine, was offered with the option of removable roof "T-Tops". However, any buyer ordering this option could only order the 305 cu in 5.0 L V8 engine, because the roof would not have the support for all the extra torque from the engine, requiring a power trade-off for those who wanted this option. Pontiac also introduced a rare option for the Trans Am GTA in the 1988 model year. This notable option on the 1988 Trans Am GTA was the $800 "Notchback", which replaced the standard long large, glass-dominated hatchback to make the Firebird design look less like the Camaro design. The Notchback was a special fiberglass rear deck lid, replacing the long-sloped window with a short vertical rear window, resembling the back of a Ferrari 288 GTO.

Approximately 700 of these Notchbacks were built in 1988 and offered for sale by Pontiac. Promotion was only in the form of a sheet in the back of a notebook of available options. The Notchbacks were made by Auto-Fab of Auburn Hills, MI. Problems with incorrect fitting of the Notchbacks to the GTAs at the Van Nuys plant often resulted in delays of several months for buyers who wanted this option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotrod.com/articles/hppp-0809-1988-trans-am-gta-notchback/|title=1988 Trans Am GTA Notchback – Hatch-22 – High Performance Pontiac|date=2008-09-01|website=Hot Rod Network|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, quality control problems plagued the Notchback, many owners complained of rippling and deforming of the fiberglass rear deck, and others complained of large defects resembling acne forming in the Notchbacks. Pontiac had to repair them under warranty, sanding down the imperfections, and repainting them, only to have more flaws resurface months later. Due to poor quality and numerous expensive warranty repairs and repainting, it was subsequently canceled on the 1989 20th Anniversary Turbo Trans Am, although a handful of them were still produced.

The fourth-generation Firebird amplified the aerodynamic styling initiated by the previous generation. While the live rear axle and floorpan aft of the front seats remained largely the same, ninety percent of the Firebird's parts were all-new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Road &amp; Track Special Series: Guide to the All-New 1993 Pontiac Firebird|date=1992|publisher=Hachette Magazines, Inc.|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the styling of the Firebird more strongly reflected the [[Pontiac Banshee|Banshee IV]] concept car than the 1991 "facelift" did. As with the Camaro, major improvements included standard dual airbags, four-wheel anti-lock brakes, 16-inch wheels, rack-and-pinion power steering, short/long-arm front suspension, and several non-rusting composite body panels. Throughout its fourth generation, trim levels included V6-powered Firebird, and V8-powered Formula and Trans Am. Standard manual transmissions were the T5 five-speed manual for the V6s, Borg-Warner's T56 six-speed manual for the V8s. The 4L60 four-speed automatic was optional for both in 1993, becoming the 4L60E with built-in electronic controls in 1994.

===1993–1997===
[[File:Firebird 07-24-2019.jpg|alt=1993–1997 Pontiac Firebird|thumb|rear view (1993–1997)]]
From 1993 until 1995 (1995 non-California cars), Firebirds received a {{convert|160|hp|abbr=on|0}} 3.4&amp;nbsp;L V6, an enhanced version of the third-generation's 3.1&amp;nbsp;L V6. Beginning mid-year 1995 onward, a Series II 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 with {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on|0}} became the Firebird's sole engine. From 1993 to 1997, the sole engine for the Formula and Trans Am was the 5.7&amp;nbsp;L LT1 V8, essentially identical to the LT1 in the [[Chevrolet Corvette#C4|C4 Corvette]] except for more flow-restrictive intake and exhaust systems.
Steering wheel audio controls were included with optional uplevel cassette or compact disc stereo systems.

Beginning with 1994 model year cars, "Delco 2001"-series stereo systems replaced the previous Delco units.&lt;ref name="Flammang"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flammang|first1=James|last2=Kowalke|first2=Ron|title=standard catalog of American Cars 1976–1999|date=1999|publisher=Krause|isbn=0-87341-755-0|edition=third}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|898}} This revised series, also introduced for other Pontiac car lines, featured ergonomically-designed control panels with larger buttons and an optional seven-band graphic equalizer. Also in 1994, the fourth-generation convertible was available; every Firebird (and Camaro) convertible featured a glass rear window with a built-in electric defroster.

The 1995 models were the same as those of previous years, but traction control (ASR: acceleration slip regulation) was available for LT1 Firebirds, controlled by a switch on the console. The steering wheels in all Firebirds was also changed; their optional built-in audio controls were more closely grouped on each side. The "Trans Am GT" trim level was dropped from the lineup after its model year run in 1994. For 1995, all Trans Ams received 155-mph speedometers and Z-rated tires. 1995 was also the first year of the vented version of the Opti-Spark distributors on LT1 F-cars, addressing a common mechanical fault with the unit. The 'transmission perform' button was available only in the 1994 and 1995 Formula and Trans Am. This option was stopped for the 1996 and later models, but the unused connections remain available for 1996 and 1997 Formula and Trans Am. While 1995 cars still used the OBD-I (on-board diagnostic) computer system (the last year of any American car including the F-body to use OBD-I), a majority of them had OBD-II connector ports under the dash.

Firebird performance levels improved for 1996, with the establishment of the stronger 200-hp 3.8 L V6 as the new base engine, and the power rating of the LT1 increased to 285 for 1996, due to its new dual catalytic-converter exhaust system. 1996 was also the first model year of the OBD-II computer system. Optional performance enhancements were available for each Firebird trim level; the Y87 performance packages for V6s added mechanical features of the V8 setups, such as four-wheel disc brakes, faster-response steering, limited-slip rear differential, and dual tailpipes.&lt;ref name="Flammang"/&gt;{{rp|904}} For Formulas and Trans Ams, functional dual-inlet "Ram Air" hoods returned as part of the WS6 performance package. The optional package boosted rated horsepower from 285 to 305, and torque from 325&amp;nbsp;lb·ft to 335. Also included were 17" x 9" wheels with 275/40ZR17 tires, suspension improvements, oval dual tailpipe tips, and a WS6 badge. Bilstein shocks were a further option with the package.

The 1997 model year introduced standard air conditioning, daytime running lamps (utilizing the front turnsignal lamps), digital odometers, and optional 500-watt Monsoon cassette or compact disc stereo systems to all Firebird trim levels.&lt;ref name="Flammang"/&gt;{{rp|907}} For V6 Firebirds, a W68 sport appearance package was also introduced as a counterpart to the Camaro RS trim level. The WS6 "Ram Air" performance package was now also an option for the Formula and Trans Am convertibles, although these convertibles did not receive the 17-inch wheel-and-tire combination. There were 41 Formula convertibles and 463 Trans Am convertibles produced from 1996 to 1997 with the WS6 package.

===1998–2002===

In 1997, in relation to the Camaro, the Firebird received a mid-cycle refresh for 1998 model year. Major changes included a new hood and front fascia with dual intakes, retracting quad halogen headlights, circular turnsignal and fog lamps, a front license plate pocket, lower fender air vents, unified-style lower door raised lettering for each trim level, and a new "honeycomb" rear light panel, with circular reverse lamps. In the dashboard, "next generation" reduced-force dual airbags became standard. As before, the Formula and Trans Am again received a close derivative of the Corvette's 5.7 L V8, the LS1 of the [[Chevrolet Corvette C5|C5 Corvette]], as the LT1 (and LT4) V8s were discontinued.&lt;ref name="Flammang"/&gt;{{rp|911}} The LS1 Firebirds were also equipped with an aluminum driveshaft, replacing the previous steel version, while all Firebird trim levels gained four-wheel disc brakes with dual-piston front calipers and larger rotors at each wheel, complete with a solenoid-based Bosch anti-lock system. The Formula convertible was no longer offered.

Beginning in 1998 for 1999 models, a standard 16.8-gallon non-metallic fuel tank increased potential traveling range. GM's ASR traction control system was extended to the V6-powered Firebirds, and all LS1 (V8) and Y87 (V6) Firebirds also received a Zexel/Torsen II slip-reduction rear axle. An electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) system replaced the old hydraulic proportioning valve for improved brake performance. An enhanced sensing and diagnostic module (SDM) recorded vehicle speed, engine rpm, throttle position and brake use in the last five seconds prior to airbag deployment.&lt;ref name="Flammang"/&gt;{{rp|915}} In 1999, a [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] shifter for variants with the 6-speed manual and a power steering cooler became options for LS1 Firebirds.

In 2000, the WS6 performance package was available exclusively for 2001 model year Trans Am coupe and convertible variants.

For 2002, more convenience items such as power mirrors and power antenna became standard equipment, while cassette stereos were phased out.

The special-edition extra-performance Firehawk (available in Formula trim for 1993–1997, and again in both Formula and Trans Am trims for 1999–2002) was produced by SLP Engineering, Inc., and sold through Pontiac dealerships. Featuring 17-inch wheels with namesake [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] Firehawk 275/40ZR17 tires along with a functional twin-inlet hood above a specific air cleaner box, its rated power increased to {{cvt|300|hp|0|abbr=}} and 330&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (445 Nm) of torque. A total of 201 Firehawks were built for 1993. In 1994, the Firehawk package was expanded to include options for a suspension upgrade as well as a larger-diameter exhaust system that could boost power to 315&amp;nbsp;hp. T-top Formula coupes and convertibles could also be optioned as Firehawks beginning in 1995. For 1996 and 1997, the Firehawk gained rectangular driving lights mounted inside the front scoops and (except Firehawk convertibles) the Trans Am's elevated rear wing. In 1997, an LT4 Firehawk was also available, utilizing the same 330&amp;nbsp;hp, balanced-and-blueprinted LT4 V8 engine as found in the manual-transmission 1996 Corvette. A total of 29 LT4-powered Firehawks were produced.

Power levels for the 1999 Firehawk, powered by the LS1 V8, rose to 327&amp;nbsp;hp (330 in 2000, 335 in 2001, and 345 in late 2002 models equipped with the "Blackwing" intake). A 10th-anniversary Firehawk was available in 2001, distinguished as a black Trans Am coupe with gold-painted hood stripes, gold 17-inch wheels, and gold tailpipe tips.

'''1994 Trans Am GT'''
In 1994 only, a "Trans Am GT" option was available. Trans Am GTs did not receive any special badging, graphics, or emblems, and looked externally identical to the base Trans Am cars. The GT package included 245/50ZR16 tires and a 155-mph speedometer. Non-GT optioned Trans Ams in 1994 received 235/55R16 tires, a 115-mph speedometer, and a much lower top-speed limiter. The "highrise spoiler", leather, and T-tops were not standard on the Trans Am GT cars in 1994, nor any year of LT1 Trans Am. RPO code T43 "uplevel spoiler" was an option on all Trans Ams, and while the mass majority of 1994 Trans Am GT cars received the T43 spoiler (along with the majority of all 1993–'97 Trans Ams), it was not part of the Trans Am GT package. Both base Trans Ams and Trans am GTs could be ordered as coupe, T-top, or convertible versions and were both available with automatic or manual transmissions. While the GT package was a cost option on the 1994 Trans Am, a majority of 1994 Trans Ams were made with the GT package.

All of the 1994 Trans Am GT options became standard in 1995–2002 as part of the Trans Am package, and the GT name/package was dropped for 1995. Some of the early fourth-generation Trans Am and Formula Firebirds list "GT" on the vehicle's title or registration. The reason behind this is because the VIN does not specify a "package" (Formula, Trans Am, Trans Am GT, Firehawk, etc.); it only specifies the engine (5.7L V8 LT1). Because the title is based on the VIN alone, titles and registrations often list all of the packages, but it does not mean the car is equipped with any certain package.

'''1994 25th-Anniversary Trans Am'''
The 1994 model year marked the 25th anniversary of the Trans Am, and another anniversary edition was released, painted white with a single dark blue stripe down the center of the vehicle that was reminiscent of the 1970 Trans Am. It also featured white-painted, five-spoke, 16-inch alloy wheels, and white leather seats and door trim. This edition was available in either coupe or convertible form.

'''1999 30th-Anniversary Trans Am'''
As with the previous 25th-anniversary edition, the 30th-anniversary edition was either a white WS6 convertible or WS6 T-top coupe, with twin dark blue stripes from hood to tail, and distinct blue anodized five-spoke 17-inch alloy A-mold wheels, with white leather seats and door trim.

2001 was the 75th anniversary of Pontiac. An available 75th Anniversary Package incorporated a power and performance package that included power door locks including retained accessory power, power windows including express down drivers side, dual power sport mirrors, power antenna. Radio, ETR AM/FM stereo w/CD player and 7 band graphic equalizer inc clock seek up/down, remote cd pre-wiring Monsoon 500 watt peak power with 10 speaker premium sound system and steering wheel leather wrapped w/driver touch radio controls.

In 2001 the dealer price for this 75th Anniversary package was $4530.00. There were a total of 472 of these packages sold in 2001, #239 on the L36 Firebird, 231 on the Formula W66 Coupe, 5 on Formula Firehawks and 2 on Trans-Ams—making these editions quite rare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transamworld.com/break-down.htm "4th Gen Firebird Breakdown Numbers"]. Trans Am World. Retrieved July 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturer original window stickers included this as a separate package listing the items and one price.

'''2002 Collector's Edition Trans Am'''
For the Firebird's final year, a collector's edition Trans Am was released as either a yellow WS6 convertible or WS6 t-top coupe, with twin black stripes from hood to tail, black-painted five-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels, and further black-trimmed body details.

The Trans Am was a specialty package for the Firebird, typically upgrading [[Car handling|handling]], [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], and [[horsepower]], as well as minor appearance modifications such as exclusive [[Hood (vehicle)|hoods]], [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoilers]], fog lights and wheels. Four distinct generations were produced between 1969 and 2002. These cars were built on the [[GM F platform|F-body platform]], which was also shared by the [[Chevrolet Camaro]].

Despite its name, the Trans Am was not initially used in the [[Trans Am Series]], as its smallest engine exceeded the SCCA's five liter displacement limit.

The second generation was available from 1970 to 1981 and was featured in the 1977 movie ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'',  the 1978 movie ''[[Hooper (film)|Hooper]]'', the 1979 movie ''[[Rocky II]]'', and the 1980 movie ''[[Smokey and the Bandit II]]''.  The Firebird Trans Am was also selected as the Official Pace Car for the [[1980 Indianapolis 500]].  The third generation, available from 1982 to 1992, was featured in the 1983 movie ''[[Smokey and the Bandit Part 3]]'' and the 1984 movie ''[[Alphabet City (film)|Alphabet City]]''. [[KITT]], the automotive star, and its evil twin counterpart [[KARR (Knight Rider)|KARR]], of the popular 1980s TV series ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', was a modified third-generation Trans Am. The fourth-generation Trans Am, available from model years 1993 to 2002, offered between {{convert|275|and|325|bhp|abbr=on}}. The fictional character [[Dwight Schrute]] from NBC's show ''[[The Office (American TV series)|The Office]]'', is another famous driver of the 1987 model.

The Trans Am GTA (Gran Turismo Americano) was an options package available on the Firebird Trans Am which added gold 16-inch diamond-spoke alloy wheels, a mono-chromatic paint scheme and special cloisonné GTA badges. The GTA (along with the Formula model that was intended to fill the gap between the base model Firebird and mid-level Trans Am) was the brainchild of former Pontiac marketing manager Lou Wassel. It was intended to be the "ultimate" Trans Am and was the most expensive Firebird available. The GTA equipment package officially went on sale in 1987 and avoided a gas-guzzler tax thanks to its lightweight PW 16-inch gold cross-lace wheels. The high-performance WS6 suspension package was also re-tuned to offer a more compliant ride while still maintaining tight handling characteristics. Engine choices consisted of a L98 5.7 liter (350 ci) TPI  V8 mated to GM's corporate 700R4 automatic transmission or the 5.0 liter (305 ci) TPI V8. A five-speed manual was available but was mated to the 5.0 liter only. The GTA trim level was available from 1987 through the 1992 model year.

For 1989, the 20th anniversary turbo Trans Am project (originally conceived by Bill Owen of Pontiac) was outsourced to PAS, Inc., an engineering firm led by Jeff Beitzel. Beitzel and his team did most of the TTA development work. The 3.8 liter turbocharged V6 engines were built by PAS at their 40,000 square foot City of Industry, CA plant. From there, they went to GM's plant in Van Nuys, CA to be installed into GTAs on the F-Body assembly line. The cars were then shipped back to PAS for final assembly, testing, and quality control. Incidentally, the GTA chassis were selected at random, thus there is no correlation between the VIN and production sequence number. The initial number of cars to be produced had ranged from 500 to 2,500 until GM finally settled on 1,500. In all, a total of 1,555 Turbo Trans Ams were manufactured.  One of these served as the [[1989 Indianapolis 500]] pace car.

The 2002 model-year WS6 Trans Am produced {{cvt|325|hp|0|abbr=}} at 5,200 rpm and {{cvt|350|lbft|0|abbr=}} of torque at 4,000 rpm out of its 5.7-liter LS1 V8 engine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nadaguides.com/Cars/2002/Pontiac/FIREBIRD-V8-6-Spd-AT/Coupe-2D-Trans-Am-WS6/Specs] 2002 Pontiac FIREBIRD-V8-6 Spd./AT

=== Burt Reynolds collection of Firebirds ===
On April 14, 2018 at the Barrett-Jackson collector car auction in Palm Beach, FL, just 5 months before his death, actor Burt Reynolds presided over the sale of 3 Pontiac Firebird Trans Ams from his personal collection, sold via Bandit Movie Cars of Florida, the custodian of the Burt Reynolds collection. He was also an avid Firebird collector after filming the movies [[Hooper (film)|Hooper]] and also the [[Smokey and the Bandit]] movie series. The first car was a red 1977 Firebird Trans Am survivor car from the Restore a Muscle Car Collection with a price of $57,200. The second vehicle was a rare 1974 Pontiac Trans AM 455 Super Duty, which was another survivor that reached $100,000 plus 10% buyer commission. The third car Reynolds sold was a 1980 Indianapolis pace car turbo Trans Am, which was also $100,000, plus 10% buyer commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.carbuyingtips.com/articles/blog/burt-reynolds-at-record-2018-barrett-jackson-palm-beach-auction.htm|title=Burt Reynolds adds fuel to the fire at record Barrett-Jackson Palm Beach Auto Auction|website=www.carbuyingtips.com|language=en|access-date=2019-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Racing ==
Firebirds were used in the [[Trans-Am series]] in the 1960s and 1970s. When the Firebird Trans Am was released, there was controversy over the model's inability to compete in the Trans-Am because the smallest available engine was too large for use in the series at 400 cubic inches (6.6 liters). The name also caused controversy because it was used without permission from the [[SCCA]], who threatened suit. GM settled the dispute by paying $5 to the SCCA for each car they sold. When the Trans-Am was last seen, model year 2002 Firebirds were in use. From 1996 to 2006, a WS6 Trans Am coupe provided the body style for the mechanically identical racing cars used in the [[International Race of Champions]] (IROC).

During the 1995, 1996, and 1997 [[NHRA]] seasons, 14-time [[funny car]] champion [[John Force]] used a Firebird body to replace the obsolete [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]] and [[Chevrolet Lumina]] bodies he had used since 1988. He used it for three seasons, winning the championship in all three years. The Firebird was also used by drivers such as Del Worsham, Tim Wilkerson, Frank Pedregon, and Jerry Toliver. The Firebird body also replaced the Oldsmobile Cutlass in the pro stock class in 1995, forcing drivers [[Warren Johnson]], Jerry Eckman, and Mark Pawuk to replace their body styles for the 1996 year. None of them would win with the first year of the Firebird body, but pro stock driver Jim Yates, a second year driver, using the Firebird body, did.

The '''Pontiac Sunfire''' is a [[compact car]] by [[Pontiac]] that was introduced for the 1995 [[model year]] to replace the [[Pontiac Sunbird|Sunbird]]. Not only was the name changed, but dramatic styling changes were included as well. The new styling was shared with the redesigned [[Chevrolet Cavalier]]. Along with the fresh new look the [[GM J platform|J platform]] was updated structurally to meet more stringent safety standards for the 1996 model year.

The Pontiac Sunfire went through two facelifts in its 11-year run. Once in 2000 which was a small redesign featuring the heavy plastic cladding look that was prevalent with Pontiac at the time, and more streamlined update in 2003.  In the US, the coupe was the only model available from 2003 to 2005. The sedan continued to be sold in Canada and Mexico until the end of production on June 22, 2005.  
The last J-body car, a 2005 Sunfire, rolled off the assembly line on June 22, 2005. [[General Motors|GM]] replaced the Sunfire with the [[Pontiac G5|G5]] for the 2006 model year in Canada and the 2007 model year in the United States.

The base model had the 2.2&amp;nbsp;L engine from 1994 until 2002. The GT trim level had an optional, more powerful 2.3&amp;nbsp;L Quad 4 [[internal combustion engine|engine]] from 1994–1995, which was replaced by the 2.4&amp;nbsp;L LD9 engine in 1995. The 2.3 and 2.4 litre engines were optional in the 2 and 4 door LS trim level. In 2003, both the 2.2&amp;nbsp;L and the 2.4&amp;nbsp;L engines were replaced by the 2.2&amp;nbsp;L Ecotec engine, and would be the only powertrain available for the remainder of production.  The Ecotec engine was also an option for the 2002 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newcartestdrive.com/review-intro.cfm?Vehicle=2002_Pontiac_Sunfire&amp;ReviewID=4160 |title=2002 Pontiac Sunfire Review, Prices, Photos |publisher=New Car Test Drive |date= |accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trim Levels==
The Sunfire could be purchased as a [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]], [[Coupé|coupe]], or [[convertible]].  All three variations came in the standard SE trim level.  An upscale GT trim level was available on the coupe and convertible. The GT trim level came standard with the 2.3 litre [[GM Quad-4 engine#LD9|LD2]] engine from 1994 to 1995 or the 2.4 litre [[GM Quad-4 engine#LD9|LD9]] "Twin Cam" engine (1996–2002), 16-inch alloy wheels, dual exhaust, and a more aggressive looking front fascia.  The SE trim was the standard for the Sunfire which included the 2.2 litre [[GM OHV engine#2200|2200 OHV]] Engine.  The 2.3/2.4 DOHC Engine was optional.  Both the SE and GT trim levels were dropped after the 2002 model year, along with the 2.2 OHV and 2.4 DOHC engines.  The 2.2 litre [[GM Ecotec engine#Ecotec|Ecotec]] was the only available engine as of the 2002 model year.&lt;ref name="edmunds.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/pontiac/sunfire/review.html |title=Pontiac Sunfire Review |publisher=Edmunds.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the convertible was only in the SE trim level until the 1999 model year where it became only available in the GT trim.  The convertible was discontinued after the 2000 model year. All Sunfire convertibles were assembled at the "Genesis" Lansing, Michigan Plant.&lt;ref name="edmunds.com"/&gt;

== Safety ==
The [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS) gave the Sunfire a ''Poor'' rating in its frontal crash test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=45 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Chevrolet Cavalier |publisher=Iihs.org |date=2005-09-29 |accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pontiac G8''' is a [[rear-wheel drive]] sedan that was produced by [[Holden]] in Australia, and then exported to the United States, where it was sold by [[Pontiac]]. The G8, a [[badge engineering|rebadged]] [[Holden VE Commodore|Holden Commodore]], was released in early 2008 for the 2008 [[model year]] in the United States, and in 2008 for the 2009 model year in Canada. Production stopped in mid-2009, following the GM decision to suspend the [[Pontiac]] brand. While available, the G8 took the place in the Pontiac lineup of both the [[Pontiac Bonneville]], which ceased production after the 2005 model year, and the [[Pontiac Grand Prix]], which ceased production after the 2008 model year. The G8 was Pontiac's first [[full-size car]] since the [[Pontiac Bonneville|Bonneville]] and the [[Pontiac GTO#Fifth generation|GTO]] coupe last sold in 2006.

By December 2008, the rear wheel drive G8 had not become the expected sales replacement for the previous front-drive models, with 11,000 unsold G8s in the inventory and just 13,000 sold. During the 2009 global economic downturn, market prices had dropped by $3000–5000 below GM's sticker price for the car. By July 2009, there were only 5,000 unsold G8s in inventory, with almost 30,700 sold.

With the imminent demise of the Pontiac brand, a result of [[General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization|GM's Chapter 11 bankruptcy]], the 2009 model year marked the end of all Pontiacs, including the G8. However, in July 2009, [[Bob Lutz (businessman)|Bob Lutz]] made an off-hand comment during a press review that the G8 would be revived as the [[Chevrolet Caprice#North America|Chevrolet Caprice]]. Subsequently, Lutz retracted this statement, citing market conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Kranz | first = Rick | date = 17 July 2009 | url = http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090717/ANA02/907179991/1197&amp;AssignSessionID=173333275567844 | title = GM cancels plan to convert Pontiac G8 into a Chevy | work = Automotive News | publisher = [[Crain Communications]] | accessdate = 2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/archives/2009/07/it_seemed_like_a_good_idea_at_the_time….html |title=It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time… |author=Bob Lutz |work=GM FastLane Blog |date=16 July 2009 |access-date=2009-07-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720072540/http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/archives/2009/07/it_seemed_like_a_good_idea_at_the_time%E2%80%A6.html |archive-date=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, General Motors announced the Chevrolet Caprice [[Police vehicles in the United States and Canada|Police Patrol Vehicle (PPV)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wert |first=Ray |date=5 October 2009 |url=http://jalopnik.com/5373645/exclusive-the-chevy-caprice-police-car-is-back |title=EXCLUSIVE: The Chevy Caprice Police Car Is Back! |work=[[Jalopnik]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |accessdate=2009-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009, which ''[[Car and Driver]]'' described as a successor to the G8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Jared|last=Gall| url = http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2012-chevrolet-caprice-ppv-police-car-review-review | title = 2012 Chevrolet Caprice PPV | work = Car and Driver |date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To fill the gap left by the G8, GM announced the [[Holden VF Commodore#Chevrolet_SS|Chevrolet SS]], a RWD V8 powered sedan for 2014 based on the [[Holden VF Commodore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.buick.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2012/May/0517_chevyss.html|title=Chevrolet Announces New SS Performance Sedan|work=media.gm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{See also|Holden VE Commodore}}

The G8 is based on the [[GM Zeta platform]], created by [[Holden]] for the [[Holden VE Commodore|VE Commodore]] in the Australian market. The G8 differs from the Commodore mainly in frontal styling and interior details. At the January 2007 [[North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]], GM chairman [[Bob Lutz (businessman)|Bob Lutz]] confirmed that GM intended to import [[Holden Commodore]]s into North America as Pontiac G8s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Joshua|last=Dowling| url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/holdens-cat-out-of-bag--ss-off-to-america/2007/01/08/1168104921065.html | title = Holden VE Commodore to be sold as Pontiac G8 | work = Sydney Morning Herald | date = 9 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news was not planned to be officially announced until the [[Chicago Auto Show]] in February.

Holden chairman [[Denny Mooney]] announced that the G8 is imported from the [[Elizabeth, South Australia]] plant, South Australia for the life cycle of the car, but refused to comment on possible future production at GM's [[Oshawa, Ontario]] facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Glenn|last=Butler| url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=29015 | title = Holden announced US export deal | work = Drive.com.au | date = 8 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2007 Chicago Auto Show, GM Global Chairman Bob Lutz announced that the G8 was expected in US Pontiac dealerships in "early 2008".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Scott | last = Oldham | url = http://blogs.edmunds.com/Straightline/2289/ | title = 2008 Pontiac G8 debuts | work = Edmunds | date = 7 February 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120707144844/http://blogs.edmunds.com/Straightline/2289/ | archivedate = 7 July 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 July 2007 the first Pontiac G8 prototypes rolled out of the Elizabeth assembly plant in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Alex|last=Nunez| url = http://www.autoblog.com/2007/07/04/pontiac-g8-prototypes-roll-off-the-line-in-oz/ | title = Pontiac G8 prototypes roll off the line in Oz | work = Autoblog.com | date = 4 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Alex|last=Nunez| url = http://www.autoblog.com/2007/10/26/the-rocky-road-to-the-holden-ve-sportwagon/ | title = The Rocky Road to the Holden VE SportWagon | work = Autoblog.com | date = 26 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; General production began 18 December 2007.&lt;ref name="caradvice.com.au"/&gt;

The G8 was the first rear-wheel drive four-door sedan sold under the Pontiac name since the 1986 [[Pontiac Bonneville|Bonneville]] and [[Pontiac Parisienne|Parisienne]]. However, at the time of the G8's release, Pontiac did offer the rear-wheel drive [[Pontiac Solstice|Solstice]]. The then recently discontinued [[Pontiac GTO#Revival|GTO]] (as well as the [[Pontiac Firebird|Firebird/Trans Am]] before it), also utilized the rear-wheel drive layout. The GTO was another Holden product, known as the [[Holden Monaro|Monaro]] in Australia, repurposed and rebadged for U.S. consumption. Production was discontinued in 2006 due to new US safety regulations and the architecture being phased out worldwide in favor of the new Zeta platform on which the G8 is based.

== Specification levels ==

=== G8 ===
[[File:2008PontiacG8-002.jpg|thumb|2008 Pontiac G8 "base".]]

The base G8, referred to in Pontiac sales literature as the "G8 Sedan", is available with a 3.6-liter ''[[GM High Feature engine|High Feature]]'' [[V6 engine]], producing {{Convert|256|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The only transmission available is a five-speed ''[[GM 5L40-E transmission|GM 5L40-E]]'' automatic; fuel economy is officially rated at {{convert|17|mpgus|L/100km|abbr=on}} city/{{convert|25|mpgus|L/100km|abbr=on}} highway.&lt;ref name="2009specs"&gt;{{cite press|url=http://archives.media.gm.com/us/pontiac/en/product_services/r_cars/r_c_g8/09index.html#specs |title=2008 Pontiac G8 and G8 GXP|publisher=Media.gm.com |date=9 June 2008 |accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Base G8 models come standard with six airbags (including full-length side curtain airbags), [[traction control]], [[electronic stability control]], dual tailpipes, 18-inch [[alloy wheel]]s (fitted with either all-season or summer performance tires), sports body kit, fog lights, power windows and locks, cruise control, black cloth seats and a seven-speaker audio system, including front center speaker, single-disc CD player, and auxiliary input jack.&lt;ref name="2008jb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jbcarpages.com/pontiac/g8/2008/|title=2008 Pontiac G8 Review|publisher=JB car pages|accessdate=2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "Comfort And Sound" package is available on V6 powered G8s, which upgrades the seven-speaker audio system and manual HVAC controls to the 11-speaker audio and automatic climate control found in the GT model. The "Premium" package upgrades the Sedan's cloth seats to leather seating surfaces, driver and passenger heated seats, six-way power driver seat adjuster, 6-way power front-passenger seat adjuster, rear center armrest, leather-wrapped shift lever, and the GT's standard leather-wrapped steering wheel. Both the base G8 and the GT utilize the "FE2" suspension package.

=== G8 GT ===
[[File:2009 Pontiac G8 GT sedan 01.jpg|thumb|right|2009 Pontiac G8 GT.]]

The GT comes with a {{convert|361|hp|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Jerick|last=Brooks| date=21 April 2007| url = http://carsandracingstuff.com/library/articles/0425.php | title = All-new Pontiac G8 to unleash in 2008 | work = The Crittenden Automotive Library | accessdate = 5 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 6.0&amp;nbsp;L (364&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in) Generation IV [[V8 engine|V8]],&lt;ref name="2009specs"/&gt; featuring a 6-speed [[GM 6L80 transmission|6L80]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] and [[Active Fuel Management]], capable of reaching {{convert|60|mph|abbr=on}} in 5.2 seconds,&lt;ref name="motortrend.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/sedans/112_0802_2008_pontiac_g8_gt_first_test/viewall.html|title=2008 Pontiac G8 GT|date=22 February 2008|work=Motor Trend Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; with quarter-mile times as low as 13.4 seconds.&lt;ref name="motortrend.com"/&gt; The G8 GT averages a fuel economy of 15/24 mpg (city/highway). A 6-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] was being considered as an option on the GT model, but Pontiac decided against offering it, stating that it would instead be offered as an option on the G8 GXP. One change in 2009 was the deletion of the center stack oil pressure and voltage gauges. Midway through the 2009 model year a few changes were made to the G8 GT, including an additional pair of [[catalytic converter]]s which reduced engine output to {{convert|355|hp|abbr=on}}, the addition of bluetooth and rear cup holders that pulled out from under the rear seats.

In addition to the larger engine and six-speed transmission, GT models also contain additional equipment, including all of the standard Sedan features plus quad tailpipes, clear taillight lenses (as opposed to the Sedan's traditional red taillights), automatic dual-zone air conditioning, a larger center-console display screen, and an 11-speaker [[Blaupunkt]] premium audio system with 2 subwoofers, six-disc CD changer, and auxiliary input jack.&lt;ref name="2008jb"/&gt; Some (but not all) of these features are available as options on the base model. A sports package is available on the GT, adding sport metallic pedals, QS4 19" machine-faced aluminum wheels, summer performance tires and a slightly smaller diameter, leather-wrapped Sport steering wheel.

=== G8 GXP ===
[[File:2009 Pontiac G8 GXP 01.jpg|thumb|right|2009 Pontiac G8 GXP]]

A G8 GXP version was shown at the [[New York International Auto Show#2008|New York International Auto Show]] in March 2008 with a 6.2-liter&lt;ref name="2009specs"/&gt; {{convert|402|hp|abbr=on}} V8 from the [[Chevrolet Corvette]] and a six-speed manual transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Mark|last=Arnold|publisher=Jalopnik|date=15 March 2008| url= http://jalopnik.com/367820/2009-pontiac-g8-gxp-revealed-gets-corvette-ls3-power-and-a-manual-transmission |title=2009 Pontiac G8 GXP Revealed, Gets Corvette LS3 Power And A Manual Transmission }}&lt;/ref&gt; The production version of the GXP was more powerful with its [[GM LS engine#LS3|LS3]] V8 producing {{Convert|415|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|415|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. The six-speed automatic was standard while a six-speed [[Tremec TR-6060 transmission|Tremec TR-6060]] manual transmission was available. The GXP reached {{convert|60|mph|abbr=on}} from a standstill in 4.5 seconds, a quarter-mile time of 13.0 seconds at {{convert|109.6|mph|abbr=on}}, and 0.90''g'' (8.8&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of lateral acceleration on a skidpad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/sedans/112_0902_2009_pontiac_g8_gxp_first_test/transmissions_specs.html|title=First Test: 2009 Pontiac G8 GXP|accessdate=6 January 2009 |publisher=Motor Trend}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GXP has an upgraded, [[Nürburgring]]-tuned FE3 suspension package, as well as larger, ventilated [[Brembo]] disc brakes. It also features a unique front bumper cover and a rear (non-functional) diffuser to differentiate it from the standard Sedan and GT models.

Total sales of the Pontiac G8 GXP were 1,829 units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sellersautosport.com/images/G8/g8production.jpg |title=Sellers auto sports official G8 production number breakdown |accessdate=2011-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a limited production of G8 GXP were available in Canada. 10 units were shipped to Canada,  however, only 4 were sold to customers. The remaining 6 were disposed of{{clarify|date=September 2018}} through GM's internal system.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In 2014, [[General Motors]] released the [[Chevrolet SS]], which was in essence the next generation of the G8 GXP. It was based on the new VF chassis [[Holden Commodore]], the successor to the VE chassis Commodore on which the G8 was based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricket.yahoo.com/news/2014-chevy-ss-vs-2009-pontiac-g8-gxp-222615228.html|title=2014 Chevy SS Vs. 2009 Pontiac G8 GXP: Here's What's Different |accessdate=2017-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the G8 GXP and the SS shared the same LS3 V8 engine, with the new SS sporting the engine with minor improvements. Horsepower for both remained 415, with 415 lb. ft. of torque.

===Holden VE Commodore versions (2009)===
{{main|Holden VE Commodore}}
Following the cancellation of Pontiac brand, it was reported that Holden planned to sell 1,500 limited edition version of the Commodore SS V fitted with the Pontiac G8 front-end fascia and other trimmings. Unlike the G8, which was offered only as a sedan, Holden would be offering utility, sedan and wagon body variants of the G8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Alex|last=Nunez|publisher=Autoblog|date=19 August 2009|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/08/19/report-pontiac-g8-sedan-wagon-and-ute-to-be-sold-in-austral/ |title=REPORT: Pontiac G8 Sedan, Wagon and Ute to be sold... in Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; They would be sold in Australia in November and December, with production beginning on 2 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Joshua|last=Dowling|date=19 August 2009|publisher=carsales.com.au|url=http://www.carsales.com.au/news/2009/large-passenger/holden/commodore/exclusive-pontiac-g8-revived-in-australia-16339 |title=Exclusive! Pontiac G8 revived in Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production versions are sold as VE Commodore SS V-Series Special Edition (Sedan, Sportwagon, Ute), with the choice of manual or 6-speed automatic transmissions. SS V-Series Special Edition was unveiled in 2009 Deni Ute Muster. Production version for SS V-Series Special Edition went on sale in 2009–11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Noah|last=Joseph|publisher=Autoblog|date=1 October 2009|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/10/01/pontiac-g8-is-alive-and-well-in-australia-as-a-special-editi/ |title=Pontiac G8 resurfaces in Australia as a pair of special-edition Holdens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cancelled body variants ==
[[File:2009 Pontiac G8 ST pick up (5223047188).jpg|thumb|Holden Commodore SS Ute with Pontiac G8 front end conversion]]
=== G8 ST ===
In addition to the sedan, a two-seat [[coupé utility]] called the G8 ST was shown at the [[New York International Auto Show#2008|New York International Auto Show]] in March 2008.  Based on the [[Holden Ute]], it was built on the same G8 platform with a {{convert|73|in|mm|sing=on}} cargo bed.  The Sport Truck had the same {{convert|361|hp|abbr=on}}, 6.0-liter V8 used in the G8 GT, as well as the 3.6-liter, {{convert|256|hp|abbr=on}} V6.  After a naming contest with more than 18,000 suggestions, the name remained the G8 ST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press|date=14 August 2008|publisher=GM|url=http://archives.media.gm.com/servlet/GatewayServlet?target=http://image.emerald.gm.com/gmnews/viewpressreldetail.do?domain=30&amp;docid=47838|title=Pontiac Names All New Sport Truck The "G8 ST"|accessdate=6 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The G8 ST, slated for release as a 2010 model, was to be Pontiac's coupe utility, and GM's first coupe utility in the United States since the [[Chevrolet El Camino]] was discontinued in 1987.  In January 2009, GM announced to Pontiac dealers that the G8 ST was cancelled due to budget cuts and restructuring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20090106/BUSINESS01/90106080/1014|title=GM kills Pontiac G8 Sport Truck|publisher=Freep}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== G8 "Sportwagon" ===
A Pontiac variant of the VE Commodore Sportwagon station wagon was considered as well, but not imported, partially due to poor sales of the market in general, especially of the [[Dodge Magnum]] as compared to its [[Dodge Charger (LX)|Charger]] sedan counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=John|last=Neff|publisher=Autoblog|date=17 January 2008| url= http://www.autoblog.com/2008/01/17/sorry-holden-gm-cancels-ve-sportwagon-for-us-market |title=Sorry Holden: GM cancels VE Sportwagon for US market }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the G8 ST, the Sportwagon model was never announced by General Motors.

== Model years ==

=== 2008 ===
For the 2008 model year, the Pontiac G8 was initially offered in six colors: Stealth Blue, Liquid Red, Ignition Orange, White Hot, Magnetic Gray, and Panther Black. Stealth Blue was discontinued after the first batch of vehicles were shipped from Australia. First deliveries to dealerships were posted on GM's website in March 2008, with comments that initial sales were brisk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press|date=1 April 2008|publisher=GM|url=http://archives.media.gm.com/servlet/GatewayServlet?target=http://image.emerald.gm.com/gmnews/viewmonthlyreleasedetail.do?domain=6&amp;docid=44734 |title=GM Reports 282,732 Deliveries in March; 805,720 In First Quarter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, May 2008 monthly sales were reported at 1,832 units against a May 2007 sales volume of 12,230 units for the Grand Prix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Thomas|date=5 June 2008|url=http://blogs.cars.com/kickingtires/2008/06/new-models-not.html |publisher=KickingTires|title= New Models Not Breaking Through in Tough Market}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2009 ===
[[File:2009 Pontiac G8 GT--DC.jpg|thumb|A 2009 Pontiac G8 GT]]
The 2009 model year adds the GXP version powered by a {{convert|415|hp|abbr=on}} 6.2-liter V8 engine with a standard 6-speed automatic transmission or optional six-speed manual transmission (see above). The GXP is available in all standard G8 colors.

The G8 lineup also adds standard [[XM Satellite Radio]], with [[Bluetooth]] connectivity provided later in the year, and four new exterior color choices: Maverick Silver Metallic, Sport Red Metallic, Stryker Blue Metallic and Pacific Slate Metallic. Meanwhile, Stealth Blue and Ignition Orange were unavailable for 2009 (Stealth Blue having already been eliminated during 2008 model year production). Also for 2009, the oil pressure and battery voltage gauges at the top of the center console were eliminated. Heavy criticism among the automotive press of the outdated appearance of these red LED gauges no doubt factored heavily in their removal. The gauges were simply replaced with a small storage compartment.

National Safety Agency Ltd., an Australian company in a joint project with the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) displayed a prototype squad car based on the Pontiac G8, at the APCO 2009 Conference in Sydney in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;

The last Pontiac G8 rolled off the assembly line on June 19, 2009.

=== Marketing ===
General Motors heavily promoted the Pontiac G8 on 31 December 2007 into 1 January 2008, by having it as the official sponsor of the [[Times Square Ball|Times Square New Year's Eve Ball Drop and Countdown]], as well as the [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]].

The G8 is the primary vehicle in the 2009 driving game, [[Wheelman (video game)|Wheelman]].

In March 2008, a commercial based on the 1980s [[arcade game]] ''[[Spy Hunter]]'' ran nationally. In the commercial, the Pontiac G8 GT takes the place of the hero car when it is destroyed by enemies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid1454928825 Pontiac ''Spy Hunter'' commercial] from [[brightcove|Brightcove Internet TV]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pontiac Catalina''' is an [[automobile]] which was part of [[Pontiac]]'s [[full-size]]d line from 1950 to 1981. Initially, the name was used strictly to denote hardtop body styles, first appearing in the 1950 Chieftain Eight and DeLuxe Eight lines. In 1959, the Catalina became a separate model, as the "entry-level" full-size Pontiac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Gunnell, John, Editor | title = The Standard Catalogue of American Cars 1946–1975 | publisher = Kraus Publications | year = 1987 | isbn = 0-87341-096-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history (1950–1958)==

The name "Catalina" was first used on the 1950 [[Pontiac Chieftain|Chieftain]] Series 25/27 [[hardtop]], Pontiac's top trim level package at the time, and later added to the [[Pontiac Star Chief|Star Chief]] in 1954, Pontiac's equivalent of the Chevrolet Bel Air. Originally referred to as "hard-top convertibles", these vehicles offered pillarless design in the door and window areas, along with the top-grade [[convertible (car)|convertible]] appointments. The advantage this fixed-roof design offered is its sporty, airy feeling without the expense and drawbacks normally associated with convertibles. With the exception of the 1958 [[Pontiac Bonneville|Bonneville]], all Pontiac hardtops are designated "Catalinas" from 1950 to 1958. Powered by a [[Cam-in-block#L-head|flathead]] [[straight-eight]] [[Pontiac Straight-8 engine|engine]] at the time of its debut, it would receive Pontiac's new 287&amp;nbsp;CID OHV [[V8 engine|V8]] four years later. A one-piece windshield was new for 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1954%20Pontiac/1954_Pontiac_Prestige_Brochure/1954%20Pontiac%20Prestige-18-19.html |title=Directory Index: Pontiac/1954 Pontiac/1954_Pontiac_Prestige_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A padded safety dash became available in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1956_Pontiac/1956_Pontiac_Brochure/1956%20Pontiac-10-11.html |title=Directory Index: Pontiac/1956_Pontiac/1956_Pontiac_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1959, Pontiac dropped the name "Chieftain" and "Super Chief" models for its entry level model and renamed it "Catalina", while demoting the former top-line Star Chief to mid-line status eliminating the two door StarChief Catalina, the only hardtop for the StarChief was the four door hardtop and expanding the Bonneville nameplate to a full flagship series that included [[Sedan (car)|sedans]], [[coupe]]s, convertibles and Safari [[station wagon]]s.

In the lower-priced Catalina line, Pontiac division advertising placed higher emphasis on the top trimmed two- and four-door hardtops, convertible and Safari station wagons instead of the pillared two- and four-door sedan variants despite the fact that the four-door sedan was the best seller in this line.

The Catalina, though it was the lowest-priced full-sized Pontiac, was priced and trimmed below the Chevrolet Impala due to GM's overlapping price structure formula only a step below the [[Buick LeSabre]] and [[Oldsmobile 88]] in trim and appointments but priced about $100 to $200 less.  Catalinas also came standard with more amenities than Chevrolet models and included a [[Pontiac V8 engine#389|larger and more powerful V8 engine of 389 cubic inches]], compared to the [[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#Second generation|Chevy's six-cylinder]] or [[Chevrolet small-block V8|283 and 348 cubic-inch V8s]]. Pontiacs also benefited from a much better automatic transmission than their Chevrolet counterparts - the four-speed [[Hydra-Matic]] - versus the Chevy's two-speed [[Powerglide]].

Though the basic Catalina started out with a full rubber mat, it could be ordered with full carpeting, glovebox and trunk lights; dual front ashtrays, cigar lighter, glove compartment snack bar (two cup indents on the glovebox door that could be opened for use at drive-in restaurants) were standard, heater-defroster and a choice of cloth and Morrokide vinyl upholstery or expanded Morrokide (all-vinyl trim) optional. Pontiac buyers could add even more trimmings for a few dollars more by ordering the "decor group" which added full wheel covers, deluxe steering wheel, chrome pedal trim plates and more. Also offered from 1962 to 1970 on most Catalina models was the Ventura custom interior (which was a separate model from 1960 to 1961), which included the interior and exterior upgrades offered with the extra-cost decor group option plus a slightly more luxurious interior of cloth or Morrokide trims similar to the costlier Pontiac Star Chief or Executive depending on the year.

Catalinas and other 1959 Pontiacs were completely restyled on a new General Motors B-body that was shared by all GM divisions from Chevrolet to Cadillac, replacing the previous A-body utilized for Pontiacs and Chevrolets that was used only for 1958. Twin tailfins, two on each side, were new and only in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1959%20Pontiac/1959_Pontiac_Prestige_Brochure/1959%20Pontiac%20Prestige-06-07.html |title=Directory Index: Pontiac/1959 Pontiac/1959_Pontiac_Prestige_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Styling highlights include thin-pillar rooflines and greater use of glass for increased visibility. Pillared four-door sedans feature six-window styling, while two-door hardtops were dubbed "bubbletops" due to the large wraparound bubble windshield and thin c-pillar and large rear window; four-door hardtops featured flat-blade rooflines with an overhang past the rear window. Wheelbases were 122" for Catalina and 124" for StarChief and Bonneville &amp;nbsp;inches, but overall length on Catalina was 7" shorter than Bonneville and StarChief at {{convert|213.7|in|mm}}.

[[File:1960 Pontiac Catalina four door front.jpg|thumb|left|1960 Pontiac Catalina sedan]]
The 1959 Pontiacs featured a "split grille", which came about by accident when the styling studio were exploring grille design. Experimentally, a design for a conventional, full width, oval grille, containing horizontal quad headlights, was cut in two and the halves transposed. With the lights remaining at the extremities, this gave the split center, open ended look of the '59 Catalina.  Along with the wider body came a 5" wider chassis in which the wheels were moved out towards the fenders. This not only improved the appearance of the car but led to improvements in ride and handling - spawning the term "wide track" ride and handling which Pontiac would use in its promotional efforts for many years to come.

All Pontiacs were powered by various renditions of the new [[Pontiac V8 engine#389|389 cubic-inch Tempest V8]] (which was later renamed from 1961 as the [[Pontiac V8 engine#421|Trophy V-8]]), which was basically a version of the previous 370 cubic-inch V8 with stroke increased to 3.75 inches (the 370ci was used in 1958-model Pontiacs and based on the Pontiac V8 design introduced in 1955). Catalinas came standard with a {{convert|235|hp}} version of the 389 with two-barrel carburetor and 8.6 to 1 compression mated to the three-speed [[manual transmission]]. When the optional four-speed Hydramatic transmission was ordered, the standard engine was {{convert|280|hp}} version of the same engine with higher 10.5 to 1 compression ratio. Available as a no-cost option with the Hydramatic transmission was the 215-horsepower 389 (dubbed the Economy V8) with 8.6 to 1 compression ratio which burned cheaper regular gasoline, instead of the premium and super-premium fuels required for the high-compression engines, and capable of achieving more than 20 MPG on the highway. Optionally available at extra cost were higher-power versions of the 389 V8 with four-barrel carburetion rated at {{convert|283|hp}} with manual gearbox or 303hp with Hydramatic, a 4-barrel carburetor version with a horsepower rating of 318hp, or "Tri-Power" options with triple two-barrel carburetors and 330hp or {{Convert|345|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

For 1960, Catalina and other Pontiacs received a minor facelifting of the '59 bodyshell with a new full-width horizontal bar grille similar to the 1930s [[Cord 810/812]] replacing 1959's split grille (for this year only-the split grille returned in 1961) and round taillights. Bodystyles and drivetrain offerings were unchanged from 1959. New to the option list was a "Sportable Transistor" radio that could be used in the car in place of the regular "in-dash" radio or removed from the car for use as a portable with battery power. Also new for 1960 were the optional "eight lug" aluminum wheels with integral [[Drum brake|brake drums]] that not only enhanced the car's looks but also provided improved stopping power. Another popular option for performance enthusiasts was the "Safe-T-Track" [[Limited-slip differential|limited slip differential]]. In the suspension department the front track was increased from the 59's 63⅞" to 64". In the engine compartment the so-called "gusher type" cooling system (with cooling liquid entering the engine over the exhaust valves, reverse of what is more normally done) was replaced by the so-called "Equa-flow" type (with conventional V-8 cooling configuration). [[Automotive lighting|Turn signals]] were standard, while the A/C was $430 and padded dash was $19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunnell|first=John|title=standard catalog of American Muscle Cars 1960–1972|year=2006|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=0-89689-433-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside, a revised instrument panel featured a new horizontal sweep [[speedometer]] along with minor changes in trim patterns.

The 1961 full-sized Pontiacs were completely restyled with more squared-off bodylines, the reintroduction of the split grille first seen in 1959 and dropped for 1960 and an all-new Torque-Box perimeter frame with side rails replacing the "X" frame chassis used since 1958. The new frame not only provides greater side-impact protection than the "X" design but also improves interior roominess.

The distinctive protruding grille made its appearance on all Pontiac products during the early 1960s, and was a modern revival of a similar appearance on Pontiac products during the 1930s and early 1940s, as demonstrated on the [[Pontiac Torpedo]].

Rooflines are more squared off on four-door models with the six-window styling dropped on pillared sedans and wider C-pillars with flat rear windows on four-door hardtops. A revised version of the 1959-60 "bubbletop" roof was used on two-door hardtops. Wrap-around windshields were dropped in favor of flatter glasswork for improved entry and exit to the front seat.

The new body is somewhat smaller and lighter than the 1960 model with the wheelbase down three inches (76&amp;nbsp;mm)  to 119, overall length reduced by the same to {{convert|210|in|mm|abbr=on}} and width dropping nearly two inches to 78.2 from {{convert|80|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} 1960. The front and rear track of the 1961-62 Pontiac was reduced to {{convert|62.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} front and rear. The 1961 Pontiac was advertised as "all Pontiac...on a new wide track."

All engines were again {{convert|389|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8s as in previous years, now called "Trophy" engines. rather than "Tempest" (including the larger 421ci "big bore" engine). Standard engines are two-barrel units rated at {{convert|215|hp|kW|abbr=on}} with the three-speed manual transmission or {{convert|267|hp|kW|abbr=on}} with the optional Hydramatic, with a {{convert|230|hp|abbr=on}} regular-fuel-capable "economy" V8 offered as a no-cost option with the Hydramatic. Offered as extra-cost options were more powerful versions of the 389 including a {{convert|303|hp|abbr=on}} version with a four-barrel carburetor or {{convert|318|hp|abbr=on}} [[Pontiac V8 engine#347|Tri-Power]] option. New to the options list were two higher performance versions of the 389, including a four-barrel {{convert|333|hp|abbr=on}} unit and a {{convert|348|hp|abbr=on}} Tri-Power option, both with higher, 10.75:1, [[compression ratio]]s. A {{convert|363|hp|abbr=on}} engine was offered to drag racers. Late in the 1961 sales season the {{convert|421|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Pontiac V8 engine#421|Super Duty]] was released for sale as a dealer installed engine. The 1961 models never came from the assembly line with the 421ci engine; instead it was a specialty item installed and sold at the discretion of individual dealers.

A new "three-speed four-range" "[[GM Roto Hydramatic transmission|Roto Hydramatic]]" [[automatic transmission]] replaced the previous four-speed unit for 1961. The new transmission is slimmer and lighter than the older four-speed Hydramatic, which was continued on the larger Star Chief and Bonneville models. Also new for 1961 was a four-speed manual transmission with [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] floor shifter, available on special order.

The 1962 Pontiacs received a heavy facelift from the 1961 design with more rounded body contours and new rooflines on two-door hardtops featuring convertible-like bows. Catalina sedans and coupes got a {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase increase to 120", after spending 1961 on a {{convert|119|in|mm|adj=on}} length shared with full-sized Chevys (Safari wagons retained the {{convert|119|in|mm|sing=on}} wheelbase through 1964).

Most regular engine and transmission offerings were carried over from 1961 with the {{convert|389|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} Trophy V8, ranging in power ratings from {{convert|215|hp|abbr=on}} to {{convert|348|hp|abbr=on}}. A small number of 1962 Catalinas and other Pontiacs were built with a "non-streetable" {{convert|421|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} Super Duty V8 with two four-barrel carburetors and {{convert|405|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, as a US$2,250 option (when the base Catalina listed at US$2,725),&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960–1972'' (Jefferson, NC:  McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), pp.191–2.&lt;/ref&gt; along with various "over the counter" performance options offered by Pontiac including aluminum bumpers and even lighter frames with drilled holes (which were dubbed the "Swiss cheese" frames).

For 1963, Catalinas and other full-sized Pontiacs featured cleaner, squared-off bodylines and vertical headlights flanking the split grille, but retained the same dimensions and basic bodyshell of 1961-62 models except for the rear flanks of the new coke bottle styling and due to this styling the rear track was extended to the 59 and 60 Pontiac's 64" wide track. Engine offerings were revised as the {{convert|333|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|348|hp|abbr=on}} versions of the 389 V8 were dropped in favor of "production" versions of the larger {{convert|421|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} rated at {{convert|338|hp}} with four-barrel carburetor, {{convert|353|hp|abbr=on}} with Tri-Power, or a {{convert|370|hp|abbr=on}} "HO" with Tri-Power . The {{convert|405|hp|abbr=on}} Super Duty 421 was still offered to racing teams during the early portion of the model year but discontinued after General Motors ordered Pontiac (and Chevrolet) to "cease and desist" from factory-supported racing efforts in February 1963. New options for 1963 included a tilt steering wheel that could be adjusted to six different positions, AM/FM radio and cruise control.

A 1963 Catalina convertible modified by California hot-rodder Bill Straub was used as a tow vehicle in the [[NASA M2-F1]] program.
[[File:M2-F1 with towing car.jpg|left|thumb|The M2-F1 and its 1963 Catalina convertible tow vehicle]]

[[File:1964 Pontiac Catalina Sedan.jpg|thumb|right|1964 Pontiac Catalina sedan]]
Mild facelifting including new grilles and taillights highlighted the 1964 full-sized Pontiacs. Engine and transmission offerings were unchanged from 1963 except for a new GM-built Muncie four-speed manual replacing the Borg-Warner T-10 unit. Also new for 1964, was the [[Pontiac 2+2|2+2]] option package available on Catalina two-door hardtops and convertibles that included bucket seats, heavy-duty suspension and other performance equipment, along with the same selection of {{convert|389|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|421|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8s found in other Catalinas. The 64 2+2 was a trim option only with the same standard engine as the base Catalina. It was only until 1965 that the 421 engine became the standard engine on the 2+2.

Throughout most of the 1960s when Pontiac annually captured third place in industry sales, behind Chevrolet and Ford, the Catalina was also often the industry's third best-selling full-sized car behind the first-place [[Chevrolet Impala]] and second-place [[Ford Galaxie 500]]. The Catalina's success in the low-medium priced field led many competitors to respond with similar products such as the 1961 [[Chrysler Newport]], a less-expensive Chrysler that was priced lower than base models bearing the Chrysler nameplate in recent previous years; and the 1962 [[Dodge Custom 880]] and 1963 [[Mercury Monterey]], both of which were introduced as full-fledged low-medium priced full-sized cars in size and power that followed unsuccessful efforts by Mercury and Dodge to bring out downsized full-sized cars.

In 1964, even Pontiac's mid-priced rivals within General Motors responded to the Catalina's success in the marketplace as well as to capture Chevy Impala owners "trading up" to cars from upscale GM divisions. Buick took its lowest-priced big car, the [[Buick LeSabre|LeSabre]], and lowered the base sticker price further by substituting a smaller {{convert|300|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine and two-speed automatic transmission from its intermediate-sized cars in place of the {{convert|401|cid|L|1|abbr=on}}  V8 and three-speed automatic used in other big Buicks. Oldsmobile went even further by creating a whole new full-sized series, the [[Oldsmobile 88|Jetstar 88]], which was $75 lower than the Dynamic 88 series (but still a few dollars higher than comparable Pontiac Catalina models) and also got a smaller engine - a {{convert|330|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 and two-speed automatic transmission from the intermediate F-85/Cutlass line, along with smaller {{convert|9.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} brake drums (also from the GM intermediates) compared to the {{convert|11|-|12|in|mm|abbr=on}} drums still found on all other GM full-sized cars from the bare-bones six-cylinder [[Chevrolet Biscayne]] to the Cadillac 75 limousine. And since the Catalina was still priced lower than the Jetstar and LeSabre, the lowest-priced full-sized Pontiac was often perceived by buyers as a better value in the marketplace due to its larger standard V8 engine and three-speed automatic transmission, and (in comparison to the Jetstar 88) bigger brakes.

The 1965 full-sized Pontiacs were completely restyled with more flowing sheetmetal featuring "[[Coke bottle styling|Coke-bottle]]" profiles and fastback rooflines on two-door hardtops. Wheelbases increased to {{convert|121|in|mm}} on all models.

A new three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic automatic transmission replaced the previous Roto Hydramatic three speed four range unit and Super Hydramatic four speed unit's on full-sized Pontiacs for 1965. The "Turbo" is a three-speed torque converter unit similar in basic design to Chrysler's Torqueflite and Ford's Cruise-O-Matic transmissions - a move that made torque converter automatics the universal design for shiftless transmissions, and relegated the original fluid-coupling Hydramatic to history. Though the "Turbo" transmission continued to use the Hydramatic name, it shared none of its design with the older transmissions. The Turbo Hydramatic also adopted the standardized "P-R-N-D-S-L" shift pattern which replaced the "P-N-D-S-L-R" pattern long familiar to owners of Hydramatic-equipped Pontiacs, Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs. The Turbo HydraMatic did not have the super low first gears of Roto's 3:50 to one or Super HydraMatic's 3:97 to one, nor did Turbo HydraMatic have Roto's or Super HydraMatic's "split torque" design whereby when in top gear or fourth range for both only 40% of the engine torque went through the fluid coupling resulting in better fuel mileage.

The 389 and 421 cubic-inch V8s received a number of revisions including thinner wall block castings. The standard engine for Catalina models is the 389 two-barrel rated at {{convert|256|hp}} with base three-speed manual transmission and 8.6 to 1 compression or 290 horsepower with Turbo Hydramatic transmission and higher 10.5 to 1 compression. An economy regular-fuel {{convert|265|hp}} version of the 389 two-barrel with 8.6 to 1 compression ratio that burned regular gas was available as a no-cost option with Turbo Hydramatic. Optional engines include a four-barrel 389 rated at {{convert|325|hp}} with Turbo Hydramatic or 333 with stick shift, a Tri-Power 389 rated at 338 horsepower, a four-barrel 421 rated at the same {{convert|338|hp}}, 353&amp;nbsp;hp with Tri-Power or the 421 HO with Tri-Power and {{convert|376|hp}}.

The 2+2 option changed from a trim package to an all-out performance car package for 1965 similar to Pontiac's intermediate-sized GTO. The base engine with the 2+2 was now the 338-horsepower 421 four-barrel with the {{convert|353|hp}} Tri-Power or 376-horsepower 421 HO with Tri-Power available as options.

The 1966 full-sized Pontiacs received minor a facelifting of the '65 body with new grilles and taillight treatment. Inside, the instrument panel was revised along with interior trim. The 2+2 was upgraded from an option to full model status and engine-transmission offerings on all Catalina models remained the same as 1965 with the exception being the elimination of the 338-horsepower 389 Tri-Power option.

For 1967, Catalinas and other full-sized Pontiacs received a heavy facelifting of the '65 bodyshell with more rounded wasp-waisted body contours and fuller fastback rooflines, along with concealed windshield wipers - an industry first. Replacing the 389 and 421 V8s of previous years were new 400 and 428 cubic-inch V8s with bigger valves and a valve angle change built off the same Pontiac V8 design in use since 1955. The valve angle change was so bigger valves and larger ports could be used. The standard Catalina engine was a two-barrel unit rated at {{convert|265|hp}} with three-speed manual transmission or {{convert|290|hp}} with Turbo Hydramatic. The {{convert|265|hp}} engine was available as a no-cost option with the Turbo Hydramatic and differed from the standard {{convert|290|hp}} unit by using regular gas as opposed to premium fuel. Optional engines included a four-barrel 400 rated at {{convert|325|hp}}, a four-barrel 428 rated at {{convert|360|hp}} or the four-barrel 428 HO rated at {{convert|376|hp}}. The Tri-Power engine options were dropped for 1967 thanks to a new GM corporate policy headed primarily by Ed Cole which prohibited the use of multiple carbs on all vehicles except the Chevrolet Corvette and the Corvair, two of Cole's baby's when he was head of Chevrolet Engineering and later Chevrolet General Manager. Front disc brakes and a stereo eight-track tape player were new additions to the option list.

The 2+2 was offered for the last time in 1967 in both hardtop coupe and convertible. The 360-horsepower 428 was standard and the 428 HO was optional. This model was dropped due to low sales since its 1964 introduction as performance car buyers overwhelmingly preferred smaller and lighter intermediates such as Pontiac's own GTO and the new Firebird ponycar, which was introduced for 1967. A 1967 Pontiac Catalina convertible was featured in the Red Hot Chili Peppers music video for "Scar Tissue".

Safety came to the fore in 1967, and the Catalina featured all the new US Government-mandated safety equipment including an energy-absorbing steering column, safety steering wheel, dual-circuit hydraulic brake system, and soft interior parts.

For 1968, Catalinas and other full-sized Pontiacs received a minor facelifting of the '67 body with a new beak-nose split grille along with a reverting to horizontal headlights, and revised taillights.  Engine offerings were similar to 1967 with revised horsepower ratings including 340 for the four-barrel 400, 375 for the 428 four-barrel and 390 for the 428 HO.  Safety continued to be key in 1968 with new fender side-marker lights becoming standard.  Cars built after January 1, 1968 included front outboard shoulder belts as standard equipment.

The 1969 Pontiacs received a major restyling with somewhat more squared off sheetmetal (though not as much as similar cars from other GM divisions) and rooflines, the coke bottle rear flanks were gone. However, the basic 1965 chassis, inner-body structure and four-door pillared sedan roofline were retained although vent windows were dropped on all models and Safari wagons got a new two-way tailgate that could be opened to the side like a door or downward like a tailgate - similar in design to that introduced by Ford Motor Company on Ford/Mercury wagons in 1966. Catalinas also got a one-inch wheelbase increase to 122.  Headrests became standard on all '69 Pontiacs built after January 1.  All 1969 GM cars (except the [[Chevrolet Corvair|Corvair]]) got a new locking steering column that would become a Federal requirement starting with the 1970 models.

Variable-ratio power steering was a new option this year ( pioneered by Cadillac in 1966 ) and front disc brakes were now automatically included when the power brake option was ordered.

Engine offerings consisted of a standard 290-horsepower 400 two-barrel (or no-cost optional regular-fuel 265-horsepower 400 with Turbo Hydramatic transmission), 330-horsepower 400 four-barrel, 370-horsepower 428 four-barrel or the 428 HO rated at 390 horses. The standard three-speed manual transmission and optional three-speed Turbo Hydramatic were continued as before, but the four-speed manual with Hurst shifter was dropped from the option list.

All full-sized Pontiacs, including Catalinas, received a new Grand Prix-like V-nose grille for 1970 along with 'horns ports' on a facelifted front end and new taillights mounted in the rear bumper. Catalina sedans and coupes now came standard with a smaller 255-horsepower 350 cubic-inch Pontiac V8 as standard equipment with optional engines including the previously standard 400 two-barrel rated at 265 and 290 horsepower (still standard on convertibles and Safari wagons), a 330-horsepower 400 four-barrel and a two versions of the new 455 cubic-inch V8 rated at {{convert|360|hp}} or 370 horses with the "HO" option. As in past years, a three-speed manual transmission with column shift was standard equipment, but most cars were equipped with the optional three-speed Turbo Hydramatic. Also offered for 1970, but seldom ordered, was a two-speed automatic transmission, Turbo Hydramatic 300 that was available with the 350 V8.

The 1965–70 [[GM B platform]] is the fourth best selling automobile platform in history after the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], [[Ford Model T]], and the [[Lada Riva]].

[[File:1971 Pontiac Catalina convertible.jpg|thumb|left|1971 Pontiac Catalina convertible]]

For 1971, Catalina and other full-sized Pontiacs were completely redesigned and restyled from the wheels up with long hood/short deck proportions and fuselage styling somewhat similar to Chrysler Corporation's 1969 full-sized cars, along with a double shell roof for improved roll-over protection and flush pull-up exterior door handles - the latter two features first seen on the {{frac|1970|1|2}} [[Pontiac Firebird|Firebird]]. Catalina and Catalina Brougham sedans and coupes rode on a {{convert|123.4|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase while Bonneville and Grand Ville used a longer {{convert|126|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase, and Safari wagons were an inch longer at 127 inches. Station wagons also got their own multi-leaf spring rear suspensions, while sedans and coupes continued to be suspended with front and rear coil springs.

New for 1971 was the Catalina Brougham series, which offered a more luxurious interior trim than the regular Catalina, available as a two-door hardtop, four-door hardtop and four-door pillared sedan. It was similar in concept to the [[Pontiac Ventura|Ventura]] series (1960-1961, 1966-1969) and the  [[Pontiac Ventura|Ventura]] custom trim option on the Catalina (1962-1965, 1970). It was dropped in 1973 after its sales failed to meet expectations. 1972 was also the Catalina convertible's final year.

The Catalina Safari wagon became simply the ''[[Pontiac Grand Safari|Pontiac Safari]]'' for 1971 (though it continued to share interior and exterior trimmings with Catalina sedans and coupes) while the more luxurious Executive and Bonneville wagons were replaced by the new Grand Safari wagon. While the Grand Safari shared its grille design with the new [[Pontiac Grand Ville|Grand Ville]] series, its interior trim was identical to the optional vinyl interior offered on the Bonneville series. Pontiac now grouped its full-sized wagons as a separate series from their sedan counterparts, as did [[Chevrolet]] (Brookwood, Townsman, Kingswood, Kingswood Estate), [[Oldsmobile]] (Custom Cruiser), and [[Buick]] (Estate Wagon).

As did all GM B-Body wagons, the Safari and Grand Safari received GM's new clamshell tailgate. Operated by switches on the instrument panel or a key switch on the rear quarter panel, the tailgate slid into a recess under the cargo floor while the electric window slid upward into the rear roof section. Pontiac boasted the new system made it easier to load and unload the wagon in tight spaces, but the "Glide-Away" tailgate was prone to electrical and mechanical problems, and water and air leakage problems, as the cars aged.

Another trouble-prone feature Pontiacs shared with all GM B- and C-body cars for 1971 was a new power ventilation system. The system, also shared with the ill-fated [[Chevrolet Vega|Vega]], used the heater fan to draw air into the car from the cowl intake, and force it out through vents in the trunk lid or tailgate. In theory, passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped, as in heavy traffic. In practice, however, it didn't work.

Within weeks of the 1971 models' debut, however, Pontiac—and all other GM dealers—received multiple complaints from drivers who complained the ventilation system pulled cold air into the car before the heater could warm up—and could not be shut off. The ventilation system was extensively revised for 1972.

All models featured new Grand Prix-style wrap-around cockpit instrument panels that placed controls and instruments within easy reach of the driver along with two round pods for a speedometer and the other for warning lights, fuel gauge or optional gauges and electric clock. Interior trims were available in cloth and Morrokide vinyl or expanded Morrokide depending on model.

Standard engine in Catalina sedans and coupes was a 255-horsepower "350" (actually 355&amp;nbsp;cid) V8 with two-barrel carburetor. Catalina Brougham models and Safari wagons came standard with a 400 cubic-inch V8 with two-barrel carburetor rated at 265 gross horsepower that was optional on other Catalina models.  Optional engines included a 455 cubic-inch V8 with two- or four-barrel carburetion and respective horsepower ratings of 285 and 325, respectively. All Pontiac engines for 1971 were designed to run on lower-octane regular leaded, low lead or unleaded gasoline thanks to a GM corporate edict, necessitating reductions in compression ratios.

Power front disc brakes were made standard equipment for the first time in 1971. As in previous years, variable ratio power steering and [[Turbo Hydramatic]] transmission were extra-cost options but became standard equipment midway through the 1971 model run. Also available on early 1971 Catalinas with the 350 engine was a two-speed automatic transmission in addition to the standard column-shift three-speed manual.

For 1972, Catalinas and other full-sized Pontiacs received new Grand Prix-style "V" nose grilles and sturdier front bumpers that could withstand crashes of up to {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, a year ahead of the Federal standard that took effect in 1973, along with revised taillight lenses.

The two-barrel 400 cubic-inch V8 was standard on all Catalina/Brougham/Safari models rated at 175 net horsepower compared to 265 gross horses in 1971 thanks to a switch in power measurements from gross ratings which were measured by a dynometer with no accessories attached while the "net" figures were measured "as installed" in a vehicle with all accessories and emission gear hooked up. Optional engines included a two-barrel 455 rated at {{convert|185|hp}} and a four-barrel 455 rated at {{convert|250|hp}}. The year 1972 was the last for the Catalina convertible and the Catalina Brougham series.

[[File:'73 Pontiac Catalina Coupe (Cruisin' At The Boardwalk '10).jpg|thumb|left|1973 Pontiac Catalina]]
Catalina and other 1973 full-sized Pontiacs featured fuller-width split grilles along with the now-federally mandated {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} front bumper, and revised taillight lenses. Instrument panels continued the "wrap-around" theme but the two round gauges were housed in square pods. With the Catalina Brougham discontinued only the regular Catalina models and Safari wagons were offered this year. Catalinas and other full-sized Pontiacs including Bonnevilles and Grand Villes now rode on a common {{convert|123.4|in|mm|sing=on}} wheelbaase for sedans and coupes though Safari and Grand Safari wagons continued on their own {{convert|127|in|mm|sing=on}} wheelbase.

Catalina sedans and coupes came standard with a 350 cubic-inch V8 rated at {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} with a 170-horsepower 400 two-barrel optional and standard on Safari wagons. Optional engines included a {{convert|230|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} 400 four-barrel and {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} 455 four-barrel V8.

[[File:74_Pontiac_Catalina_(5889168107).jpg|thumb|left|For 1974 the full-sized Pontiacs received a very Mercedes-esque grille]]
The 1974 Catalina and other big Pontiacs had a new Mercedes-like center split grille and revised rear styling with new {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} bumpers on the aft end and license plate moved above the bumper. Two-door hardtop coupes featured new fixed triangular side windows, but kept the pillarless style with roll-down rear quarter windows, unlike Chevrolet, which eliminated the rolldown rear quarters in the Caprice and Impala Custom coupes.  The four-door pillared and hardtop sedans were virtually unchanged from 1973. Interiors were much the same as 1973 except for a revised standard steering wheel and new cut-pile carpeting.

New to the option list were adjustable accelerator and brake pedals, a Pontiac exclusive (and seldom ordered), and a Radial Tuned Suspension that included the upgraded tires along with other suspension mods such as front and rear sway bars.

The 170-horsepower 400 V8 with two-barrel carburetor was now the standard engine on all models with a 225-horsepower 400 four-barrel and 250-horsepower 455 four-barrel [[V8 engine|V8]] available as options. Also for 1974, the Safari wagon was renamed the ''Catalina Safari'' and continued to share interior and exterior trims with sedans and coupes.

The year 1975 brought revised front and rear styling to Catalinas and other full-sized Pontiacs, along with standard radial tires and electronic ignition. The same assortment of 400 and 455 engines carried over from 1974 with reduced horsepower ratings ranging from 170 to 200, but now mated to catalytic converters, which provided improved driveability and fuel economy over previous emission control equipment, but mandated the use of unleaded gasoline. Four-door pillared and hardtop sedans featured new six-window styling with the sixth window on the hardtop sedan functioning as an opera window. 1975 also marked the end of Pontiac convertible production until 1982; the Grand Ville Brougham was the last full-size Pontiac convertible.

For 1976, only minor detail changes were made to Catalinas and other full-sized Pontiacs that included revised grilles (with rectangular headlights now on Catalinas with the "Custom Trim Option-round headlights continued on base models) and taillight lenses. This year was the last for the 1971-vintage bodyshell, optional adjustable pedals, 455 V8 and the clamshell tailgate on Safari wagons. 1976 also marked the return of the Bonneville Brougham series to the top of the full-size line, as Pontiac marketers abandoned the Grand Ville name entirely.

In 1977, Pontiac and other GM divisions downsized their full-sized cars in an effort to lighten weight and improve gas mileage. The Catalina continued as Pontiac's entry-level full-size automobile with a Buick-built 231 cubic-inch [[V6]] now standard in sedans and coupes (Safari wagons came standard with V8 power) and optional V8s of 301 CID, 350 CID and 400 CID displacements, each Pontiac-built engines and offered in all states except [[California]]. The Pontiac 350 was offered in 1977, but replaced by Buick and Oldsmobile 350 V8s from 1978 to 1980; and the Pontiac 400, offered through 1978, was replaced by an Oldsmobile 403 V8 in 1979 only. An Oldsmobile-built 350 Diesel V8 was optional for 1980 and 1981, along with another cut-down Pontiac V8 of 265 CID.

With the downsized 1977 model, the Catalina Safari got a new two-way tailgate that could be opened to the side as a door or lowered as a tailgate which replaced the more complicated 1971-76 clamshell tailgate design. The wagons also shared the same full-coil spring suspension as their sedan counterparts, rather than the multi-leaf springs found on 1971-76 Safaris.

As Pontiac V8s were completely [[banned]] from the State of California beginning in 1977 due to the inability to meet the state's more stringent emission control standards, Catalinas (and Bonnevilles) sold in California were equipped with engines from other GM divisions through 1981. Those included the Buick 231 V6 and an assortment of V8s including the Chevrolet 305, Oldsmobile 307, Buick and Oldsmobile 350s, and Oldsmobile 403 V8.

The Catalina was discontinued after the 1981 model year as Pontiac sought to abandon the full-sized car market as part of GM's continued downsizing program. When production of the Catalina nameplate ended in 1981, over 3.8 million Catalinas had been sold since 1959.

'''Strato Chief, Laurentian, Parisienne and Grande Parisienne'''
[[File:'56 Pontiac Strato Chief Convertible (Cruisin' At The Boardwalk '10).jpg|thumb|left|1956 Pontiac Strato Chief convertible (Canada)]]
[[File:Pontiac Laurentian Convertible 1956 2.jpg|thumb|left|1956 Pontiac Laurentian convertible]]
From the 1950s through 1970s, GM of Canada offered a unique hierarchy of full-size Pontiac series different from the American Catalina, Star Chief, Executive and Bonneville lines. In Canada, Pontiac was marketed as a low priced car, rather than a medium price make as in the U.S.  Closely paralleling Chevrolet's Biscayne, Bel Air and Impala series, by 1959 the Canadian models were named Strato Chief, Laurentian and [[Pontiac Parisienne]].  When Chevrolet introduced the "Super Sport" as a distinct model line in 1962, GM of Canada soon made available a similarly equipped Pontiac "Custom Sport" (rebadged Pontiac "2+2" in 1967 to mirror a name used by Pontiac in the US for a sporty model based on its Catalina series).  And when Chevrolet rolled out its topline Caprice model in mid-1965 to compete with Ford's newly introduced upscale Ford LTD, GM of Canada introduced the "Grande Parisienne" trim series for the 1966 model year. For the 4 years that Grande Parisienne was offered, 1966-1969 it was available as a 2 door hardtop, 4 door hardtop, or the model with no twin in the US, the 1967-1968 Grande Parisienne station wagon with hideaway headlights.

Like all Canadian Pontiacs built from 1955 to 1970, Laurentians used full-size Chevrolet chassis, drive trains, and other parts, but using a body shell similar in style to, but not interechangeable with, the U.S. Catalina. For example, a  1964 Pontiac Laurentian looks like a Catalina, but has more in common with the Chevrolet Bel Air. Through at least 1967, however, the Laurentian wore the three "stars" normally associated with the Pontiac Star Chief/Executive series, even though other exterior trim pieces were similar to the Catalina.

The Laurentian was available in all the body styles used for the Chevrolet Bel Air, including hardtop coupes and sedans, through the 1962 model run. After 1963, hardtops were offered only in the Parisienne and Grande Parisienne series (first offered in 1966), which paralleled the Chevrolet Impala and Caprice respectively. However, two-door hardtops returned to the Strato-Chief and Laurentian series in 1969 because Pontiac discontinued its Catalina 2-door sedan in the U.S. after the 1968 model run. 

The Canadian model line nameplates were never sold in the U. S. They were built for the Canadian market and for export from Canada as disassembled "crate" or "kit" cars.  The one exception came when the Parisienne became an American Pontiac offering beginning in mid-1983 through 1986, although by this time the U.S. and Canadian offerings were identical. As the only remaining full-size Pontiac model available at the time, the Canadian Parisienne had been coveted by US dealerships as a flagship model to fill that market segment and compete with the Caprice offered by Chevrolet dealers. The existing name was deemed suitable for the purpose and production was simply extended to cover both countries.

[[File:'65 Pontiac Strato Chief (Auto classique Laval '10).jpg|thumb|1965 Pontiac Strato Chief (Canada)]]
Right-hand drive Parisiennes and Laurentians were assembled from CKD kits by [[Holden|GM Holden]] in Australia and by [[General Motors South Africa|GM South Africa]] in South Africa; and from SKD kits by [[Holden New Zealand|GM New Zealand]] in New Zealand. 

As well, these kits were assembled for both Left-hand drive and Right-hand drive markets in Europe at GM plants in the Netherlands and Belgium. 

Canadian Pontiacs were used in part because, for fellow Commonwealth countries, there were advantages with import duties. But largely due first to the economies of part sourcing two separate GM lines from the same parts bin.  Second, with higher gasoline prices and lower discretionary spending than in the US, Canadian Pontiacs like Chevrolets were more affordable, hence more marketable overseas.  Thirdly, without the bulk and weight of American Pontiacs, their Canadian counterparts were better adapted where space can be limited, as in Europe and in a British RHD environment where an overly large full-size car suffers considerable disadvantages.

These RHD cars had the same dashboards whether Chevrolet or Pontiac (Impalas and Bel Airs were also exported to RHD markets) and only one dash design per bodyshell run so the 61-64 models had the one dash (a RHD version of the 1961 Pontiac layout) even though it changed annually in Canada and the 65-68s all had a 'transposed' version of the '65 Chevrolet dash. The RHD cars also had antiquated, short, 'clap-hands' wipers that almost met in the middle of the windshield rather than the parallel wipers of the LHD Canadian cars.  Local radios, upholstery and two-speed heater/demisters were fitted - some Australian cars had local Frigidaire air conditioning.

The '''Pontiac Grand Ville''' is a [[full-size]] car that was the top-trim model in the [[Pontiac]] line from 1971 to 1975.  It displaced the [[Pontiac Bonneville]], which had served as Pontiac's top-trim model since 1958.

The Bonneville was not discontinued, but shifted downward in the model lineup, effectively replacing the discontinued [[Pontiac Executive]].  The Grand Ville and Bonneville shared a number of trim and design elements that distinguished them from the Catalina, and the 1971-72 Grand Villes were built on a stretched (126 inch) wheelbase version of the GM "B" platform that nevertheless had identical interior dimensions to all other full-size Pontiacs.

In addition to more luxurious interior trimmings, the Grand Ville had distinctive chrome trim at the front and rear to set it apart from the rest of the Pontiac line. For 1974 only, the Grand Ville had unique parking lights which wrapped around the corner of the front fender. The car was often sold with deluxe appearance options, such as sport wheels and vinyl tops. Rear fender skirts were featured on the 1973 to 1975 models.

Standard equipment on Grand Ville models included a 455 cubic-inch [[V8 engine|V8]] (for 1975, a 400 cubic-inch [[V8 engine|V8]] was standard and the 455 optional), [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] [[automatic transmission]], power steering and power front disc brakes. Popular options included air conditioning, power windows and driver's seat, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, AM/FM stereo with tape deck and much more. One of the rarest options available on Grand Villes and other full-sized Pontiacs during this period was the adjustable brake and accelerator pedals offered from 1974 to 1976.

The Grand Ville enjoyed moderate success from 1971 to 1973. However, the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] of late 1973 and early 1974 led to gasoline shortages, long lines at filling stations, and high fuel prices. These factors sharply cut into full-sized car sales in 1974 as buyers moved towards smaller cars. For 1975, the Grand Ville became the Grand Ville Brougham and included more standard equipment than in previous years, such as power windows and a carpeted trunk. This would be the final year for the Grand Ville series, which included Pontiac's last convertible until 1983. For 1976, the Grand Ville nameplate was dropped and the lineup was renamed Bonneville Brougham, returning that nameplate back to its former flagship status.

Grand Ville convertibles were rare, with production never exceeding 5,000 units per year during the model run. From 1973 to 1975 the Grand Ville was Pontiac's only full-size convertible offering; 1971 and 1972 full-size Pontiac convertibles were offered in the entry level Catalina line as well. (There were no convertible Bonnevilles after the 1970 model year.) The rarest of the Grand Ville convertibles was the 1971 model with just under 1,800 examples built. The 1975 model was the most plentiful with just over 4,500 cars built, as being the final year of production increased demand. The Grand Ville convertible had the lowest production amongst its corporate cousins, the [[Oldsmobile 88]] Royale, [[Buick LeSabre]]/[[Buick Centurion|Centurion]], [[Chevrolet Caprice]] Classic and [[Cadillac Eldorado]] convertible lines.

The '''Pontiac Torpedo''' was a [[full-size]]d car produced by [[Pontiac]] from the 1940 through the 1948 model year (war years excepted). When released, it was the biggest Pontiac, used an 8-cylinder engine, and it had more standard features than other Pontiacs. Although the ''Torpedo'' name was exclusive to the highest line of Pontiacs in 1940, in 1941 the name was applied to all Pontiacs in three separate lines. The Custom Torpedoes were now top of the line name, while the DeLuxe Torpedo became the base line, and the Streamline Torpedo became the middle line of Pontiacs. All ''Torpedo'' models could be had with either a 6-cylinder or 8-cylinder engine beginning in 1941. From 1942 to 1948 the ''Torpedo'' name designated only the base line of Pontiacs.&lt;ref&gt;http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/NA/Pontiac/1940-Pontiac/1940-Pontiac-1701891734/1940-Pontiac-16&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Torpedo'' name disappeared from the Pontiac lineup in 1949. It was replaced by the [[Pontiac Chieftain]].

[[File:US Army Staff Car.jpg|thumb|left|1941 Pontiac Deluxe Torpedo Eight Metropolitan Sedan (A-body)]]
In 1940, Pontiac introduced the Torpedo on the [[General Motors]] [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]].&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; Along with [[Oldsmobile]], Pontiac had the distinction of having all three of GM's mainstream platforms this year, but this would last only one more year. The new C-body that the 1940 Pontiac Torpedo shared with [[Cadillac Series 62]], [[Buick Roadmaster]] and [[Buick Super|Super]], and the [[Oldsmobile 98|Oldsmobile Series 90]] featured cutting-edge "[[Torpedo (car)|torpedo]]" styling. Shoulder and hip room was over {{Convert|5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wider, running boards were eliminated and the exterior was streamlined and {{convert|2|-|3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} lower. When combined with a column-mounted shift lever the cars offered true six passenger comfort. These changes had clearly been influenced by the [[Cadillac Sixty Special]].

The 1940 Torpedo had larger windows and wider seats than other Pontiacs, front and rear "[[Quarter glass|ventiplanes]]" on 4-door sedans and long gracefully streamlined rear decks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Pontiac/1940-Pontiac/1940-Pontiac-1701891734/1940-Pontiac-10 |title=1940 Pontiac brochure |publisher=oldcarbrochures.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concealed hinges were used on all doors. The doors were extra wide. The hood ornament had a plastic Indian head mounted in a metal base. Front end sheet metal looked like that on other Pontiacs. Eight-cylinder badges were used front and rear. The door locks had weather sealed keyholes. Gas filler tubes were enclosed under "flip-up" lids on the left rear fenders. The window openings were trimmed with bright metal moldings. It was only available with the Inline 8-cylinder engine and either as a 4-passenger 2-door Sedan or a 5-passenger 4-door Sedan. A heater, cigarette lighter, six-tube radios, an electric clock, and a trunk light were all optional.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;

In 1941 the A-body and B-body were similarly redesigned with lower, wider runningboard-less bodies (though running boards were offered as an extra-cost option)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Pontiac/1941_Pontiac/1941_Pontiac_Brochure/1941-Pontiac-18 |page=18 |title=1941 Pontiac brochure |publisher=oldcarbrochures.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Pontiac renamed its entire line-up "Torpedo", with models ranging from the low-end [[GM A platform|A-bodied]] Deluxe Torpedo (with a 119-inch wheelbase),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1941_Pontiac/1941_Pontiac_Brochure/1941%20Pontiac-22.html |title=1941 Pontiac brochure |page=22 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the mid-level [[GM B platform|B-bodied]] Streamliner Torpedo (with a 122-inch wheelbase), and the high-end C-bodied Custom Torpedo (with the same 122-inch wheelbase as the previous year). All models came with either the six- or eight-cylinder engines.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;

A wide grille with horizontal bars was used on the A-bodied Deluxe Torpedo. The parking lights were built into the grille. Headlights were fully recessed into the new, wider fenders. Speed-line ribbing was molded into the sides of both front and rear fenders. Deluxe Sixes were in Series 25. Deluxe Eights were in Series 27. The sixes had shorter hood ornaments, a "6" badge on the hood and Pontiac lettering on the side. The eights had larger hood ornaments, an "8" badge on the hood and Pontiac Deluxe lettering on the side. Deluxe Torpedoes had notchback styling. Initially five body styles were available: a 3-passenger 2-door Business Coupe, a 5-passenger 2-door Sedan Coupe, a 5-passenger 2-door Sedan, a 5-passenger 2-door convertible and a 5-passenger 4-door Sedan. The 5-passenger 4-door Metropolitan Sedan was added in the middle of the model year. It had 4-window styling with rear ventiplanes similar to the 4-door Custom Torpedo Sedan instead of the 6-window styling found on the regular 4-door Deluxe Torpedo Sedan. The convertible had a power top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1941_Pontiac/1941_Pontiac_Brochure/1941%20Pontiac-15.html |title=1941 Pontiac brochure |page=15 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sleek [[fastback]] styling characterized the B-bodied Streamliner Torpedo. The roofline swept from the windshield to the rear bumper in one smooth curve. The front end sheet metal was the same as on the Deluxe Torpedo and trim difference between sixes and eights were also the same. Streamliner Sixes were in Series 26. Streamliner Eights were in Series 28. Beige corded wool cloth upholstery. There was also a Super Streamliner Torpedo subseries. Supers had the same body styling and trim but featured two-tone worsted wool cloth upholstery with pin stripes. They also added sponge rubber seat cushions, electric clocks, deluxe flexible steering wheels and divan type seats with folding center armrests. Two bodystyles were available: a 5-passenger 2-door Sedan Coupe and a 5-passenger 4-door Sedan.

The C-bodied Custom Torpedo had a notchback sedan and coupe as the previous year but new was a 4-door 8-passenger wood bodied [[station wagon]] in standard or Deluxe trim. Styling was similar to the Deluxe and Streamliner Torpedoes as were the variations between the sixes and the eights. Custom Sixes were in Series 24. Custom Eights were in Series 29. Station wagon bodies were built by Hercules and Ionia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.coachbuilt.com/bui/h/hercules_campbell/hercules_campbell.htm |title=Hercules-Campbell Body Company |publisher=Coach Built }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ionia bodies had a more rounded rear end treatment. Standard station wagons had imitation leather upholstery while Deluxe types had genuine leather cushions.

1941 was the last year Pontiac offered a model with the GM C-body until the big "[[Station wagon#Tailgate evolution|Clamshell tailgate]]" [[Pontiac Safari]] and [[Pontiac Grand Safari|Grand Safari]] [[station wagons]] of 1971-76.

The only way to get an 8-cylinder engine on the [[GM A platform (RWD)|GM A body]] from 1941 to 1948 was to buy an [[Oldsmobile Series 60|Oldsmobile Special 68]] or a Pontiac Deluxe Torpedo Eight. In a sense these were perhaps the first [[muscle car]]s.

For 1942, the Torpedo name was assigned to the A-bodied Pontiac while the [[Pontiac Streamliner|Streamliner]] became the B-bodied Pontiac. The grille got horizontal bars, while the headlamps were placed farther apart. Most Torpedoes continued to have the [[notchback]] styling found on the Deluxe Torpedoes. However a new body style to the A-bodied Pontiac was a 5-passenger 2-door Sedan Coupe which had [[fastback]] styling similar to the Streamliner. After December 15, 1941, the Torpedo received wartime 'black-out" trim, which meant that all the chrome pieces were painted in Duco Gun-Metal Grey.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;

In 1946, the first postwar Pontiac's looked very similar to the pre-war models. The dash contained full instrumentation with round gauges. The engines were the same. The 4-window 4-door Metropolitan Sedan and the 2-door Club Coupe were discontinued.

1947 Torpedoes received a new "Chief Pontiac" hood ornament. An 8-tube radio became optional.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt;

1948 was the last year for the Torpedo, receiving a new grill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Pontiac/1948-Pontiac/1948-Pontiac-Foldout/1948-Pontiac-Foldout-04-05-06-07 |title=1948 Pontiac foldout |publisher=oldcarbrochures.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Hydramatic automatic transmission became optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oldcarbrochures.com/new/021110/1948%20Pontiac%20Foldout/1948%20Pontiac%20Foldout-08-09-10-11-12-13-14-15.html  |title=1948 Pontiac foldout |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Base price was $1,500.

==Early history==
[[File:Pontiac Silver Streak Torpedo Streamliner Coupe 1941.jpg|thumb|left|1941 Pontiac Streamliner Torpedo Eight coupe (B-body)]]
Along with [[Oldsmobile]], Pontiac had the distinction of having all three of [[General Motors]]' mainstream [[Automobile platforms|platforms]] in 1940, but this would last only one more year. In 1940 Pontiac introduced its first [[GM B platform|B-bodied]] car, the Deluxe Series 28 Eight. Also in 1940, Pontiac introduced the [[Pontiac Torpedo|Torpedo]] on the [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]].&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; The new C-body featured cutting-edge "[[Torpedo (car)|torpedo]]" styling. Shoulder and hip room was over {{Convert|5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wider, running boards were eliminated and the exterior was streamlined and {{Convert|2|-|3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} lower. When combined with a column mounted shift lever the cars offered true six passenger comfort. These changes had clearly been influenced by the [[Cadillac Sixty Special]].

In 1941 the [[GM A platform|A-body]] and B-body were similarly redesigned. Consequently, Pontiac renamed its entire line-up "Torpedo", with models ranging from the low-end [[GM A platform|A-bodied]] Deluxe Torpedo (with a {{Convert|119.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase), the mid-level [[GM B platform|B-bodied]] Streamliner Torpedo (with a {{Convert|122.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase up {{Convert|2.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} from the previous year), and the high-end C-bodied Custom Torpedo (with the same {{Convert|122.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase as the previous year).&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;

1941 was the last year Pontiac offered a model with the GM C-body until the big "[[Station wagon#Tailgate evolution|Clamshell]]" tailgate [[Pontiac Safari]] and [[Pontiac Grand Safari|Grand Safari]] [[station wagons]] of 1971-76.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; For 1942, the Torpedo name was assigned to the A-bodied Pontiac while the Streamliner became the B-bodied Pontiac.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;

[[File:Pontiac 1947 Streamliner Station Wagon.jpg|thumb|left|1947 Pontiac Streamliner Station Wagon]]
Streamliners used the larger [[GM B platform|B-body]] and, except for the [[station wagon]]s, used [[fastback]] styling.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; The 1941 Super models with folding center armrest were known as [[Pontiac Chieftain|Chieftains]] in 1942.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; All Pontiacs looked lower, heavier and wider.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; Extension caps on the front doors lengthened the forward fender lines.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; The hood extended back to the front doors, eliminating the cowl.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; The grille, bumper and hood were widened and headlamps were further apart. Long horizontal parking lamps sat just above the vertical side grilles.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; The horseshoe shaped center grille had horizontal bars and a circular emblem in the middle of the upper main surround molding.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; The word Pontiac appeared on the hood side molding of six-cylinder models, while the moldings of the eight-cylinder cars said Pontiac Eight.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; After December 15, 1941, wartime "blackout" trim was used.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; All parts previously chrome plated were finished in [[Duco]] Gun Metal Grey.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;

[[File:1948 Pontiac Streamliner Deluxe - Flickr - exfordy.jpg|thumb|left|1948 Pontiac Streamliner Deluxe coupe]]
[[File:1948 Pontiac Streamliner Deluxe - Flickr - exfordy (2).jpg|thumb|left|1948 Pontiac Streamliner Deluxe coupe]]
With the end of the [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] [[Pontiac Torpedo|Pontiac Custom Torpedo]], station wagon production was transferred to the new Streamliner line.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; The final body work continued to be done at either the Hercules Body Company or at Ionia Manufacturing. The Streamliner station wagon ranged from $1265 for a base Six to $1340 for a Chieftain Eight, making it Pontiac's most expensive model.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; At {{Convert|215.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} in overall length the 1942 Pontiac Streamliner station wagon also set a record for the longest Pontiac, this would not be exceeded until the 1959 [[Pontiac Star Chief]] and [[Pontiac Bonneville|Bonneville]].&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;

The first postwar Pontiac available (September 13, 1945) was the Streamliner coupe, which remained the sole product for a time.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; The Chieftain trim level of 1942 was renamed the Deluxe trim level in 1946. Styling highlights of Pontiacs were wraparound bumpers, a massive 14 blade grille, new nameplates and concealed safe-light parking lamps.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Streamliners could be identified by straight back Indian moldings on the rear hood ornament chrome beltline moldings and bright moldings on the "speedline" fender ribs.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; They also had longer front fender crown moldings and were generally larger in size.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Lettering on hood emblems and badges placed forward of the "speedlines" identified Eights.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Interior trim on passenger cars were in gray striped cloth.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Station wagons had three seats in standard trim, two seats in Deluxe trim and used imitation leather upholstery and passenger car style interior hardware.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Ranging in price from $1942 for a standard Six to $2047 for a Deluxe Eight, Streamliner station wagons continued to be the most expensive Pontiac model.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; A total of 92,731 Streamliners were sold in 1946, accounting for over two thirds of all Pontiacs.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;

In 1947 the "[[Pontiac Straight-8 engine|Silver Streak]]" styling theme was continued, now with five bands of chrome on hoods. All Pontiacs had new grilles with four broad gently bowed horizontal bars.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Hoods and fenders were protected by an inverted steer's horn shaped bar incorporating a die cast plate with indianhead relief.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Interiors for sedans and coupes were redesigned with Berwicke beige panels for dashboard and windows.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Windshield, door and garnish moldings were finished in Autumn Brown with dado stripe border moldings.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; All coupes and sedans were fastbacks with full-loop around window moldings.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Streamliner station wagons ranged in price from $1992 for a standard Six to $2111 for a Deluxe Eight, again making them Pontiac's most expensive model.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Sales of Streamliners totaled 128,660 in 1947, or nearly 56% of all Pontiacs sold.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;

In 1948 a new Pontiac styling included triple "Silver Streaks," a horizontal grille theme with vertical shaft, and round taillights.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; The word "Silver Streak" was carried on the sides of the hood with eights having an "8" placed between the two words.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Streamliners were again larger and more expensive than other Pontiacs.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; All Streamliners, be they 2-door or 4-door fastbacks, or station wagons, now came standard or Deluxe.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Deluxe models were distinguished by spear moldings on front fender, bright gravel guards, and chrome plated wheel discs on all cars except wagons.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Deluxe interiors had two tone trims with pillow-and-tuft seatbacks, quarter sawed mahogany dash and window trim, electric glovebox door clocks, Deluxe steering wheels and other rich appointments.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Standard Streamliner station wagons had tan imitation leather seats and Deluxe wagons had red upholstery of the same type.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Station wagon prices ranged from $2364 for a standard Six to $2490 for a Deluxe Eight, making them Pontiac's most expensive model.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; In 1948 160,857 Streamliners were sold, accounting for nearly 66% of all Pontiacs.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;

Perhaps the biggest story of 1948 for Pontiac was the addition of [[Hydramatic]] [[automatic transmission]] as an option.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; As of 1948 only [[General Motors]] sold cars with fully [[automatic transmission]]s and the only other way to get one was to buy a higher priced [[Cadillac]], [[Buick]] or [[Oldsmobile]]. [[Chevrolet]] would not introduce [[Powerglide]] until 1950, [[Ford]] [[Cruise-O-Matic#FordoMatic|FordoMatic]] until 1951 ([[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]] would start buying Hydramatics from GM in 1949), and [[Chrysler]], [[PowerFlite]] on [[Chrysler Imperial|Imperials]], until 1953.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Hydramatic proved very popular with a total of 171,946 Pontiacs sold with it, or about 71% of all Pontiacs, and with 122,327 Streamliners equipped with it, or about 76% of all Streamliners, in its first year.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Since Hydramatic was still only optional on Cadillac and Oldsmobile, and [[Dynaflow]] optional on [[Buick Roadmaster]], given the total sales of Cadillac (50,619), Oldsmobile (173,661) and Buick Roadmaster (80,071), and the fact that Dynaflow was only introduced in the middle of the model year, this implies that probably over 40% of all cars sold with automatic transmissions in 1948 were Pontiacs.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;

The 1949 Pontiacs featured low sleek envelope bodies.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Streamliner coupes and sedans utilized the [[fastback]] [[GM B platform|B-body]] shell.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; [[Station wagons]] continued to be part of the Streamliner line. All of these cars came as standards or Deluxes. All station wagons and other standard models had small hubcaps.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Standard coupes, sedans, and wagons were characterized by an absence of beltline trim along with use of rubber gravel guards and painted headlight rims.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Deluxes had beltline moldings, chrome gravel guards and bright plated headlight doors.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; [[Pontiac Straight-8 engine|Silver Streak]] styling was seen again.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Silver Streak lettering was placed above front fender spears on Deluxes and high on the fenders of standards.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Eights had the number "8" between the two words. Most standard models had gray striped pattern cloth upholstery.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Most Deluxes used dark gray broadcloth trims.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Wagons were trimmed as before except imitation leather was only used on standard wagons.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; 1949 was the last year for [[Woodie (car body style)|wood-bodied station wagons]], as production shifted to all-metal station wagons with [[woodgrain]] trim during the model year.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Streamliner station wagons continued to be the most expensive Pontiac model, ranging in price from $2543 for a standard Six to $2690 for a Deluxe Eight.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;

The 1950 Pontiacs utilized the popular 1949 envelope bodies with revisions to trim and appointments.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; The horizontal center grille bar now wrapped around the corners of the body.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Deluxes had a chrome body strip, chrome wheel rings, chrome headlight rings and stainless steel gravel guards.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Eights had an "8" between the words. Streamliners (except for station wagons and sedan delivery trucks) had fastback styling.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; The price of Streamliner station wagons fell to a range of $2264 for standard Sixes to $2411 for Deluxe Eights&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; due to the fact all-metal construction did not require final work be done at Hercules Body Company or Iona Manufacturing. Nevertheless, the Streamliner station wagon remained the most expensive Pontiac model.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;

The 1951 "Silver Anniversary" Pontiacs reflected 25 years of advanced engineering.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; A wing shaped grille was seen and a Silver Streak theme continued. Streamliners again used the B-body shell with sloping fastbacks on coupes.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Deluxes had chrome body strip, bright gravel guards, and headlight rings.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Belt line moldings on all Deluxe passenger cars (not station wagons) had a dip behind the doors.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Standard belt moldings were straight.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; A script plate reading Pontiac was used on Series 25 Sixes and on Series 27 Eights a different script read Pontiac Eight.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; In its final year, the Streamliner station wagon continued to be Pontiac's most expensive model, ranging in price from $2470 for a standard Six to $2629 for a Deluxe Eight.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Pontiac's headquarter operations at the [[Pontiac, Michigan]] plant was responsible for 49.2% of all Pontiacs built in 1951.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;

With the demise of the Streamliner, 1951 would be the last time Pontiac offered a [[GM B platform|B-bodied]] car until 1959.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;

The '''Pontiac GTO''' is an [[automobile]] that was manufactured by American automobile manufacturer [[Pontiac]] from the 1964 to 1974 model years, and by GM's subsidiary [[Holden]] in Australia from the 2004 to 2006 model years.

The first generation of the GTO was the first [[muscle car]] produced in the 1960s and the 1970s. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rNiI4quG6KUC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=First+muscle+car |page=7 |title=Muscle car: mighty machines that ruled the world|first=John |last=Gunnell |publisher=Krause Publications |year=2006 |isbn= 9780896893139 |accessdate=March 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=muscle&gt;{{cite web|url= http://musclecars.howstuffworks.com/muscle-car-information/how-muscle-cars-work1.htm |title=The Birth of Muscle Cars |author=Auto editors of''Consumer Guide'' |publisher=howstuffworks.com |date=16 January 2007 |accessdate=March 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Pontiac GTO is considered by some to have started the trend with all four domestic automakers offering a variety of competing models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |quote= 'classic' muscle car is considered a GTO-like model, it doesn't have to be a Pontiac.

For the 1964 and 1965 model years, the GTO was an optional package on the intermediate-sized Pontiac LeMans. The 1964 GTO [[vehicle identification number]] (VIN) started with 82, while the 1965 GTO VIN started with 237. The GTO became a separate model from 1966 to 1971 (VIN 242...). It became an optional package again for the 1972 and 1973 intermediate [[Pontiac LeMans|LeMans]]. For 1974, the GTO optional package was offered on the compact-sized [[Pontiac Ventura|Ventura]].

The GTO was selected as the [[Motor Trend Car of the Year]] in 1968.

The GTO model was revived from 2004 to 2006 model years as a [[captive import]] for Pontiac, a left-hand drive version of the [[Holden Monaro]], itself a [[coupé]] variant of the [[Holden Commodore]].

==Origins==
In early 1963, General Motors' management banned divisions from involvement in [[auto racing]]. This followed the 1957 voluntary ban on automobile racing that was instituted by the [[Automobile Manufacturers Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0SG1yOw4edUC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=automobile+racing+ban+by+the+Automobile+Manufacturers+Association |page=62 |title=Muscle: America's Legendary Performance Cars |first=Randy |last=Leffingwell |first2=Darwin |last2=Holmstrom |year=2006 |publisher=Motorbooks |isbn=9780760322840 |accessdate=March 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1960s, Pontiac's advertising and marketing approach was heavily based on performance. With GM's ban on factory-sponsored racing, Pontiac's managers began to emphasize street performance.

In his autobiography ''Glory Days'', Pontiac chief marketing manager Jim Wangers, who worked for the division's contract advertising and public relations agency, states that [[John DeLorean]], Bill Collins, and Russ Gee were responsible for the GTO's creation. It involved transforming the upcoming second-generation [[Pontiac Tempest]] (which reverted to a conventional front-engine with front transmission configuration) into a sporty car, with a larger {{convert|389|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Pontiac V8 engine]] from the full-sized [[Pontiac Catalina]] and [[Pontiac Bonneville|Bonneville]] in place of the standard {{convert|326|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8. By promoting the big-engine option as a special high-performance model, they could appeal to the speed-minded youth market (which had also been recognized by [[Ford Motor Company]]'s [[Lee Iacocca]], who was at that time preparing the sporty [[Ford Mustang]] variant of the second generation Ford Falcon compact).

The GTO disregarded GM's policy limiting the [[GM A platform (RWD)|A-body]] [[mid-size car|intermediate]] line to a maximum engine displacement of {{convert|330|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}. Pontiac general manager [[Pete Estes|Elliot "Pete" Estes]] approved the new model, although sales manager Frank Bridge, who did not believe it would find a market, insisted on limiting initial production to 5,000 cars.

=== Name ===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
The name, which was DeLorean's idea, was inspired by the [[Ferrari 250 GTO]], the successful race car. It is an [[Italian language|Italian]] [[abbreviation]] for ''Gran Turismo Omologato'' ("grand tourer [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologated]]"), which means officially certified for racing in the [[grand tourer]] class. In reality, however, the Pontiac GTO was never really a certified Grand Tourer race car. Internally, it was initially called the "Grand Tempest Option", one of many automobiles in the Pontiac line up with a 'Grand' in it. Despite these things, the GTO is one of the fastest cars ever manufactured by Pontiac.

===1964===
The first Pontiac GTO was available as an option package for the [[Pontiac LeMans]], available in [[coupé]], [[hardtop]], and [[convertible]] body styles. The [[United States dollar|US$]]295 package included a {{convert|389|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]] rated at {{convert|325|bhp|abbr=on}} at 4,800&amp;nbsp;rpm with a single Carter AFB four-barrel [[carburetor]] and dual [[Exhaust system|exhaust pipes]], [[chrome plating|chromed]] valve covers and air cleaner, seven-blade [[fan clutch|clutch fan]], a floor-shifted three-speed [[manual transmission]] with a [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] shifter, stiffer springs, larger diameter front [[sway bar]], wider wheels with 7.50 × 14 redline tires, [[hood scoop]]s, and GTO badges. Optional equipment included a four-speed manual transmission, [[Super Turbine 300]] two-speed [[automatic transmission]], a more powerful engine with "Tri-Power" carburetion (three two-barrel Rochester 2G carburetors) rated at {{convert|348|bhp|abbr=on}}, metallic [[drum brake]] linings,&lt;ref name="1964-page=7"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1964%20Pontiac/1964_Pontiac_GTO_Brochure/1964%20Pontiac%20GTO-07.html |title=1964 Pontiac GTO Brochure |page=7 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[limited-slip differential]], heavy-duty cooling, ride and handling package, and the usual array of power and convenience accessories. With every available option, the GTO cost about [[United States dollar|US$]]4,500 and weighed around {{convert|3500|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. A tachometer was optional, and was placed in the far right dial on the dash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1964%20Pontiac/1964_Pontiac_GTO_Brochure/1964%20Pontiac%20GTO-06.html |title=1964 Pontiac GTO Brochure |page=6|publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1964 Pontiac GTO (9130478010).jpg|thumb|left|1964 Pontiac GTO convertible]]

Most contemporary road tests by the automotive press such as ''Car Life'' criticized the slow steering, particularly without [[power steering]], and inadequate drum brakes, which were identical to those of the normal Tempest. ''[[Car and Driver]]'' incited controversy when it mentioned that a GTO, which had supposedly been tuned with the "Bobcat" kit offered by Ace Wilson's Royal Pontiac of [[Royal Oak, Michigan]], was clocked at a quarter mile time of 12.8&amp;nbsp;seconds and a trap speed of {{convert|112|mph|abbr=on}} on [[racing slick]]s. Later reports strongly suggest that the ''Car and Driver'' GTOs were equipped with a larger {{convert|421|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine that was optional in full-sized Pontiacs. Since the two engines were difficult to distinguish externally, the subterfuge was not immediately obvious. In Jim Wangers' ''Glory Days'' he admitted after three decades of denial that the red drag strip GTO had its engine swapped with a 421 Bobcat unit. Since the car was damaged during the testing, and Wangers did not want anyone looking under the hood, he used the blue road course GTO to flat tow the red GTO 1,500 miles back to Detroit. Frank Bridge's initial sales forecast proved inaccurate: the GTO package's total sales amounted to 32,450 units.

====Bobcat====
Throughout the 1960s, Ace Wilson's Royal Pontiac, a Pontiac [[Car dealership|car dealer]] in Royal Oak, Michigan, offered a special tune-up package for Pontiac 389 engines. The components and instructions could be purchased by mail, as well as installed by the dealer. A majority of the GTO's made available for media testing were equipped with a Bobcat kit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Severs |first=Aaron |url= http://ateupwithmotor.com/model-histories/pontiac-gto/ |work=ateupwithmotor.com |title=Three Deuces, Four Speeds: The Rise and Fall of the Pontiac GTO |date= August 7, 2009 |accessdate=March 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milt Schornack joined Royal Pontiac and helped improve the performance enhancement package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mattar |first=George |url= http://www.hemmings.com/mus/stories/2007/04/01/hmn_feature23.html |journal=Hemmings Muscle Machines |date=April 2007 |title=Milt Schornack - He put the GET-UP-AND-GO into GTOs |accessdate=March 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The components of the kit varied, but generally included parts to modify the spark advance of the [[distributor]], limiting spark advance to 34–36° at no more than 3,000&amp;nbsp;rpm (advancing the timing at high rpm for increased power), a thinner copper [[head gasket]] to raise compression to about 11.23:1, special intake manifold [[gasket]]s to block the heat riser to the carburetor (keeping it cooler), larger carburetor jets, and locking rocker nuts to hold the hydraulic valve lifters at their maximum point of adjustment, allowing the engine to rev higher without "floating" the valves. Properly installed, the kit could add between 30 and 50 horsepower (20–40&amp;nbsp;kW), although it required high-[[octane]] super premium [[gasoline]] of over 100 octane to avoid [[Engine knocking|spark knock]] with the higher compression and advanced timing. Adhesive "Royal Bobcats" stickers were also included.

===1965===
[[File:1964 &amp; 1966 Pontiac GTO (5898346363).jpg|thumb|A 1964 GTO (left) with a 1966 GTO (right) showing the difference in design]]
The Tempest model line up, including the GTO, was restyled for the 1965 model year, adding {{convert|3.1|in|mm|0}} to the overall length while retaining the same [[wheelbase]] and interior dimensions. It had Pontiac's characteristic vertically stacked quad headlights. Overall weight was increased by about {{convert|100|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}. The brake lining area increased by nearly 15%. Heavy-duty shocks were standard, as was a stronger front antisway bar. The dashboard design was changed, and an optional rally gauge cluster (US$86.08) added a more legible [[tachometer]] and [[oil pressure]] gauge. An additional option was a breakerless transistor ignition.

The 389 cubic inches engines received revised cylinder heads with re-cored intake passages and high rise intake manifolds, improving airflow to the engine. Rated power increased to {{convert|335|hp|abbr=on}} at 5,000&amp;nbsp;rpm for the base four-barrel engine; the Tri-Power engine was now rated {{convert|360|hp|abbr=on}} at 5,200&amp;nbsp;rpm. The 'S'-cammed Tri-Power engine had slightly less peak torque rating than the base engine {{convert|424|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3,600&amp;nbsp;rpm as compared to {{convert|431|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3,200&amp;nbsp;rpm. Transmission and axle ratio choices remained the same. The three-speed manual was standard, while two four-speed manual transmissions (wide or close ratio) and a two-speed automatic transmission were optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1965%20Pontiac/1965_Pontiac_Performance_Brochure/1965%20Pontiac%20Performance-16.html |title=1965 Pontiac Performance Brochure |page=16 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The restyled car had a new simulated [[hood scoop]]. A seldom seen dealer-installed option consisted of a metal underhood pan and gaskets to open the scoop, making it a [[cold air intake]]. The scoop was low enough that its effectiveness was questionable (it was unlikely to pick up anything but [[boundary layer]] air), but it allowed an enhanced engine sound. Another exterior change was the black "egg-crate" grille.

''Car Life'' tested a 1965 GTO with Tri-Power and what they considered the most desirable options (close-ratio four-speed manual transmission, power steering, metallic brakes, rally wheels, 4.11 limited-slip differential, and "Rally" gauge cluster), with a total sticker price of [[United States dollar|US$]]3,643.79. With two testers and equipment aboard, they recorded a 0–60&amp;nbsp;miles per hour (0–97&amp;nbsp;km/h) acceleration time of 5.8&amp;nbsp;seconds, the standing quarter mile in 14.5&amp;nbsp;seconds with a trap speed of 100&amp;nbsp;miles per hour (160&amp;nbsp;km/h), and an observed top speed of 114&amp;nbsp;miles per hour (182.4&amp;nbsp;km/h) at the engine's 6,000&amp;nbsp;rpm [[redline]]. A four-barrel ''[[Motor Trend]]'' test car, a heavier convertible handicapped by the two-speed automatic transmission and the lack of a limited slip differential, ran 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph in 7&amp;nbsp;seconds and through the quarter mile in 16.1 seconds at 89&amp;nbsp;miles per hour (142.4&amp;nbsp;km/h).{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Major criticisms of the GTO continued to center on its slow steering (ratio of 17.5:1, four turns lock-to-lock) and subpar brakes. ''Car Life'' was satisfied with the metallic brakes on its GTO, but ''Motor Trend'' and ''Road Test'' found the four-wheel drum brakes with organic linings to be alarmingly inadequate in high-speed driving.

Sales of the GTO, abetted by a marketing and promotional campaign that included songs and various merchandise, more than doubled to 75,342. It spawned many imitators, both within other GM divisions and its competitors.

===1966===
[[File:1966 Pontiac GTO (15117795820).jpg|right|thumb|1966 Pontiac GTO convertible]]
The GTO became a separate Pontiac model (model number 242) in 1966, instead of being an "option package" on the Tempest LeMans. The entire GM "A" body intermediate line was restyled that year, gaining more curvaceous styling with kicked-up rear fender lines for a [[coke bottle styling|"Coke-bottle" look]], and a slightly "tunneled" backlight. The tail light featured a louvered cover, only seen on the GTO. Overall length grew only fractionally, to {{convert|206.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, still on a {{convert|115|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase, while width expanded to {{convert|74.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Rear track increased one inch (2.5&amp;nbsp;cm). Overall weight remained about the same. The GTO was available as a pillared coupe, a [[hardtop]] (without [[Pillar (automobile)|B-pillars]]), and a [[convertible]]. Also an automotive industry first, plastic front grilles replaced the [[pot metal]] and aluminum versions seen on earlier years. New Strato [[bucket seat]]s were introduced with higher and thinner seat backs and contoured cushions for added comfort and adjustable headrests were introduced as a new option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1966_Pontiac/1966_Pontiac_Performance_Brochure/1966%20Pontiac%20Performance-08-09.html |title=1966 Pontiac Performance Brochure |pages=8–9 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument panel was redesigned and more integrated than in previous years with the ignition switch moved from the far left of the dash to the right of the steering wheel. Four pod instruments continued, and the GTO's dash was highlighted by walnut veneer trim.

Engine and carburetor choices remained the same as the previous year, except the Tri-Power option was discontinued mid-model year. A new engine was offered that saw few takers: the XS option consisted of a factory Ram Air set up with a new 744 high lift [[cam]]. Approximately 35 factory-installed Ram Air packages are believed to have been built, though 300 dealership installed Ram Air packages are estimated to have been ordered. On paper, the package was said to produce the same {{convert|360|hp|abbr=on}} as the non-Ram Air, Tri-Power car.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Sales increased to 96,946, the highest production figure for all GTO years. Although Pontiac had strenuously promoted the GTO in advertising as the "GTO Tiger," it had become known in the youth market as the "goat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Pontiac GTO The Great One |publisher=Motorbooks |date=September 2003 |first=Steve | last=Statham |isbn=978-0760308288| page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1967===
[[File:1967 Pontiac GTO (14040324408).jpg|right|thumb|1967 GTO hardtop]]
The GTO underwent a few styling changes in 1967. The louver-covered [[taillight]]s were replaced with eight tail lights, four on each side. Rally II wheels with colored lug nuts were also available in 1967. The GTO emblems located on the rear part of the [[Fender (vehicle)|fenders]] were moved to the chrome [[rocker panel]]s. The grill was changed from a purely split grill, to one that shared some chrome.

The 1967 GTO was available in three body styles:

*Hardtop – 65,176 produced
*Convertible – 9,517 produced
*Sports coupe – 7,029 produced

The GTO also saw several mechanical changes in 1967. The [[Tri-Power]] carburetion system was replaced with a single 4-barrel [[Rochester Products Division|Rochester]] [[Quadrajet]] [[carburetor]]. The {{convert|389|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine received a larger cylinder [[Bore (engine)|bore]] {{convert|4.12|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} for a total [[Engine displacement|displacement]] of {{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Pontiac V8 engine#400|V8]], which was available in three models: economy, standard, and high output. The economy engine used a two-barrel carburetor rather than the Rochester Quadrajet and produced {{convert|265|hp|abbr=on}} at 4,400 rpm and {{convert|397|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 3,400 rpm. The standard engine produced {{convert|335|hp|abbr=on}} at 5,000 rpm; and the highest [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] of the three engines at {{convert|441|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 3,400 rpm. The high output engine produced the most power for that year at {{convert|360|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,100 rpm and a maximum torque of {{convert|438|lbft|Nm kgm|0|abbr=on}} at 3,600 rpm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/?car=347193|title=1967 Pontiac GTO Ram Air specifications|website=carfolio.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supercars.net/blog/1967-pontiac-gto/|title=1967 Pontiac GTO review|website=supercars.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myclassicgarage.com/knowledge-base/1967-Pontiac-GTO|title=1967 Pontiac GTO|website=myclassicgarage.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vehicle emissions control|Emission controls]] were fitted in GTOs sold in [[California]].

The 1967 model year required new safety equipment. A new energy-absorbing steering column was accompanied by an energy-absorbing steering wheel, padded instrument panel, non-protruding control knobs, and four-way emergency flashers. A shoulder belt option was also featured, and the brake master cylinder was now a dual reservoir unit with a backup hydraulic circuit.

The two-speed automatic transmission was also replaced with a three-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] TH-400, which was equipped with a [[Hurst Performance]] dual-gate [[Gear stick|shifter]], called a "his/hers" shifter, that permitted either automatic shifting in "drive" or manual selection through the gears. Front [[disc brake]]s were also an option in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1967%20Pontiac/1967%20Pontiac%20Full%20Line%20Brochure-01/1967%20Pontiac%20Full%20Line-54.html |title=1967 Pontiac Full Line Brochure |page=54 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GTO sales for 1967 totaled 81,722.

===1968===
[[File:68 GTO Tach.jpg|thumb|left|1968 GTO hood-mounted Tachometer]]
[[File:1968 Pontiac GTO (28170575472).jpg|thumb|left|1968 Pontiac GTO]]
General Motors redesigned its [[GM A platform (RWD)|A-body]] line for 1968, with more curvaceous, semi-fastback styling. The wheelbase was shortened to {{convert|112.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} on all two-door models. Overall length was reduced 5.9&amp;nbsp;inches (150&amp;nbsp;mm) and height dropped half an inch (12&amp;nbsp;mm), but overall weight was up about {{convert|75|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}. Pontiac abandoned the familiar vertically stacked headlights in favor of a horizontal layout, but made [[Hidden headlamps|hidden headlights]] available at extra cost. The concealed headlights were a popular option. The signature hood scoop was replaced by dual scoops on either side of a prominent hood bulge extending rearward from the protruding nose.

A unique feature was the body-color Endura [[Bumper (automobile)|front bumper]]. It was designed to absorb impact without permanent deformation at low speeds. Pontiac touted this feature heavily in advertising, showing hammering at the bumper to no discernible effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strohl |first=Danie |url= https://www.hemmings.com/magazine/hmn/2006/07/Endura-Front-Bumper/1296846.html |title=Endura Front Bumper The bounce-back bumper that freed automotive styling |journal=Hemmings Motor News |date=July 2006 |accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A GTO could be ordered with "Endura delete", in which case the Endura bumper would be replaced by a chrome front bumper and grille from the Pontiac LeMans.

Powertrain options remained substantially the same as in 1967, but the standard GTO engine's power rating rose to {{convert|350|hp|abbr=on}} at 5,000&amp;nbsp;rpm. At mid-year, a new Ram Air package, known as Ram Air II, became available. It included freer-breathing cylinder heads, round port exhaust, and the 041 cam. The 'official' power rating was not changed. Another carry-over from 1967 was the four-piston caliper disc brake option. However, most 1968 models had drum brakes all around as this seldom ordered option provided greater stopping power. The 1968 model year was also the last year the GTOs offered separate crank-operated front door vents.

Concealed windshield wipers, which presented a cleaner appearance hidden below the rear edge of the hood, were standard on the GTO and other 1968 GM products after having been originally introduced on the 1967 [[Pontiac Grand Prix]].  A popular option, actually introduced during the 1967 model year, was a hood-mounted tachometer, located in front of the windshield and lit for visibility at night. An in-dash tachometer was also available.

Redline [[bias-ply tire]]s continued as standard equipment on the 1968 GTO, though they could be replaced by [[whitewall tire]]s at no extra cost. A new option was [[radial tire]]s for improved ride and handling. However, very few were delivered with the radial tires because of manufacturing problems encountered by supplier [[Goodrich Corporation|B.F. Goodrich]]. The radial tire option was discontinued after 1968. Pontiac did not offer radial tires as a factory option on the GTO again until the 1974 model.

''Hot Rod'' tested a four-speed GTO equipped with the standard engine and obtained a quarter mile reading of 14.7 seconds at {{convert|97|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in pure stock form. ''Motor Trend'' clocked a four-speed Ram Air GTO with 4.33 rear differential at 14.45&amp;nbsp;seconds at {{convert|98.2|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and a standard GTO with Turbo-Hydramatic and a 3.23 rear axle ratio at 15.93&amp;nbsp;seconds at {{convert|88.3|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Testers were split about handling, with ''Hot Rod'' calling it "the best-balanced car [Pontiac] ever built," but ''Car Life'' chided its excessive nose heaviness, understeer, and inadequate damping.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Royal Pontiac, located in Royal Oak, Michigan, offered a 428/Royal Bobcat conversion of the 1968 GTO. For $650.00. a 390-horsepower 428 cubic inch engine was installed in place of the 400. The 428 CI engine was disassembled and blueprinted to produce more than the advertised factory 390 horsepower and easily spinning to 5700 RPM. ''Car and Driver'' road-tested the 428 CI powered car with the Turbo-Hydramatic transmission and 3.55 gears. It could do 0–60 MPH in 5.2 seconds, 0–100 in 12.9 seconds, and the 1/4 mile in 13.8 seconds at 104&amp;nbsp;mph. This compared to a '' Car Life'' road test of a 400 CI powered GTO with a Ram Air engine, four-speed transmission, and 3.90 gear which did 0–60 in 6.6 seconds, 0–100 in 14.6 seconds, and the 1/4 mile in 14.53 at 99.7&amp;nbsp;mph. ''Car and Driver'' wrote that the 428 CI powered car was "a fine, exciting car for either touring or tooting around in traffic. Not overly fussy. Not difficult to drive–-up to a point. Too much throttle at the wrong time will spin the car, or send it rocketing off the road and into the farmer's field. You can light up the car's tires like it was an AA-fueler anytime the notion seizes your fancy." On the other hand, according to ''Car Life'', the Ram Air powered car "likes to run between 3,000 and 6,000 RPM. Below 3,000, the GTO ran flat and a bit rough. Part-throttle driving at 2,000 RPM around town was difficult and unpleasant. Freeway cruising at 4,000 RPM is anything but pleasant and promises short life for hard-working engine components. Also, driving the GTO on wet roads with this deep geared axle was thrilling. Rear tire breakaway could be provoked by a slight jab at the accelerator, sending the car into a minor skid that usually used up more than one lane of space."

Like all 1968 passenger vehicles sold in the United States, GTOs now featured front outboard shoulder belts (cars built after January 1, 1968) and side marker lights. To comply with the new 1968 federal vehicle emissions standards, the GTO was now equipped with emissions controls.

Now facing competition both within GM and from [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Dodge]], and [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]]—particularly the low-cost [[Plymouth Road Runner]]—the GTO won the ''Motor Trend'' [[Motor Trend Car of the Year|Car of the Year Award]]. Sales reached 87,684 units, which would ultimately prove to be the second-best sales year for the GTO.

===1969===
[[File:1969 Pontiac GTO (9674948817).jpg|thumb|1969 Pontiac GTO]]
The 1969 model eliminated the front door vent windows, had a slight grille and taillight revision, moved the ignition key from the dashboard to the steering column (which locked the steering wheel when the key was removed, a federal requirement installed one year ahead of schedule), and the gauge face was changed from steel blue to black. In addition, the rear quarter-panel mounted side marker lamps changed from a red lens shaped like the Pontiac "arrowhead" emblem to one shaped like the broad GTO badge. Front outboard headrests were made standard equipment on all cars built for 1969.

The previous economy engine and standard 350&amp;nbsp;hp {{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine remained, while the {{convert|360|hp|abbr=on}} 400HO was upgraded to the Ram Air III, rated at {{convert|366|hp|abbr=on}} at 5,100&amp;nbsp;rpm. The top option was the [[Ram-air intake|Ram Air]] IV rated at {{convert|370|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,500 rpm and {{convert|445|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3,900 rpm of torque,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://musclecars.howstuffworks.com/classic-muscle-cars/1969-pontiac-gto-judge.htm|website=howstuffworks.com|title=1969 Pontiac GTO Judge:A profile of a Muscle car|accessdate=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which featured special header-like high-flow [[exhaust manifold]]s, high-flow [[cylinder head]]s, a specific high-rise aluminum [[intake manifold]], larger [[Rochester Products Division|Rochester]] [[Quadrajet]] 4-barrel [[carburetor]], high-lift/long-duration [[camshaft]], plus various internal components capable of withstanding higher engine speeds and power output. Unlike the highest RPM [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine|Chevy big-block]] and [[Chrysler Hemi engine|Hemi]] engines, the Ram Air IV utilized [[hydraulic lifters]].

By this time, the gross power ratings of both Ram Air engines were highly suspect, bearing less relationship to developed power and more to an internal GM policy limiting all cars except the Corvette to no more than one advertised horsepower per {{convert|10|lb|abbr=on}} of curb weight. The higher-revving Ram Air IV's advertised power peak was actually listed at 5,000&amp;nbsp;rpm—100&amp;nbsp;rpm lower than the less-powerful Ram Air III.

A new model called "The Judge" was introduced. The name came from a comedy routine, "Here Come de Judge", used repeatedly on the ''Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In'' TV show. The Judge routine, made popular by comedian [[Flip Wilson]], was borrowed from the act of long-time burlesque entertainer Dewey "Pigmeat" Markham. Advertisements used slogans like "All rise for the Judge" and "The Judge can be bought". As originally conceived, the Judge was to be a low-cost GTO, stripped of features to make it competitive with the [[Plymouth Road Runner]]. The package was [[United States dollar|US$]]332&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autotraderclassics.com/car-article/1969+Pontiac+GTO+Judge-66818.xhtml |title=1969 GTO Judge Buyer's Guide |publisher=Autotraderclassics.com |first=Joe |last=Babiasz |accessdate=11 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128112742/http://www.autotraderclassics.com/car-article/1969+Pontiac+GTO+Judge-66818.xhtml |archivedate=January 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; more expensive than a standard GTO, and included the Ram Air III engine, Rally II wheels without trim rings, Hurst shifter (with a unique T-shaped handle), wider tires, various decals, and a rear spoiler. Pontiac claimed that the spoiler had some functional effect at higher speeds, producing a small but measurable [[downforce]], but it was of little value at legal speeds. The Judge was initially offered only in Carousel Red, but midway into the model year, a variety of other colors became available.

The GTO was surpassed in sales both by the [[Chevrolet Chevelle]] SS396 and the [[Plymouth Road Runner]], but 72,287 were sold during the 1969 model year, with 6,833 of them getting the Judge package.

A [[Paint sheen|matte]] black car played a role in the action movie [[The Punisher (2004 film)|''The Punisher'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===1970===
[[File:1970 Pontiac GTO The Judge (27220110376).jpg|right|thumb|1970 Pontiac GTO "Judge"]]
The Tempest model line received another facelift for the 1970 model year. Hidden headlights were deleted in favor of four exposed round headlamps outboard of narrower grille openings. The nose retained the protruding vertical prow theme, although it was less prominent. While the standard Tempest and LeMans had chrome grilles, the GTO retained the Endura urethane cover around the headlamps and grille.

The suspension was upgraded with the addition of a rear anti-roll bar, essentially the same bar as used on the [[Oldsmobile 442]] and [[Buick Gran Sport]]. The front anti-roll bar was slightly stiffer. The result was a useful reduction in body lean in turns and a modest reduction of [[Understeer and oversteer|understeer]].

Another handling-related improvement was optional variable-ratio [[power steering]]. Rather than a fixed ratio of 17.5:1, requiring four turns lock-to-lock, the new system varied its ratio from 14.6:1 to 18.9:1, needing 3.5 turns lock-to-lock. Turning diameter was reduced from 40.9&amp;nbsp;feet (12.5&amp;nbsp;m) to 37.4&amp;nbsp;feet (11.4&amp;nbsp;m).

[[File:2018 Draggin' Main Car Show &amp; Cruise 06 (1970 Pontiac GTO engine).jpg|thumb|1970 Pontiac GTO engine]]
The base engine was unchanged for 1970, but the low-compression economy engine was deleted and the Ram Air III and Ram Air IV remained available, although the latter was now a special-order option.

A new option was Pontiac's 455 HO engine (different from the round-port offerings of the 1971–72 cars), available now that GM had rescinded its earlier ban on intermediates with engines larger than 400 HO. The 455, a long-stroke engine also available in the full-size Pontiac line as well as the Grand Prix, was dubiously rated by Pontiac as only moderately stronger than the base 350 HP 400 CID and less powerful than the {{convert|366|hp|abbr=on}} Ram Air III. The Pontiac brochure indicated the same 455 installed in the Grand Prix model was rated at {{convert|370|hp}}. The camshafts used in the Ram Air III and the GTO 455 HO were the same. For example, the manual transmission 455 HO's used the same 288/302 duration cam as the Ram Air III. The 455 was rated at {{convert|360|hp|abbr=on}} at 4,300&amp;nbsp;rpm. Its advantage was torque: {{convert|500|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 2,700&amp;nbsp;rpm. A functional Ram Air scoop was available. ''Car and Driver'' tested a heavily optioned 455, with a four-speed transmission and 3.31 axle and recorded a quarter mile time of 15.0&amp;nbsp;seconds with a trap speed of {{convert|96.5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} . ''Car Life'' test car had the Turbo-Hydramatic 455 with a 3.55 rear differential, clocked 14.76&amp;nbsp;seconds quarter mile time at {{convert|95.94|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, with an identical 6.6&amp;nbsp;second 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph acceleration time. Both were about {{convert|3|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} slower than a Ram Air III 400 four-speed, although considerably less temperamental: the Ram Air engine idled roughly and was difficult to drive at low speeds. The smaller displacement engine recorded less than {{convert|9|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} of gasoline, compared to {{convert|10|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}}-{{convert|11|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} for the 455.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

A new and short-lived option for 1970 was the vacuum operated exhaust (VOE), which was vacuum actuated via an underdash lever marked "exhaust". The VOE was designed to reduce exhaust backpressure and to increase power and performance, but it also substantially increased exhaust noise. The VOE option was offered from November 1969 to January 1970. Pontiac management was ordered to cancel the VOE option by GM's upper management following a TV commercial for the GTO that aired during [[Super Bowl IV]] on [[CBS]] January 11, 1970.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} In that commercial, entitled the "Humbler", which was broadcast only that one time, a young man pulled up in a new GTO to a drive-in restaurant with dramatic music and exhaust noise in the background, pulling the "exhaust" knob to activate the VOE and then left the drive-in after failing to find a street racing opponent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} That particular commercial was also canceled by order of GM management.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Approximately 233 1970 GTOs were factory built with this option including 212 hardtop coupes and 21 convertibles, all were "YS" 400ci 350&amp;nbsp;hp with either four-speed manual or Turbo Hydra-matic transmissions. This particular GTO in the commercial was "Palladium" silver with a black bucket interior. It was unusual in several respects as it also had the under-dash "Ram Air" knob just to the right of the VOE knob, and it sported "'69 Judge" stripes, as a few very-early '70 GTOs could be ordered with. It also had a Turbo Hydra-matic transmission, remote mirror, Rally II wheels, A/C, hood tachometer, and a new-for-1970 Formula steering wheel.

The Judge remained available as an option on 
the GTO. The Judge came standard with the Ram Air III, while the Ram Air IV was optional. Though the 455&amp;nbsp;CID was available as an option on the standard GTO throughout the entire model year, the 455 was not offered on the Judge until late in the year. Orbit Orange (actually a bright canary yellow) became the new feature color for the 1970 Judge, but any GTO color was available. Striping was relocated to the upper wheelwell brows.

The new styling did little to help declining sales, which were now being hit by sagging buyer interest in all muscle cars, fueled by the punitive surcharges levied by [[Vehicle insurance|automobile insurance]] companies, which sometimes resulted in insurance payments higher than car payments for some drivers. Sales were down to 40,149, of which 3,797 were the Judge. Of those 3,797 cars built in the Judge trim level, only 168 were ordered in the convertible form: RA III, RA IV and 455HO. The general consensus is that six of the 168 built were ordered with the 1970-only D-Port 455HO {{convert|360|hp|abbr=on}} engine, a no-cost option, which explains the conflicting production figures over the years as to how many were built; 162 versus 168. The '69/'70 "round-port" RA IV engine, a derivative of the '68½ "round-port" RA II engine, was the most exotic high-performance engine ever offered by PMD and factory-installed in a GTO or Firebird. The 1969 version had a slight advantage as the compression ratio was still at 10.75:1 as opposed to 10.5:1 in 1970. It is speculated that PMD was losing $1,000 on every RA IV GTO and Firebird built, and the RA IV engine was under-rated at {{convert|370|hp|abbr=on}}. A total of 37 RA IV GTO convertibles were built-in 1970: 24 four-speeds and 13 automatics. Of the 13 1970 GTO RA IV/auto convertibles built only six received the Judge option. The GTO remained the third best-selling intermediate muscle car, outsold only by the Chevrolet Chevelle SS 396/454 and the Plymouth Road Runner.

===1971===
[[File:1971 Pontiac GTO (27782184705).jpg|thumb|right|1971 Pontiac GTO front]]
[[File:1971 Pontiac GTO Endura Bumper.JPG|thumb|right|1971 Pontiac GTO Endura bumper]]
[[File:1971 Pontiac GTO Rear.JPG|thumb|right|1971 Pontiac GTO rear]]

The 1971 GTO had another modest facelift, this time with wire-mesh grilles, horizontal bumper bars on either side of the grille opening, more closely spaced headlamps, and a new hood with the dual scoops relocated to the leading edge, not far above the grille. Overall length grew slightly to {{convert|203.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Sport mirrors increased standard width two inches, from 74.5 to 76.5 inches.

A new corporate edict, aimed at preparing GM for [[tetraethyllead|no-lead gasoline]], forced an across-the-board reduction in compression ratios. The Ram Air engines did not return for 1971. The standard GTO engine was still the 400&amp;nbsp;CID V8, but now with 8.2:1 compression ratio. Power was rated at {{convert|300|hp|abbr=on}} SAE gross at 4,800&amp;nbsp;rpm and torque at {{convert|400|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3,600&amp;nbsp;rpm. It had {{convert|255|hp|abbr=on}} SAE net at 4,400 rpm in the GTO and {{convert|250|hp|abbr=on}} SAE net at 4,400 rpm in the Firebird.

An engine option was the 455&amp;nbsp;CID V8 with four-barrel carburetor, 8.4:1 compression ratio and 325&amp;nbsp;hp (242&amp;nbsp;kW) at 4,400 rpm, which was only available with the Turbo Hydra-matic TH-400 transmission. It had {{convert|260|hp|abbr=on}} SAE net at 4,000 rpm in the GTO and {{convert|255|hp|abbr=on}} SAE net in the Firebird. This engine was not available with Ram Air induction.

The top-of-the-line GTO engine for 1971 was the new 455 HO with 8.4 compression, rated at {{convert|335|hp|abbr=on}} at 4,800&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|480|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3,600&amp;nbsp;rpm. It had {{convert|310|hp|abbr=on}} SAE net at 4,400 rpm in the GTO and {{convert|305|hp|abbr=on}} SAE net in the Firebird Trans Am or Formula 455 with Ram Air induction(Formula; shaker hood inlet on Trans Am). The 1971 Pontiac brochure declared that this engine produced more NET horsepower than any other engine in its history. That would imply the 400 CID V8 Ram Air engines had less than 310&amp;nbsp;hp net.

For 1971, the standard rear-end was an open 10 bolt. Positraction 10 bolt rear ends were available as an option on 400 CI engine equipped GTO's, while all 455 CI GTO's were available with a 12 bolt open or optional 12 bolt Positraction rear-end.

''Motor Trend'' tested a 1971 GTO with the 455, four-speed transmission, and 3.90 axle, and obtained a 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph acceleration time of 6.1&amp;nbsp;seconds and a quarter mile acceleration time of 13.4&amp;nbsp;seconds at 102&amp;nbsp;mph (164&amp;nbsp;km/h).

[[File:Western Bays Street Rodder Hot Rod Show - Flickr - 111 Emergency (18).jpg|thumb|1971 Pontiac GTO, The Judge]]
The Judge returned for a final year, With the standard equipment being the Mountain Performance package was the 455 HO. Only 357 were sold, including 17 convertibles, before The Judge was discontinued in February 1971. Only 10,532 GTOs were sold in 1971, 661 of which were non-Judge equipped convertibles.

===1972===
In 1972, the GTO reverted from a separate model to a US$353.88 option package for the LeMans and LeMans Sport coupes. On the base LeMans line, the GTO package could be had with either the low-priced pillared coupé or hardtop coupé. Both models came standard with cloth and vinyl or all-vinyl [[bench seat]]s and rubber floor mats on the pillared coupe and carpeting on the hardtop, creating a lower-priced GTO. The LeMans Sport, offered only as a hardtop coupe, came with Strato bucket seats upholstered in vinyl, along with carpeting on the floor and lower door panels, vinyl door-pull straps, custom pedal trim and cushioned steering wheel, much like GTOs of previous years. Other optional equipment was similar to 1971 and earlier models. Planned for 1972 as a GTO option was the ducktail rear spoiler from the [[Pontiac Firebird]], but after a few cars were built with that option, the mold used to produce the spoiler broke, and it was canceled. Rally II and honeycomb wheels were optional on all GTOs, with the honeycomb wheels now featuring red Pontiac arrowhead emblems on the center caps, while the Rally II wheels continued with the same caps as before, with the letters "PMD" (for Pontiac Motor Division).

Power, now rated in SAE net hp terms, was down further, to {{convert|250|hp|abbr=on}} at 4,400&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|325|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3,200&amp;nbsp;rpm torque for the base 400 engine. The optional 455 had the same rated power (although at a peak of 3,600&amp;nbsp;rpm), but substantially more torque. Most of the drop was attributable to the new rating system (which now reflected an engine in as-installed condition with mufflers, accessories, and standard intake). The engines were relatively little changed from 1971.

Optional was the 455 HO engine, essentially similar to that used in the Trans Am. It was rated at {{convert|300|hp|abbr=on}} at 4,000&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|415|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3,200&amp;nbsp;rpm, also in the new SAE net figures. Despite its modest 8.4:1 compression, it was as strong as many earlier engines with higher gross power ratings; yet like all other 1972-model engines, it could perform on low-octane regular leaded, low-lead or unleaded types of gasoline. Only 646 cars with this engine were sold.

Sales plummeted by 45%, to 5,811. (Some sources discount the single convertible and the three anomalous wagons, listing the total as 5,807.) Although Pontiac did not offer a production GTO convertible in 1972, a buyer could order a LeMans Sport convertible with either of the three GTO engines and other sporty/performance options to create a GTO in all but name. Even the GTO's Endura bumper was offered as an option on LeMans/Sport models, with "PONTIAC" spelled out on the driver's side grille rather than "GTO."

===1973===
The GTO was an option package for the LeMans and featured a reskinned A-body with "Colonnade" hardtop styling, which eliminated the true hardtop design because of the addition of a roof pillar but retained of the frameless door windows. Rear side windows were now of a fixed design that could not be opened and in a triangular shape. New federal laws for 1973 demanded front bumpers capable of withstanding 5-mile-per-hour (8&amp;nbsp;km/h)impacts with no damage to the body (5&amp;nbsp;mph rear bumpers became standard in 1974). The result was the use of prominent and heavy chrome bumpers at the front and rear. The overall styling of the 1973 Pontiac A-body intermediates (LeMans, Luxury LeMans, GTO and [[Pontiac Grand Am|Grand Am]]) was generally not well received by the general public.

In contrast, the [[Pontiac Grand Prix]] and [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]], which were also derived from the intermediate A-body, were much better received because of their squared-off styling and formal rooflines with vertical windows. Pontiac's sister division, [[Oldsmobile]], received better reviews from the automotive press and the car-buying public with the similar-bodied [[Oldsmobile Cutlass|Cutlass]].

Again, the 1973 GTO option was offered on two models including the base LeMans coupe or the LeMans Sport Coupe. The base LeMans coupe featured a cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl bench seat while the more lavish LeMans Sport Coupe had all-vinyl interiors with Strato bucket seats or a notchback bench seat with folding armrest. The LeMans Sport Coupe also had louvered rear side windows from the Grand Am in place of the standard triangular windows of the base LeMans.

The standard 400&amp;nbsp;CID V8 in the 1973 GTO was further reduced in compression to 8.0:1, dropping it to 230&amp;nbsp;hp (170&amp;nbsp;kW). The 400 engine was available with any of the three transmissions including the standard three-speed manual, or optional four-speed or Turbo Hydra-Matic. The 455&amp;nbsp;CID V8 remained optional but was dropped to 250&amp;nbsp;hp (186&amp;nbsp;kW) and available only with the Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission. The 455 HO engine did not reappear, but GM initially announced the availability of a Super Duty 455 engine (shared with the contemporary Pontiac Trans Am SD455), and several such cars were made available for testing, impressing reviewers with their power and flexibility. Nevertheless, the Super Duty was never actually offered for public sale in the GTO. Also, eight 455SD Grand Ams were also built for testing and eventually all were destroyed as well.

Sales dropped to 4,806, due in part to competition from the new Grand Am and the lack of promotion for the GTO. By the end of the model year, an emerging [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] quashed consumer interest in muscle cars.

===1974===
Wanting to avoid internal competition with the "Euro-styled" [[Pontiac Grand Am]], and looking for an entry into the compact muscle market populated by the [[Plymouth Duster|Plymouth Duster 360]], [[Ford Maverick (Americas)|Ford Maverick Grabber]], and [[AMC Hornet|AMC Hornet X]], Pontiac moved the 1974 GTO option to the compact [[Pontiac Ventura]], which shared its basic body shell and sheetmetal with the [[Chevrolet Chevy II / Nova|Chevrolet Nova]].

The US$461 GTO package (Code WW3) included a three-speed manual transmission with Hurst floor shifter, heavy-duty suspension with front and rear [[Sway bar|anti-roll bar]]s, a [[Shaker scoop|shaker hood]], special grille, wing mirrors, and wheels, and various GTO emblems. The only engine was the {{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with a 7.6:1 compression ratio and a Rochester 4MC Quadrajet carburetor. It  generated a maximum power output of {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on}} at 4,400&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|295|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 2,800&amp;nbsp;rpm. Optional transmissions included a wide-ratio four-speed with Hurst shifter for US$207 (Code M20) or the three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic. Power Steering was a US$104 option (Code N41) as well as Power front disc brakes for US$71 (Code JL2).

The GTO option was available in both the base Ventura and Ventura Custom lines as either a two-door coupé or a [[hatchback]] [[coupé]]. The base Ventura interior consisted of bench seats and rubber floor mats, Bucket seats could be added for $132 (Code A51), while the Ventura Custom had upgraded bench seats or optional Strato bucket seats along with carpeting, cushioned steering wheel, and custom pedal trim.

Bias-belted tires were standard equipment, but a radial tuned suspension option added radial tires along with upgraded suspension tuning for improved ride and handling.

The revamped model quickly became a sore spot for loyalists, a situation not helped when Motor Trend tested the "Hot Sports Compacts" in their February 1974 issue—the staff could only muster a 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph acceleration time of 9.5 seconds and a quarter-mile trap time of 16.5 seconds (at a leisurely 84.03&amp;nbsp;mph). ''Cars Magazine'' tested a 1974 GTO with the optional four-speed manual transmission and obtained a 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph acceleration time of 7.7&amp;nbsp;seconds and a quarter mile time of 15.72&amp;nbsp;seconds at {{convert|88|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Jerry Heasley of ''High Performance Pontiac'' magazine called the car "a joke of a Ventura compact...uglier and stupid looking," in their August 1983 Special GTO issue.

Sales were an improvement over 1973, at 7,058, but not enough to justify continuing production of the model.

==1999 concept car==
During the 1999 [[North American International Auto Show|Detroit Auto Show]], a GTO [[concept car]] with a heritage-inspired "Coke-bottle" shape, grille, and hood scoop, was introduced to the world. It was only intended to be a design study and had no engine. It had styling cues paying homage to all the generation of the Pontiac GTOs such as rear quarter windows reminiscent of the 1967 Pontiac GTO, hood mounted tachometer pod, split grilles, tapered tail lights, twin hood Scoops and unique 21-inch wheels.

===2004===
In 2004, the Pontiac GTO was relaunched in the U.S. market in the form of a [[Rebadging|rebadged]], third-generation [[Holden Monaro]].

The VZ Monaro-based GTO was Pontiac's first [[captive import]] since the 1988–1993 [[Pontiac LeMans#1988–1993|Pontiac LeMans]]. The [[Holden Monaro CV8|V2/VZ Monaro]] was a 2-door coupe variant of the [[Australia]]n developed [[Holden VT Commodore|VT/VX Holden Commodore]]. The Commodore had, in turn, been developed by enlarging the [[Europe]]an designed 1994 [[Opel Omega B]], which was marketed in its original form in the U.S. from 1997 to 2001 as the [[Cadillac Catera]]. The Monaro was also exported to the [[United Kingdom]] as the [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] Monaro and to the [[Middle East]] as the [[Chevrolet Lumina]] SS.

The revival was prompted by former GM North America Chairman [[Bob Lutz (businessman)|Bob Lutz]], who had the idea of importing a Holden Commodore-based vehicle after reading a ''Car and Driver'' review of the Holden Commodore SS, published circa 2000. ''Car and Driver'' praised the performance of the V8 powered, rear-wheel drive Holden Commodore SS, but noted that even though it was one of the best vehicles that GM offered at the time, it could not be purchased in the United States. The idea of importing a rear-wheel drive Holden as a GM North American performance offering gradually transformed into importing the Monaro. Lutz, as well as other GM executives, later drove a Holden Monaro while on a business trip in Australia, which convinced them that importing the car could be a profitable venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lutz |first=Bob |year=2011 |title=Car Guys vs. Bean Counters |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781591844006/page/134 134, 135] |publisher=Portfolio/Penguin |isbn=978-1-59184-400-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781591844006/page/134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lutz had to convince GM executive hierarchy to import the car, and overcome a corporate culture that promoted regional autonomy between GM North America and its overseas divisions. This resulted in an "unnecessarily long gestation period," as Lutz put it, and at a much higher cost than anticipated. The Monaro design was introduced in 2001, but appeared "dated" in 2004 when it was released in the United States. It was also originally planned to sell for about $25,000, but by the time it was launched in the U.S., the Australian dollar's growth against the U.S. dollar had inflated the price of the car to well over $34,000. Both of these elements played a role in the car's lukewarm acceptance by the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Lutz, pp. 135, 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

The GTO was assembled by GM's [[Holden]] subsidiary at [[Elizabeth, South Australia|Elizabeth]]. It was equipped with the 5.7 liter [[GM LS engine|LS1]] V8 engine for the 2004 model year, the same engine found in the concurrent model year Chevrolet Corvette, with a choice of a 6-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic. Changes from the Australian-built Monaro included bracing additions to the body to meet U.S. crash standards, a "corporate Pontiac" front facia, new badging, "GTO" stitching on the front seats, and a revised exhaust system. GM Engineers benchmarked the sound of the 1964 GTO held in the Pontiac historical collection, as well as other LS1-powered vehicles, while working with the exhaust vendor to tune the system. The effort was made to make the new GTO invoke the same sound as the original while still meeting the noise threshold required by some states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=2004 GTO Press Releases |publisher=General Motors |year=2004 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2004 GTO exhaust was a true dual system that followed the original Monaro exhaust routing, thus both tailpipes exited on the driver side of the vehicle. General Motors claimed performance of 0&amp;ndash;60&amp;nbsp;mph in 5.3 seconds and a 13.8 second quarter mile time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=2004 GTO Press Releases |publisher=General Motors |year=2004 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was closely verified by several automotive magazine tests.

Initially in 2004, the car was offered in seven colors: Barbados Blue Metallic, Cosmos Purple Metallic, Quicksilver Metallic, Phantom Black Metallic, Impulse Blue Metallic, Torrid Red, and Yellow Jacket.

[[File:2004 Pontiac GTO 2 -- 02-26-2010.jpg|thumb|2004 Pontiac GTO]]

GM had high expectations to sell 18,000 units, but the Monaro-based GTO received a lukewarm reception in the U.S. The styling was frequently derided by critics as being too "conservative" and "anonymous" to befit either the GTO heritage or the current car's performance. Given the newly revived [[muscle car]] climate, it was also overshadowed by the [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]], [[Chrysler 300]], [[Dodge Charger]], [[Dodge Magnum]], and the new [[Ford Mustang]], all of whom featured more traditional "muscle car" aesthetics. Critics also pointed out the car's high sale price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.edmunds.com/pontiac/gto/ |title=Pontiac GTO Review |publisher=Edmunds |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales were also limited because of tactics of [[Car dealership|dealerships]], such as initially charging large markups and denying requests for test drives of the vehicle. By the end of the year, the 2004 models were selling with significant discounts. Sales were 13,569 cars in total of the 15,728 imported cars for 2004.

The hood scoops that originally were slated for production in 2005 were pushed into production as part of an over-the-counter Sport Appearance Package. The 2004 Sport Appearance Package also included a taller and more angular rear spoiler, as well as deeper inset front grilles.

Closing out the 2004 model year was the W40 package featuring an exclusive paint color called Pulse Red, red “GTO” embroidery on black-anthracite seats, and a grey colored gauge cluster. The last 794 units of the 2004 model year GTOs were equipped with the W40 package.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lsxmag.com/news/what40-the-secret-40th-anniversary-edition-2004-pontiac-gto/&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005===
[[File:05 Pontiac GTO (6199613782).jpg|thumb|2005 Pontiac GTO]]
[[File:05 Pontiac GTO (6199611690).jpg|thumb|2005 Pontiac GTO (rear view)]]
The 2005 model year continued with the standard hood scoops, split rear exhaust pipes with a revised rear fascia, and late in the year, optional 18&amp;nbsp;inch (45.7&amp;nbsp;cm) wheels. The major change for 2005 was the replacement of the [[GM LS engine#5.7 L|LS1 engine]] with the [[GM LS engine#6.0 L 2|LS2 engine]]. This {{convert|5967|cc|abbr=on}} engine had increased power and torque of {{convert|400|hp|abbr=on}} with {{convert|400|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} respectively. Other changes included larger front rotors and caliper hardware from the Corvette, strengthened drivetrain with the addition of a driveshaft with larger "[[giubo]]s" and a larger differential flange, as well as revised half-shafts. Dashboard gauge graphics were revised. The optional dealer-installed Sport Appearance Package became available and differed visually by having a different lower rear fascia, aftermarket mufflers with quad chrome exhaust tips, revised spoiler and front lower fascia extension, recessed grilles, and revised rocker panels. This package was available from GM as an accessory in red, silver, black, or primer for other color cars. Production amounted to 11,069 cars due in part to a shortened model year. Barbados Blue and Cosmos Purple were dropped for the year, but Cyclone Grey and Midnight Blue Metallic were added. Customers also had the option to order their GTO without hood scoops (RPO code BZJ), though only 24 cars were produced with such an option. With an improved powerplant, GM claimed the car to be capable of accelerating from 0 to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 4.7&amp;nbsp;seconds and a 13.0&amp;nbsp;second quarter mile time&lt;ref&gt;''2005 Pontiac GTO Sales Brochure.'' GM, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; at {{convert|105|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} (automatic transmission). ''Car and Driver'' magazine tested the car and measured the 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph acceleration time of 4.8 seconds and a quarter mile time of 13.3&amp;nbsp;seconds at {{convert|107|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} with its BFGoodrich g-Force T/A KDWS, 245/45ZR-17 95W M+S front and rear tires and a manual transmission. The 0–100&amp;nbsp;mph and 0–130&amp;nbsp;mph times were 11.7 and 19.6 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Quiroga |first=Tony |title=2005 Pontiac GTO v 2005 Ford Mustang GT – Comparison Tests |journal=Car and Driver |date=January 2005 |url= http://media.caranddriver.com/files/2005-pontiac-gto-vs-2005-ford-mustang-gt21st-century-muscle-powertrain.pdf |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006===
[[File:2006-Pontiac-GTO.jpg|thumb|2006 Pontiac GTO]]
For 2006, two additional colors were added, Spice Red Metallic and Brazen Orange Metallic, while Midnight Blue Metallic and Yellow Jacket were dropped. Changes for 2006 included revised blacked-out tail lamps, illuminated steering wheel radio controls, faster moving power seat motors, and an interior power door lock switch. The climate control button for the A/C also had the word "Defog", a carryover from the 2005 model year, along with the {{convert|400|hp|abbr=on}}, 6.0&amp;nbsp;L engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=41eBeJF1mQgC&amp;pg=PA327&amp;dq=2006+GTO+horsepower |title=GTO : Pontiac's Great One |first=Darwin |last=Holmstrom |first2=David |last2=Newhardt |publisher=Motorbooks International |year=2011 |isbn= 978-0-7603-3985-5 |page=327 |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 21, 2006, Buick-Pontiac-GMC General Manager John Larson announced to dealers that GM would halt imports of the GTO in September, making 2006 the last model year for the new GTO. The explanation was the inability to meet new airbag deployment standards for 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keefe |first=Don |title=Pontiac GTO To Cease Production After 2006 Model Year |journal=High Performance Pontiac |date=February 2006 |url= http://www.highperformancepontiac.com/hotnews/hppp_0602_gto_production_ends/index.html |accessdate=11 September 2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The final production numbers of the 2006 Pontiac GTO amounted to 13,948 cars, an increase from 11,069 cars from the previous model year.

The last Pontiac GTO, which was also the very last Monaro-based coupe produced, came off the assembly line in Australia on June 14, 2006.&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dowling |first=Joshua |title=The real last Monaro |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=7 July 2006 |url=http://news.drive.com.au/drive/motor-news/the-real-last-monaro-20060707-13yjy.html |accessdate=11 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220141030/http://news.drive.com.au/drive/motor-news/the-real-last-monaro-20060707-13yjy.html |archivedate=December 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Total production for all three years amounted to 40,808 vehicles.&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt; The fifth generation of the GTO was only intended as a limited production car for those 3 years from the beginning of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson |first=Aaron |title=Lusty Performance Disguised in a Phone Company Fleet Car |journal=Car and Driver |date=December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pontiac LeMans''' {{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|m|ɑː|n|z}} was a model name that was applied to [[subcompact car|subcompact-]] and [[mid-size car|intermediate-sized]] [[automobile]]s marketed by [[Pontiac]] from 1962 to 1981 (1983 in [[Canada]]). Originally a trim upgrade based on the [[Pontiac Tempest|Tempest]], it spawned the industry changing signature muscle car, the [[Pontiac GTO|GTO]], in 1964.  Manufactured in five generations in the 1960s and '70s, it was replaced by the downsized [[Pontiac Bonneville]] for the 1982 model year.  From 1988 to 1993 the name was resurrected for a [[badge-engineered]] version of the [[Daewoo LeMans]] manufactured by [[Daewoo Motors|Daewoo]] in [[South Korea]].

===1961===
The LeMans was introduced as the top-of-the-line version of the compact-sized [[Pontiac Tempest]] toward the end of the 1961 [[model year]] on GM's new [[GM Y platform|Y body platform]]. The Tempest LeMans was a trim package featuring sportier and more luxurious trim than the Tempest, including different badging and bucket seats. The trim option was available only on the two-door sedan (pillared coupe) body style. 

===1962===
For the 1962 model year, the LeMans was still a trim package, but now also available in the convertible body style, as well as with the [[Inline-four engine|I4]] 4-bbl carbureted engine. There was also no pillarless [[hardtop]] body style available in either the Tempest and LeMans versions. 

===1963=== 
For 1963, the LeMans name was still used only on two-door coupes and convertibles, but now was designated as a separate model in the Pontiac compact car lineup. This would last for just one year. Optional was a high-performance "326 CID V8" engine (actually displacing {{convert|336|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} during the 1963 model year).

===1964===
[[File:1964 Pontiac LeMans Convertible (18846029440).jpg|thumb|left|1964 LeMans Convertible]]
The Tempest line was changed to an intermediate-sized car on the new [[GM A platform (RWD)|GM A platform]] in 1964. The LeMans returned to its role of Tempest trim upgrade, which included carpeted lower door panels, deluxe steering wheels, courtesy lighting, and full [[Hubcap|wheel covers]]. For 1964, a two-door [[hardtop]] was added. A new {{convert|215|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} I6 was introduced, as well as a redesigned {{convert|326|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 that now actually displaced 326 CID. 

Shortly after the start of the 1964 model year, the LeMans became available with a new [[performance package]] designated as the [[Pontiac GTO|GTO]], or 'Gran Turismo Omologato'. The GTO option included a {{convert|389|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 from the full-sized Pontiac line that produced 325 HP with a four-barrel carburetor or 348 HP in [[Tri-Power]]] version featuring three two-barrels.

===1965===
The LeMans line was expanded to include a four-door sedan for the 1965 model year.

Horsepower ratings for the GTO version were increased to 335HP 4bbl and 360 Hp Tri power&amp;nbsp;hp, a four-speed floor shift Muncie [[manual transmission]] with [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] shifter, heavy-duty suspension, red-line Tiger Paw tires. With the Introduction of the Tempest in 1961, Pontiac achieved the number three in sales{{clarify|In what category?  Total US auto market?  Compacts?  Intermediates?  When?  1961?  By 1963?  Average of '61-'63?  Cumulative sales during that period?|date=March 2019}} and something it would hold onto through the decade of the Sixties. The success and the aggressive image of the GTO also spilled over and helped increase the image and sales of the entire Pontiac line.

===1966===
[[File:1966 Pontiac LeMans (4815900877).jpg|thumb|left|1966 Pontiac LeMans four-door hardtop]]
The pillared 4-door sedan was replaced by a four-door [[hardtop]] body style for the 1966 model year.
 
The GTO became a separate model of its own for 1966, though retaining the same basic body as the [[Pontiac Tempest|Tempest]] and LeMans models. For 1966, all Pontiac intermediates got new styling featuring tunnelback rooflines on two-door hardtop and pillared coupes. While the GTO continued as a big-engined muscle car, the Tempest and LeMans models got a new [[SOHC]] {{convert|230|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} I6 as the base engine. This engine, as well as the early Tempest with the transaxle in the rear, were ideas of Pontiac's Chief Engineer [[John DeLorean]] (who became Pontiac's general manager at the end of the 1965 model year). This engine was available in an economical one-barrel carbureted, 165&amp;nbsp;hp version as standard equipment on all Pontiac intermediates except GTOs. Optional on all Tempest and LeMans models except station wagons was a Sprint package that included a four-barrel version of the I6 that also included higher compression ratio and hotter cam, resulting in 207 horsepower, along with an "all-syncro" floor-mounted three-speed transmission with Hurst shifter, suspension kit, and body striping. Optional were a two-barrel 326&amp;nbsp;CID V8 rated at 250&amp;nbsp;hp or a 285&amp;nbsp;hp four-barrel 326 HO [[V8 engine|V8]] with higher compression ratio and dual exhausts.

The Sprint-optioned Tempest and LeMans models were not popular during the mid-to-late 1960s, being outsold by the bigger-engined GTO. The Sprint option and [[SOHC]] [[Straight-six engine|six-cylinder]] engine were discontinued after 1969, and replaced with a Chevrolet-built 250&amp;nbsp;CID [[Overhead valve|OHV]] six-cylinder engine, becoming the base engine from 1970 to 1976 in most Pontiac intermediates.

The four-door Safari [[station wagon]] became available for the 1968 model year in the Tempest line. A new engine replaced the 326. This new engine was based on all existing Pontiac engine architecture and using the 326, 389, and 400 engines crank at 3.75" and expanding the 326's 3.72" bore to 3.88" to give 353.84 cubic inches. It was marketed by Pontiac as a 350, just like the original 326 was called rather that its true size of 325.84. For 1968 the 350 could be had in two versions at 265&amp;nbsp;hp 2bbl and 325&amp;nbsp;hp 4bbl. 

In 1969 the engine came as 265&amp;nbsp;hp 2bbl and 330&amp;nbsp;hp 4bbl. The ten horsepower increase over 1968's engine is due to a different cam plus the use of the # 48 big valve heads, the same head used on the Ram air 3 400" {{convert|366|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine and the 428-HO engine at 390&amp;nbsp;hp. 1969 would be the last high performance version of the 350. The Sprint OHC six had gone from its original size of 230 inches to 250 cubic inches, and the horsepower had increased from the original {{convert|207|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|230|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in its final version in 1969.

For 1970, Pontiac reshuffled its intermediate lineup with the Le Mans nameplate downgraded to the mid-line sub-series previously known as the Tempest Custom and included two- and four-door pillared sedans, while the previous top Le Mans series was renamed the Le Mans Sport in the same three body styles including a four-door hardtop [[sedan (car)|sedan]], two-door hardtop [[coupe]] and [[convertible (car)|convertible]]. This year, bigger engines - which had previously reserved for GTOs - were made available on lesser Tempest/Le Mans models including a 400&amp;nbsp;CID V8 rated at {{convert|265|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with a two-barrel carburetor or a {{convert|330|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} option with a four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts. At mid-year the bottom Tempest line, which initially included only two- and four-door sedans, added the T-37 hardtop coupe which was initially described as "General Motors' lowest-priced hardtop (undercut by a base [[Chevrolet Chevelle]] hardtop coupe introduced a few weeks later). Less expensive than the GTO, the T-37 hardtop coupe offered a GT-37 appearance package that included striping, three-speed floor shift transmission, tuned suspension and other trim. The GT-37 was available with any Tempest/Le Mans V8 from the standard 350 two-barrel to the 400 four-barrel. Replacing the Pontiac-built OHC [[Straight-six engine|six-cylinder]] as the base engine for Tempest/Le Mans models for 1970 was Chevrolet's 250 cubic-inch straight-six engine, while the 350 two-barrel was again the base V8 and the four-barrel 350 HO was discontinued.

In 1971, the Tempest nameplate was retired and Pontiac promoted the Le Mans nameplate to full-series status to identify all of its intermediate models, which still included the GTO. At the bottom of the line was the Pontiac T-37, previously known as the Tempest, and now expanded to include two- and four-door sedan along with the original hardtop coupe. The GT-37 option was available on both the two-door sedan (pillared coupe) or hardtop coupe. Engine offerings were carried over from 1970 and Pontiac's 455 cubic-inch V8 (offered only on GTOs in 1970) was now available as an option on all Pontiac intermediates in both base four-barrel with 325 horsepower or the 455 HO option with 335 horsepower. All 1971 engines were detuned with lower compression ratios to run on lower-octane regular leaded, low-lead or unleaded gasoline. Brakes were 9.5" drums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1971%20Pontiac/1971_Pontiac_LeMans_Brochure-Cdn/1971%20Pontiac%20LeMans%20%20Cdn%20-16.html |title=1971 Pontiac LeMans Brochure - Canada |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1972, all Pontiac intermediates were now Le Mans models and the low-priced T-37 line was replaced by a base Le Mans pillared coupe. The top-line intermediate was the Luxury Le Mans, available in hardtop sedan and coupe models, featuring upgraded interiors compared to regular Le Mans models. The Le Mans Sport was available as a two-door hardtop or convertible with Strato bucket seats and interiors from the Luxury Le Mans. The [[Pontiac GTO|GTO]] was changed from a separate series back to an option package on Le Mans and Le Mans Sport coupes. Replacing the previous GT-37 option package for 1972 was the new "Le Mans GT" option, available on Le Mans pillared and hardtop coupes with any V8 ranging from the 350 two-barrel to the 455 HO four-barrel, and also included the same appearance and handling items carried over from the GT-37.

From 1973 to 1977, the Le Mans and other GM intermediates were much larger in size than previous models due to evolutionary changes that resulted in larger cars year after year and federally mandated [[5 mph bumper|5&amp;nbsp;mph crash bumpers]] that added weight and length. During this period, Pontiac's intermediate lineup included the base Le Mans, Le Mans Sport Coupe, [[Pontiac GTO|GTO]] (1973 only), Luxury Le Mans (became the Grand Le Mans in 1975), the Euro-styled [[Pontiac Grand Am|Grand Am]] from 1973 to 1975, and the 1977 [[Pontiac Can Am|Can Am]]. Body styles were all based on GM's Colonnade design for both sedans and coupes (no convertibles or hardtops offered after 1972) that included center pillars for improved rollover safety standards but eliminated true hardtop design, along with frameless windows similar to a hardtop. Two-door coupes featured triangular "fixed" rear side windows that did not open, which were covered with louvers on the Le Mans and GTO sport coupes, and the new Grand Am coupe.

===1973===
The 1973 Le Mans, along with all other GM intermediates, was new from the ground up but retained the same wheelbase lengths of 112 inches for two-door coupes, and 116 inches for four-door sedans and station wagons. All models featured the federally mandated 5-mile-per-hour front bumpers along with single headlights. Handling capabilities were greatly improved on all models due to new front-suspension components shared with the F-body Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro, improved rear-coil suspension and bias-belted tires (except Grand Ams, which got radial tires).
Engine offerings were carried over from 1972 with revisions to meet the 1973 emission requirements. Standard on base Le Mans sedans and coupes was Chevrolet's 250-cubic-inch inline six-cylinder engine, while the Le Mans Sport Coupe, Luxury Le Mans sedans and coupes, and all Safari wagons got Pontiac's 350-cubic-inch V8 with two-barrel carburetor rated at 150 horsepower standard (optional on base Le Mans models). Optionally available on Le Mans, Le Mans Sport and Luxury Le Mans was a 400-cubic-inch V8 with two-barrel carb and 170 horsepower, a 230-horsepower 400 four-barrel (standard with the GTO option) and a 250-horsepower 455 four-barrel was optional on all models. Planned and listed as an option for the 1973 GTO but never materialized was a 455 Super Duty [[V8 engine|V8]] rated at 310 net horsepower for which introduction was delayed by Pontiac management due to emission issues until the spring of 1973 and then only in the smaller Firebird Formula and Trans Am pony cars.
A three-speed automatic transmission was standard on Le Mans and Luxury Le Mans models while the GTO came with a floor-mounted three-speed with [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] shifter. Available at extra cost was the three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic with all engines, while a four-speed manual with [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] shifter was available with the 230-horsepower 400.

[[File:Le Mans Sport Coupe 1973.jpg|left|thumb|1973 Pontiac Le Mans sport coupe]]
===1974===
Changes for the 1974 Le Mans included new split grilles with horizontal bars on base Le Mans and Le Mans Sport models, while Luxury Le Mans models got chromed vertical bar split grilles. Model offerings in each series were the same as 1973, except for the addition of a new Luxury Le Mans Safari wagon and the deletion of the GTO series from the intermediate line to the compact [[Pontiac Ventura]] series. Out back were new federally mandated 5 mph bumpers to match the similarly mandated front bumpers of the previous year and less curvaceous rear end treatment with vertical taillights and license plate/fuel filler moved above the bumper. Base Le Mans coupes retained the fixed full triangular rear side windows while Luxury Le Mans coupes got a smaller vertical opera window similar to the [[Pontiac Grand Prix|Grand Prix]] along with an optional Landau rear quarter vinyl roof. Le Mans Sport Coupes were now available with two rear side window treatments - the louvered triangular version carried over or the opera window with Landau vinyl roof from the Luxury Le Mans.

All engines were carried over from 1973 including the 250 inline six, and V8s including the 350 two-barrel, 400 two- and four-barrel and 455 four-barrel. New to the option list for 1974 was a 350 four-barrel. The same assortment of three- and four-speed manual transmissions were carried over for 1974 along with the three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic.
New to the option list for 1974 on all models were GM-specification radial-ply tires manufactured by GM's usual tire suppliers that included revised suspension tuning.

===1975===
The 1975 Le Mans received mostly trim changes including new crosshatch grilles on base and Sport models, and a distinctive vertical bar grille with more chrome on the Grand Le Mans (renamed from Luxury Le Mans) series cars and only revised nameplates and taillight lenses in the rear. Interiors were revised on top Grand Le Mans cars to include the distinctive wrap-around dashboard from the Grand Prix and Grand Am models with simulated African Crossfire Mahogany trim, a notchback bench seat with armrest in sedans and wagons or a no-cost choice of the notchback bench or Strato bucket seats in coupes. Base Le Mans and Sport Coupe models carried over trim only slightly revised from 1974 including a revised Custom Cushioned steering wheel.

Pontiac's Maximum Mileage System consisted of GM's new catalytic converter that reduced emissions while improving drivability and fuel economy, a High Energy electronic ignition, and lengthened routine maintenance intervals. Radial tires were standard on all models and a "Radial Tuned Suspension" option was available that included upgraded radial tires along with front and rear sway bars.

Engines were revised for 1975 to meet that year's emission requirements and mated to the catalytic converter, which spelled the end of true dual exhausts. The 250 cubic-inch Chevy inline six was standard on base Le Mans coupes and sedans while the 350 two-barrel V8 was optional and standard on the Le Mans Sport Coupe, and Grand Le Mans sedans and coupes, and optional engines on all of those models including a 350 four-barrel and a 400 two-barrel. Le Mans and Grand Le Mans Safari wagons came standard with a 400 four-barrel engine that was optional on other models. The 455 V8 was discontinued for all LeMans models for 1975, but still available in the Grand Am. Transmission offerings included a three-speed manual standard with the six-cylinder and 350 two-barrel V8, with the three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic optional with those engines, a "mandatory" option with all other engines in sedans and coupes, and standard on the Safari wagons. The Hurst-shifted four-speed manual was no longer offered.

===1976===
[[File:Pontiac (1664080537).jpg|thumb|1976 Pontiac Le Mans]]
For 1976, the Le Mans and Grand Le Mans were the only Pontiac intermediate offerings with the discontinuation of the Grand Am series. All models received new rectangular headlights with distinct grilles unique to the base and Le Mans Sport and another one for the Grand Le Mans. The Grand Le Mans had the instrument panel of the 1973-75 Gran Am, while the Le Mans and Le Mans Sport continued with the regular dash.  The 1973-75 Luxury Le Mans had the regular Le Mans instrument panel.

The Chevy-built 250 straight-six was now standard on all Le Mans and Grand Le Mans sedans and coupes along with the Le Mans Sport Coupe with V8 options including a new "Oldsmobile-built" 260 V8 and Pontiac V8s of 350 and 400 cubic inches with two- or four-barrel carburetion (400 four-barrel still standard on all Safari wagons), along with the return of the 455 four-barrel V8 after a one-year absence. The three-speed manual transmission was standard with the Chevy six with Turbo Hydra-matic optional, the latter now the only transmission offered with all V8s except the small 260 which could be ordered with a five-speed manual in the Le Mans Sport Coupe.

Also new for 1976 was an "Enforcer" police package on Le Mans sedans with either the 400 or 455 V8s that included Turbo Hydra-matic transmission, variable ratio power steering, heavy duty power front disc brakes and suspension tuning.

===1977===
[[File:1977 Pontiac LeMans Sport Coupé.jpg|thumb|left|1977 Pontiac Le Mans Sport Coupe]]
The 1977 model year was the last for the Le Mans and Grand Le Mans built off the 1973-vintage Colonnade body. Appearance changes were limited to revised grilles and taillight lenses. Engine offerings were revised with Buick's 231 cubic-inch [[V6 engine|V6]] replacing the Chevy inline six as the base power plant in sedans and coupes. The base V8 (standard on Safari wagons and optional on other models) was Pontiac's new 301 cubic-inch engine based on the same V8 engine block as other Pontiac V8s but utilized many lightweight components.  Optional V8s were pared down to Pontiac-built 350 and 400 four-barrel powerplants. The three-speed manual was the standard transmission on V6 models, while the Turbo Hydra-matic was optional and the only transmission available with the V8 engines. Those drivetrain offerings were available in 49 states. In California, Pontiac V8s were not offered for 1977 due to the inability to meet that state's more stringent regulations. In the Golden State, the Buick V6 was standard on most models but the V8 engines offered there were Oldsmobile's 350 and 403 four-barrel engines. Turbo Hydra-matic was the only transmission offered in California.

A sporty-performance model based on the Le Mans Sport Coupe called the [[Pontiac Can Am]] was a one-year only offering for 1977. The Can Am came standard with the 400 four-barrel V8 in 49 states or the Olds 403 four-barrel in California, along with Turbo Hydra-matic transmission, a Grand Prix instrument panel and console, along with Strato bucket seats, and rear spoiler. It was partially intended as a replacement for the 1973-75 Grand Am, whose departure had caused A-body sales to drop significantly, combined with the fact that the Pontiac models had always been the weakest sellers of the line with a high percentage of low-profit fleet sales.

For the final year of the Colonnade Le Mans models, they were joined by newly downsized B-body Catalina and Bonneville full-sized cars, which weighed a few pounds less than the "intermediates" and rode on the same 116-inch wheelbase length as the Le Mans sedans and Safari wagons and also had similar dimensions as far as length and width were concerned. The intermediates would have to wait one more year for downsizing, and although the new B-bodies made them redundant, it was still considered necessary to sell both as a hedge in case the B-body cars proved to be troublesome. In addition, many customers still preferred the tried-and-true Colonnade intermediates to the B-bodies and they continued to sell well for their final year, mostly thanks to the coupe models.

}}{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}[[File:'79 Pontiac LeMans.jpg|thumb|left|1979 Pontiac Le Mans sedan]]

In 1978, the Le Mans and other GM mid-sized cars were considerably downsized and lost some 600-800&amp;nbsp;lb. Pontiac's engines were also downsized, with the standard engine being the Buick 3.8&amp;nbsp;L 231&amp;nbsp;ci V6, Pontiac 265&amp;nbsp;ci V8, or optional Pontiac 4.9&amp;nbsp;L 301&amp;nbsp;ci V8 for 1978, (a Chevy 305&amp;nbsp;ci V8 in California). 1978 also saw Pontiac's 350&amp;nbsp;ci &amp; 400&amp;nbsp;ci engine production shut down after many years of service as its hallmark V8s. A limited production run of 400ci engines was made, but were only available in 1978 and 1979 Trans Ams equipped with the four-speed manual transmission. Chevrolet's 350 V8 was available in 1979 LeMans Safaris (station wagon) only.&lt;ref name="Spontiac155"&gt;[[#GunKow|Gunnell and Kowalke]], p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1978 to 1980, Pontiac's mid-sized lineup included the base Le Mans, Grand Le Mans, and a revived Grand Am; all available as a Coupe, Sedan, or Wagon. In 1980, the Grand Am was only offered only as a coupe, and the "Grand Am" nameplate was again discontinued until 1985, when it was used on Pontiac's new compact car &amp;mdash; a form the Grand Am would take for the next two decades.

[[File:1980 Pontiac Grand Le Mans 2-dr V8 fL.jpg|thumb|left|1980 Pontiac Grand Le Mans coupe]]

The final year for the mid-sized Le Mans was 1981 with only base and Grand Le Mans models offered initially.  They were joined mid-year by a new LJ trim level positioned between the base and Grand models.  The car was given a new Firebird-eaque slanted nose which made the 2-door coupe popular in [[NASCAR]], especially as a superspeedway race car in 1981{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}, which was the first year these cars were used in the series. A Le Mans driven by Cale Yarborough won the 1983 [[Daytona 500]], and one driven by Tim Richmond at the 1983 [[Pocono 500]]. Engine offerings by this time included [[Buick]]'s 231 CID V6, Pontiac's 4.3 L 265 CID V8, Pontiac's 301 CID V8, and Chevrolet's 305 CID V8 (for California only).

For 1982, because the larger Pontiacs were not selling well, GM decided to discontinue the full-sized Catalina and Bonneville. The Bonneville name was then simply swapped onto the smaller G-body sedan and wagon because GM reasoned that it carried a higher level of name recognition with customers than LeMans; the wagon was replaced by the [[Pontiac 6000]] wagon and overlapped with the Bonneville Safari for two years while the Grand Prix served as the [[de facto]] replacement for the coupe. This "new" Bonneville amounted to little more than the existing LeMans with revised front and rear fascia designed to mimic the departed Pontiac B-body. In Canada, this model continued to use the Grand LeMans name through 1983, after which it was badged as a Bonneville. Due to GM cost-cutting measures, Pontiac's remaining V8's, the 265 and 301 were both discontinued late in 1981, with all engine development to focus on the Pontiac Iron Duke [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] engines for GM's smaller cars. That engine was essentially half of a Pontiac 301 V8. The new engine lineup now consisted of the Buick 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6, Chevrolet 305 V8, and Oldsmobile 350 diesel V8. For 1984, the Bonneville Safari Wagon was dropped, while the Bonneville four-door sedan continued through the 1986 model year. Beginning in 1987, the Bonneville nameplate was moved to a slightly larger front-wheel-drive sedan that shared its [[GM H platform (FWD)|basic platform]] with the [[Buick LeSabre]] and [[Oldsmobile Eighty-Eight|Oldsmobile Delta 88]]; by 1992, the [[GM W platform|W body]]-based Grand Prix had evolved from its [[personal luxury car]] origins to become Pontiac's sole midsize offering.

The Pontiac Le Mans nameplate was revived in 1988 as a [[Badge engineering|rebadged]] [[Daewoo_LeMans#Daewoo_LeMans_.281986.E2.80.931994.29|Daewoo LeMans]]; a subcompact car sold in the North American and New Zealand markets until 1993 as a [[captive import]]. In North America, three-door [[hatchback]] and a four-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] body styles were offered. It replaced the [[Pontiac 1000]].

The Pontiac/Daewoo Lemans was a rebadged variant of the [[Opel Kadett#Kadett E (1984–1991)|Opel Kadett]]; [[Opel Combo|Opel Kadett Combo]] (European markets); [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] [[Vauxhall Astra|Astra]] Mark 2, [[Vauxhall Belmont]], Bedford Astravan, Bedford Astramax (Britain); Chevrolet Kadett (in [[Brazil]]); and the [[UzDaewooAuto]] Nexia (in [[Uzbekistan]]).

'''Production Automotive Services, Inc.''' (commonly referred to as '''PAS''') and formally known as '''Prototype Automotive Services''', was a specialty vehicle manufacturer which produced the 1989 [[Pontiac]] Turbo Trans Am, the 1991 [[GMC Syclone]], the 1992 [[GMC Sonoma GT]] and the 1992 - 1993 [[GMC Typhoon]]. These were the only projects PAS created with [[General Motors]] before merging and becoming TDM Technologies in Livonia, MI and Wheel to Wheel in Troy, MI.

==History==
1989 marked the 20th Anniversary for Pontiac's flagship ponycar, the Trans Am, and Bill Owen at Pontiac Motor Division saw to it that it was a special one. Pontiac engineers originally wanted to use an all-aluminum V-8 engine in the TTA. That plan never materialized, so the 3.8L Intercooled Buick Turbo V-6 engine from the [[Buick Grand National]] was chosen and equip with cylinder heads from the existing 3800 Series I V-6, because of their increased clearance at the strut towers and superior flow.&lt;ref name="HRM-IMD"&gt;{{cite web|title=1989 Pontiac Trans Am Turbo Pace Car - Indy Meets Daytona|url=http://www.hotrod.com/cars/featured/hppp-0610-1989-pontiac-trans-am/|publisher=Hot Rod Magazine|author=Thomas A. DeMauro|accessdate=August 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contract to outfit the TTA engine was given to PAS Engineering in Van Nuys, CA  and the work took place in its 40,000-square-foot City of Industry facility. After the engines were completed, they were shipped back to GM, installed in the cars and then returned to PAS for testing and quality-control checks, before being offered to the public for sale. Jeff Beitzel, who was the president of PAS, had his personal 20th Anniversary TTA (one of the 5 pilots cars) sent to [[American Specialty Cars]] (ASC) and made into a convertible.&lt;ref name="HRM-IMD"&gt;{{cite web|title=1989 Pontiac Trans Am Turbo Pace Car - Indy Meets Daytona|url=http://www.hotrod.com/cars/featured/hppp-0610-1989-pontiac-trans-am/|publisher=Hot Rod Magazine|author=Thomas A. DeMauro|accessdate=August 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PAS also made other performance changes, which included the 1LE brake package originally engineered for Trans Am racecars. The setup featured vented 12-inch front and 11.7-inch rear rotors to ensure fade-free performance. The aluminum dual-piston front and single-piston rear calipers were borrowed from the [[Chevrolet Corvette]].&lt;ref name="HRM-TW"&gt;{{cite web|title=Time Warp T/A|url=http://www.superchevy.com/features/0512gm-1989-pontiac-trans-am-turbo-feature/|publisher=Hot Rod Magazine|first=Jim|last=McIlvaine|accessdate=Oct 7, 2005|date=2005-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the project, Scott Kelly, who was the Engineering Liaison of PAS, was instrumental in the development and production of the TTA. Scott served as the go-between for PAS and [[General Motors]] throughout the program and was responsible for the all of the Trans Ams used during the month of May 1989, including the three actual pace cars. After the TTA program, Scott worked as the Service and Warranty Administrator for the TTA, GMC Syclone, Typhoon, Sonoma GT, and natural-gas-powered trucks, that PAS produced until 1994.&lt;ref name="HPP-TTAR"&gt;{{cite web|title=1st Annual 1989 Pontiac Trans Am Turbo Meet - The '89 Pontiac Turbo Trans Am Reunion|publisher=High Performance Pontiac Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The car features a split two-piece [[windshield]], a touring car [[convertible (car)|convertible]] top, modified rear quarter panels and front fenders, exaggerated tail lamps, set of four bucket seats and an extra third row bench where there was originally a trunk, a rear-mounted [[parachute]] and a GTO emblem on the [[grille|front grille]].&lt;ref name=StAntoine-MT&gt;St. Antoine, Arthur. - [http://www.motortrend.com/classic/features/c12_0511_dean_jeffries_interview/index.html "Interview: Dean Jeffries, Hollywood legend"]. - ''[[Motor Trend|Motor Trend Magazine]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KeefeD-PEM-1997&gt;Keefe, Don. - [http://www.monkees.net/DOCS/MMOBILE.HTM "The History of the MonkeeMobile"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513031513/http://www.monkees.net/DOCS/MMOBILE.HTM |date=2008-05-13 }}. - ''Pontiac Enthusiast Magazine''. - (c/o monkees.net) - 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The Monkeemobile had its origins in 1966 when [[Dean Jeffries]] was asked to design and build a car for a new TV show called ''[[The Monkees]]''. Jeffries, under contract with [[Model Products Corporation]] (MPC) at the time, told CEO George Toteff about the project. A make of vehicle had not yet been chosen for the project. Toteff then told his friend [[Pontiac GTO#Origins|Jim Wangers]] of these developments. Wangers was working with Pontiac promotion and advertising at the time and saw the show as a huge promotional opportunity for Pontiac. After making the deal, Jim Wangers supplied two base 389 4-barrel 1966 GTO convertibles with automatic transmissions to be converted into Monkeemobiles. MPC was in turn given exclusive rights to market a model kit of the Monkeemobile. They eventually sold over seven million copies of the kits.&lt;ref name=KeefeD-PEM-1997 /&gt;

==The car==
[[File:The Monkees 1967.jpg|right|thumb|The Monkees in 1966]]
Two cars were contracted, one for the television program and the other as a promotional car, for touring car shows around the United States. Both cars were built in the span of four weeks. The first version originally featured a 6-71 [[supercharger|supercharged]] engine, a solid mounted rear axle (no springs) and extra rear end weight.{{cn|date=November 2018}} This was to enable the car to "pop [[wheelie]]s".{{cn|date=November 2018}}  Because the car had too much power and was difficult to drive, {{cn|date=November 2018}} the original blower set up was removed and a dummy blower was fitted, over a stock Pontiac [[Tri-Power]].&lt;ref&gt;Rothermel, Rich. "Dean Jeffries: Runnin' Flat Out Since 1951", in ''Rod &amp; Custom'', April 2000, p.66 caption&lt;/ref&gt; The second car was used as a touring car for auto shows and promotional events. Before its transformation into a Monkeemobile, the second car was first seen on TV as Major Nelson's [[Pontiac GTO|GTO]] in ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]''.{{cn|date=November 2018}}  Both were used on ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'' TV series, one during the first season and both throughout the second season.&lt;ref name=KeefeD-PEM-1997 /&gt;

Several notable differences between the two cars exist, such as the size of the door logo and the styling of the fan belt cover and blower lines, which can be used to tell the difference between the two cars.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==Later years==
After the television show ended, both cars were offered back to Dean Jeffries for [[USD|$]]2,000 each,&lt;ref&gt;Rothermel, p.71.&lt;/ref&gt;  who had [[right of first refusal]]. He declined to purchase the cars because he felt he could build new ones cheaper.&lt;ref name=StAntoine-MT /&gt;

The "TV car" (aka car # 1) followed the Monkees on tour only to be left in Australia in 1968. It later resurfaced in [[Puerto Rico]] as a hotel courtesy car. To this day, there is still no hard information on how the car made its way to Puerto Rico, and it was sold at government auction in 1992 for [[USD|$]]5,000 when the hotel went out of business. Though basically as it was built, the car did get some restoration work done when bought, and it was used as the example for the [[Ertl Company]] [[1:18 scale]] [[die-cast toy]], The Monkees 1997 TV reunion show, "[[Hey, Hey, It's the Monkees]]" and the 2001 "Cars &amp; Guitars Of Rock N Roll" display at the [[Petersen Automotive Museum]] . It is now in the hands of a private collector in Northern New Jersey.&lt;ref name="Car #1 current whereabouts"&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connor|first=Erin|title=Look for the Monkeemobile in Bergen County|url=http://blog.northjersey.com/thebeat/971/look-for-the-monkeemobile-in-bergen-county/|work=Jersey Beat blog on NorthJersey.com|publisher=NorthJersey.com|accessdate=2012-06-21|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121210043401/http://blog.northjersey.com/thebeat/971/look-for-the-monkeemobile-in-bergen-county/|archivedate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "show car" (aka car #2) was purchased by [[custom car]] designer, [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]]. This car would be the most visible during the years. Barris later went on to use and display the car for promotions at many large and small events. In 2006 the car went through a major restoration. Even though it became a 100 point show car, many changes and upgrades were made. In January 2008, Barris, through [[Barrett-Jackson]] in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], auctioned the car for [[USD|$]]360,000. It now resides in the hands of a private collector in southeastern [[Michigan]].  The car, though in great condition, now has spongy brakes.&lt;ref&gt;Press Release: [http://news.barrett-jackson.com/barrett-jackson-shatters-records-at-2008-scottsdale-event/ "Barrett-Jackson Shatters Records at 2008 Scottsdale Event"]. - Barrett-Jackson Auction Company - January 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Golfen, Bob and Peter Corbett. - [http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/0119milliondollar0120-ON.html Gooding auction sells top car"]. - ''[[Arizona Republic]]''. - January 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Barris also had Dick Dean, who had helped Jeffries build the two originals, make a copy, identified by yellow trim on the headlight bezels, tan seats (instead of the original white upholstery), and other variations. A second copy or tribute car was recently built by a longtime associate of Dean Jeffries. This car contains many parts removed from the #2 car during its restoration and belongs to a private collector in Florida. Another replica was built for the Monkees 45th Anniversary Tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ebay-stories.com/hey-hey-its-the-monkeemobile |title=eBay Stories |publisher=eBay Stories |date=2015-04-24 |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour, which took place from May 12, 2011 to July 23, 2011, was the fourth and final reunion tour to feature band members Davy Jones, Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork together, before Jones's death from a heart attack on February 29, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Poniewozik |first=James |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/02/29/rip-davy-jones-the-monkees-daydreamboat/?xid=rss-topstories |title=RIP Davy Jones, The Monkees’ Daydreamboat &amp;#124; TIME.com |website=Entertainment.time.com |date=2012-02-29 |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous replicas created over the years with distinctive visual differences unique to each car. None of these copies were made by the original cars' creator, [[Dean Jeffries]].

==Tribute car==
A TV series showcased the complete build for the 45th Anniversary Tour replica car, built to the specifications for the television show. Dean Jeffries, the Monkeemobile's original designer and fabricator, provides direction and commentary for the car's refurbishment. This was among his last projects before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2013/05/08/dean-jeffries-legendary-customizer-dies-at-80-w-video/ |title=Dean Jeffries, legendary customizer, dies at 80 |website=Autoblog.com |date=2013-05-08 |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike some other "copies" that lack many of the details of the original, the 1967 Pontiac GTO 4-speed "donor car" was professionally transformed to a concours grade show car with exacting detail, from the GM paint code "R" to the gold plated 6-71 supercharger and correct Cragar wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nichol |first=Mark |url=http://cars.aol.co.uk/2012/04/30/amazing-monkeemoile-for-sale-on-ebay/ |title=Amazing Monkeemoile for sale on eBay - AOL Cars UK |website=Cars.aol.co.uk |date=2012-04-30 |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
