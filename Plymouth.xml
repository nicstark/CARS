The '''Plymouth Plaza''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|l|ɑː|z|ə}} is an [[automobile]] which was produced by [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] from 1954 through the 1958 model year.

The ''Plaza'' was Plymouth's entry-level car during those years and was priced under the [[Plymouth Savoy]]. It was offered in sedan, coupe and wagon variants. Known as Plymouth's "Price Leader", in 1958 the Plaza offered buyers the widest choice of options to date.  Options formerly reserved only for higher-priced lines were available on the Plaza for the first time in history.  The Business Coupe, which was the least produced model of Plymouth in 1958 (1,472 units), differed from the regular 2dr Club Sedan in that the rear seat was an optional accessory.  Plymouth also added a special edition to the Plaza fleet in '58.  

Based on a Plaza Club Sedan, the "Silver Special" had a custom paint job with silver paint on the roof and in the Sportone inserts plus a short stainless steel spear that accented the front fenders and extended partially into the front doors.  The final custom touch was on the rear fins where the Silver Special bore "Forward Look" emblems instead of the traditional "Plaza" scripts.  It isn't known how many of the 94,728 Plazas produced in 1958  were fitted with the Silver Special trim package, but they are believed to be very rare cars.

Like most models of its kind in the 1950s and 1960s, the Plaza -- with its minimal trim and plain cloth-and-vinyl upholstery, and limited option choices -- saw most of its appeal toward fleet buyers, such as police departments, where luxury and comfort were not primary concerns. However, the model was available to budget-conscious private consumers who wanted or needed the room of a full-sized automobile and the availability of such items as a V-8 engine and automatic transmission.

For the 1959 model year, Plymouth discontinued the Plaza and moved the Savoy name down to become the entry level model.&lt;ref name=Gunnell_P655&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975, Revised 4th Edition, page 655&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Plymouth Savoy''' is an [[automobile]] model produced from the 1954 through 1964 model years by [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]].

==Early history==
[[File:Plymouth Savoy 1951.JPG|thumb|left|Plymouth Savoy Wagon 1951]]
Plymouth used the name '''Savoy''' on several automobiles. From 1951-1953, the Savoy name was used on a [[station wagon]], upgrading the base model [[Plymouth Suburban|Suburban]]. Later was a line of full-sized Plymouths from 1954-1961.&lt;ref name="CG"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Consumer Guide |first1=Auto Editors of |title=50 Years of American Automobiles |date=1989 |publisher=Beekman House |location=New York |isbn=0-517-68640-6 |page=319-322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another incarnation was among Plymouth's downsized full-size cars from 1962-1964.

As with Plymouth's Plaza and Belvedere models, the Savoy was named after an upscale hotel, the [[Savoy Hotel]] in London.

When introduced in 1954, later in the year with 1955 model paint schemes, the Savoy was Plymouth's mid-level car and priced between the base [[Plymouth Plaza|Plaza]] sedans and the top-line [[Plymouth Belvedere|Belvedere]] models.
 
In 1954, the Savoy was available as a two-door [[Coupe|Club Coupe]], four-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]], and 2-door Club Sedan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Plymouth/1954-Plymouth/1954-Plymouth-Foldout/1954-Plymouth-Foldout-06-09 |title=1954 Plymouth foldout, models |publisher=oldcarbrochures.org |accessdate=13 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212716/http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Plymouth/1954-Plymouth/1954-Plymouth-Foldout/1954-Plymouth-Foldout-06-09 |archivedate=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, the Savoy was available with new power steering.&lt;ref name="1955brochure"/&gt;

In 1956, the line added a hardtop [[coupe]] and the Custom Suburban [[station wagon]].

In 1956, [[seat belts]] were added for safety.&lt;ref name="1956album"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Plymouth/1956%20Plymouth/album/1956%20Plymouth-05.html |title=1956 Plymouth album |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=13 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930154753/http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Plymouth/1956%20Plymouth/album/1956%20Plymouth-05.html |archivedate=30 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Highway Hi-Fi]] record player was also optional.&lt;ref name="1956album"/&gt;

For the 1957 and 1958 model years, the line added a four-door [[hardtop]] sedan.

In 1959, Plymouth dropped the Plaza and replaced it with the Savoy, making the Savoy the model's entry level full-size Plymouth. The two hardtop models were dropped, as well as the side trim and interior appointments. Sales were not diminished as the Savoy became fleet vehicles used by taxicab companies, police departments and other fleet-minded customers where luxury was not a concern. The model was also available to customers who were in the market for a low-cost, economical vehicle with the availability of a V-8 engine and automatic transmission, and room of a full-size vehicle. By 1960, a new model, the '''Plymouth Taxi Special''', was spun off from the Savoy. Front leg room was 45.5".&lt;ref name="1959brochure"/&gt;

Plymouth models were restyled in 1960. The styling for 1961 was a year "most beholders would agree...it was hit with the ugly stick".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Flory |first=J.

Plymouth discontinued the Savoy nameplate at the end of the 1964 model year, except in Canada, where it continued through 1965.&lt;ref name="CG" /&gt;

In 1965, the full-sized entry level Plymouth model in the U.S. was the [[Plymouth Fury|Fury I]]; in Canada it was called the Savoy but the top-level models were named Fury II and Fury III.

The '''Plymouth Caravelle''' is a [[mid-size]] sedan that was introduced by [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] as a 1983 Canadian model. The Caravelle came to the United States in 1985 to replace the [[Chrysler E-Class]]. It was essentially identical to the concurrent [[Dodge 600]]. It was replaced by the [[Plymouth Acclaim]] in 1989. The Caravelle was Plymouth's first [[front wheel drive]] mid-size sedan.

The name of the vehicle was inspired by the word [[Caravel]], a 15th-century sailing ship used by the Portuguese; the ship was noted for its speed and agility.

For 1985, the Chrysler brand dropped its unsuccessful entry-level variant of the [[Chrysler E platform|E platform]], the Chrysler E-Class (the idea of a more mainstream Chrysler was not well received by consumers). Even though the Dodge 600 was mainstream, Dodges were not generally sold with Chryslers, so rather than only having the upscale [[Chrysler New Yorker|New Yorker]] on [[Chrysler-Plymouth]] dealer lots, the former E-class was given a new grille and rebranded as a Plymouth and thus the U.S. Caravelle was created. This model was slotted between the compact [[Plymouth Reliant|Reliant K]] and the large rear-wheel drive [[Plymouth Gran Fury|Gran Fury]].

For its first year the Caravelle came in one trim level with a number of standard features, the Caravelle SE. These standard features including: AM/FM stereo, power windows, power locks, power adjustable mirrors, deck lid release, cruise control, air conditioning, and a 50/50 split front bench seat, with dual recliners. For 1986, the Caravelle was given a facelift, which rounded many of the sharp angles, giving it a more aerodynamic appearance. Also from 1986 onward, a base model was offered, without some of the standard features of the "SE". The Caravelle continued in the U.S. until 1988, when it was replaced by the new [[Chrysler A platform|A body]] [[Plymouth Acclaim|Acclaim]] for 1989. Unlike the identical Canadian Caravelle, a 2-door [[coupe]] model was never offered in the U.S.

==Canada==
In Canada, the Caravelle first appeared for the 1978 model year as a version of the [[Dodge Diplomat]] for Canadian [[Chrysler]]-Plymouth dealers.&lt;ref name="Zavitz"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zavitz |first1=Perry |title=Canadian Cars, 1946-1984 |date=1985 |publisher=Bookman Publishing |location=Baltimore |isbn=0934780439 |pages=114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As all Chrysler Canada dealers sold Chryslers, only the top of the line [[Chrysler LeBaron|LeBaron]] was sold in Canada, and the [[Dodge Diplomat|Diplomat]] and Caravelle did not offer the top line models. The top of the range Caravalle was approximately $670 cheaper than the LeBaron.&lt;ref name="Zavitz" /&gt;. Between 1978 and mid-1981, all Caravelles were built at the Chrysler plant in [[St Louis]].&lt;ref name="Zavitz" /&gt; In 1983, Chrysler Canada added the E-body version of the Dodge 600, also offering it as a Plymouth Caravelle. The [[rear wheel drive]] Caravelle then became the Caravelle Salon, rather than taking the American "Gran Fury" name. Also in 1983, Chrysler Canada added a Caravelle version of the [[Dodge 400]] 2-door [[coupe]]. Thus the Caravelle came in three sizes based on three platforms - [[Chrysler K platform|K]], [[Chrysler E platform|E]], and [[Chrysler M platform|M]].

The coupe was dropped after 1986 while [[sedan (car)|sedan]] production came to an end in 1988. Like the U.S. version, the Canadian Caravelle was replaced by the [[Plymouth Acclaim]] for 1989. The Caravelle Salon, which was the original [[rear wheel drive]] version, survived until 1989.

The original '''Plymouth Duster''' is a semi-[[fastback]] two-door [[coupe]] version of the [[compact car|compact-sized]] [[Plymouth Valiant]] automobile that was marketed by [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] from 1970 to 1976 model years.&lt;ref name=Duster&gt;{{cite web |last=Samsen |first=John |url= http://www.allpar.com/cars/plymouth/sportwagon.html |title=The Plymouth Duster SportWagon Concept Car |accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Duster coupe provided the compact-sized Plymouth Valiant with a sporty body style to attract customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/cars/plymouth/duster.html |title=1970-1994 Plymouth Duster and Dodge Demon cars |publisher=Allpar |year=2010 |accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car was a $15 million effort to update the compact Valiant for the 1970 model year.&lt;ref name="stuff-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1970-1976-plymouth-duster.htm/ |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1970-1976 Plymouth Duster |date=10 October 2007 |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Valiant badge appeared only on the first model year Dusters, and continued to be used on all the companion 4-door sedan and 2-door Valiant Scamp [[hardtop]] models. The Duster was built on the Valiant [[Automobile platform|platform]] and shared the same front end sheet metal, but featured a different design from the cowl back.

The Duster was also positioned to compete with [[Ford Motor Company|Ford's]] slightly smaller semi-fastback [[Ford Maverick (North America)|Maverick]] compact car and the [[AMC Hornet]] that were both also introduced in 1970, and the slightly larger semi-fastback [[Chevrolet Nova]] whose design was introduced in 1968.&lt;ref name="PS-01-70"/&gt; While the Maverick and Nova were offered in a 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] body style, the Duster nameplate was used only for the 2-door coupe. The Duster was also marketed as an alternative to the original [[Volkswagen Beetle]], as well as the new class of domestic [[subcompact car]]s such as the [[Chevrolet Vega]].&lt;ref name="stuff-1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=Plymouth+Duster+economy+car&amp;hl=en |page=38 |title=You can save a little money by buying a VW instead of a Duster (advertisement) |date=10 November 1972 |journal=Life |volume=73 |issue=19 |accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=69QDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=Plymouth+Duster+economy+car&amp;hl=en |page=51 |title=How one Duster can beat four Vegas (advertisement) |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=December 1972 |volume=138 |issue=6 |accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous trim and option package variants of the Duster were offered with names that included Feather Duster, Gold Duster, Silver Duster, Space Duster, Duster Twister, Duster 340 and  Duster 360. These marketing variations of the basic Duster design targeted customers seeking economy, cargo capacity, and/or performance.

Duster logo was, and still remains, one of the most recognizable automobile logos.  Chrysler employee, Thomas Bertsch (1952-1987), created the "twister" logo and font.   Many corresponding graphics were used for different trim packages over the years.  Bertsch was the director of the interior styling and design studio for much of his career.

==Year-by-year changes==

===1970===
The Plymouth Duster introduced in late-1969 for the 1970 [[model year]] was all Valiant from the cowl forward, but the rest of the car's sheet metal, save door skins, was completely different. The design incorporated a semi-fastback roof and a special rear valance with for having no bezels. The door glass was operated by a new regulator mechanism, required to fit the much more radical [[Tumblehome#In automobile design |tumblehome]] (reduced side glass radius), and the windshield was more steeply raked. For 1970 only, a small Valiant badge went on the front fenders just above the Duster badge.

The 1970 Duster was available in two models — the standard Duster and a performance-oriented Duster 340. Engine options were {{convert|198|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|225|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} versions of Chrysler's [[Chrysler Slant 6 engine|Slant Six]], as well as the {{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|340|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler LA engine|LA-series]] [[V8 engine|V8]]s.

At midyear, a '''Gold Duster''' trim package was added. The Gold Duster package came with either the " badging, gold stripes on the sides and rear, wall-to-wall carpeting, pleated, all-vinyl seats, whitewalls, wheel covers, a deluxe insulation package, and a canopy [[vinyl roof]]. The Gold Duster was offered through /Valiant 1975 small cars from Plymouth" printed 8-1-74 form no. 81-005-0003 page 2 outlines the Gold Duster, of which 24,817 were equipped with the 340 engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975 |publisher=Krause Publications |isbn=0-87341-027-0 |editor-last=Gunnell |editor-first=John A. |year=1987 |page=565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971===
The Duster was a success for Plymouth, so much so that in 1971 Dodge requested and received their own version, the [[Dodge Dart|Demon]]. In response, Plymouth was given a version of the Dodge Dart Swinger 2-door hardtop named the [[Plymouth Scamp|Plymouth Valiant Scamp]].

For 1971, only small changes were made to the Duster. The "Valiant" fender badges and "Plymouth" grille logotype were deleted. A new trim package was released, called the '''Duster Twister'''. The Twister package presented the appearance of the Duster 340, but came only with the base [[Straight-six engine|I6]] or 318 V8. The Twister's appearance package included special side stripes that mimicked the Duster 340 Wedge stripes, a matte-black hood and the 340's special shark-tooth grille. A nonfunctional dual hood scoop and rear spoiler appearance package was available, as were high-back bucket seats and dual exhaust.

A new electronic "breakerless" ignition became optional on the 340 V8 late in 1971 model year. In 1971, 186,478 Plymouth Dusters were built, with 12,886 being the higher horsepower 340 cubic inch fastback models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1970-1976-plymouth-duster13.htm|title=1970-1976 Plymouth Duster|date=10 October 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1972===
[[File:'72 Plymouth Duster (Les chauds vendredis '10).jpg|thumb|right|1972 Plymouth Duster]]
The Duster was not changed significantly for 1972. New surface-mount [[Automotive lighting|sidemarker lights]] replaced the previous flush-mount items, the taillamps became larger, one-piece units. The power rating of the 340 V8 was reduced from {{convert|275|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|245|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} due in part to a reduction in compression ratio from 10.2:1 to 8.5:1, as well as changing the intake valves from {{convert|2.02|in|mm|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1.88|in|mm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Direct Connection Race Bulletin #8 page 19 PN P4007913, printed July 1980&lt;/ref&gt; All horsepower rating numbers, even on unchanged engines, decreased for 1972 due to a [[Horsepower#Society of Automotive Engineers|new rating protocol]]. Chrysler's electronic ignition became standard on the 340 models in 1972. Also, there was a 1 year only air cleaner that had a vacuum operated door at the bottom to allow for additional air flow when the throttle is depressed.

===1973===
Following the design changes on the Valiant models, the Duster also received a new hood, grille, front fenders, bumpers, and taillights for 1973. The taillights on previous years mounted from the inside and had a flush appearance. Starting in 1973, the taillights were mounted from the outside and were trimmed in chrome. These remained unchanged through 1976. The Dodge version, the Demon, was rebranded "Dart Sport" in response to church groups opposition to the word, "Demon."

Other changes were in store for the Plymouth Duster. Simpler single-piston slider-type disc brake calipers were introduced for 1973 (standard on 318-powered cars and with power-assist on 340 models), replacing the Kelsey Hayes four-piston calipers. Disc brake-equipped Dusters now had the more-common 5-lugs on 4.5" wheel bolt pattern. All 340 and some 318 engine-equipped cars received the simplified 8.25" rear axle assembly (with wheel bearings riding directly on the axle shaft and endplay being taken by C-clips); these axles also featured the 5-on-4.5" wheel bolt pattern. (This axle assembly replaced the 8.75" "drop-out" arrangement seen on some 1966-1972 A-bodies). The 225-powered cars retained the 5-lugs on 4" pattern on vehicles with the standard drum brakes. A three speed Torque Flight automatic along with a manual transmission was offered with the 225 slant six. All models received larger front wheel bearings and increased spindle diameter. Electronic ignition became standard across the board.

Also a Space Duster package was offered. This allowed the back bench seat to be folded down, allowing more space to carry cargo. There is also a security flap allowing private things to be stashed away from view of others.

A new, metal sunroof was optional for 1973. The rear window defroster/defogger was upgraded to an electric-grid style for 1973, which replaced the previous recessed package shelf air blower.

===1974===
[[File:'74 Plymouth Duster (Rigaud).jpg|thumb|right|1974 Plymouth Duster, with non-OEM wheels, tires, and air cleaner]]
For 1974, Plymouth replaced the 340 with a {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} version of the corporate LA-series V8, de-tuned to meet new [[Automobile emissions control|emissions regulations]]. The new for 1974 "E58" 360 engine produced {{convert|245|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} by utilizing the camshaft, heads, intake manifold, carburetor, and dual-exhaust set up from the past 340 engine. New retractable front seat belts were added. In the midst of the first oil crisis, 1974 would be the Duster's best sales year, with a total of 281,378 Duster-bodied cars produced, majority of which being the six cylinder and 318 V8 models.&lt;ref&gt;Gunnell, page 574.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1974 there was a separate model called the Duster 360. Standard equipment included the 360 engine, dual exhaust, power disc brakes, full side tape stripe, rear tape stripe, heavier suspension, shocks, added sway bar, and 8 1/4" rear end. Plymouth built 3,969 of these models and most came with automatic transmissions, and very few having manual transmissions. Duster 360 options included Goodyear raised white letter tires on rallye wheels. Air conditioning and fold back sunroof or flip down rear seat were also available.

===1975===
[[File:'75 Plymouth Duster (Rigaud).jpg|thumb|right|1975 Plymouth Duster, with non-OEM wheels and tires]]
The 1975 models were mostly unchanged from the previous two years, with some exceptions: a new grille with a return of the Plymouth 3-pointed-'spear' affixed to the grille's center; catalytic converters were added to 225 Slant Six and 318 V8 models (the 360 was not equipped with a converter and its power was now {{convert|235|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, due to the addition of a [[secondary air injection]] system, commonly referred to as a "smog pump".  Less than 2000 of the 1975 model Dusters left the factory equipped with the 360 engine.

===1976===
The grille-mounted [[Turn signal|park and turn signal]] lenses were amber; prior years had colorless lenses with amber bulbs. The interior rear view mirror was mounted directly to the windshield rather than to the previous double-pivot roof bracket, and the [[parking brake]] was now foot- rather than hand-operated. Disc brakes became standard equipment on cars built after 1 January 1976.

Several special models were offered:

*The '''Feather Duster''' featured lightweight aluminum parts including the intake manifold, bumper brackets, hood and trunk bracing, and [[manual transmission]] housing, for a weight savings of about {{convert|187|lb|kg|1|abbr=on}}—5% lighter than a standard Duster similarly equipped. It came with a 225 Slant Six with its distributor and single-barrel carburetor calibrated for economy, a low-restriction exhaust system, an extra-high rear axle ratio, and was offered with either the [[Torqueflite]] 3-speed automatic or A833 overdrive 4-speed manual transmission. It was the most fuel-efficient car in its size class, achieving up to 36 mpg highway and 24 in the city with the manual transmission option (along with Dodge's version, the '''Dart Lite''').&lt;ref&gt;1976 Dodge Dart factory literature form no. 81-205-6002, printed September 1975&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''Space Duster''' had fold-down rear seat and security panel and combined with the luggage compartment, offered over {{convert|50|cuft|m3|abbr=on}}. of cargo space. (This feature was actually introduced, optionally, in 1973).
*The '''Silver Duster''' had special stripes and a cloth Boca Raton style interior{{Vague|date=May 2011}}.

The Duster 360 option was deleted as a separate model as the engine became an option on any trim level Duster, and only 1300 or so cars were equipped with it. The 1976 360-powered Duster (and Dart Sport 360) was still without a catalytic converter, and while its power was down to {{convert|225|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, the car could still manage 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph in 7.9 seconds when equipped with the 3.21 rear axle gearing.

==Replacement==
In mid-1976 the [[Dodge Aspen]] and [[Plymouth Volare]] twins replaced the Dodge Dart and Plymouth Duster which were still based on bodies originally sold in 1967. The fastback coupes featured a solid B-pillar with fixed rear glass. These new models were introduced to compete with the more upscale [[Ford Granada (North America)|Ford Granada]] and [[Mercury Monarch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knutson |first=Lanny |url= http://www.allpar.com/model/volare.html |title=1976 Plymouth Volare and Dodge Aspen - Introduction and Reviews |work=Allpar.com |date= |accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising==
From 1974 to 1975, actress [[Judy Strangis]] was a TV pitchwoman for the Plymouth Duster in the role of "Mean Mary Jean," wearing a football jersey and short denim hot-pants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBFvV7_Mag|title=1974 Plymouth Duster -  Mean Mary Jean --Better Quality Version - Featuring Judy Strangis|first=|last=OsbornTramain|date=8 March 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrqbV7le1t8|title=Mean Mary Jean Plymouth 1970s Commercial|first=|last=RetroActive|date=24 October 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IwWG61NNNQ|title=Plymouth Gold Duster Commercial (1974)|first=|last=Bionic Disco|date=31 October 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strangis also promoted [[Chrysler]] Corporation's [[Plymouth Volare]] and [[Plymouth Road Runner]] models and often appeared at [[Chrysler]] promotions and auto shows around the country.

The '''[[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] Reliant''' and  '''[[Dodge]] Aries''' were introduced for model year 1981 as the first "[[Chrysler K platform|K-cars]]" manufactured and marketed by the [[Chrysler|Chrysler Corporation]]. The Reliant was available as a 2-door [[coupe]], 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]], or as a 4-door [[station wagon]], in three different trim lines: base, Custom and SE ("Special Edition"). [[Station wagon]]s came only in Custom or SE trim. Unlike many small cars, the K-cars retained the traditional 6 passenger 2 bench seat with column shifter seating arrangement favored by many Americans. The Reliant was powered by a then-new [[Chrysler K engine|2.2 L I4]] [[overhead camshaft#Single overhead camshaft|SOHC]] engine, with a [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]] "Silent Shaft" 2.6&amp;nbsp;L as an option (this engine also featured hemispherical combustion chambers, and all 1981 models equipped with it featured "HEMI" badges on the front fenders). Initial sales were brisk, with the both Reliant and Aries each selling over 150,000 units in 1981. As [[badge engineering|rebadged variants]], the Reliant and Aries were manufactured in [[Newark Assembly|Newark, Delaware]], [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], and [[Toluca Car Assembly|Toluca, Mexico]] &amp;mdash; in a single generation. After their introduction, the Reliant and Aries were marketed as the "Reliant K" and "Aries K".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allpar.com/eek/k/kron.html allpar K-Chronology]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Reliant replaced the [[Plymouth Volaré]]/[[Plymouth Road Runner|Road Runner]]. The Aries replaced the [[Dodge Aspen]]. The Reliant and Aries were classified by the EPA as mid-size and were the smallest cars to have 6-passenger seating with a 3-seat per row setup, similar to larger [[rear-wheel drive]] cars such as the [[Dodge Dart]] and other [[front-wheel drive]] cars such as the [[Chevrolet Celebrity]]. Chrysler marketed the car as being able to seat "six Americans." The Aries was sold as the Dart in [[Mexico]]. The Reliant and Aries were selected together as ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Car of the Year]] for 1981 and sold almost a million Aries and 1.1 million Reliant units over the nine-year run. 

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}
[[File:1981 Dodge Aries cp.jpg|thumb|left|200px|1981 Dodge Aries coupe]]
[[File:'85-'89 Dodge Aries Wagon.jpg|thumb|left|1986–1988 Dodge Aries wagon]]

Chrysler was facing a grave financial crisis due to poor business decisions, lack of investment in new products during previous years, and external factors outside of their control as the 1970s ended. Lynn Townsend, chairman from 1967–75, had pursued a hands-off policy of running the company, refusing to spend more than the minimum on new drivetrains or platforms as long as the existing ones continued to sell. Sales of the company's larger cars started dropping after the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 OPEC Embargo]] and an increased amount of company volume consisted of lower profit compact models. Chrysler also had a policy of producing cars regardless of whether a customer ordered them, which was in contrast to AMC, Ford, and GM who only produced vehicles they received orders for. Soon, they were left with a backlog of unsold inventory which cost money to store and had to resort to the money-losing tactic of rebates to get rid of these excess cars. Compounding these difficulties were new Federal emissions and safety regulations during the 1970s which added more to the production costs of each car. Townsend retired in 1975 and left the reins to John Riccardo, who presided over a slowly-sinking company. 

The following year, the compact [[Dodge Aspen]]/Plymouth Volare debuted as replacements for the dated Dodge Dart/Plymouth Valiant, but were rushed into production and ended up with a major string of quality control problems that led to them being one of the most recalled cars in US history. In 1977, Riccardo petitioned newly elected US president [[Jimmy Carter]] for a Federal bailout, but Carter would not consider the idea as long as Chrysler's present management were in charge. In January 1978, Chrysler released the Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon, a US adaption of the European Simca Horizon and the first domestic-built FWD subcompacts. They came out in a year when larger cars were in demand and dealers struggled to move them from lots, costing the hard-pressed company yet more money. Ford president [[Lee Iacocca]] was fired on July 13, 1978 and three months later, Chrysler offered him the position of company president. By this point, the smallest of the Big Three American automakers was close to collapse, struggling from the unexpected poor sales of the Omni, the fallout from the Aspen recalls, and the decision to discontinue full-sized Dodges and Plymouths in 1978, leaving them without a full-sized car in a year of strong sales for them. Since 1976, quality control on Chrysler vehicles had become worse.

Although the K-platform had been designed during 1978, the failing company could not afford by this point to put them into production. Thus, Iacocca and Riccardo decided to repeat the original 1977 request for government assistance, but since the Carter Administration would not offer any help until the existing management was removed, Riccardo stepped down as chairman and gave Iacocca the job. During a series of Congressional hearings, Lee Iacocca made his case for a Federal bailout of Chrysler, citing past [[Conrail|bailouts of the railroad industry]] and aerospace company [[Lockheed-Martin]] as precedent. He argued that thousands of American jobs would be saved and the company had been consciously attempting to build modern, economical cars such as the Omni, but fate had dealt them a bad hand. Iacocca also stated that excessive government regulations were costing needless money. Congress approved the bailout after Chrysler detailed the plans for their new FWD platform and the first handful of K-cars trickled off the assembly line at Detroit's Jefferson Avenue plant in late 1980.

The Reliant and Aries were [[Downsize (automobile)|downsized]] replacements for the six-passenger Volare and Aspen, which in turn were modernized version of the original Valiant and Dart compact cars of the 1960s. Based on experience gained with subcompact Omni/Horizon of 1978, the roomier K-cars set out to build a family sized car with a front-wheel drive design powered by a four-cylinder engine. They were offered as 2 and 4 door notchback sedans and wagons and retained six-passenger seating on two bench seats. While the [[Chevrolet Citation]] introduced front-wheel drive in the 1980 model year to replace the Nova, its unusual styling and problems with recalls hampered its success. They achieved nearly a million in sales between the two original nameplates before being rebadged and upgraded, not counting the numerous stretched, sporty or minivan derivatives. Ford did not replace its family-sized Fairmont/Granada/LTD with a front-wheel drive design until the 1986 [[Ford Taurus]], while cars like the [[Chevrolet Cavalier]] and [[Ford Tempo]] would be marketed as upscale compacts rather than family sedans.

Initial advertisements for the Aries were done in red, white, and blue and emphasized American industry's desire to answer the challenge of Japanese products and also promoted the low $5,880 base price. Since Chrysler was so financially strapped, early promotional shots featured the same car, but with Dodge and Plymouth badges and trim swapped. In 1981, sales of the Reliant and Aries got off to a slow, but early start and can be attributed to Chrysler's inadequate preparation. Instead of producing a sufficient amount of base models, Chrysler was producing a larger number of ''SE'' and ''Custom'' models. When consumers arrived at Plymouth (and Dodge) dealers, they were shocked to find that the Reliant they were planning on purchasing would end up costing hundreds or thousands of dollars more. As a result of this, Chrysler corrected this and began building more base models then sales of the Reliant and Aries skyrocketed.

The Reliant and Aries were available in standard "base", mid-level ''SE'', and high-end ''Custom'' (later renamed ''LE'') trim levels. Unlike the [[coupe]] and [[sedan (car)|sedan]], the [[station wagon]] was not available in base trim. "Custom/LE" Reliant/Aries wagons came standard with exterior woodtone siding, although it could be deleted.  All models except base could be ordered with front bucket seats rather than the standard bench.  By 1987, though, bucket seats became standard and bench seats were optional without charge.

*1982: A new hood ornament (changed from either a Plymouth "frog legs" hood ornament or a Dodge badge mounted flat on the hood to an upright Chrysler Pentastar), roll-down rear door windows vs. the former stationary glass with rear quarter pop-outs, a counterbalanced hood, and black painted valve cover on the 2.2L engine (vs. the former blue). 
*1983: A blacked out grille is made standard on the Aries. 
*1984: The hood ornament was removed and the Chrysler Pentastar moved to the grille; the [[Mercedes Benz]]-styled grille used on the Reliant was modified. Also, the tail lights received chrome trim, and the interior received a padded dash and new black instrument cluster with round gauges. 
*1985: The first major changes occurred when the Ks received a new, rounder front fascia, featuring either a new egg-crate or crosshair [[grille]] for the Plymouth and Dodge that was the same height as the headlights (rather than going all the way up to the hood as with previous model years). A new rear fascia featuring five-section taillights. A new trim line, the top-tier LE ("Luxury Edition"), was added (it also replaced the Custom trim level on the wagon). The base engine was a transverse mounted Chrysler designed 2.2 L (135 cid) [[inline-four engine]] with an electronic two-barrel carburetor (later replaced by a fuel injection system in 1986), rated at {{Convert|82|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Transaxles were a 4-speed floor shift [[Manual transmission|manual]] or a 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] with either a floor or column shift. A Mitsubishi motor was optional (automatic transmission was required with that engine), and cars so equipped for 1981 were badged as 2.6 HEMI.  Reliants and Aries equipped with this engine accelerated 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph in the 13-second range.
*1986: There was the replacement of the 2.2&amp;nbsp;L engine's [[carburetor]] by a new throttle-body electronic [[fuel injection]] system, while a new 2.5&amp;nbsp;L [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] engine, also fuel-injected, was added to the option list, replacing the Mitsubishi 2.6 L ''[[Mitsubishi Astron engine#4G54|G54B]]'' engine, but driveability and reliability problems led to its replacement. (Just like the 2.6, automatic transmission was mandatory for the 2.5.)  The four-speed [[manual transmission]] – previously offered as standard equipment – was dropped. The SE trim line is dropped, and the LE and base trim remained the only trims until the end of production.
*1987: The coupe's fixed rear windows got a small pivoting vent at the trailing edge of the rear doors. 
*1988: The base model was renamed ''America'' in the U.S (renamed ''Canada'' in Canada), offered as relatively inexpensive, basic transportation. This was later done to the base models of the [[Dodge Omni|Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon]] and [[Dodge Shadow|Dodge Shadow/Plymouth Sundance]]. It is also the last year for the station wagons.  

After 1987, the Reliant and Aries underwent only minor changes throughout the rest of its production run. The last K-car rolled off the assembly line on December 9, 1988.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The 1989 Reliant and Aries were carryovers from the 1988 model year and only the America and Canada trims were available on these models. No station wagon models were sold in 1989. The Reliant was replaced by the [[Plymouth Acclaim|Acclaim]] for 1989, while the Aries was replaced by the [[Dodge Spirit|Spirit]].

The '''Plymouth Fury''' is a model of [[automobile]] which was produced by [[Plymouth automobile|Plymouth]] from 1955 to 1989. It was introduced for the 1956 model year as a sub-series of the [[Plymouth Belvedere]], becoming a separate series one level above the contemporary Belvedere for 1959. The Fury was a [[full-size car]] from 1959 to 1961, then a [[mid-size car]] from 1962 to 1964, again a full-size car from 1965 to 1974, and again a mid-size car from 1975 to 1978. From 1975 to 1977 the Fury was sold alongside the full-size [[Plymouth Gran Fury]]. In 1978, the B-body Fury was the largest Plymouth, and by 1979, there was no large Plymouth.  This was rectified in 1980 with the R-body Gran Fury, followed by the M-body Fury in 1982.  Production of the last V8, RWD Plymouth Fury ended at Kenosha, WI, on December 23, 1988.  Unlike its sibling brand, Dodge, Plymouth would not live to see the resurgence of the large, V8/RWD sedan.  The last Plymouth rolled off the Belvedere assembly line in 2001.

The word "fury" denotes a type of [[anger]], inspired by the [[Furies]], mythological creatures in [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient Roman]] mythology. The car is recognizable as the title subject of the 1983 best-selling novel ''[[Christine (novel)|Christine]]'' by [[Stephen King]].  Later in the same year it was adapted into a [[Christine (1983 film)|movie]].

==Early history==
[[File:1956 Plymouth Fury (18329909251).jpg|thumb|right|1956 Plymouth Fury]]
The Fury was a sub-series of the [[Plymouth Belvedere]] from 1956 through 1958. It was sold only as a sandstone white two-door [[hardtop]] with gold [[anodising|anodized]] aluminum trim, in 1956 and 1957. In 1958 it was only available in buckskin beige with gold anodized aluminum trim. These Furys had special interiors, bumper wing-guards and V8 engines with twin four-barrel [[carburetor]]s. The 1957 and 1958 [[Chrysler A engine#318|{{convert|318|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}]]-engine produced {{convert|290|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

The 1957 models were restyled; longer, wider, with very large vertical tailfins and a new torsion bar front suspension replacing the previous coil springs. While the new styling boosted sales, quality control suffered for all Chrysler products as they were brought quickly to market before their design and construction weaknesses could be fully addressed by engineering.

In 1958, the optional engine was a [[Chrysler B engine#350|{{convert|350|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}]] called the "Golden Commando" with two four-barrel carburetors producing {{convert|305|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. A {{convert|315|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} option with fuel injection was available, but the [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix]] [[electronic fuel-injection]] system was recalled by the factory and owners were given a conventional dual four-barrel setup. The Golden Commando engine was optional on any [[Plymouth Plaza]], [[Plymouth Savoy|Savoy]], [[Plymouth Belvedere|Belvedere]], [[Plymouth Suburban|Suburban]], and Fury, as was the dual four-barrel {{convert|318|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} (dubbed the "V-800 Dual Fury"; four- and two-barrel 318s also arrived for 1958 and were simply called "V-800s").

In 1959, Plymouth introduced the Sport Fury as its top model, and the Fury as its second from the top model to replace the [[Plymouth Belvedere]] at the top of the Plymouth line-up. The Fury range was now available as a four-door sedan and [[station wagon]], as well as a two-door hardtop and [[Sedan (car)|sedan]]. The Sport Fury series had only a two-door [[hardtop]] and [[convertible]]. The Sport Fury was dropped at the end of 1959, but was reintroduced in mid-1962 and discontinued in 1971.

In 1959, the 350 was replaced with a {{convert|361|CID|L|abbr=on}} version of the Golden Commando with a two- or four-barrel carburetor. The dual four-barrel version of the 318 was also dropped that year, with the four-barrel available on this engine through the 1962 model year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Dodge Viscount===
The Dodge Viscount was an automobile built by [[Chrysler Canada]] for the 1959 model year only. It was based on the contemporary Plymouth Fury, but featured a 1959 Dodge front clip assembled to the Plymouth Fury body. However, there was no sport model counterpart to the Sport Fury sold in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Jeffrey I. |last1=Godshall |first2=James K. |last2=Wagner |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zsnXUcRfqTsC&amp;pg=PA107 |title=Maple Leaf Mutants: Chrysler North of the Border |journal=Automobile Quarterly |volume=32 |number=3 |pages=107–108 |date=January 1994 |accessdate=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1962 Fury emerged as a downsized model riding on the new Chrysler [[Chrysler B platform|B-body unibody platform]], the product of a Chrysler Corporation embroiled in multiple corporate controversies at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/reviews/1962/sport-fury.html |title=1962 Plymouth Sport Fury car reviews |last=Redgap |first=Curtis |publisher=allpar.com |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales of the new model were slow, prompting the reintroduction of the Sport Fury trim package,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/reviews/1962/sport-fury.html |title=1962 Plymouth Sport Fury car reviews |last=Redgap |first=Curtis |publisher=allpar.com |accessdate=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; offered as a hardtop coupe or a convertible.

Chrysler Corporation began to restyle and enlarge the Plymouths and Dodges, which improved sales in 1963 and 1964. The 1964 models saw an improvement in sales, especially the two-door hardtop, which featured a new slanted roofline. Engine choices remained the same throughout this three-year cycle.

In 1965, Chrysler returned the Fury to the new, full-size [[Chrysler C platform|Chrysler C-body platform]]. The new 1965 Plymouth line included three special Furys: the Fury I, Fury II, and Fury III. The Fury I was the basic model, while the Fury II and Fury III offered more trim and features. Full size Furys had options such as [[automatic transmission]]s, [[power steering]], white sidewall tires (along with full wheel covers), [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] radios, [[vinyl top]]s, and [[air conditioning]]. The Sport Fury was the highest trim and feature model, positioned to compete with the [[Chevrolet Impala]] Super Sport and [[Ford Galaxie |Ford Galaxie 500/XL]]. It offered a sportier interior and exterior trim package. The Fury II was available as a two-door hardtop in Canada only; in the U.S. it was only available as a two- or four-door sedan, and as a station wagon.

The overall design changed, with the grille losing chrome but gaining two vertical stacked headlights on each side. All rode on new {{convert|119|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbases ({{convert|121|in|mm|abbr=on}} for the wagons)—{{convert|1|in|mm|abbr=on}} longer than before. The 426 "street wedge" V8 was introduced, rated at {{convert|385|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and finally street-legal.&lt;ref name="allpar"/&gt;

The 1966 Furys kept the same profile as the 1965s, with a split front and rear grill motif. For 1967, the body was restyled with a sharp, angular profile. The stacked quad headlight bezels were curvier and set more deeply into the body, giving the car a more muscular look. The roofline had sharper angles and gave the car a longer, more luxurious appearance. A new, formal two-door hardtop body style appeared which featured smaller rear quarter windows and a wider, back-slanted "C" pillar. Called the "fast top", it was offered alongside the restyled thin "C" pillar hardtop in both VIP and Sport Fury series (as well as on corresponding big Dodge models). The 1967 model year introduced new safety regulations, which meant that for the first time, all Plymouths included dual-circuit brake master cylinders, energy-absorbing steering columns and wheels, recessed instrument panel controls, and shoulder belt mounting points for outboard front seat occupants.

The 1968 Furys received only minor grille updates up front, along with side marker lights and shoulder belts for front outboard occupants (except the convertibles). At the rear, however, all models except the station wagons received new sheet metal, including reshaped rear doors on four-door models.&lt;ref name="chrysler407"&gt;{{Cite book | ref = SCchr | title = Standard Catalog of Chrysler, 1924-1990 | first = John | last = Lee | publisher = Krause Publications, Inc. | location = Iola, WI | page = 407 | date = 1990 | isbn = 0-87341-142-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the [[Plymouth Suburban|Suburban]] badge returned to station wagons after having been retired in 1961. The Suburban, Custom Suburban, and Sport Suburban corresponded to the Fury I, II, and III models.&lt;ref name="chrysler407"/&gt;

From 1966 to 1969, a luxury version of the Fury, called the "Plymouth VIP" (marketed as the "very important Plymouth" in 1966) was fielded, in response to the [[Ford LTD (North America)|Ford LTD]], [[Chevrolet Caprice]], and the [[AMC Ambassador|AMC Ambassador DPL]]. These models came with standards such as full wheel covers, [[vinyl top]]s, luxuriously upholstered interiors with walnut dashboards and door-panel trim, a thicker grade of carpeting, more sound insulation, and full courtesy lighting.

In Australia, the full size [[Dodge Phoenix]] was based on the [[Dodge Dart]] and [[Dodge 440|440]] until 1965, when it became a right-hand drive version of the contemporary Fury. The Phoenix continued in production in Australia until 1972, each based on that year's North American Plymouth Fury.

The 1969 models featured Chrysler's new round-sided "Fuselage Look" styling. The Fury was again available as a 2-door hardtop, 2-door convertible, 4-door hardtop, 4-door sedan, and 4-door station wagon. For 1970, the VIP was discontinued and a 4-door hardtop was added to the Sport Fury range, which also gained a new hardtop coupe. This was available in "GT" trim; the 1970 and 1971 Sport Fury GTs were powered by the {{convert|440|cuin|L|abbr=on}} engine, which in 1970 could be ordered with three 2-barrel (twin-choke) [[carburetor]]s (the "6-Barrel on Plymouth and 6-PAK for Dodge"). This engine produces {{convert|350|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="chrysler411"&gt;[[#SCchr|Lee]], p. 411&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1969 models included the Fury I, Fury II and Fury III, the sport-model Sport Fury and the top-line VIP. The 225 cubic-inch six-cylinder engine continued as standard on the Fury I, II and select III models, with the 318 cubic-inch V8 standard on the Sport Fury, some Fury III models, and all VIP models plus the station wagon; a three-speed manual transmission was standard, with the TorqueFlite automatic transmission optional. The six-cylinder engine/three-speed manual transmission power team – along with the three-speed manual transmission on the 318 cubic-inch V8 – continued to be available until midway through the 1971 model year, after which all full-sized Plymouths were built with a V8 engine, including the new 360 cubic inch engine and automatic transmission. Parking lights now illuminated with the headlights, which meant that if one headlight was inoperative in low beam, that other drivers wouldn't mistake your car for a motorcycle in the dark.

For 1970, the VIP was dropped, with the Sport Fury line expanded to include a four-door hardtop sedan. An optional Brougham package, which included individually-adjustable split bench seats with passenger recliner and luxurious trim comparable to the former VIP series, was available on Sport Furys; a Sport Fury GT and S/23 models. The S/23 was dropped for 1971, with new options including an electric sunroof (for top-line models) and a stereo tape player with a microphone, making it possible to record off the radio or take dictation.

The 1971s offered a new Sport Fury 4-door sedan, and a coupe (similar to the Sport Fury hardtop but with fixed rear quarter windows) in the Fury I series. A hardtop coupe was now available in the Fury II series, and a Formal Hardtop was available for both Sport Fury and Fury III. New options included headlight washers, and a stereo cassette recorder.

For 1972, the Fury was facelifted with a large chrome twin-loop bumper design with a small insignia space between the loops and hidden [[headlamp]]s as standard equipment on the Sport Suburban, and the newly introduced Fury Gran Coupe and Gran Sedan, which eventually would become the [[Plymouth Gran Fury]]; the Sport Fury and GT models were dropped, while the new Fury Gran series offered an optional Brougham package.&lt;ref name="chrysler415"&gt;[[#SCchr|Lee]], p. 415&lt;/ref&gt; The six-cylinder engine, strangled by emissions requirements, was no longer offered in full-size Plymouths. On the other hand, a 400 cubic inch V8 was now an option.&lt;ref name="chrysler415"/&gt; For 1973, the front end was redesigned with a new grille and headlamp setup, along with [[Bumper (car)|bumpers]] capable of withstanding {{convert|5|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} impacts. The 360 became the standard engine for Fury Suburbans.&lt;ref name="chrysler417"&gt;[[#SCchr|Lee]], p. 417&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1974, the Fury shared Chrysler's all-new full-size C-body platform in common with the concurrent flagship [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]] (1974-75); [[Chrysler New Yorker]] (1974-78), [[Chrysler Newport|Newport]] (1974-78) and [[Chrysler Town and Country|Town &amp; Country]] (1974-77); and with the [[Dodge Monaco]] (1974-76) and [[Dodge Royal Monaco|Royal Monaco]] (1977) as well. Styling was more squared off with lower beltlines and greater use of glass than with Chrysler's previous fuselage generation (1969-73), also with cues more similar to the model year 1971 and later Buicks and model year 1973–74 Mercurys. The unibody structure with subframe for engine/transmission was retained along with other typical Chrysler Corporation engineering features including torsion bar front suspension and multi-leaf springs in the rear.

[[File:1974 Plymouth Fury II coupe.png|thumb|left|1974 Plymouth Fury II 2-door hardtop]]
Model lineup again included the Fury I, Fury II, Fury III and Gran Fury series, plus the Suburban and Sport Suburban station wagons. Engine offerings included a standard {{convert|360|CID|L|abbr=on}} V8 with two-barrel carburetor on sedans and coupes, a two-barrel {{convert|400|CID|L|abbr=on}} V8 standard on wagons and optional on other models, and four-barrel carbureted 400 and {{convert|440|CID|L|abbr=on}} V8s optional on all models.

All 1974 Furys came standard with TorqueFlite automatic transmissions, power steering, and power front disc brakes.

As part of the company's efforts to make ordering a well-equipped car easier, two special model packages were available: a basic group (which had items already ordered on a majority of full-sized Plymouths, such as an AM radio, air conditioning, light group and tinted glass) and a luxury group (which added items such as cruise control, power windows and an AM/FM stereo radio). The Brougham package, whose centerpiece was the individually-adjustable 50/50 divided front seat with individual center armrests and recliners, was still available for Gran Furys. New options included Chrysler's chronometer (an electronic digital clock), a gauge alert system that used light-emitting diodes to monitor engine functions and automatic temperature control.

For the 1975 model year, Chrysler moved the Fury name, which had been part of the full-size C-body Plymouth model line up during the previous ten model years, over to the restyled mid-size B-body line, which had been marketed as the [[Plymouth Satellite|Satellite]] previously. The "Road Runner" was offered as the top-of-the-line model of the redesigned Plymouth Fury 2-door line up, then it was moved over to the [[Plymouth Volare]] line up during the following model year (1976). The full-size Plymouth, now known as the '''[[Plymouth Gran Fury]]''', lasted through 1977. The entire mid-size Plymouth Fury line up was discontinued at the end of the 1978 model year, replaced in [[Canada]] by the [[Badge engineering|rebadged]] [[Dodge Diplomat]] model called the [[Plymouth Gran Fury|Plymouth Caravelle]] (not to be confused with the [[Chrysler K platform|E-body]] [[Plymouth Caravelle]] from 1983 to 1988 and the 1985 to 1988 [[Plymouth Caravelle]] for the American car market). During the entire 1979 model year, there were no Fury offerings from Plymouth at all.

Only minor styling changes occurred from the 1975 to the 1978 model years, most notably, during the 1977 model year when quad stacked square headlights (see photo) replaced the previous round dual beam headlights, the front turn signals, previously on the outboard edges of the grille, were moved over to the cutouts in the front bumper. Tail lights received amber turn signal lenses in place of the previous red turn signal lenses. Various 2-door models had no centerposts and some of them were true hardtops with roll-down rear windows. Other two-door models had fixed rear windows even though they had no centerposts. For the most part, the Plymouth Fury two-door models, during the 1975 and the 1978 model years, were labeled as "hardtops".
[[File:Gran Fury Sport Suburban 1977.jpg|thumb|left|1977 Plymouth Gran Fury Sport Suburban]]
The Plymouth Fury, 1975-1978, shared its B-body and unibody structure with the [[Dodge Coronet]] (1975-1976), [[Dodge Monaco]] (1977-1978) and the corporation's new personal-luxury coupe models, [[Chrysler Cordoba]] (1975-1979) and [[Dodge Charger]] SE (1975-1978). All the four-door models, wagons and sedans alike, continued with the basic body shells, which date back to the start of the 1971 model year, rode on a {{convert|118|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase, while the various two-door models—which were restyled with new and more formal sheetmetal and rooflines—rode on the {{convert|115|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase.

Before 1975, the Plymouth Satellite had a {{convert|117|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase, while the Dodge Coronet had a {{convert|118|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase. For 1975, the mid-size Plymouth Fury had a {{convert|117.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase and the 1975 Dodge Coronet had the same wheelbase.

Before 1974, the Plymouth Fury had a {{convert|120|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase, while the Dodge Monaco/Polara had a {{convert|122|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase. For 1974, the Plymouth Gran Fury and Dodge Monaco had the same {{convert|121.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase.

[[File:1975 Plymouth Fury coupe.png|thumb|1975 Plymouth Fury 2-Door Hardtop]]

Fury was offered in three basic subseries for 1975 in sedans and coupes and two for the station wagon. The sedan was offered in base, custom and salon models, with interior and exterior trim ranging from austere to luxurious. The salon featured plush velour bench seats with recliners and folding armrests and carpeted trunks, along with a spring-loaded hood ornament with the Plymouth logo. In addition to the Road Runner, the Fury coupes were offered in base, Custom and Sport models. The "sport" was the top-line coupe featuring body pinstriping on the upper door and front and rear fenders, interiors with all-vinyl bucket seats and center cushion and armrest, or optional center console; or split bench seats with armrest, along with plusher shag carpeting on floor and door panels plus lower door carpeting. The wagons were available as either the Fury Suburban or Fury Custom Suburban.

Engine offerings included the {{convert|225|CID|L|abbr=on}} slant-six that was standard on all models except Fury Sport, Road Runner, and station wagons, which came with the {{convert|318|CID|L|abbr=on}} V8 as the base engine which was optional on other models. Optional engines on all models included {{convert|360|CID|L|abbr=on}} and {{convert|400|CID|L|abbr=on}} V8s with two- or four-barrel carburetor, and the {{convert|440|CID|L|abbr=on}} four-barrel was only as a "police" option on four-door sedans. A three-speed manual transmission was standard with the automatic TorqueFlite optional.

The 1976 model year mid-size B-body 1976 Plymouth Fury saw very few appearance changes from the previous year other than the availability of a dual opera window roof on Sport Fury two-door models. Engine and transmission offerings were also unchanged except that the 360 two-barrel V8 was now the standard engine on station wagons along with the TorqueFlite automatic transmission, both items of which were optional on other models.

The 1977 model year mid-size B-body 1977 Plymouth Fury received a new front end with a chrome vertical bar grille and outline along with stacked rectangular headlights. Model and drivetrain offerings were unchanged from 1976 except that the Slant Six now had two-barrel carburetion replacing the one-barrel pot of previous years and was now standard on the Sport Fury two-door models. Optional V8 engines included the 318 two-barrel, 360 two- or four-barrel and 400 two- or four-barrel. The 440 four-barrel V8 was only offered in four-door models as part of the police package.

The 1978 model year was technically a mid-size B-body car, but the 1978 Plymouth Fury was Plymouth's largest car with the discontinuation of the full-size C-body Plymouth Gran Fury after 1977. TorqueFlite automatic transmission and power steering were now standard on all Fury models and the same selection of V8 engines was still available. Few appearance changes were made from the previous model year. The 1978 was the last model year for the Plymouth Fury and its Dodge Monaco counterpart, which was renamed as such during the start of the previous model year (1977), which, in turn, was called the "Dodge Coronet" (from 1965, 1966 to 1967, 1968 to 1970, 1971 to 1974 and from 1975 on through to 1976), while the former full-size C-body Dodge was renamed the "Dodge Royal Monaco" during the start of the previous model year (1977) up until it was discontinued after just one model year. The personal-luxury coupes, which were based on the mid-size B-body platform, including the Chrysler Cordoba and Dodge Magnum (renamed from Charger in 1978) would soldier on for one more year until they were downsized (and renamed Mirada for the Dodge version) in 1980 to the M-body platform used for the Dodge Diplomat and Chrysler LeBaron.

===1979–1981===
[[File:Plymouth Gran Fury 1980.png|thumb|1980–1981 Plymouth Gran Fury]]
For 1979, the B-body chassis/unibody structure was recycled for the corporation's R-body full-sized car, which was a considerably downsized replacement of the 1974–78 C-body cars. Those R-body cars included the [[Chrysler Newport]], [[Chrysler New Yorker]], and [[Dodge St. Regis]] Plymouth version was the Gran Fury although not very common. Plymouth Gran Fury was used on the big car market with a new Gran Fury that was a twin of the concurrent Chrysler Newport intended mainly for fleet sales and law enforcement duties.

===1982–1989===
[[File:3rd-Plymouth-Gran-Fury.jpg|thumb|1982–1989 Plymouth Gran Fury]]
For 1982 the M-body [[Dodge Diplomat]] was rebadged to create another iteration of the Gran Fury. This version, available through the 1989 model year, was a popular choice for police cruisers. The Chrysler New Yorker (1982) and New Yorker Fifth Avenue (1983) (renamed [[Chrysler Fifth Avenue]] for (1984–89)) shared the Gran Fury and [[Dodge Diplomat]] body.

Available only in two-door [[hardtop]] and [[convertible]] models,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.hagerty.com/price-guide/1965-Plymouth-Satellite |title=History of the 1965-1970 Plymouth Satellite |publisher=Hagerty |accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Satellite remained the top of the line model until the 1967 model year, when it was moved a notch down by the [[Plymouth GTX|GTX]]. 

The Fury name was moved to Plymouth's mid-size models for 1975, at which time the Satellite name was discontinued.

When the new, larger [[Plymouth Fury]] was introduced for 1965 on Chrysler's full-size [[Chrysler C platform|C platform]], the [[Plymouth Belvedere]] name was moved to Plymouth's "new" mid-size line for 1965. The Belvedere Satellite was the top trim model in the series, above the Belvedere I and II. It was only available as a two-door hardtop or convertible. Bucket seats and center console were standard, as well as a V8 engine. For 1965, the standard engine was the {{convert|273|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} with optional {{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}, {{convert|361|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}, as well as {{convert|383|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|426|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Commando" engines. This 426 had the wedge combustion chamber design, and is not the 426 "Hemi" that was offered in 1966. The front end featured single headlights on each side, and a grille divided into four thin rectangles laid horizontally.

The 1965 Satellite two-door hardtop total production was 23,341 units. It weighed {{convert|3220|lb|kg|abbr=on}} with a base price of $2,612. Convertible production was 1,860 units. It weighed {{convert|3325|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and was priced at $2,827 in standard trim.

The 1966 redesigned Satellite was available with a "Street Hemi" engine with two 4-barrel carburetors and 10.25:1 compression. This engine was rated at {{convert|425|hp|kW|abbr=on}} at 5,000&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|490|lb.ft|N·m|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,000&amp;nbsp;rpm. The other V8 engine options for 1966 remained the {{convert|180|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 273, the 318 at {{convert|230|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, as well as the {{convert|265|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Commando 361 and Commando 383 at {{convert|325|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, down from its {{convert|330|hp|kW|abbr=on}} rating in 1965.

The 1967 Satellite was a carryover from 1966, but there were several trim changes. A new grille featured dual side-by-side headlights, a change in the rear trunk finish panel and taillights included multiple horizontal ribs. New horizontal aluminum trim at the lower body crease with lower silver paint gave all 1967 Satellites essentially a two-tone paint scheme. For 1966 and 1967, the interior vinyl seats and door panels were treated to a unique 'Western Scroll' design which mimicked tooled leather in appearance. This was the 'premium' interior shared with the GTX in 1967. For 1966 and 1967 the Satellite was again offered only in 2-door hardtop and convertible models and was powered by V8 engines. The 361 was discontinued for the 1967 models, but a 2-barrel 383 producing {{convert|270|hp|kW|abbr=on}} was optional, as well as 4-barrel version rated at {{convert|325|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.

Production figures for 1966 were 35,399 hardtops and 2,759 convertibles.

A restyled and higher trimmed Sport Satellite model with a standard 318 V8 was introduced in 1968, sitting above the regular Satellites.&lt;ref name="chrysler"&gt;{{Cite book | ref = SCchr | title = Standard Catalog of Chrysler, 1924-1990 | first = John | last = Lee | publisher = Krause Publications, Inc. | location = Iola, WI | page = 406 | date = 1990 | isbn = 0-87341-142-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sport Satellite received the same blacked out grille with horizontal blades as used on the Road Runner whereas the regular Satellite shared its grille with Belvederes. A 4-door sedan and station wagon were offered on the Satellite line for the first time. There were no Sport Satellite sedans in 1968, but, confusingly, a Satellite Sport Wagon could be had. These had Sport Satellite trim and also woodgrain panels outside.&lt;ref name=SChry407&gt;[[#SCchr|Lee]], p. 407&lt;/ref&gt; A Sport Satellite four-door sedan was added to the lineup in 1969, and the wagons became a part of the regular Sport Satellite line.&lt;ref name=SChry408&gt;[[#SCchr|Lee]], p. 408&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1968 model year was also the introduction of the [[Plymouth Road Runner]] that shared the same body as the Satellite and Belvedere models.

The 1968 body continued through 1970, with new grilles in 1969 and a minor front and rear restyling for 1970, which was the last year for the Belvedere name.

A new design was introduced for the 1971 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarmanualproject.com/brochures/Plymouth/1971/Satellite/index.htm |title=1971 Plymouth Satellite brochure |publisher=oldcarmanualproject |accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Satellite adopted new "fuselage" styling - in line with the facelifts on the larger [[Chrysler C platform|Chrysler C-Body]] models - on the two-door, four-door, and wagon models. Unlike previous years, 4-door sedans and 2-door coupes did not share sheet metal and each carried unique styling. Sedans were available in base, Custom, and Brougham trim, while two-doors were available in base trim (with rear windows that did not roll down), Sebring trim, and Sebring Plus trim. Station wagons were available in base, Custom, or wood-trimmed Regent models. Two-door models had a loop-type front bumper, and this body was the basis for the related GTX and Roadrunner models.

For the 1973 model year, the two-door models - including the Sebring - received a more conventional front end design, with squared up sheet metal and rear side windows. Safety requirements for the 1974 model year included {{convert|5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} bumpers for the sedans and wagons. The Satellite name was dropped after 1974, after which Plymouth's intermediate offerings on the B-body chassis took the [[Plymouth Fury]] name. The Satellite Sebring was replaced by the [[Chrysler Cordoba]] (a car which was originally intended to be called Plymouth Sebring) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/model/cordoba.html |title=The Chrysler Cordoba, (and 300) |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shared an all new body with the Dodge Charger.

The GTX was based on the Belvedere, and was differentiated by a blacked out grille and special rear fascia, fiberglass simulated hood scoops with optional racing stripes, a chrome "pop-open" fuel filler cap, and a tachometer mounted on the center console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1967-1974 Plymouth GTX: muscle cars with all the trimmings |url= https://www.allpar.com/cars/plymouth/GTX.html |website=allpar.com |accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1968===
[[File:68 Plymouth GTX (7331425156).jpg|thumb|left|1968 Plymouth GTX convertible]]
Chrysler introduced major changes in the design of the 1968 model Plymouth B-bodies and the GTX was given a completely new look. A new hourglass body replaced the previous rectilinear design. The high performance 440 was standard in the GTX as was the TorqueFlite [[automatic transmission]], while it was an extra cost option in the Road Runner. The GTX used the Sport Satellite trim and was offered in two body styles, a two-door [[convertible]] and a two-door hardtop (no B-pillar). All featured dual horizontal "racing stripes" on the lower sides ending with a ''GTX'' emblem ahead of the rear wheel openings. 

The GTX was positioned to be an upscale model of the [[Plymouth Road Runner]] by adding luxury to performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eisenschenk |first=Wes |title=1969 Plymouth Road Runner |year=2017 |publisher=CarTech |isbn=9781613253021 |page=10 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6hpGDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=Plymouth+GTX |accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new budget performance version of the Belvedere featured the new [[Chrysler RB engine#383|{{convert|383|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] "Super Commando" V8 (renamed the "Road Runner 383"). It also had less insulation and comfort items, which reduced weight and kept it in the low price field.

===1969===
[[File:1969 Plymouth GTX 2 door Hardtop (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|1969 Plymouth GTX]]
In 1969, the GTX's sales dropped when the Road Runner was also offered in a convertible body style. The GTX received minor cosmetic changes to the tail lights and grille, as well as the side marker lights. An optional "Air Grabber" hood (standard on Hemi-engined cars) featured functional openings on both sides of the hood that were controlled from the dash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunnell |first=John |title=American Cars of the 1960s: A Decade of Diversity |year=2005 |publisher=Krause Publications |isbn=0896891313 |pages=28-29 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uaugkWcuACUC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=Plymouth+GTX |accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1969 GTX had standard black lower-body side paint in place of the previous stripes. The standard 440 V8 was still rated at {{convert|375|hp|abbr=on}}. This was the last year that the convertible model was available on the GTX. Total production was 701 GTX convertibles in 1969. Of those, eleven were equipped with the 426 Hemi; four were 4-speeds and seven had TorqueFlite automatics. 

===1970===
[[File:1970redGTX.JPG|thumb|left|1970 GTX with an Air Grabber hood]]
The 1970 GTX received a minor redesign with a new grille and rear taillights. Sales were low as the car did not look much different from the Road Runner. Stylists made the lines smoother, and a "power bulge" hood was introduced, as well as non-functional rear-brake air scoops. The [[convertible]] body style was no longer available. The Air Grabber hood returned, but instead of having two narrow openings running length-wise as in 1969, it had one opening scoop located on the power bulge. The GTX was available with the standard 440 four-barrel carburetor. Optional were the 440+6 barrel (three 2-barrel carburetors) and the 426 Hemi. In keeping with the GTX marketing strategy, the 1970 model included many standard features. 

The only other performance luxury model in Plymouth's lineup was the full-size Sport Fury GT, built on the C-Body platform. The GT was added to the lineup in 1970.

The [[Chrysler B platform|B-body]] was redesigned for 1971 and featured rounded "fuselage" styling with a raked windshield, hidden cowl, and a loop-type front bumper around a deeply inset grille and headlights. This was the final year for the GTX as a stand-alone model. The convertible body style was dropped. 

Engine choices were 440 four-barrel, 440 with three two-barrels (Six Pack), and 426 Hemi. Emission restrictions such as lower compression ratios and faster-acting choke operation lowered the base 440 output by {{convert|5|hp|abbr=on}}, to {{convert|370|hp|abbr=on}}. The 440 Six Barrel was down to {{convert|385|hp|abbr=on}}, but the Hemi was still rated at {{convert|425|hp|abbr=on}}. Due partly to rising insurance rates on muscle cars, sales were low. There were less than 3,000 units produced in 1971. 

For 1972 through 1974, any Road Runner ordered with the optional 440 was renamed Road Runner GTX and included the badging of both previous models.

The '''Plymouth Laser''' is a sports coupe sold by [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] from 1989 (as a 1990 model) to 1994. The Laser and its siblings, the [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]] and [[Eagle Talon]], were the first vehicles produced under the newly formed [[Diamond Star Motors]], a joint-venture between the [[Chrysler Corporation]] and the [[Mitsubishi Motors Corporation]]. The "Laser" name was recycled from an earlier sports coupe sold as the [[Chrysler Laser]] during the 1980s.

==Overview==
Introduced as "the first Plymouth of the '90s"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Chrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure "1990 Plymouth Laser"&lt;/ref&gt; in advertising, the Plymouth Laser debuted in January 1989 as a 1990 model. Commercials for the 1990 Laser featured [[R&amp;B]] singer [[Tina Turner]]&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yV3VYJnPuRM | title=Tina Turner in a Plymouth Laser ad from 1990 | website=YouTube | accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; who appeared in a series of 1990 promotional ads for Plymouth. With three available engines, two transmission offerings, and sporty "aero" styling, the Laser was the most performance-oriented Plymouth since the [[Plymouth Barracuda|Barracuda]], [[Plymouth Duster|Duster]], and [[Plymouth Road Runner|Road Runner]] muscle cars of the 1970s.

Despite its close resemblance to its Mitsubishi and Eagle siblings, it has several unique styling cues intended to set it apart from the other two. Apart from badging, Lasers sport a race-inspired look, with a plastic panel in the place of a grille, a full rear lightbar, a bulge on the hood for 2.0 L engined models (not necessarily [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]]), and available stylish "lace" patterned alloy wheels. Rallye Sport (RS), models are set apart from the base models by their black roof with body color targa band, [[power steering]], lower bodyside accent striping, and dual power mirrors, as well as an array of options not available on base Lasers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Base Lasers carry a {{convert|92|hp|kW|lk=on|abbr=on}} 1.8&amp;nbsp;L [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder engine]], whereas a {{convert|135|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, 2.0&amp;nbsp;L [[Overhead camshaft#Double overhead camshaft|DOHC]] four-cylinder was optional with the Laser RS. The top-of-the-line RS Turbo uses a turbocharged 2.0&amp;nbsp;L rated at {{convert|195|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. A five-speed [[manual transmission]] was standard. A four-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]] was optional, except with the turbocharged engine, which could only be ordered with the manual transmission until 1991 models debuted.

==Through the years==

===Model year changes===

[[File:1993 Laser RS Gold.png|thumb|250px|1993 Plymouth Laser RS Gold Edition]]

'''1990''': the Plymouth Laser was released in January 1989 as a 1990 model. Three models were initially offered: base, RS, and RS Turbo. The similar Mitsubishi Eclipse was also released in 1989, and the Eagle Talon soon followed. The RS models, among other options could be equipped with a factory installed [[Compact disc player|CD player]], a first such option on any Plymouth.

'''1991''': the Laser received [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] (ABS), and the turbocharged engine could now be ordered with an automatic transmission instead of a manual. The Laser RS could now only be ordered with the {{convert|195|hp|kW|abbr=on}} engine.

'''1992''': the Laser received cosmetic changes for 1992, and a new [[Four-wheel drive#4WD versus AWD|all-wheel-drive]] (AWD) model joined the lineup. The RS Turbo AWD came only with a manual transmission, while the [[front-wheel drive]] version could still be ordered with an automatic. There was also a freshening to the hood and front and rear fascias. The pop-up headlights were removed in favor of multi-form fixed headlights, making the car look more aerodynamic. The rear lightbar was replaced by two separate taillights. The RS model came with alloy wheels and other cosmetic differences. The RS could also be ordered with the Gold Package, which featured gold trimmed wheels, pin stripes and graphics. Only a limited number of RSs with this package were built, making them rare.

'''1993''': AWD Lasers could now be ordered with an automatic transmission. With the automatic, the power rating of turbocharged models dropped to {{convert|180|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. All Lasers except for the base model could be equipped with ABS.

'''1994''': Production of the Laser ended on June 3, 1994.,&lt;ref name="allpar"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.allpar.com/model/eagle-talon.html | title=The Eagle Talon and Plymouth Laser: Mitsubishi cars with pentastars | journal=Allpar | accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to poor sales. Nothing, including the price, was changed.

==Awards==
The Laser ''Turbo'' was on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] from 1989 through 1992.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caranddriver.com/features/1989-10best-cars-1989-mitsubishi-eclipse-turbo-plymouth-laser-turbo-page-10&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the line==
The Plymouth Laser was not a major sales success. It did not sell as well as the [[Eagle Talon]], and certainly not as well as the [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]]. Several factors influenced this. First, the Laser was a product of [[badge engineering]], therefore it had to compete with two other cars that were virtually identical. Compounding the problem, it faced in-house competition from the Talon, as the [[Eagle (automobile)|Eagle]] brand was also owned by Chrysler. Where Plymouth was generally marketed as the value-oriented, mainstream brand, Chrysler was trying to market Eagle as their performance brand. Due to this, a much heavier amount of advertising was devoted to the Talon. The fact that the Laser was far different from any other product Plymouth was selling at the time did not help its popularity. In the early 1990s, Plymouth's bread and butter lineup still consisted of [[Chrysler K platform|K-car]]-derived cars and minivans; the Laser simply did not fit into this group.

Due to these factors, the Laser was discontinued after a brief run of 1994 models. This failure of badge-engineering was just a preview of what would happen to the whole Plymouth marque in subsequent years. The Laser's discontinuation coincided with the introduction of its successor, the 1995 [[Plymouth Neon]].&lt;ref name="allpar" /&gt; The Neon was available as a two-door coupe and a four-door sedan and was a far better sales success than the Laser. The Mitsubishi Eclipse and Eagle Talon were both redesigned for 1995. The Talon became Eagle's last surviving model in 1998; the car and the Eagle marque were both dropped after that year. The Eclipse continued until the 2012 model year.

'''Plymouth Voyager''' is a nameplate for a range of vans that were marketed by the [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] division of [[Chrysler]].  From 1974 to 1983, the Voyager was a full-size van, sold as the counterpart of [[Dodge Sportsman]] (later the Dodge Ram Wagon).  For 1984, the Voyager became a [[Chrysler minivans|Chrysler minivan]] sold alongside the [[Dodge Caravan]]; as a minivan, three generations of the Voyager were sold from 1984 to 2000.  Following the closure of the Plymouth division in 2000, the Voyager was marketed under the Chrysler brand (as a lower-trim version of the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]]), where it was sold through 2003.

From 1988 to 2016, Chrysler used the [[Chrysler Voyager]] name for export-market minivans; during the existence of the Plymouth brand, export-market Voyagers were produced with the body and trim of the Dodge Caravan.  When including the Plymouth Voyager and Dodge Caravan with their rebadged Chrysler, Lancia, and Volkswagen variants, the [[Chrysler minivans]] collectively rank as the [[List of automobile sales by model|13th best-selling automotive model line]] worldwide.&lt;ref name="autonews"&gt;{{cite web

  | url = http://www.autonews24h.com/Auto-Industry/Chrysler/2885.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Plymouth Voyager minivan was assembled by Chrysler at its [[Windsor Assembly]] facility (Windsor, Ontario, Canada); from 1987 to 2000, the Voyager was also assembled at [[Saint Louis Assembly]] (Fenton, Missouri).  The full-size Plymouth Voyager van was assembled at the now-closed [[Pillette Road Truck Assembly]] facility (Windsor, Ontario, Canada).

For the 1974 model year, Plymouth marketed trucks under its own brand (for the first time since 1942).  The Voyager was the Plymouth counterpart of the [[Dodge Sportsman]] passenger van alongside the [[Plymouth Trail Duster|Trail Duster]] SUV (a counterpart of the [[Dodge Ramcharger]]).  In contrast to Dodge, the Voyager was marketed solely as a passenger van; in line with the Sportsman, 12–15 passenger seating was offered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mclellansautomotive.com/photos/B28439.jpg 1974 Plymouth Voyager promotional postcard (McLellan's Automotive)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://grassrootsmotorsports.com/reader-rides/4979/ Readers' Rides; 1974 Plymouth Voyager (Grassroots Motorsports)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Early versions of the Voyager were visually similar to their Dodge counterparts, centering Plymouth badging in the grille (as with Fargo vans and 1971-1973 Dodges).  For 1978, the B-pillar underwent a redesign, placing the side door further forward; the dashboard was redesigned (Dodge would use this design through 1997).  Externally distinguished by a new grille, the exterior saw a shift of the Plymouth lettering from the grille to the hood.   

For 1979, Chrysler introduced the second generation of the B-platform vans, marked by a longer front nose (and the discontinuation of big-block V8 engines).  Virtually indistinguishable from its Dodge Royal Sportsman counterpart, the parking lamps of the Voyager now wrapped into the front fenders, fitted with four rectangular headlamps.  For 1981, Dodge vans adopted the "Ram van" model nameplate (in line with Dodge pickup trucks); with a lack of large "RAM" badging on the door, the Voyager saw more differentiation from its Dodge counterpart.   

Following the 1983 model year, Plymouth discontinued the full-size Voyager, using the nameplate for its minivan; the 1983 full-size van would be the final full-size truck offered by the brand prior to its 2001 closure.    {{clear}}

==Background==
[[Lee Iacocca]] and Hal Sperlich had conceived their idea for a modern minivan during their earlier tenure at Ford Motor Company.  [[Henry Ford II]] had rejected Iaccoca's and Sperlich's idea (and a prototype) of a minivan in 1974, then rumored to carry the name "Maxivan". Iaccoca followed Sperlich to Chrysler Corporation, and together they created the T115 minivan — a prototype that was to become the Caravan and Voyager, known colloquially as the "Magic-wagons" (a term used in advertising).

The Chrysler minivans launched a few months ahead of the [[Renault Espace]] (the first MPV/minivan in Europe, initially presented to executives as a [[Talbot]] (which was made up of Chrysler Europe's disposed assets) in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matrasport.dk/Cars/Espace/history.html The Matra/Renault Espace&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but not launched until 1984), making them the first of their kind — effectively creating the modern [[minivan]] segment in the US.

In 1984, Chrysler marketed the [[badge engineering|rebadged]] Plymouth variant of its new minivan as the Voyager, using the Chrysler's S platform,  derived from the K-platform ([[Plymouth Reliant]] and [[Dodge Aries]]). The Voyager shared components with the K-cars including portions of the interior, e.g., the Reliant's instrument cluster and dashboard controls, along with the K-platform front-wheel drive layout and low floor, giving the Voyager a car-like ease of entry. The Voyager was on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 1985.&lt;ref name="allpar"&gt;{{cite journal  | url=http://www.allpar.com/model/m/history.html  | title=A Brief History of the Chrysler Minivan | journal=[http://www.allpar.com/ Allpar]  | accessdate=2008-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1987, the Voyager received minor cosmetic updates as well as the May 1987 introduction of the Grand Voyager, which was built on a longer wheelbase adding more cargo room. It was available only with ''SE'' or ''LE'' trim.

First-generation Voyager minivans were offered in three trim levels: an unnamed base model, mid-grade ''SE'', and high-end ''LE'', the latter bearing [[Woodie (car body style)#simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] paneling. A sportier ''LX'' model was added in 1989, sharing much of its components with the Caravan ES.

Safety features included 3-point seat belts for the front two passengers and lap belts for rear passengers. Standard on all Voyagers were legally mandated side-impact reinforcements for all seating front and rear outboard positions. Safety features such as [[airbags]] or [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] were not available.&lt;ref name="allpar.com"&gt;[http://www.allpar.com/model/m/history.html "A Brief History of the Chrysler Minivan" Information courtesy of Chrysler, allpar], retrieved on 2010–08–23.&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the Voyager, along with the [[Dodge Caravan#First generation (1984–1990)|Dodge Caravan]], are considered to be the first mass produced vehicles to have dedicated built in [[Cup holder|cup holders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2013/03/08/when-did-cars-get-cup-holders/|title=When Did Cars Get Cup Holders? - Sociological Images|last=Pages|first=The Society|language=en|access-date=2019-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bonappetit.com/trends/article/the-history-of-the-car-cup-holder|title=The History of the Car Cup Holder|last=Dean|first=Sam|website=Bon Appetit|language=en|access-date=2019-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later commercials in 1989 featured rock singer [[Tina Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl2HV4UlZ84 "1989 Tina Turner Plymouth Voyager Commercial"], retrieved on 2010–08–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian commercials in 1990 featured pop singer [[Celine Dion]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi5t4AxvKKg "Celine Dion : 1990 Dodge Caravan &amp; Plymouth Voyager"], retrieved on 2010–08–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seating===
1984-1986 Voyagers could be equipped for five, six, seven passengers, with an eight-passenger variant available only in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure "1986 Plymouth full-line"&lt;/ref&gt; Five-passenger seating, standard on all trim levels, consisted of two front bucket seats and an intermediate three-passenger bench seat. In 1985, on base and SE models, the front buckets could be replaced by a 40/60 split three-passenger bench seat, bringing the total number of occupants to six. Seven-passenger seating was an option on SEs and LEs, with dual front buckets, an intermediate two-passenger bench, and a rear three-passenger bench. Eight-passenger seating was available on SE models only, with both the additional middle two-passenger bench and three-passenger front bench. Depending on configuration, the base model could seat up to six, the SE could seat up to eight, and the LE could seat up to seven.

The two bench seats in the rear were independently removable (though not foldable), and the large three-seat bench could also be installed in the 2nd row location via a second set of attachment points on the van's floor, ordinarily hidden with snap-in plastic covers. This configuration allowed for conventional five-passenger seating with a sizable cargo area in the rear. The latching mechanisms for the benches were very intuitive and easy to operate.

On base models, the front buckets were low-back items, upholstered with plain cloth or vinyl. On SEs, the buyer could choose between low-back buckets with deluxe cloth or high-back buckets in upgraded vinyl. LEs came standard with high-back front buckets, upholstered in either luxury cloth or luxury vinyl.

In 1985 and 1986, there was also a five-passenger version with a back seat that could be folded flat with the pull of a handle into a bed that filled the rear compartment from the back of the front seats to the rear. This option was known as the Magic Camper. The Magic Camper back seat had an extra rear-facing cushion that formed the back-most section of the bed when folded flat and the seat, though very heavy, was removable. The Magic Camper option included a tent that attached magnetically to the side of the vehicle allowing access in and out of the sliding side door.

For 1987 the six- and eight-passenger options were withdrawn, leaving seating for five standard and for seven optional on the base and SE, and seating for seven with high-back front buckets standard on the LE, Grand SE, and Grand LE. Deluxe cloth upholstery was now standard on base and all SE models, with the luxury vinyl optional on SEs. On LEs, luxury cloth came standard and for the first time, leather seats were available on the LE models.

===Engines===

[[File:87-90 Plymouth Grand Voyager SE.jpg|thumb|1987-1990 Plymouth Grand Voyager SE]]

For the first 3 years of production, two [[inline-4]] engines with 2 barrel [[carburetors]] were offered. The base [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2L]] was borrowed from the Chrysler [[Chrysler K Platform|K-cars]], and produced {{convert|96|hp|kW|abbr=on}} horsepower. The higher performance fuel injected version of the [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2L]] engine later offered in the Chrysler [[Chrysler K Platform|K-cars]] was only offered in the Voyager for the 1987 model year, and would remain the base powerplant until mid-1987. Alongside the [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2L]], an optional Mitsubishi [[Astron 2.6|2.6L]] engine was available producing {{convert|104|hp|kW|abbr=on}} horsepower.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.allpar.com/model/m/original-minivans.html&lt;/ref&gt;

At launch, the Voyager's low [[power-to-weight ratio|horsepower to weight ratio]] had not been much of a concern. Its main competitors were the [[Toyota Van]] and the [[Volkswagen Type 2 (T3)|Volkswagen Vanagon]], both of which offered similar performance. In mid-1987, the base [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2L]] [[Straight-4|I4]] was replaced with a [[fuel-injected]] [[Chrysler K engine#2.5|2.5L]] [[Straight-4|I4]], which produced {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while the [[Mitsubishi Astron engine|Mitsubishi ''G54B'']] [[Straight-4|I4]] was replaced with the new [[fuel-injected]] [[Mitsubishi 6G7x engine#6G72|3.0L Mitsubishi]] [[V6 engine|V-6]] producing {{convert|136|hp|kW|abbr=on}} in March of that year.

A [[Chrysler K engine#2.5 Turbo|turbocharged version]] of the base 2.5L producing {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} was available in 1989 and 1990. Also in 1989, revisions to the Mitsubishi V-6 upped its output to {{convert|142|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. In 1990, a new {{convert|150|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.3|3.3L V-6]] was added to the option list. Sales of the 2.5 turbo dwindled as a result, and it was dropped at the end of the year.

===Transmissions===
Both a three-speed TorqueFlite [[automatic transmission]] and a five-speed manual were available with all [[inline-4]] engines, including the turbocharged 2.5 [[Liter|L]] (this was a rare combination). [[V6 engine|V-6]] engines were only offered with the venerable fully hydraulically operated [[TorqueFlite]], until the computer controlled [[Ultradrive]] 4-speed automatic became available in 1989. The [[Ultradrive]] offered much better fuel economy and responsiveness, particularly when paired with the [[inline-4]] engine.

[[File:91-95 Plymouth Voyager.jpg|thumb|left|1992-1993 Plymouth Voyager]]

The Plymouth Voyager was modified for 1991 with new sheet metal. The S platform was still used, though renamed the "AS platform". These were the last Voyagers that were derived from the [[Chrysler K platform]].

Trim levels were carried over from the previous generation. 1991 Voyagers were available in base, mid-grade ''SE'', high-end ''LE'', and high-end sporty ''LX''. The LX which was available only on short-wheelbase Voyagers, was marketed as a sport-luxury minivan and came with the most standard equipment including alloy wheels, [[Automotive lighting|fog lamps]], and wide array of power-operated features.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Chrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure "1991 Plymouth Voyager/Grand Voyager"&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years various trim packages were offered on SE models. The "Sport Wagon" package available from 1993–1995 featured accent color (gray) bumpers and [[molding (automotive)|molding]], fog lamps, and special aluminum wheels.&lt;ref name="Used Plymouth Prices"&gt;[http://www.edmunds.com/used/plymouth/index.html "Used Plymouth Prices"], retrieved on 2010–08–23.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Rallye" package offered in 1995, took the place of the departed ''LX'' model. It was more luxury-oriented, with lower body two-tone paint — regardless of upper body color, the lower body was painted "Driftwood Beige" — silver aluminum wheels, and special badging.&lt;ref name="Used Plymouth Prices"/&gt; The [[font]] first used for the Rallye's badging was adopted for all of Plymouth's badging from 1996 onward.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.allpar.com/model/m/1991-voyager.html "1991-1995 Chrysler minivans: Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager, Chrysler Town &amp; Country" Information courtesy of Chrysler, allpar], retrieved on 2010–08–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interiors were more differentiated in this generation than on the first with a redesigned dashboard for 1994 featured a passenger-side front airbag.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and a seating package, marketed as "Quad Command" seating package, available on SE, LE, and LX models. Quad command replaced the 2nd row bench with two individual bucket seats with a center aisle to the 3rd row bench. Interior options varied with trim levels and packages. Cloth seating was standard on all models; leather seating was a standalone extra-cost option on LE and LX models.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Only badging and minor cosmetics differentiated the Voyager from its [[Dodge Caravan]] rebadged variant.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The Chrysler Town &amp; Country shared the Voyager's headlamps and taillights along with its own chrome waterfall grille. In Mexico, the Voyager was sold as a Chrysler and shared the chrome waterfall grille with the Town &amp; Country.

===Innovations===
This generation of vans brought additional innovations, including:
* "Quad Command" bucket seating (1990)
* Available [[All-wheel drive]] (1990)
* Available [[anti-lock brakes]] (1990)
* First driver's side [[airbag]] in a minivan (1991), made standard (1991), and first dual front airbags (1993)
* Integrated child safety seats (1991), improved design with recliners (1993)
* First minivan to meet 1998 U.S. federal safety standards (1993)

The turbocharged engine and Convert-A-Bed feature were dropped.&lt;ref name="allpar"/&gt;

{{clear}}

===Year-to-year changes===
* 1991: Second-generation minivans released. A driver's side airbag was made standard for this year. Integrated child safety seats in the second row bench were optional on 1992 Voyagers. The Grand Voyager was available with a lower-cost powertrain. A {{Convert|142|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.0 L V6 and a 3-speed automatic could be substituted for the standard {{Convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.3 L V6 with its 4-speed automatic. The 5-speed manual transmission could once again be paired with the base engine, which was now the 2.5 liter four instead of the original 2.2 liter four.
* 1993: On 7-passenger models, the optional "Quad Command" bucket seats replaced the middle bench seat. The right bucket tilted forward to ease entry and exit to the rearmost bench. The front shoulder belts became height-adjustable and rear shoulder belts had lower anchor points and the horn button was black.
* 1994: New bumpers and body moldings, and a redesigned dashboard appeared on all 1994 Voyagers. New safety features which included a passenger-side airbag and side door-guard beams enabled the Voyager to meet all passenger car safety requirements through 1998. A cassette player became standard on all models but the base, and a CD player was available on all models. Under the hood, a {{Convert|162|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.8 L V6 was a new option for top-of-the-line Grand Voyager LE models. The 3.3 L V6 had been upgraded to produce {{Convert|162|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} as well. For 1994 the "10 Year Anniversary Edition" was an option on Voyager ''SE'' models; it had unique two-tone paint and badges.
* 1995: No major changes were made for 1995, except for the new ''Rallye'' option package available on ''SE'' models. Rallye models came with special silver-accent wheels and special two-toned paint on the lower body.

{{main|Chrysler minivans (NS)}}

The 1996 Plymouth Voyager was completely redesigned from the ground up. Gone were its [[Chrysler K platform|K-car]] underpinnings and architecture, replaced with more modern components and Chrysler's acclaimed [[cab-forward]] design. The third generation redesign used the [[Chrysler S platform|Chrysler NS platform]] and included a driver's-side sliding door, a minivan first. The Voyager was on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 1996 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120724084058/http://www.caranddriver.sg/features/archive/1996_10best_cars-10best_cars "1996 10Best Cars"], retrieved on 2010–08–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caranddriver.sg/features/archive/1997_10best_cars-10best_cars "1997 10Best Cars"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120730194234/http://www.caranddriver.sg/features/archive/1997_10best_cars-10best_cars |date=2012-07-30 }}, retrieved on 2010–08–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a shift from previous minivans, the third-generation Voyager was marketed as the entry-level Chrysler minivan rather than as a direct counterpart of the Dodge Caravan.  While sharing the same bodyshell, the Voyager and Caravan saw significant changes in body trim and feature content.  Distinguished by a dark gray eggcrate grille (a body-color grille became an option in 1998), the Voyager used matte gray bumpers across all trim levels with matte gray side moldings.   Before calendar year 1996, the NS Voyager was produced with the Pentastar grille emblem and rear badging carried over from the previous model year, shifting to the "sailboat" Plymouth grille emblem and new badging in script font afterward.  

The Voyager retained the base, SE, and LE trims from its predecessor.  To reduce model overlap, the LE trim was discontinued in the United States (in favor of an expanded Town &amp; Country range).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Yates, Brock W |title=The Critical Path: Inventing an Automobile and Reinventing a Corporation (1st Edition) |publisher=Little, Brown |year=1996 |page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; To allow the Plymouth brand to remain competitive, the Rallye option package was introduced on the SE trim&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure "1996 Plymouth Voyager/Grand Voyager"&lt;/ref&gt;; along with exterior badging, the Rallye offered interior content featured in LE-trim Voyagers and Caravans.  For 1998, the Rallye trim was renamed Expresso.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure "1998 Plymouth Voyager"&lt;/ref&gt;

Third generation Voyagers and Grand Voyagers were equipped nearly identically to their Dodge counterparts, save for front fascias, badging, and the wheels on LE-trim vans, which are shared with the Town &amp; Country. However, to maintain its position as the entry-level minivan, the Voyager was never produced with automatic headlights, fog lights, power driver's seat and power mirror memory, or auto-dimming rear view mirrors. All-wheel drive was also discontinued in some markets. The vinyl woodgrain-appearance side paneling was no longer available, as the new side sheetmetal was no longer flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Yates, Brock W |title=The Critical Path: Inventing and Automobile and Reinventing a Corporation (1st Edition) |publisher=Little, Brown |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third generation Voyagers introduced a new system of rear seats to simplify installation, removal, and re-positioning&amp;mdash; marketed as "Easy-Out Roller Seats". All Voyagers and Grand Voyagers were equipped with this feature. When installed, the 2nd and 3rd row seats (either bucket or bench seats) are latched to floor-mounted strikers. When unlatched, eight rollers lifted each seat, allowing it to be rolled fore and aft. Tracks had locator depressions for rollers, thus enabling simple installation. Ergonomic levers at the seatbacks released the floor latches single-handedly without tools and raised the seats onto the rollers in a single motion. Additionally, seatbacks were designed to fold forward. Seat roller tracks were permanently attached to the floor and seat stanchions were aligned, facilitating the longitudinal rolling of the seats. Bench seat stanchions were moved inboard to reduce bending stress in the seat frames, allowing them to be lighter.

===Engines===
* 1996–2000 2.4&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Chrysler Neon engine#2.4 and 2.4 Turbo|EDZ]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]], {{convert|150|hp|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|167|lbft|N.m|abbr=on}} (Canadian vans beginning in 1999 included a 3.0 L V6 as standard equipment)

===Year-to-year changes===
* 1996: As running changes during this model year, the Pentastar front logo and rear badging carried over from the previous generation were replaced with the new "sailboat" logo and script font, while the front interior door panels were redesigned, losing the discrete grab handles in favor of ones integrated into the armrests. Another running change saw the elimination of the plastic intake manifold cover from the 3.8L engine.
* 1997: A CD player was a new option. Other than that, only minimal changes.
* 1998: Grocery bag hooks were added to the rearmost bench. The Rallye package was renamed Expresso and now included new wheel covers (if equipped with steel wheels), a standard CD player and a body-colored grille). SE models with optional low-back seats and LE models received updated cloth upholstery. As a running change during this model year, the HVAC vents on the driver's side and in the center of the dashboard were changed to a more conventional design.
* 1999: The 3.8 L V6 was made available for front-wheel drive SE models. A small [[cargo net]] between the front seats, additional standard equipment, integrated child-safety seats and second-row buckets were added to the Voyager this year. Air conditioning was made standard on ''SE'' models. In Canada, the 3.0L V6 was made standard equipment. 1999 also saw the addition of a one-year-only 15th anniversary "Platinum Edition", to mark Caravan's 15th year of production. This package was offered on various trim levels, and included Platinum Metallic paint, and fender badges.
* 2000: Now standard on all models was air conditioning, power windows, and power locks (the latter two standard on ''SE'' models only). A dealer-installed rear-seat video entertainment system was newly available on all models. The 2000 model year offered packages which included the "2000+" and "Millennium" package; however these were little more than unique fender badges on vans with popular equipment. As Chrysler withdrew the Plymouth brand, the Voyager was marketed by both Chrysler and Plymouth during this model year.

===Crash test results===
The 1996-2000 Dodge Grand Caravan (twin of the Voyager/Grand Voyager) received a "Marginal" rating in the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]'s 40&amp;nbsp;mph offset test. The structural performance and restraints were graded "Acceptable", but the foot injuries were very high.

In the NHTSA crash tests, it received 4 stars for the driver and front passenger in the frontal-impact. In the side-impact test, it received 5 stars for the driver, and 3 stars for the rear occupant, and resulted in a fuel leak that could cause a fire hazard.

==Discontinuation==
[[File:'02-'03 Chrysler Voyager.jpg|thumb|'02-'03 Chrysler Voyager]]
{{main|Chrysler_Voyager#Generation_IV|l1=Fourth Generation Chrysler Voyager}}
Following the retirement of the Plymouth brand after the 2000 model year, the Voyager nameplate was moved to Chrysler.  Slotted below the Chrysler Town &amp; Country, the Chrysler Voyager was offered solely in a short-wheelbase configuration; along with matte-black bumpers, the grille of Voyager was styled with the Chrysler emblem at the top (a design carried over to the later [[Chrysler PT Cruiser|PT Cruiser]]).  

For 2004, the Chrysler Voyager was discontinued in the United States and Canada and replaced by a short-wheelbase Town &amp; Country (the Voyager lasted through 2007 in Mexico).  The Voyager nameplate would skip the fifth-generation Chrysler minivans entirely, reappearing for the 2020 model year as a lower-trim version of the [[Chrysler Pacifica (minivan)|Chrysler Pacifica]] minivan and replacement for the [[Dodge Grand Caravan]].

'''Plymouth Belvedere''' is a series of [[United States|American]] [[automobile]] models made by [[Chrysler]] from 1954 to 1970 that were marketed under the [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] brand.

The Belvedere name was first used for a new [[hardtop]] body style in the Plymouth Cranbrook line for the 1951 model year. In 1954 the Belvedere replaced the Cranbrook as the top trim and became a full model line with [[sedan (car)|sedan]]s, [[station wagon]]s and [[convertible]] body styles. The Belvedere continued as Plymouth's full-sized car until 1965, when it became an intermediate, and was replaced after the 1970 model year by the [[Plymouth Satellite|Satellite]], a name originally used for the top-trim level Belvederes.

Introduced on March 31, the 1951 Plymouth Cranbrook Belvedere is a two-door pillarless [[hardtop]]. It was Plymouth's first such body design and was introduced in response to the 1950 [[Chevrolet Bel Air]], and the [[1949 Ford#1951|Ford Victoria]], the first two-door hardtop in the low-priced American market.

The Cranbook Belvedere was the name for the two-door hardtop version of the [[Plymouth Cranbrook|Cranbrook]] and built on the same {{convert|118.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase. Powering the Belvedere is the [[Chrysler flathead engine|Chrysler flathead]] {{convert|217.8|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[straight-6]] engine with a 7.00:1 compression ratio producing {{convert|97|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} (SAE gross).

For 1952, Plymouth kept the Cranbrook Belvedere largely unchanged. The biggest alteration was to the color scheme; to further distinguish the top-level Belvedere from other Plymouths, the two tones now flowed from the roof over the beltline onto the trunk, which has been referred to as the "saddleback" treatment. Two-tone color schemes were "sable bronze" over suede, black over "mint green", and gray over blue. Overdrive was made available as optional equipment in the 1952 Plymouth. In overdrive, the engine made three revolutions for each rear wheel revolution and four without overdrive. The engine was a complete carryover from 1951. Production for 1951 and 1952 totalled 51,266 units.

The Belvedere remained a part of the Cranbrook series through the 1953 model year, which saw all Plymouth models completely restyled. Major style changes include a shorter {{convert|114|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase, a one-piece windshield, flush rear fenders, and a lower hood line. In April 1953, Plymouths received the Hy-Drive [[semi-automatic transmission]]. The engine was carried over from 1952 with the only enhancement being a slight increase in the compression ratio to 7.10:1, which yielded a rating of {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

A total of 35,185 1953 Belvederes were sold.

The Belvedere replaced the Cranbrook as the top-line offering for 1954. Now, a separate model instead of just a two-door hardtop, it was also available as a [[convertible]], two-door [[station wagon]], and four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]. The two-door hardtop version was now called the "Sport Coupe". 1954 Belevederes featured full-length rocker sill moldings.&lt;ref name=Gunnell650/&gt;

Minor styling updates adorned the carry-over body design. For the first time, small chrome [[Car tailfin|tailfins]] appeared on the rear fenders.

In March 1954, Plymouth finally offered a fully automatic transmission, the Chrysler PowerFlite two-speed. Also new was a larger standard engine: a {{convert|230.2|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} I6 that was also used by the Dodge Division. Power was now rated at {{convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

Belvedere production totaled 32,492 for the year.

All Plymouths were treated to a major overhaul for the 1955 model year. This was the first year of Chrysler Stylist [[Virgil Exner]]'s "Forward Look." The Belvedere returned as top-of-the-line.

For 1956, Plymouth styling evolved from that of the 1955s. Most notable would be the introduction of the first push-button automatic transmission to appear in an American automobile, and a more dramatic rear-end treatment highlighted by a pair of rakish tail-fins. In early 1956, the [[Plymouth Fury|Fury]] joined the Belvedere line as a special-edition high-performance coupe.  Belvedere remained the top full-line series through 1958. In 1956, Plymouth added seat belts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Plymouth/1956%20Plymouth/album/1956%20Plymouth-05.html |title=Directory Index: Plymouth/1956 Plymouth/album |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=2011-11-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930154753/http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Plymouth/1956%20Plymouth/album/1956%20Plymouth-05.html |archivedate=September 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Chrysler's [[George Huebner|chief engineer]] in a public relations campaign took a Belvedere and had a turbine engine fitted instead of the standard gasoline engine, and was driven across the US.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QuEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jLnBT_OmOpT3gAfc2_WlBQ&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAjgy#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "We Drove A Turbine Car Coast-To-Coast."] ''Popular Mechanics'', June 1956, pp. 72-76/252.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1957 model year had high sales for the Chrysler Corporation, and for the Plymouth line.  Plymouth's design was so revolutionary that Chrysler used the slogan "Suddenly, it's 1960!" to promote the new car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Plymouth/1957-Plymouth/1957-Plymouth-1624331561/1957-Plymouth-Prestige-02-03 |title=1957 Plymouth prestige brochure |pages=2–3 |work=oldcarbrochures.org |accessdate=26 April 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509102700/http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Plymouth/1957-Plymouth/1957-Plymouth-1624331561/1957-Plymouth-Prestige-02-03 |archivedate=9 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard on all body styles except the convertible was the "Powerflow 6" L-head engine. The convertible was only V8 powered and V8s were available in other Belvederes with an optional "Fury" {{convert|301|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} version as well as a "High-Performance PowerPAC" at extra cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Plymouth/1957-Plymouth/1957-Plymouth-1624331561/1957-Plymouth-Prestige-12 |page=12 |title=Specifications: 1957 Plymouth brochure |work=oldcarbrochures.org |accessdate=26 April 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509075143/http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Plymouth/1957-Plymouth/1957-Plymouth-1624331561/1957-Plymouth-Prestige-12 |archivedate=9 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A manual transmission was standard with the push-button two-speed [[PowerFlite]] optional and the push-button three-speed [[TorqueFlite]] automatic also optional on V8 cars.

The Belvedere would once again return as a top level trim for 1958 for the last time. Styling was a continuation from the 1957 models. A big block "B" engine of 350&amp;nbsp;in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; V8 with dual four-barrel carburetors dubbed "[[Chrysler B engine|Golden Commando]]" was optional on all models.  For 1959, the Fury became the top range with a full array of sedans and coupes, and the Belvedere became the middle range.  The Savoy became the least expensive model, and the Plaza was discontinued.

The convertible was only available in the Belvedere model between 1956 and 1958.

The 1957-58 Belvedere two-door hardtop gained notoriety from the movie ''[[Christine (1983 film)|Christine]]'' (1983)based on the novel by Stephen King.  In the opening scene, which the titles set as "Detroit, 1957", Christine appears near the end of the assembly line as a lone bright red car in a long line of Buckskin Beige Furys being built for the new model year (1958). (In the novel it is revealed that her first owner, Roland Lebay had ordered her with custom paint, as the standard 1958 Fury came only in beige.) For the movie Christine is painted "toreador red" with an "iceberg white" top.

Starting in 1960, Belvederes got a brand-new standard [[Straight-6|inline six]]-cylinder engine replacing the venerable valve-in-block "flathead" six.  Colloquially known as the [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine|Slant Six]], it [[engine displacement|displace]]d {{convert|225|cid|l|abbr=on}}, featured overhead valves, and a block that was inclined 30 degrees to the right to permit a lower hood line with maximum displacement. This engine used a single-barrel Holley carburetor, and became known for its extremely rugged construction, exceptional reliability and longevity. V-8 engines continued to be optionally available, in displacements of {{convert|318|cid|l|abbr=on}} and {{convert|361|cid|l|abbr=on}}.

Unit body construction was introduced throughout the line, though it appeared on certain Plymouths in earlier years such as the 1953 hardtop coupe.  This eliminated the [[vehicle frame|frame]], and was advertised as Unibody.  Under Chrysler president William Newberg, Virgil Exner's styling team was encouraged to go "over the top" with distinctive styling, leading the 1960 models to be popularly dubbed the "jukebox on wheels" and the 1961 models to be widely considered among the ugliest cars ever mass-produced.  Despite being remarkable cars in performance, handling, modest weight, and appealing interiors, sales suffered, and Plymouth yielded third place in sales to [[Rambler (automobile)|Rambler]].

The 1962 model year full-size Plymouths were "downsized", with more compact outside dimensions. American car buyers at the time were in the thought mode of "bigger is better", and sales of these models suffered. However, the smaller Plymouth provided greater owner approval in their actual use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=reEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=1962+Plymouth+Belvedere |title=Smaller Plymouth wins greater owner approval |pages=95–99, 246, 248, 250 |date=February 1962 |journal=Popular Mechanics |volume=117 |issue=2 |accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Plymouth Belvedere with six-cylinder engine and automatic transmission was compared to the intermediate-size Ford Fairlane and the compact-size Chevrolet Chevy II in an economy test by ''Popular Mechanics'' and the road test concluded that the Belvedere was "a very pleasant transportation package."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=POEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=1962+Plymouth+Belvedere |title=Drive Comparing Ford Fairlane, Plymouth Belvedere, Chevy II |pages=104–108, 244, 245 |first=James |last=Whipple |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=January 1962 |volume=117 |issue=1 |accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another advantage of the smaller and lighter body was in drag racing.

The 1963 and 1964 models used the same unibody platform as the 1962s, but were restyled to look longer and wider.

The 1964 Belvedere (and corresponding Fury hardtop coupes) featured a new "slant-back" roofline that proved to be popular, and sales improved significantly over the previous design.

The 1964 Belvedere was also the car used to introduce the 426 [[Chrysler Hemi engine]], which used a canted large-valve arrangement. This was such a significant high-RPM breathing improvement that Hemi-equipped Plymouth Belvederes won first, second, and third at NASCAR's 1964 Daytona race. One of the winning drivers was [[Richard Petty]].&lt;ref name="allpar"&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://allpar.com/racing/petty-plymouth-racing.html |title=Which came first, the Plymouth or the Petty? |work=Allpar |year=2003 |first=Curtis |last=Redgap |accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 Plymouth once again made the Fury a full-size car, and Belvedere ostensibly became the intermediate size offering, though in fact the Belvedere was little changed, and most dimensions and weights remained the same—the Fury was merely enlarged, restoring a full-sized line which Plymouth had been sorely lacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1965-1967-plymouth-belvedere-satellite-gtx.htm/printable|title=1965, 1966, 1967 Plymouth Belvedere/Satellite and GTX|publisher=HowStuffWorks  |date=6 December 2007 |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Belvedere line was divided into the Belvedere I, Belvedere II and Satellite subseries, the latter available only as hardtop coupe and convertible, and featuring the {{convert|273|cid|l|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler LA engine|"LA block"]] V-8 as standard equipment.  The line was restyled in 1966, and the high-performance [[Plymouth GTX|GTX]] was added in 1967.

The pilot episode for the television show ''[[Adam-12]]'' featured a 1967 Belvedere as the standard [[Los_Angeles_Police_Department|LAPD]] police cruiser.

In 1968, the Belvedere - along with the rest of Chrysler's B-body offerings - was reskinned with "[[Coke bottle styling]]." The Belvedere II was dropped, but the [[Plymouth_Satellite|Sport Satellite]] was added to the overall lineup, using the same sheetmetal.

The new LA-style lightweight 318 engine was introduced for this year and would remain available on the Belvedere through its life. The [[Plymouth Road Runner]] was introduced as a low-price, high-performance alternative to the GTX, and Richard Petty won the Grand National championship in NASCAR in a Belvedere.  However the GTX came standard with the 440 CID engine and the Road Runner with the 383 Magnum, with the only engine options being the 440 six barrel or the 426 HEMI engines.

The Belvedere name was dropped at the end of the 1970 model year, replaced by the Satellite name originally reserved for higher-end Belvederes. It lasted only through 1974, becoming the Fury in 1975 when the longer-wheelbase Fury model became the Gran Fury.

==Police==
Belvederes were used in police service from the late 1960s to the early 1970s, when they were replaced by the [[Plymouth Gran Fury]].  They were prominent in both the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] and [[New York Police Department]].

==Australian production==
[[File:1958 Belvedere 4 dr htop also oz asmbld 58,59==.JPG|thumb|Chrysler Australia also produced the 4 door Hardtop in 1958]]

The Plymouth Belvedere was also produced by [[Chrysler Australia]]. The first model, based on the 1953 US Plymouth, featured a high level of Australian content, with body panels pressed in Chrysler Australia's [[Keswick, South Australia|Keswick]] facility in [[South Australia]] and matched with a 217.8 cubic inch (4107cc) side-valve six-cylinder engine, imported from Chrysler UK.&lt;ref name=Brimble&gt;David Brimble, Chryslers before the Chrysler Royal, Restored Cars, No 87 (July / August 1991), pages 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced as a four-door sedan&lt;ref name=Brimble/&gt; and as a locally developed two-door [[coupe utility]],&lt;ref&gt;Larry O'Toole, The Good Old Aussie Ute, page 192&lt;/ref&gt; along with similar Cranbrook and Savoy models, until it was replaced by the [[Chrysler Royal (Australia)|Chrysler Royal]] in 1957.&lt;ref name=Brimble/&gt; The Belvedere was reintroduced to the Australian market in early 1958 when Chrysler Australia began assembling the current model Belvedere four-door hardtop which was imported from the US in [[Complete knock down|knocked-down form]].&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, 2010, page 74&lt;/ref&gt; The 1959 model was equipped with a 318 cubic inch V8 engine and push-button automatic transmission.&lt;ref name=AMS&gt;News Review, Three Chryslers, Australian Motor Sports, August 1959&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysler Australia replaced their Plymouth Belvedere, [[Dodge Custom Royal]] and [[De Soto Firesweep]] models with the [[Dodge Phoenix]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, 2010, page 77&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oklahoma centennial==
{{main article|Miss Belvedere}}

During [[Oklahoma]]'s 50th anniversary, a new 1957 Plymouth Belvedere was sealed in a concrete enclosure as a time capsule in downtown [[Tulsa]] on the grounds of the brand new county courthouse. It was unearthed June 14, 2007&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unburiedcar.com&lt;/ref&gt; during the state's centennial celebrations, and was publicly unveiled on June 15.  In line with the [[Cold War]] realities of late 1950s America, the concrete enclosure was advertised as having been built to withstand a nuclear attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/06/23/buried.classic.ap/index.html CNN:] link broke. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706155304/http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/06/23/buried.classic.ap/index.html |date=July 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concrete enclosure, however, was not airtight and allowed water to leak in, which caused significant damage to the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=World staff |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/webextra/content/2007/buriedcarunearthed/articles.aspx?articleID=070613_1__Theva21346 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130204200651/http://www.tulsaworld.com/webextra/content/2007/buriedcarunearthed/articles.aspx?articleID=070613_1__Theva21346 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-02-04 |title=Buried Belvedere vault full of water |publisher=TulsaWorld |accessdate=2011-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=070615_1__Belve56612 |title=Updated: Belvedere rusty but still has personality |publisher=TulsaWorld |date=2007-06-15 |accessdate=2011-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927114823/http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=070615_1__Belve56612 |archive-date=2011-09-27 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; televised vehicle customizer [[Boyd Coddington]] was to have been the first to start the unburied car, had it been operable.

The car was the prize of a 1957 contest to guess the population of Tulsa in the year 2007. The winning entrant, one Raymond Humbertson, guessed 384,743 versus the actual figure of 382,457. However, Humbertson died in 1979 and now only distant relatives remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=070623_238_A1_spanc67588 |title=Miss Belvedere, you have a winner: But Raymond Humbertson died in 1979 |publisher=TulsaWorld |date=2007-06-23 |accessdate=2011-11-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130205133617/http://tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=070623_238_A1_spanc67588 |archivedate=2013-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second such car, this one a [[Plymouth Prowler]], was encased in a vault in Tulsa's Centennial Park (formerly Central Park) 1998 to celebrate the city's centennial.  After it was discovered what had become of the 1957 Belvedere, the Prowler was moved above ground, and a mound was formed over it.  It is to be revealed after the same period of time as the Belvedere, in 2048.

The '''Plymouth Gran Fury''' is a [[full-size]]d [[automobile]] that was manufactured by [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] from 1975 to 1989. The nameplate would be used on successive [[Downsize (automobile)|downsizings]], first in 1980, and again in 1982, through what would originally have been intermediate and compact classes in the early 1970s, all with conventional rear-wheel drive layouts. By the time Chrysler ended M-body production in December 1988 (1989 model year), they were Chrysler's last remaining rear-wheel drive cars, with a V8 and carburetor, a configuration used since the mid-1950s. Plymouth did not have another rear-wheel drive car until the 1997 [[Plymouth Prowler|Prowler]] roadster.

After [[Chevrolet]] ended production of its full-sized [[Chevrolet Caprice|Caprice]] sedan in 1996, [[Ford]] continued production of its V8 powered rear-wheel drive [[Panther platform]] models through September 2011. In 2013, GM announced the end of [[Zeta platform]] manufacturing in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Diego|title=Bad News From Oz: No More Holden Caprice After 2017|url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/2014/08/bad-news-from-oz-no-more-holden-caprice-after-2017/|website=GM Authority|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; by 2017. At the end of 2001, the Plymouth nameplate had been discontinued, but in 2005, Chrysler's 300 and Dodge Magnum, as well as the 2006 Charger and 2008 Challenger, brought full-sized V6 and V8 powered rear- (and all-wheel-drive) sedans back to their lineup, thereby leaving [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]] as the only American manufacturer of full-sized V8/RWD passenger sedans.

Before 1975, the top line models in Plymouth's Fury series were known as the "Fury Gran Coupe" and "Fury Gran Sedan". The Fury Gran Coupe model was introduced in 1970 as a highly trimmed pillared coupe. It moved to the two-door hardtop body for 1971, when a "Fury Gran Coupe" hardtop sedan was also available, renamed "Fury Gran Sedan" for 1972. The Gran Coupe and Gran Sedan models continued in 1973.

In 1975, the mid-size [[Chrysler B platform|B-body]] [[Plymouth Satellite]] was restyled and renamed [[Plymouth Fury]]. As a result, the previous full-sized [[Chrysler C platform|C-body]] Fury became known as the Gran Fury. Because the C-body Fury had been redesigned for 1974, the 1975 Gran Fury received few changes besides its new name. Top-of-the-line Gran Fury Brougham models were treated to a new grille and new single-unit headlight design; all Gran Furys would receive this for 1976.

[[File:1977 Plymouth Gran Fury 5.9 Rear.jpg|thumb|left|1977 Gran Fury 4-door sedan]]

This generation was available as a 2-door coupe, 2-door hardtop, 4-door sedan, 4-door hardtop, and 4-door station wagon. All models with the exception of the wagons rode on the {{convert|121.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase shared with the [[Dodge Monaco]]. Gran Fury Suburban wagons rode on a longer {{convert|124|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase that was also used by Monaco wagons and all full-sized Chryslers and Imperials. The 1975 Gran Fury was available in four trim levels:&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of American Cars "Plymouth" p.717: "Plymouth Production Figures."&lt;/ref&gt; base (sedan and coupe only), "Custom" (all models), "Brougham" (coupe and hardtop only), and "Sport Suburban" (wagon only). Changes for 1976 were minimal. The 4-door hardtop body style was eliminated, leaving only coupes, sedans, and wagons. With this, sedans were now available in deluxe Brougham trim. Offerings were trimmed for the C-body Gran Fury's final model year, 1977. The mid-range Custom trim level was dropped, leaving only base and high-end Brougham coupes and sedans. 1977 Gran Fury wagons were available in either base Suburban or high-end Sport Suburban models. All full-sized C-body Plymouths were discontinued at the end of the 1977 model year, leaving the mid-size B-body Fury to soldier on as Plymouth's large car for 1978.

Sales of all of the Chrysler Corporation's C-body models for the 1974-1978 model years were considerably disappointing; the Plymouth Gran Fury was no exception. This is because 1973 introduction of the redesigned 1974 model year C-bodies coincided with the [[1973 oil crisis]]. As gas prices skyrocketed, demand for gas-guzzling full-sized cars took a nosedive. C-body offerings decreased throughout the 1974-1978 design cycle. Imperials were the first to go after 1975. Plymouth and Dodge C-bodies were dropped after the 1977 model year. Chrysler C-bodies were discontinued after 1978. The discontinuation of the Gran Fury was followed by the discontinuation of the mid-size Fury after the 1978 model year. This huge gap in Plymouth's lineup left the compact [[Plymouth Volare|Volaré]] as Plymouth's largest car for 1979. A redesigned downsized Gran Fury would return in 1980.

When the downsized "R-body" cars were introduced for 1979, a Plymouth version included,as the low-end [[Chrysler Newport]] was intended to fill this gap. Although the Newport achieved this and 1979 sales were fairly strong, there was still heavy demand for a full-sized Plymouth model.&lt;ref name="allpar.com"&gt;[http://www.allpar.com/cars/dodge/R-bodies.html "Chrysler Corporation R Bodies: 1979-1981 Downsized, Full-Sized Cars" Information courtesy of Chrysler, allpar], retrieved on 2010–07–01.&lt;/ref&gt; So finally in 1980 the Gran Fury returned after a two-model-year absence.

This downsized Gran Fury was available only as a "pillared hardtop" 4-door sedan, this time based on the heavily restyled, but not re-engineered [[Chrysler R platform|R platform]], introduced in 1979 in response to redesigned Chevrolet and Ford models. The "new" R-body was heavily based on Chrysler's old mid-size B-body platform, introduced in 1962 and updated several times thereafter. Nearly identical to the concurrent Chrysler Newport, it was intended to satisfy dealer requests for a lower-priced [[full-size]] model but more importantly to fulfill fleet orders,&lt;ref name="allpar.com"/&gt; primarily for police and taxi use.

The 1980 Plymouth Gran Fury was available in two versions, Base and Salon. Gran Fury Salon offered more standard features, including a vinyl-covered roof, higher-grade interior cloth, split-bench seat, chrome body-side trim, and deluxe wheel covers. Like its sibling, the [[Dodge St. Regis]], the R-Body Gran Fury was very popular with fleet customers, especially police departments (by ordering the A38 ''Police Package'' coupled with a 195 bhp E58 360 cu in engine); both the [[Michigan State Police]] and the [[Ohio State Highway Patrol]] ordered substantial numbers of the cars. In light of this, the 1980 Gran Fury achieved the highest sales (18,750) of any R-body that year.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of American Cars, 2006 Edition p.278; 362; 717: "Plymouth Production Figures."&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2nd Generation Plymouth Gran Fury was short-lived, being discontinued midway through the 1981 model year, along with the other R-body models, due to slow sales.&lt;ref name="allpar.com"/&gt; This can be mainly attributed to poor fuel economy, as well as its outdated platform. The 1981 Gran Fury was also the last true full-size car to bear the [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] name, until the brand's demise twenty years later.

In 1982, Plymouth downsized the Gran Fury again, this time sharing the mid-size [[Chrysler M platform|M platform]] with the [[Chrysler Fifth Avenue]] (called [[Chrysler New Yorker]]/[[Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue|New Yorker Fifth Avenue]] for 1982 and 1983) and the [[Dodge Diplomat]]. In addition to the R-body Gran Fury, the M-body Gran Fury replaced the M-body [[Chrysler LeBaron]], which had moved to the [[compact car|compact]] [[Chrysler K platform|K platform]] that year. Now considered a mid-sized car, this generation Gran Fury was close to the exterior size of what was once the compact [[Plymouth Valiant|Valiant]] and [[Plymouth Volare|Volaré]] but offered more interior room.  The M-body was in fact heavily based on the Volaré's [[Chrysler F platform|F platform]]. Like its predecessor, the 1982 Gran Fury was introduced later than its Chrysler and Dodge siblings; the [[Chrysler LeBaron]] and [[Dodge Diplomat]] had used the M-body since 1977.

1982-1989 Plymouth Gran Fury shared the Dodge Diplomat's front and rear fascias. They were virtually identical with the exception of badging. Once again, the third generation Gran Fury was available in base and higher-end "Salon" trim.  As in previous years, the higher-volume Gran Fury base model catered more towards fleet customers while Gran Fury Salons were geared more towards private customers and offered options such as full vinyl roofs, velour upholstery, turbine-spoke wheels, power windows, and power locks.

Although available to retail buyers, Gran Fury was far more popular with police departments and other fleet buyers, primarily since the car was reasonably priced and had a conventional drive-train with proven components that could withstand a good deal of abuse. The Gran Fury, however, was much less powerful than both its Big Three competitors as well as the Chrysler Corporation's earlier police offerings.&lt;ref name=MT982&gt;{{cite magazine | magazine = Motor Trend | title = The chase gets slower | first = Jim | last = Hall | date = September 1982 | volume = 34 | number = 9 | publisher = Petersen Publishing | ref = MT3409 | pages = 93–95 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most powerful engine available to police departments was a {{convert|165|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} iteration of the 318&amp;nbsp;ci V8, capable of an 18.16&amp;nbsp;second [[Dragstrip|quartermile]] in period testing - slower than the 90-hp [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1#Rabbit|Volkswagen Rabbit GTi]].&lt;ref name=MT982/&gt;

This generation of the Gran Fury sold in respectable numbers. However, despite having the same base prices as the Gran Fury (just under $12,000 [[USD]] for their final year), the Diplomat always outsold it, usually by several thousand units each year. The Chrysler Fifth Avenue's total sales were always more than that of the Gran Fury and Diplomat by far, even though it generally cost about $6,000 [[USD]] more. This last car to carry the Gran Fury nameplate remained largely unchanged for its 7-year run. Declining sales, a lack of promotion, and technical obsolescence—the platform dated back to the 1976 [[Plymouth Volare]] and [[Dodge Aspen]]—eventually contributed to the model's demise in early 1989. That year, a driver-side airbag became standard; this would be the last RWD Plymouth until the introduction of the [[Plymouth Prowler|Prowler]]. While Dodge offered the 1990 [[Dodge Monaco|Monaco]], and later the 1993 [[Dodge Intrepid|Intrepid]], Chrysler never replaced the Gran Fury with any other large car in the remainder of Plymouth's lineup on through to its demise in the 2001 model year.

==Canada==
The M-body Gran Fury was also sold in Canada from 1978 to 1989 as the [[Plymouth Caravelle]], badged "Caravelle Salon" after the midsize front-drive [[Plymouth Caravelle]] was released in Canada for 1983. Although the Diplomat and LeBaron appeared on the market in mid-1977, the Caravelle was introduced in the fall of 1977 as a 1978 model. It was sold only by Canadian Plymouth dealers and was not available in the U.S., though the midsize front-drive car was offered in the U.S. market starting in 1985. In addition to the sedan body style, the Canadian Caravelle was offered in 2-door coupe and 4-door station wagon form through 1982.

The '''Plymouth Superbird''' was a highly modified, short-lived version of the [[Plymouth Road Runner]] with well-known graphics and horn sound. It was the factory's follow up stock car racing design, for the 1970 season, to the [[Dodge Charger Daytona]] of 1969, and incorporated many engineering changes and modifications (both minor and major) garnered from the Daytona's season in competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sessler|first1=Peter C.|title=Dodge &amp; Plymouth muscle car red book|date=2001|publisher=MBI Pub.

The car's primary rival was the [[Ford Torino Talladega]], a direct response to the [[Chrysler#Product line|Mopar]] [[Aero Warriors|aero car]]. It has also been speculated that a motivating factor in the production of the car was to lure [[Richard Petty]] back to Plymouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/11/03/plymouth-road-runner-superbird-auction/3349815/ |title=Is a wacky '70 Plymouth Superbird worth $500,000? |author=Chris Woodyard |work=USA TODAY |date=November 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of the Mopar aero cars famously featured a protruding, aerodynamic nosecone, a high-mounted rear [[Automotive aerodynamics|wing]] and, unique to the Superbird, a horn which mimicked the [[Wile E.

==History==
Developed specifically for NASCAR racing, the Superbird, a modified Road Runner, was Plymouth's follow-on design to the Charger Daytona fielded by sister company Dodge in the previous season. The Charger 500 version that began the 1969 season was the first American car to be designed aerodynamically using a wind tunnel and computer analysis, and later was modified into the Daytona version with nose and tail. The Superbird's smoothed-out body and nosecone were further refined from that of the Daytona, and the street version's retractable headlights (made of fiberglass&lt;ref name=aerowarriors/&gt;) added nineteen inches to the Road Runner's original length. The rear wing was mounted on tall vertical struts that put it into less disturbed air thus increasing the efficiency of the downdraft that it placed upon the car's rear axle. For nearly 30 years the mathematic formula used to determine the exact height of the enormous wing was thought to be a highly guarded Chrysler secret. In the 1990s, a retired Chrysler project engineer (falsely&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lehto|first1=Steve|title=The Real Reason the Dodge Charger Daytona's Wing Was So Huge |url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a29732/daytona-superbird-reason-for-wings/ |accessdate=27 June 2016 |work=Road and Track Online |date=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) claimed publicly that the height was determined in much simpler fashion: it was designed to provide clearance for the trunk lid to open freely. By coincidence, the height of the wing was at the optimum level for maximum downforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zatz |first1=David |title=The Plymouth Superbird and Dodge Charger Daytona |url=http://www.allpar.com/model/superbird.html |website=AllPar.com |publisher=David Zatz; 2001-2015, Allpar LLC |accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rear-facing fender scoops were to hide cutouts. These cutouts were to allow wheel clearance due to the taller, wider wheels and lowered the height of the vehicle for NASCAR competition. On [[Dodge Charger Daytona|Daytonas]], the scoops were actually for ventilating trapped air from the wheel wells in order to reduce under fender air pressure and lift. For standard road going Superbirds the covers or "air extractors" were a cosmetic enhancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mueller |first1=Mike |title=The complete book of Dodge and Plymouth muscle |date=2009 |publisher=MBI Pub.

NASCAR's [[homologation]] requirement demanded that vehicles to be raced must be available to the general public and sold through dealerships in specific minimum numbers. For 1970, NASCAR raised the production requirement from 500 examples to one for every two manufacturer's dealers in the United States; in the case of Plymouth, that meant having to build 1,920 Superbirds. Due to increasing emissions regulations, combined with insurance spike for high performance cars and NASCAR's effective ban on the aero cars, 1970 was its only production year.

"Superbird" decals were placed on the outside edges of the spoiler vertical struts featuring a picture of the [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner|Road Runner]] cartoon character holding a racing helmet. A smaller version of the decal appears on the driver's side headlight door. Superbirds had three engine options: the [[Chrysler Hemi engine#Second Generation: 426|426 Hemi]] [[V8 engine]] producing {{convert|425|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5000 rpm and {{convert|490|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]], the [[Chrysler RB engine#440|440 Super Commando Six Barrel]] with 3X2-barrel carburetors producing {{convert|390|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and the {{convert|375|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler RB engine#440|440 Super Commando]] with a single 4-barrel [[carburetor]]. Only 135 models were fitted with the 426 Hemi. As the 440 was less expensive to produce, the "street" version of the 426 Hemi engine used in competition was homologated by producing the minimum number required.

On the street, the nose cone and wing were very distinctive, but the aerodynamic improvements hardly made a difference there or on the drag strip. In fact, the 1970 Road Runner was actually quicker in the quarter mile and standard acceleration tests due to the increased weight produced by the Superbird's nose and wing. Only at speeds in excess of {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} did the modifications begin to show any benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aerodynamic Upgrades|url=http://www.rapid-racer.com/aerodynamic-upgrades.php|website=Rapid-Racer.com|publisher=Rapid-Racer 2015|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production numbers==
Chrysler memos of September 1969 show that the sales programming staff were preparing to handle 1,920 winged Plymouths for 1970, but published figures say as many as 2,783 were built. The current figure generally accepted is 1,935 SuperBirds built and shipped to United States dealers, with anywhere from 34 to 47 allegedly heading to Canada. The engine option is also questioned, although the most frequently seen numbers report 135 Hemi SuperBirds and sixteen 440ci. six-pack editions, with the remainder powered by 440ci. 4bbl. motors. It is believed that over 1,000 Plymouth SuperBirds exist today.&lt;ref&gt;SUPERCARS: The Story of the Dodge Charger Daytona and Plymouth SuperBird; Frank Moriarty: {{ISBN|1-57427-043-5}}, (1995), page 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

==NASCAR==
[[File:RichardPettyRoadrunner.jpg|thumb|right|Petty's Road Runner Superbird on display at the [[Richard Petty Museum]]]]

In Autumn 1968, [[Richard Petty]] left the Plymouth NASCAR Racing Team for Ford's. Charlie Grey, director of the Ford stock car program, felt that hiring Petty would send the message that "money rules none". However, the Superbird was designed specifically to lure Petty back to Plymouth for the 1970 season. Petty did reasonably well against strong Ford opposition on the NASCAR tracks that year, winning eight races and placing well in many more.

NASCAR's rules implemented for the 1971 season limited the "[[Aero Warriors|aero-cars]]" to an engine displacement of no greater than {{convert|305|cid|l|abbr=on}} or they had to carry much more weight compared to their competitors. While they were still legal to race, the power-to-weight consequences that would come with the smaller engine or the increased weight rendered the cars uncompetitive. This was the start of a trend of rules slowing down NASCAR, because the races were exceeding the technology of tires and safety over {{convert|200|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Ford, in response, also designed the 1970 [[Ford_Torino#Torino_King_Cobra|Torino King Cobra]] with an aerodynamic, superbird-style nose, but it was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Florea|first1=Ciprian|title=1970 Ford Torino King Cobra Prototype|url=http://www.topspeed.com/cars/ford/1970-ford-torino-king-cobra-prototype-ar163976.html|website=TopSpeed.com|publisher=TopSpeed |date=7 July 2014 |accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adolphus|first1=David Traver|title=Game Over - 1970 Ford Torino King Cobra, 1970 Mercury Talladega Super Cyclone Spoiler II The nukes that ended the aero wars|url=http://www.hemmings.com/mus/stories/2009/04/01/hmn_feature6.html|website=Hemmings.com|publisher=Feature Article from Hemmings Muscle Machines|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petty's Superbird appears as a key character in the 2006 [[Pixar]] film ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', with Petty as the voice of seven-time champion [[List of Cars characters#Strip .22The King.22 Weathers|Strip "the King" Weathers]]. The racing sponsor's branding in the film exactly matches the Superbird's paint as "[[List of Pixar film references#Dinoco|Dinoco]] blue".

==Market impact==

The Superbird's styling proved to be extreme for 1970's tastes (many customers preferred the regular Road Runner), and as a consequence, many of the 1,920 examples built&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960-1972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), p.771.&lt;/ref&gt; sat unsold on the back lots of dealerships as late as 1972.

The Superbird and the Dodge Charger Daytona were each built for one model year only (1970 and 1969 respectively).

== In Pop Culture ==

The ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' character [[Strip 'The King' Weathers]] (voiced by [[Richard Petty]]) is based on Petty's own #43 Superbird. A Superbird is prominently featured in the [[Spice Girls]]' music video "[[Say You'll Be There]]". Caroline Jones drives a Superbird in her music videos “The Difference (Goshdamn)” and “Chasin’ Me”. &lt;gallery&gt;

The '''Plymouth Valiant''' (first appearing in 1959 as simply the '''Valiant''') is an [[automobile]] which was manufactured by [[Plymouth (automobile)|the Plymouth division]] of the [[Chrysler Corporation]] in the United States from the model years of 1960 through 1976. It was created to give the company an entry in the [[compact car]] market emerging in the late 1950s. The Valiant was also built and marketed, without the Plymouth name, worldwide in countries including [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Finland]], [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], [[Sweden]] and [[Switzerland]], as well as other countries in [[South America]] and [[Western Europe]]. It became well known for its excellent durability and reliability, and was one of Chrysler's best-selling automobiles during the 1960s and 1970s, essentially keeping the company afloat during its hard economic times.

''[[Road &amp; Track]]'' magazine considered the Valiant to be "one of the best all-around domestic cars."&lt;ref&gt;''Mighty Mopars 1960–74'' by Tony Young p. 16 {{ISBN|978-0-87938-124-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1957, Chrysler president Lester Lum "Tex" Colbert established a committee to develop a competitor in the burgeoning compact car market which included the popular [[VW Beetle]], the new [[American Motors]] [[Nash Rambler|Rambler]] and upcoming entries from [[General Motors|GM]], [[Ford]] and [[Studebaker]]. [[Virgil Exner]] designed a car that was smaller and lighter than a full-size car without sacrificing passenger and luggage space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valiant.org/history.html |title=The Strange Development Story of the Plymouth Valiant |publisher=Valiant.org |accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally named the ''Falcon'' after Exner's 1955 [[Chrysler Falcon]] [[concept car]], the vehicle was renamed the 'Valiant' honoring [[Henry Ford II]]'s request to use the name for the [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]].&lt;ref&gt;Witzenburg, Gary. "The Name Game", ''Motor Trend'', 4/84, p.82.&lt;/ref&gt; The Valiant debuted at the 44th [[International Motor Show]] in [[London]] on October 26, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;'"British to See Valiant First" by Ralph R. Watts, ''The Detroit News'', October 21, 1959, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced as a 1960 model and was officially considered a distinct brand,&lt;ref&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975, Revised 4th Edition, page 656&lt;/ref&gt; advertised with the tagline 'Nobody's kid brother, this one stands on its own four tires.' For the 1961 model year, the Valiant was classified as a [[Plymouth automobile|Plymouth]] model.&lt;ref&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975, Revised 4th Edition, page 658&lt;/ref&gt; The 1961–62 [[Dodge Lancer]] was essentially a [[badge engineering|rebadged]] Valiant with different trim and styling details. For the 1962 model year, the Valiant returned without Plymouth branding but was sold only in Plymouth Chrysler, Chrysler Dodge, or the rare standalone Plymouth dealerships.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} For model year 1964 and onwards the car was sold in the United States only as a Plymouth Valiant.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} 

[[File:J66127 Bazou 20130810-162650 45.52340,-73.56055,012,43m Valiant1960-SemiFastback.jpg|thumb|left|The semi-fastback gave it a sleek, European look]] The Valiant was less radical in configuration than [[General Motors]]' compact [[Chevrolet Corvair]], which had an [[air-cooled]] rear-mounted engine, but was considered more [[aesthetics|aesthetically]] daring than the also-new Falcon and [[Studebaker Lark|Lark]] compacts, which had more conventional looks; the Valiant boasted a radical design that continued Exner's [[Forward Look]] styling with "sleek, crisp lines which flow forward in a dart or wedge shape."&lt;ref name=Loofbourrow&gt;'"The Valiant – A New Motoring Concept" by A.G. Loofbourrow, V.M. Exner &amp; R.M. Sinclair, Chrysler Corp., Engineering Division, for presentation of the Society of Automotive Engineers Annual Meeting at The Sheraton-Cadillac Hotel, and Statler Hotel, Detroit, Michigan, January 11–15, 1960'&lt;/ref&gt; The flush-sided appearance was a carried-over feature from Chrysler's [[Ghia]]-built '''D'Elegance''' and '''Adventurer''' [[concept car]]s which also gave the Valiant additional inches of interior room.&lt;ref name=Loofbourrow/&gt; With its semi-[[fastback]] and lengthy hood line, many automotive publications of the time thought the Valiant's styling was European inspired. While the Valiant was all new, specific design elements tied it to other contemporary Chrysler products with features such as the canted [[Car tailfin|tailfins]] tipped with cat's-eye shaped [[Automotive lighting|tail lamps]] and the simulated spare tire pressing (or [[continental tire]]) on the deck lid that were thematically similar to those on the [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]] and the [[Chrysler 300 letter series#1960 300F|300F]]. According to Exner, the stamped wheel design was used not only to establish identity with other Chryslers, but to "dress up the rear deck area without detracting from the look of directed forward motion."&lt;ref name=Loofbourrow/&gt;

The Valiant debuted an all-new [[Straight-6|6-cylinder overhead-valve engine]], the famous [[Chrysler Slant Six engine|Slant-Six]]. Its inline cylinders were uniquely canted 30° to the right (passenger side). This allowed a lower hoodline, shorter engine length—the water pump was shifted from front to alongside—and efficient long-branch individual-runner intake manifolds, an advance that benefited from Chrysler's pioneering work in tuned intakes. The Slant-6 produced both more power and better economy than other American made offerings, and it soon gained a reputation for dependability. Project Engineer [[Willem Weertman]] and his team had designed a simple yet robust workhorse, from its four-main forged crankshaft to a simplified "mechanical" valve train. Block and head castings were unusually thick because both were intended to be cast in either iron or aluminum with the same tooling. Although volume casting techniques of the era could not yet reliably produce complex head castings in aluminum, over 50,000 [[die casting|die-cast]] aluminum-block versions of the {{convert|225|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine were produced between late 1961 and early 1963 and sold as extra-cost options.

The 1960 Valiant exemplified Chrysler's leadership in aluminum die casting. While the aluminum Slant-Six engine block wouldn't enter production until 1961, the [[Kokomo, Indiana]], foundry produced a number of other aluminum parts for the 1960 Valiant, all instrumental in reducing the total weight of the car. The 1960 model contained as much as {{convert|60|lb|abbr=on}} of aluminum in structural and decorative forms, with the majority of the material used in cast form as chassis parts.&lt;ref name="TSB_11_59"&gt;''Aluminum Saves Weight in the Valiant'' (Product Information Bulletin, Chrysler Corp., Engineering Division, Technical Information Services, November, 1959)&lt;/ref&gt; These parts included the oil pump, water pump, [[alternator (auto)|alternator]] housing, Hyper-Pak (see below) and standard production intake manifolds, all-new [[Torqueflite]] A-904 [[automatic transmission]] case and  tail extension, and numerous other small parts. These cast-aluminum parts were roughly 60% lighter than corresponding parts of cast iron.&lt;ref name="TSB_11_59"/&gt; A cast aluminum part had the benefit of reduced section thickness where strength was not a vital consideration. Section thickness of cast-iron parts were often dictated by casting practice, which required at least {{convert|3/16|in|mm|abbr=on}} to ensure good castings.&lt;ref name="TSB_11_59"/&gt; Exterior decorative parts stamped from aluminum were lighter than similar chromium-plated zinc castings. The entire grille and surrounding molding on the Valiant weighed only {{convert|3|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="TSB_11_59"/&gt; If this same assembly had been made of die-cast zinc, as many grilles of the era were, it would have weighed an estimated {{convert|13|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="TSB_11_59"/&gt; An estimated {{convert|102|lb|abbr=on}}—about 4% of a Valiant's total shipping weight—was saved with the {{convert|60|lb|abbr=on}} of aluminum parts.&lt;ref name="TSB_11_59"/&gt;

The Valiant [[Chrysler A platform|A-body]] platform utilized "unit-body" or "[[unibody]]" construction (not used by the Chrysler Corporation since the [[Chrysler Airflow|Airflow]] models of the 1930s) rather than "[[body-on-frame]]" construction. Instead of a bolted-in forestructure used in other unibody designs, the Valiant incorporated a welded-in front understructure and stressed front sheet metal. The fenders, quarter panels, floor and roof contributed to the stiffness of the body shell. A unit wheelbase comparison showed the Valiant to be 95% stiffer in torsion and 50% stiffer in beam than a 1959 Plymouth with separate body-on-frame construction. Dynamic testing showed that high structural resonant frequencies were attained, indicating greater damping and reduced body shake.&lt;ref name=Loofbourrow/&gt;

The front suspension consisted of unequal length control arms with [[torsion beam suspension|torsion bars]], while the rear suspension used a live axle supported by asymmetric [[leaf springs]]. Chrysler used this design through the entire production of the Valiant and other A-body models, with revisions to the suspension components themselves for the 1962, 1967, 1968, and 1973 models.

===Hyper-Pak===
[[File:Hyperpak.jpg|thumb|left|An all-aluminum Slant-6 engine with reproduction Hyper Pak intake manifold]]

Plymouth product planning director Jack Charipar gave impetus for a stock car racing version of the Valiant,&lt;ref&gt;Weertman, Willem (2008). Chrysler Engines 1922-1998. Warrendale, PA: SAE International, 419. {{ISBN|978-0-7680-1642-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and while Chrysler engineers developed the '''[[Chrysler Slant-6 engine#Hyper Pak|Hyper-Pak]]''' for the track, the Hyper-Pak dealer tuning kit option was made available in limited quantities on December 1, 1959. Features included {{convert|153|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque, a 10.5:1 compression ratio, dual exhaust pipes on a single muffler, a manual [[choke valve|choke]] and a larger {{convert|15|usgal|l|abbr=on}} fuel tank.&lt;ref&gt;'"Up Goes Valiant-Junior HP Race On?" by Fred Olmsted, The Detroit Free Press, January 21, 1960, p. 18'&lt;/ref&gt; Dick Maxwell, a Chrysler engineer responsible for many of the Super Stock [[Mopar]]s, recalls that "When [[NASCAR]] decided to run a compact road race in conjunction with the 1960 [[Daytona 500]], all the factories got involved. We built a fleet of seven Hyper Pak Valiants with 148-[[horsepower|hp]] 170-[[cubic inch|ci]] [Slant] sixes having a single four-barrel with ram manifold." The race Hyper-Paks also featured high-load valve springs and long-duration, high-lift camshafts.

NASCAR's new Compact Car category debuted at the [[Daytona International Speedway]] on January 31, 1960. The first of two races was a road course, which used a {{convert|1.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} portion of the high-banked [[tri-oval]] together with a twisting infield road for a lap distance of {{convert|3.81|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The race length was 10 laps, {{convert|38.1|mi|km|abbr=on}}. Averaging a speed of {{convert|88.134|mph|km/h|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name= smashup&gt;'"Valiants Survive a 4-Car Smashup, Win at Daytona," The Detroit Free Press, February 1, 1960, p. 26'&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marvin Panch]] drove his Hyper-Pak into first place; all the Hyper-Paks swept the field taking the first seven places. The second race of the day used only the tri-oval track 20 laps on its full {{convert|2.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} length totaling {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}}. A multi-car accident on the fourth lap took out the four Valiant leaders including one driven by [[Richard Petty]]. Panch was not among them because car trouble delayed his start and he was busy passing slower cars from the rear of the field when the leaders crashed. After a restart, Panch worked to first place and stayed there averaging a speed of {{convert|122.282|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name =smashup/&gt; The remaining Valiants placed 1-2-3 and Panch again went into the winner's circle. Maxwell again recalls that "It was a Plymouth runway. We finished first through seventh. Our cars were so fast, NASCAR never did that race again."&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Tony|authorlink=|title=Mighty Mopars 1960-1974|publisher=Motorbooks International|year=1984|location=| page=25|url=|doi=|id=|isbn=978-0-87938-124-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design and mechanical revisions===
The first-generation Valiants, though sold in three model years, existed in ''four'' distinct configurations: early 1960, late 1960, 1961, and 1962. The base-model '''V100''' cars received relatively minimal ornamentation.

====1960====
[[File:J66109 Bazou 20130810-162416 45.52342,-73.56055,132,45m Valiant1960-Back.jpg|right|thumb|1960 back showing the spare-tire stamping on trunk lid]]
Early 1960 models, particularly the '''V200''' high-trim cars, featured extensive brightwork and ornamentation. An {{convert|8|in|cm|abbr=on}} [[chrome plating|chrome]] spear atop each front fender, an ''inner'' reveal ring on the deck lid's spare tire stamping, a "V200" nameplate on the dashboard, and [[stainless steel]] windshield and backlight reveal moldings, which were deleted from production, replaced with less costly flexible [[mylar]]-faced plastic locking strips—in approximately January, 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Corporation: 'Valiant Master Parts Catalog, 1960-1963'&lt;/ref&gt; Early and late V200s had a continuous stainless steel molding following the tailfin crease as it swept down in front of the rear wheel, then continuing forward along the lower break line in both doors and the front fender. The radiator grille was brite-dipped stamped aluminum, and a central grille badge doubled as the hood release. Script "Valiant" callouts were placed in the center of the deck lid's spare-tire stamping and on each front fender.

During the 1960 model year, there were revisions to improve lubrication of the two rear [[connecting rods]], [[voltage regulator]] function, cold starting and idling, acceleration, and to prevent breakage of the front and rear manifold mounting studs.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Corporation: '1960 Valiant Technical Service Bulletins'&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Valiant Wagon.JPG|thumb|left|1961 Plymouth Valiant Wagon.]] The Valiant station wagons had {{convert|72.3|ft3|m3|1|abbr=on}} of cargo space yet required two feet less parking space than a full-size Plymouth.&lt;ref name=lowest_price/&gt; A locking luggage compartment on the two-seat models included the use of ''Captive-Aire'' (run-flat) tires. The compartment, located in the cargo deck, served as a spare tire storage space for models equipped with standard tires in which case the lock was optional. Captive-Aire tires, which did not require a spare, were standard equipment on the three-seat models. An aluminum tailgate window screen was available for the exclusion of insects when on vacation and camping trips.&lt;ref name=lowest_price/&gt;

The four-door station wagon, assembled only at the Dodge Main plant in Hamtramck,&lt;ref name= lowest_price&gt;"Valiant Wagon Lowest Priced" by Ralph R. Watts, The Detroit News, November 6, 1959, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; was available in V100 and V200 trim in two- and three-seat configurations; the third seat faced the rear. Both models were the lowest priced four-door station wagons in America.&lt;ref name=lowest_price/&gt; The two-seat model was $60 under both the four-door Lark and Rambler station wagons, and the three-seater was $186 below the Rambler four-door.&lt;ref name=lowest_price/&gt;

====1961====
[[File:Valiantcat.jpg|thumb|left|1960-61 [[Automotive lighting|tail lamp]] with back-up lamp below]]

For 1961, new 2-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] and [[hardtop]] models were released, but no changes were made to the 4-door sedan and wagon sheet metal. The interior and exterior trim were changed to provide model year differentiation, a mild form of [[Planned obsolescence#Style obsolescence|planned obsolescence]]. The radiator grille stamping was the same as in 1960, but for 1961 it was painted with a pattern of black squares. The central grille ornament was still pulled from the bottom to release the hood, but it was now faced with an emblem having a white field with the blue-and-red stylized "V" Valiant logo, rather than 1960's red field with gold script "Valiant" callout. The side trim was changed; a {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} stainless spear was placed at the rear of each tailfin crease, a [[hockey stick]]-shaped trim was applied to the lower break line, and the front fender/door crease was capped with a long stainless spear. The tailfins were each topped with three [[transverse plane|transverse]] chrome strips, and a large horizontal emblem containing a round plastic "V200" callout was centered in the deck lid's spare-tire stamping. Matching round "V200" callouts were placed in round housings at the midpoint of the front fender spears. Inside the car, the instrument cluster was largely carried over, but 1960's black gauges with white callouts gave way to 1961's white gauges with black callouts.

Mechanical revisions for 1961 included new [[carburetor]]s, the availability of [[PCV valve|positive crankcase ventilation]] (which was newly mandated on cars sold in [[California]]), the availability of dealer-installed [[air conditioning]], the relocation of the alternator from the left to the right side of the engine, and extensive revisions throughout most of the Valiant's systems and components.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Corporation: '1961 Valiant Technical Service Bulletins'&lt;/ref&gt; Late in the 1961 model year, the larger {{convert|225|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Slant-6 engine became available in the Valiant, its use having been expanded earlier in the year from the larger Dodges and Plymouths to the Valiant-sized Dodge Lancer.

====1962====
[[File:HyperPak.JPG|thumb|left|1962 Plymouth Valiant with Hyper Pak]]

The 1962 model year saw an extensive [[facelift (product)|facelift]]. The radiator grille was flattened and shortened. The hood release was moved to a knob at the top of the grille frame. The central grille emblem was deleted, except on the top-line '''Signet 200''' 2-door hardtop model, which received a black-painted grille with a round central emblem incorporating the red-and-blue stylized "V" Valiant emblem. The Signet 200 had pleated, leather-like bucket seats, custom tailored interior trim, deep-pile carpeting, special trunk lid emblem, different headlamp frames and special side moldings; it was America's lowest-priced hardtop with bucket seats.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}
[[File:Valianttail.jpg|thumb|right|1962 tail lamp]]

Fender and hood stampings were similar to the 1960-'61 items, but neither identical nor interchangeable. At the rear, the cat's-eye tail lamps were deleted. A wraparound stainless trim was applied to the tailfins, below which were placed round tail lamps set into stamped aluminum bezels. These occupied the space formerly available for optional backup lamps, which for 1962 flanked the license plate below the rear bumper. The spare-tire stamping was eliminated from the deck lid, which was now a smooth stamping with a small central ridge at its trailing edge. On V200 deck lids, a large round emblem surrounded an oblong block-letter "VALIANT" callout on a black field. Similar block-letter/black-field callouts were placed on each front fender. On the Signet, the deck lid was adorned with a smaller round emblem surrounding the red-and-blue stylized-V Valiant logo.

V200 side trim reverted to the 1960 concept, following the tailfin crease and lower body break crease. However, the 1962 trim was more massive and contained an oblong triple-window effect at the rear of the body break crease. On Signets, the front fenders had an open-centred double spear, connected at the front and back, within which was contained a secondary body paint color.
[[File:Valiantcluster.jpg|thumb|left|1962 instrument cluster—transmission pushbuttons on the left]]

The 1962 Valiant was given a completely new instrument cluster. Like that of the larger 1962 Plymouth models, the new Valiant cluster was highly regarded for its clean design and easy readability. A large round [[speedometer]] was placed at the left of the cluster, with separate round gauges for fuel level, engine temperature, and charging system condition ([[amperes]]) in a row to the right of the speedometer. Automatic transmission pushbuttons were in a column at the left edge of the panel, and heater pushbuttons were in a column at the right edge. A new shallower-dish steering wheel was also introduced.

Mechanical revisions for 1962 were extensive. The electrical system was extensively upgraded, with a new gear-reduction [[Automobile self starter|starter]], new alternator, more fuses, and [[printed circuit boards]] rather than individual wires for the instrument cluster. Carburetors were improved again, the [[manual transmission]] gearshift was moved from the floor to the steering column, there were new 45°-shear engine mounts replacing the previous vertical-shear items, exhaust systems were made of more [[corrosion]]-resistant (aluminized) materials, and axle ratios were altered for better [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]]. Manual steering ratio was changed from 20:1 to 24:1, and both power and manual steering gearboxes were new, the latter now housed in aluminum rather than iron. Most of the front suspension components were redesigned (now with balloon seals, an industry first), and it was claimed they needed lubrication only every {{convert|32000|mi|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Corporation: '1962 (S-series) Valiant'&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1961, the [[Society of Illustrators]] presented Exner the 1962 Styling Award for outstanding design of the 1962 Signet 200; the award lauded Exner's "creative sculpted design" of the Valiant, "an automobile of outstanding originality, restraint and spirited beauty."&lt;ref&gt;'"Valiant Gets Styling Award" by Fred Olmsted, The Detroit Free Press, October 18, 1961, P.16'&lt;/ref&gt;

The Valiant was totally reskinned for 1963 with a {{convert|0.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} shorter wheelbase; it had a wide, flat hood and a flat square rear deck. The upper belt feature line ran from the rear body, in a gentle sweep, to the front fender tip. Here it was 'veed' back and down to the trailing edge of the front fender. The roofline was flatter and sharpened in profile. The grille was a variation of the inverted trapezoid shape that characterized contemporary Chryslers, with a fine mesh insert. Advances in body structure, many accessories and a new spring-staged choke were promotional highlights. The Valiant was offered as a 2-door [[hardtop]] and convertible, a 2- or 4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]], and a 4-door [[station wagon]]. The hardtop and the [[convertible (car)|convertible]], with manual- or optional power-operated top, were offered only in the high V200 and premium Signet trim levels. The optional {{convert|225|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} slant-6 engine was initially offered with the die-cast aluminium block introduced in late 1961, but early in the 1963 model year the aluminum block was discontinued; both the 170 and 225 engines were thenceforth available only with iron blocks. In December 1962, Plymouth's first-ever vinyl-covered roof became available as an option on the Signet. The 1963 Valiant was much better received by the public, and sales for the year rose to 225,056.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knutson |first=Lanny |url=http://www.allpar.com/history/plymouth/1964.html |title=Best of the carryovers: Plymouth for 1964 |publisher=Allpar.com |accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valiant.org/chron.html |title=Year by year history of the Plymouth Valiant |publisher=Valiant.org |accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Valiant was sold in Mexico as a Chrysler Valiant starting with the 1963 model year. This was also the first year that it was coupled with the [[Dodge Dart]], which had been previously a lower-end full-size model.

Building on a worldwide record sales success in 1963, the Valiant moved into 1964 with design changes giving better economy, reliability and performance. Changes in the 1964 Valiant included a restyled front end featuring a new grille with a horizontal bars. A "Valiant" medallion was placed at the center of the grille where the bars formed a flat bulge. Vertical [[taillamps]] replaced the previous horizontal items. The ring-style rear deck decoration was replaced with a Valiant script located at the right-hand corner. There were few styling changes in the 1965 Valiants, but the 1966 Valiants had a split grille with fine-patterned insert; new front fenders; new rear fenders on the sedans; new bevelled-edge rear reck lid; heavier rear bumper; and a new roofline with large backlight.

The new Chrysler-built A833 four-speed [[manual transmission]] was offered together with a [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] shifter. Another new option was the ''Sure-Grip'' [[limited slip differential]], which was touted as a bad-weather safety feature and also offered traction benefits in performance driving.

The Valiant was extremely popular in the US, Canada, and numerous markets outside North America. Plymouth supported a successful team of Valiant two-door sedans in the 1965 and 1966 [[SCCA]] Manufacturers Rally Championships.&lt;ref&gt;'"The Beaulieu Encyclopedia of the Automobile Vol. 2 M-Z," multiple editors, p.1240, {{ISBN|1-57958-293-1}}'&lt;/ref&gt;

===V8 engine===
In mid-1964, Chrysler released an all-new {{convert|273|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine]] as optional equipment in all Valiants. This compact V8 engine, with solid [[tappet]]s, the first in Chrysler's [[Chrysler LA engine|LA engine range]] and that would last until 2002, was specifically engineered to fit in the compact A-body engine compartment. Valiants with the optional 273 engine came with V-shaped emblems at the sides of the cowl. With the {{convert|180|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} 273, the Valiant became the lowest-priced V-8 automobile in the world. For 1965, a hotter {{convert|235|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} version of the 273 called the '''Commando 273''' was made available with 10.5:1 compression, a  4-barrel carburetor, performance camshaft, low restriction exhaust and other modifications.

The Dodge Lancer, which had been almost identical to the Valiants of 1961–62, was replaced in 1963 by the '''[[Dodge Dart|Dart]]'''. The Dart was available in all the same body styles as the Valiant, except there was no Dodge equivalent of the Barracuda. All Darts used a larger, {{convert|111|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase, except for wagons which used the Valiant's {{convert|106|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase.

[[File:Plymouth-Valiant.jpg|thumb|left|1969 Valiant Signet]]

The Valiant was completely redesigned for 1967 model year and the station wagons, hardtops, and convertibles were dropped. Buyers who wanted a Valiant-type hardtop coupe or convertible could choose a similarly-styled [[Plymouth Barracuda|Barracuda]], which was still based on the Valiant with a slightly sportier style.  The new Valiant model range included 2- and 4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedans]] on a newly lengthened {{convert|108|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase. The design was straightforward and rectilinear. The body sides were mildly sculptured with a tapering lower feature line that widened toward the wheels. The new fenders had a vertical slab look. The grille was vertically split and subdivided horizontally. Vertical [[Automotive lighting|taillights]] were segmented and had a fanned-out look. Horsepower rating for the {{convert|170|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Slant-6 engine was raised from {{convert|101|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} to {{convert|115|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} by installation of the slightly bigger camshaft introduced on the 225 in 1965, together with Carter BBS and Holley 1920 [[carburetor]]s using the larger {{convert|1+11/16|in|mm|abbr=on}} throttle bore previously reserved for the 225, rather than the smaller {{convert|1+9/16|in|mm|abbr=on}} carburetors formerly used on the 170 engine.  Federally-mandated safety equipment was provided on all 1967s, including a new dual-chamber brake master cylinder, energy-absorbing steering column, wheel, and instrument panel controls; shoulder belt mountings for outboard front passengers, a new 4-way hazard flasher, and, for 1970, lane-change directional signals were included.

For the 1968 model, the horizontal division bar was removed from the grille. A fine cross hatched insert was framed by a segmented chrome surround. Model nameplates were moved from the rear fender to the front fender. The {{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}, {{convert|230|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} V8 was a Valiant option for the first time.  All North American Chrysler products got front and rear side marker lights, amber in front, red in the rear.  These were round in shape, surrounded by an attractive chrome bezel.  Valiants built after January 1, 1968, also got new front shoulder belts as standard.

For 1969, a new one-piece, full-width grille, new taillights and trim were featured. Standard engines were unchanged, although refinements in the Chrysler '''Clean Air System''' (formerly '''Clean Air Package''') produced better operating economy from the 6-cylinder engines. Improved drum brake self-adjusters, a more efficient power steering pump, and improvements to the optional Sure-Grip differential were also highlighted.  Starting with cars built on January 1, 1969, front seat headrests were now standard. 1969 Valiants got new rectangular side marker lamps with federally required integral reflectors.

For 1970, the Valiant was carried over with detail changes, including a new black plastic grille sculptured differently from 1969's metal item. The central portion protruded flush with the forward edge of the hood, while the remainder of the grille was set back from the front plane. The two-door sedan was dropped, replaced by the new Duster [[coupe]]. For all except export Valiants, the base 170 engine was replaced by a new {{convert|198|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} version of the Slant-6. The 198 gave better performance than the 170, and was less costly to make, since it used the same cylinder block as the 225. The Valiant was virtually unchanged for 1971; small revisions included removal of the center grille emblem and a new kind of finish treatment on the grille surround. It now had a blacked-out look instead of the previous argent silver treatment. For the 1970 and 1971 models, exterior and interior trim were slightly revised, and there were engineering changes for better driveability, improved soundproofing and decreased [[Automobile emissions control|emissions]], the latter in compliance with regulations mandated by the newly created [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) implementing new devices such as an [[EGR valve]] and an [[activated charcoal]] evaporative emissions system. The 1971 Valiant eventually set sales records with 256,930 calendar year deliveries,&lt;ref&gt;['The Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975, 4th Edition' Edited by Ron Kowalke P. 681 {{ISBN|0-87341-521-3}}]&lt;/ref&gt; so there was little motivation to change it for 1972. Only details of the taillights and grille were altered for the 1972 Valiants. New surface-mount sidemarker lamp-reflector units replaced the more costly previous flush-mount items.
[[File:'71 Plymouth Valiant Scamp (Rassemblement Saint-Bruno-De-Montarville '10).jpg|thumb|left|1971 Valiant Scamp w/ non-OEM headlamps, wheels, and stripe]]

Beginning in 1971, a badge-engineered version of the {{convert|111|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase [[Dodge Dart#1970–1976|Dodge Dart Swinger]] called the '''Valiant Scamp''' was offered. This used the Dart Swinger 2-door hardtop body shell with Valiant front sheet metal and dual taillamps carried over from the 1970 Dodge Dart.

1972 saw the Valiant's best sales ever,&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960-1972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), p.922.&lt;/ref&gt; with 330,373 sold.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p.925.&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1973, the vent wing windows were deleted from the ''Scamp'', and all models were given a new grille and front bumpers able to withstand damage at a {{convert|5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} impact, as well as steel beams inside the doors to protect vehicle occupants in side-impact collisions as mandated by [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|NHTSA]]. The door beams, the new bumpers and their impact-absorbing mounts, a rubber-booted telescoping system attached to the car's structure, added mass to the Valiant. At the same time, engines were being progressively detuned to comply with increasingly stringent emissions regulations. Performance and economy suffered as a result.

Through the early 1970s, the Valiant took more than 40% of Plymouth's total sales volume.&lt;ref&gt;

Worldwide, Chrysler affiliates and subsidiaries sold American- or Canadian-made Valiants from [[complete knock down]] kits, as well as locally designed and engineered Valiants and Valiant-based vehicles incorporating a mix of North American and local design and components.

In 1974, the {{convert|108|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase variant of the A-body sedan was dropped, and the Valiant sedan became a rebadged Dart. The larger size resulted in thicker C-pillars and new rear fender contours. Thenceforth, the only differences between the Valiant and Dart were minor cosmetics. The 1973 Valiant grille and front sheet metal were retained for 1974, but the front bumper's rubber guards were chromed. The taillights were extensively redesigned, resulting in a more formal look. The US Federal {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} bumper standards were applied to rear bumpers for the 1974 models, adding even more weight to the Valiant. Since the Duster (1970), Dart-based Scamp (1971) and Dart-based sedan (1974) displaced both of the Valiant's 1967 bodies, they could be considered to represent a fourth generation of Valiants.

1974 Valiant was also available in a "Scamp Package" which included 318 V8 engine, four door, 3 speed automatic transmission, power steering, power disc brakes, chrome trim, vinyl roof, AC, carpet, split vinyl bucket seat bench, radio, rear window defroster blower, and 120&amp;nbsp;mph speedometer standard.  Production was limited and ordered as customers requested the package, a few hundred were produced.

1974 introduced the '''Valiant Brougham''' and its twin, the '''Dodge Dart Special Edition'''. Available in two- or four-door models, they were a compact luxury car meant as an attractive alternative to larger luxury cars following the [[1973 oil crisis]]. The Brougham had generous chrome trim, a vinyl top, deep cut-pile carpeting, velour cloth upholstery, interior door padding, color-keyed or simulated wire wheel covers, and a special selection of paint and trim combinations. Much of the optional equipment on a regular Valiant became standard equipment on Brougham models such as [[power steering]], power disc brakes, air conditioning, [[cruise control]], electric rear window defroster and an AM/FM radio.

[[File:1975 Plymouth Valiant Brougham in brown, by night.jpg|thumb|left|1975 Plymouth Valiant Brougham, the most luxurious Valiant available]]

With a slightly restyled grille, 1975 models were essentially carry-overs from 1974 except that California and certain high-altitude models received [[catalytic converter]]s and required [[unleaded gasoline]]. The 1975 Valiants had several new items available to buyers with increasing interest in fuel economy. These included radial tires and a "Fuel Pacer" system that lit a warning light to tell the driver he was driving uneconomically, as well as Chrysler's A833OD 4-speed manual transmission, the first 4-speed Chrysler had offered with a 6-cylinder engine in the North American market since 1965. There were new {{convert|50000|mi|km|abbr=on}} spark plugs{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} and batteries and a 'Clincher' warranty that covered everything on the car except trim for 12 months with no mileage restrictions.

1976 models were virtually identical to 1975s; amber rather than clear front [[Automotive lighting|park/turn signal lights]] were used and the parking brake pull-handle was changed to a foot pedal.

===A38 police package===
In 1976, the Valiant was available as a Code A38 police package car and offered in three basic engine sizes: E24 (California emission standards) and E25 (Federal) {{convert|225|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} single-barrel Slant-6; E44 {{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}, twin-barrel V-8; E58 {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}, four-barrel V-8 with single (California) or dual (Federal) exhaust. It was the E58 that Chrysler recommended for police service as it was the only one with "added endurance features to improve durability." The E58 produced 175 net hp in California trim and 220 net hp in Federal form. The E58 dual exhaust engine (sans catalytic converters) made for a very fast Valiant squad car. So equipped, this compact Chrysler cop car tripped the quarter-mile lights in 16.4 seconds with trap speeds of {{convert|84.6|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and could catch nearly all the so-called "performance cars" of the day.&lt;ref name=Sanow&gt;{{cite book|last=Sanow|first=Edwin J.| authorlink=|author2=John L. Bellah|title=Dodge, Plymouth &amp; Chrysler Police Cars 1956-1978| publisher=Motorbooks International|year=1994|location=|page=150|url=|doi=|id=|isbn= 978-0-87938-958-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Seattle Police Department]] using the Valiant A38 reported a 46 percent drop in the preventable accident rate among police officers,&lt;ref name=Sanow/&gt; and according to a ''Motor Trend'' police survey, the A38 Valiant had much better evasive capabilities, better overall visibility, and was generally easier to drive than the full-size squad cars.&lt;ref name=Sanow/&gt; A special handling package applied to the A38 Valiant included front and rear [[anti-roll bar|antisway bars]]. Unfortunately, the Valiant wasn't physically durable enough;&lt;ref name=Sanow/&gt; it lacked additional frame welds and rear cross-member reinforcements standard on all other Mopar A38 packages. More importantly, the front K-frame of the Valiant was prone to failure under severe police use.&lt;ref name=Sanow/&gt;

===Replacement with Plymouth Volaré and Dodge Aspen===
In 1976, the [[Plymouth Volaré]] and [[Dodge Aspen]] [[Chrysler F platform|F-body]] cars were introduced mid-year replacing the Valiant and Dart, respectively. Production of the A-body shifted to Saint Louis Assembly while Hamtramck Assembly was dedicated to the new F-body,{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} which unfortunately, did not maintain their predecessors' reputation for quality and durability and in fact reversed it. The change hurt Chrysler's reputation and profitability, contributing to its near-bankruptcy in 1979–80.

==Derivative models==

===Barracuda===
{{Main|Plymouth Barracuda}}
[[File:Cudawindow.JPG|thumb|1966 Barracuda backlight and fish badge]]

Automotive trends in the early middle 1960s had all the US automakers looking at making compact sporty cars. The Valiant was a natural choice of basis for Chrysler's efforts in this direction.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 33"&gt;''Young'', p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Ford's [[Ford Mustang|Mustang]] gave this type of vehicle its common "[[pony car]]" moniker, but in fact Chrysler beat Ford to market by two weeks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/cuda.html |title=Plymouth Barracuda @ Allpar |publisher=Allpar.com |date=1964-04-01 |accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the April 1, 1964 release of the '''Barracuda''' [[fastback]]. The Barracuda used the Valiant's {{convert|106|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase and the Valiant hood, headlamp bezels, windshield, vent windows, quarter panels and bumpers; all other sheet metal and glass was new. This hybrid design approach significantly reduced the development and tooling cost and time for the new model. Unfortunately, the Barracuda was as similar to the Valiant as the Mustang was different from the Falcon, and its introduction was, at first, barely noticed by most buyers.&lt;ref&gt;''Flory'', p. 319&lt;/ref&gt;

The fastback body shape was achieved primarily with an enormous rear window, or backlight, which wrapped down to the fenderline. [[Pittsburgh Plate Glass]] (PPG) collaborated with Chrysler designers in producing this {{convert|14.4|ft2|m2|abbr=on}} rear window, the largest ever installed on a standard production car up to that time.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 33"/&gt; The following year, the fenders and taillamps that had been introduced on the 1964 Barracuda were used on the whole 1965 Valiant range except for the wagon, which got different taillamps.

The second-generation Barracuda, though still a {{convert|108|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase A-body sharing many components with the Valiant, was given Barracuda-specific styling and its own range of models including convertibles and fastback and [[notchback]] hardtops.  A wide range of engines were available on the Barracuda throughout its production lifecycle, from a 145-hp 225 cubic-inch (3.7L) Slant Six, up through high-compression small- and big-block V8s.

Although the first and second generation Barracudas were heavily based on the contemporary Valiants, Plymouth wanted them perceived as a distinct models. Consequently, the "Valiant" chrome script that appeared on the 1964 model's trunk lid was deleted on the 1965 model in the US market. For 1966, the stylized red-and-blue Valiant "V" emblems were replaced on the Barracuda with a model-specific stylized fish logo. For 1967, the new 4-barrel {{convert|383|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V-8 with {{convert|280|hp|abbr=on}} was optional only in the '''Formula S''' which boosted the Barracuda's performance with 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph in 7.4 seconds and the quarter mile covered in 15.9 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;''Young'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; In other markets such as Canada and South Africa, where Valiant was a marque in its own right, the car remained known as ''Valiant Barracuda'' until the A-body Barracuda was discontinued after 1969.

For 1970, the Barracuda lost all commonality with the Valiant as an all-new [[Chrysler E platform|E-body]] Barracuda was produced.

===Duster===
{{Main|Plymouth Duster}}
[[File:Dusterback.jpg|thumb|right|1970 Duster 340 with logo]]

Plymouth introduced a sporty new model for 1970: the 2-door [[fastback]] '''Plymouth Valiant Duster'''. The same technique that spawned the 1964 Barracuda was employed for the Duster. It was designed to use the same front end sheet metal, [[powertrain|running gear]], and {{convert|108|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase as the Valiant, but Plymouth's stylists gave the car an entirely new look by using a modified fastback configuration with radically curved side glass having only half the curvature radius of conventional side glass. Though the {{convert|340|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine with 10.5:1 compression, {{convert|275|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|340|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque had been available for special order in Valiants and Barracudas since 1968, the 340 was offered as a regular production option in the '''Duster 340''', Plymouth's analogue to the '''Dodge Demon 340''' and the '''Dodge Dart Swinger 340'''. The Duster was an immediate hit as a sporty alternative to the now larger and more expensive Barracuda.&lt;ref&gt;''Flory'', p. 771&lt;/ref&gt;

An aggressive "shark tooth" grille was offered on the fastback Duster 340 and new-for-1971 '''Duster Twister''' models. The Twister was a "performance [[appearance package]]" produced in response to increasing premiums on muscle cars, many of which were calculated using the vehicle's [[power-to-weight ratio]] as an [[actuarial]] gauge. Despite the "dust whirl" side stripes and Twister decals, Rallye road wheels, dual racing mirrors, twin hood scoops, flat-black hood paint with strobe stripes, and plaid cloth-and-vinyl trim interior available in four colors, the biggest engine available was the {{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8.

Chrysler increased the displacement of its highest-performance small block V-8 engine from {{convert|340|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} to {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} for 1974. The 360 was rated at {{convert|245|hp|abbr=on}} and placed in the '''Duster 360'''. However, the 1974 Duster was nearly {{convert|150|lb|kg|abbr=on}} heavier than the 1971 model&lt;ref&gt;''Young'', p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; on account of the heavier bumpers, side-impact door beams, emission control equipment, and added soundproofing. Even with performance options such as the four-speed manual transmission, Hurst shifter and Sure-Grip differential with 3.55:1 axle ratio, 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph and quarter-mile times increased roughly two seconds compared to those for the 1970 Duster. Unfortunately, higher fuel prices and performance-car insurance surcharges deterred many buyers as the interest in high performance waned. However, throughout its production, the most popular engines in Dusters were the 198 and 225 cubic-inch [[Chrysler Slant-Six engine|Slant Sixes]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}

==International variants==

===Canada (1960-1966)===
[[Chrysler Canada]] marketed the Valiant at Dodge and Plymouth dealers under a standalone "Valiant" marque. The Canadian 1960–62 Valiant was visually similar to its American counterpart except the badge on the trunk lid read "'''by Chrysler'''" instead of "'''Plymouth'''". Besides minor differences in interior and exterior trim, the alternator was an extra-cost option in Canada through 1962 while it was standard equipment in America. An anti-ice system for the carburetor's throttle body, engine block heater, battery warmer, electric car interior heater and other cold-climate items were available as factory and/or dealer-installed options. Air conditioning, which was first offered in the US 1961 models, was not made available North of the border until 1966. Some Canadian-made Auto-Lite (now [[Prestolite Electric|Prestolite]]) electrical components were used in lieu of the American-production Chrysler-built components. The [[Windsor, Ontario]], plant was a source for left- and right-hand-drive export Valiants as [[knock down kit]]s.

For 1963 and 1964, the Canadian Valiant used US Plymouth Valiant front sheet metal with the [[Dodge Dart#Third generation (1963–1966)|US Dodge Dart]] body and {{convert|111|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase (except wagons, which—like all 1963–1966 Dart and Valiant wagons—were on the {{convert|106|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase).

For 1965, Chrysler Canada sold both the {{convert|106|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase and the {{convert|111|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase A-body vehicles, all badged as Valiants, and all with the US Dart dashboard and instrument cluster. For 1966, the shorter Valiant was dropped from the Canadian market and all Canadian Valiants were now rebadged US Darts.

The Canadian Barracuda, badged as the '''Valiant Barracuda''', was built in Canada in 1964 and 1965 but was imported for 1966. Like the Valiant, the Barracuda had no Plymouth markings.

With the coming of the US-Canada [[Auto Pact]] of 1965, Chrysler could ship cars and parts both ways over the border and in 1967 the company began importing Plymouth Valiants and Dodge Darts from Detroit, as well as exporting Darts and Valiants from Windsor to the US.

The [[Chrysler Valiant]] was produced in [[Australia]] by [[Chrysler Australia]] from 1962 to 1980, and by [[Mitsubishi Motors Australia]] from 1980 to 1981.

===Mexico (1963–1988)===
Valiants, which were assembled and sold in Mexico from 1963 through 1976, were essentially the same A-body models as their US counterparts with minor differences. The Mexican Valiant lineup included a unique 2-door hardtop produced from 1963&lt;ref&gt;https://www.valiant.org/valiant/mexico.html&lt;/ref&gt; to 1969 called the '''Acapulco''' named after [[Acapulco|the coastal resort city]]. Based on a V200 Signet, the Acapulco was not available in the U.S. or anywhere else outside of Mexico. The most notable features included a cobra snakeskin vinyl roof and emblems of Acapulco in the interior and on the trunk lid. Other features included bucket seats, upgraded interior and remote controlled passenger side mirrors. The car was powered by 2bbl 225 Slant-6 which was being used concurrently in the Australian market; the manual transmission was operated by a four-on-the-floor Hurst gearshift. 

The Valiant Duster was introduced in Mexico in 1970, the same as the Plymouth Duster that was sold in the US market. Starting in 1972, the Valiant Duster got the same body as the US-market Dodge Demon/Dart Sport. In 1976, A-body cars were discontinued in North America, replaced by the Plymouth Volare/Dodge Aspen. Mexican Volares were badged as "Valiant Volares", and these had the Volare rear end but the Aspen grille. When the Volare was replaced with the Reliant "K" in 1981, these cars were marketed as "Valiant Volare K" as well. The Valiant Volare K was the last Valiant-badged car sold in Mexico.

===Argentina (1962–1968)===
In 1962, Chrysler-Fevre Argentina S.A. started building the 1960 version of the US Plymouth Valiant under the Chrysler nameplate (although later most of the cars were sold under the "Valiant" nameplate as an independent brand). Only the 4-door version was produced. Two models were offered, the "Valiant V200" (Valiant I), with a 2,790 cc engine, and, since 1963, the "Valiant II" with a 3,687 cc engine. In 1965 the "Valiant III" was launched. Despite its name, this car was similar to the 1963 US [[Dodge Dart]]. It was offered in three trims, standard, Coronado (luxury) and GT (sport). In 1967 the "Valiant IV" came out. This car also looked very much like the US 1966 Dodge Dart, offering the same trims than the previous version. Production ceased for the Valiants in 1968, when they were replaced by the [[Dodge Polara#In Argentina|GTX /Coronado/Polara]] lineup. However, for the 1968 model year a basic "Valiant" trim of the Coronado/Polara was offered.

==Collectibility==
The Valiant is a collectable car today, particularly early models, as they are rarer. However, very few early Valiants survive as, until recently, few collectors considered sedans attractive; therefore, outstanding examples fetch high appraisal values today.

The '''Plymouth Cranbrook''' is an [[automobile]] which was built by [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] from 1951 to 1953. It replaced the [[Plymouth Deluxe|Special Deluxe]] when Plymouth changed its naming scheme and was essentially the same as the [[Plymouth Concord]] and [[Plymouth Cambridge|Cambridge]], but at a higher trim level.

The name Cranbrook may have been taken from a city in British Columbia, but it may also have been taken from Cranbrook Drive in Detroit; this small street intersected with Cambridge Avenue. Both streets are between 7 Mile Road West and 8 Mile Road West, near the [[Dodge Main]] plant. Concord Street ran by the plant. This indicates that the cars may have been named after streets near Chrysler Corporation facilities.

==1951 - 1952 (P-23 series)==
The Plymouth Cranbrook, as a car, was conservatively styled, designed to fit K.T. Keller's notion that cars be practical and allow drivers to sit upright while wearing a hat; it was sold at a time when competitors favored the low and sleek look.  Differences between the 1950 Special Deluxe and the 1951 Plymouth Cranbrook are relatively few in number and scope, with interchangeable glass and doors, but different rubber seals; lack of woodgrain on the instrument panel; plastic brake handle instead of chrome; and other similar changes. More substantial was having what had been the hood release handle function as the overdrive control. Fender lettering and other badging necessarily changed as well. From a distance, the cars were essentially similar.

The Plymouth Cambridge and Plymouth Cranbrook models shared the P-23 Series Number in both 1951 and 1952.&lt;ref name=Gunnell646-649&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975, Revised 4th Edition, pages 646-649&lt;/ref&gt; The six-cylinder flathead engine produced {{convert|97|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

{{clear_left}}

==1953 (P-24 series)==
[[File:1953 Plymouth Cranbrook Convertible Club Coupe.JPG|thumb|left|1953 Plymouth Cranbrook Convertible Club Coupe]]
For 1953, the boxy shape was changed for straighter lines, with sleeker and more modern styling. The windshield went to a modern one-piece unit; and the door handles pulled out instead of twisting. The glove box was moved to the center for easier access by the driver. The gas cap was moved to under the trunk lid, resulting in initial problems with gas spilling out of a full tank into the trunk; this problem was resolved with baffles in mid-1953.

The three-window coupe and fastback sedan were dropped for 1953; the former long and short wheelbase models were consolidated with a common wheelbase of {{convert|114|in|mm}}, only one inch shorter than those of Chevrolet and Ford (though considerably less overhang than those competitors gave the Cranbrook a "shorter" look.) Power increased marginally, to {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

The 1953 Plymouth Cranbrook was designated Series P-24-2 and the lower trim level Cambridge was the P-24-1.&lt;ref name=Gunnell649&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975, Revised 4th Edition, page 649&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, the Cranbrook name was replaced by the [[Plymouth Belvedere|Belvedere]], which had been the top trim level of the Cranbrook; all Plymouth names were switched to those of upscale hotels.

==Australian production==
The Plymouth P-23 series was also produced in Australia &lt;ref name=Farmer_405_406&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas In Motion, A History of Chrysler in Australia, 2010, pages 405-406&lt;/ref&gt; and was marketed under the Cranbrook name.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics of motor cars sold in Australia from 1923 to 1957, Restored Cars (magazine) No 21, page 20&lt;/ref&gt; 4,382 examples were built in the years 1951 to 1953.&lt;ref name=Farmer_405_406/&gt;
 
The Plymouth P-24 series, which was marketed in the U.S. as the 1953 Plymouth,&lt;ref name=Gunnell649/&gt; was also assembled in [[Australia]] in that year by [[Chrysler Australia]].&lt;ref name=Farmer407&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, A History of Chrysler in Australia, 2010, page 407&lt;/ref&gt; As in the U.S.,&lt;ref name=Gunnell649/&gt; it was sold as the Plymouth Cambridge and Cranbrook.&lt;ref name=Farmer17/&gt; 

In 1954 assembly of the P-25 series commenced, with Plymouth Cambridge, Cranbrook, Savoy and Belvedere names used.&lt;ref name=Farmer23-25&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, A History of Chrysler in Australia, 2010, pages 23 to 25&lt;/ref&gt; Australian design input was minimal, although major body panels were locally produced. From 1956 a [[coupe utility]] variant was offered in addition to the four door sedan and was available in Cranbrook, Savoy and Belvedere models.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadkillontheweb.com/utes.html My UTEs!, www.roadkillontheweb.com] Retrieved on 13 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Australian production of the P-25 continued through to 1957.&lt;ref name=Farmer23-25/&gt;

The '''Plymouth Cambridge''' was a full-size automobile, produced by [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] in 1951 through 1953. It was Plymouth's mid-range model in its 1951 and 1952 lineups and its base model for 1953. When it was introduced, it came with new features such as electronic windshield wipers and downdraft carburetors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1945-1975|year=1982|publisher=Krause publication|location=Wisconsin|isbn=0-87341-027-0|editor=Gunnell, John A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also had "Safe-guard" brakes, that had two hydraulic cylinder per front wheel instead of just one&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Plymouth/1952_Plymouth/1952_Plymouth_Foldout/1952%20Plymouth-03-04-05.html&lt;/ref&gt; It replaced the [[Plymouth Deluxe|Deluxe]], and was replaced by the [[Plymouth Savoy|Savoy]] for 1954.

The '''Plymouth Concord''', was a [[full-size car]], produced by [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] between 1951 and 1952. It was Plymouth's least expensive model in its lineup, replacing the [[Plymouth Deluxe|Deluxe]].

== Models ==
This line of Plymouths was introduced in 1951 when "war demands nearly eliminated auto production and restricted access to key metals."&lt;ref name="allpar-plymouth49-52"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/cars/plymouth/cranbrook.html |title=The Plymouth Cranbrook, Cambridge, and Concord cars, 1951-1954 |first=Jim |last=Benjaminson |work=Allpar |accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body styles were unchanged from the previous year with the Concord available in a three-passenger business coupe, a fastback two-door sedan, or an all-metal two-door Suburban station wagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YgUKAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=new+Plymouth+Concord+sedan+three+passenger+coupe |page=56 |title=Plymouth, 1946-1959 |first=James A. |last=Benjaminson |publisher=Motorbooks International |year=1994 |isbn=9780879388409 |accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Concord Series was available in a simple ''Deluxe'' trim level. For the new all-metal two-door Suburban station wagon, an additional ''[[Plymouth Savoy|Special Savoy]]'' trim level was available.&lt;ref name="allpar-plymouth49-52"/&gt; This upgrade included better upholstery, arm rests, assist straps, storage compartments, and chrome exterior window and belt line trim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SX2pBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=Plymouth+Concord |page=74 |title=Plymouth wagons: includes Dodge-DeSoto-Chrysler, 1939-1954 |first=Don |last=Narus |publisher=New Albany Books |year=2013 |isbn=9781467559850 |accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business coupe featured cargo space behind the front bench seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fVEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=new+Plymouth+Concord+sedan+three+passenger+coupe |pages=20–21 |title=How to select the car model that best suits your needs (Plymouth advertisement) |journal=Life |date=21 May 1951 |accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1952 model year included minor changes to medallions, [[hood ornament]], and script nameplates, but after the midyear an optional electric [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] unit (for speeds over 25&amp;nbsp;mph) was added for the manual transmission (no automatic transmission was available).&lt;ref name="allpar-plymouth49-52"/&gt;

The Concord model line was dropped for 1953 and replaced by the Cambridge for the lowest trim level.&lt;ref name="allpar-plymouth49-52"/&gt;

== Name origin ==
[[Plymouth, Massachusetts]], was one of the first European settlements in North America and is a major city in the state. Two of Plymouth's model lines in the 1950s were named after towns in Massachusetts: [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] and [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Allpar |url= http://www.allpar.com/history/plymouth/plymouths-1949-1952.html |title=Plymouth cars of 1949 to 1952 |first=Lanny |last=Knutson |accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Concord", was later used by [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]] (AMC) for its line of compact cars (see: 1978-83 [[AMC Concord]]).

The name was resurrected by the Chrysler division after it bought out AMC on its full-size cars (see: 1993-2004 [[Chrysler Concorde]]), though it was spelled "Concord'''e'''".

'''''Miss Belvedere''''' is a 1957 [[Plymouth Belvedere#1957–1959|Plymouth Belvedere]] that was sealed in an underground vault on the grounds of the [[Tulsa]] city courthouse on June 15, 1957, as a 50-year [[time capsule]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Plymouth 1946-1959|last = Benjaminson|first = Jim|publisher = Motorbooks International|year = 1994|isbn = 0879388404|location = |pages = |url = http://www.plymouthbulletin.com/57plymouth.htm|access-date = 2015-11-22|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141012043212/http://www.plymouthbulletin.com/57plymouth.htm|archive-date = 2014-10-12|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A rusty classic in trusty hands|url = http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2008/06/a_rusty_classic_in_trusty_hand.html|website = NJ.com|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burial (1957)===
[[File:'Miss Belvedere' before burial, 1957.jpg|thumb|250px]]
As part of the city of Tulsa's "Tulsarama" Golden Jubilee Week festivities celebrating [[Oklahoma]]'s 50th year of [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|statehood]], it was decided to bury, in an underground vault, a new desert gold and sand dune white two-tone 1957 [[Plymouth Belvedere]] sport coupe. Also, along with the unnamed vehicle, other contemporary items were placed inside the vault as a time capsule for the people of the year 2007.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Belvedere - burial 1957|url = http://www.tulsaworld.com/belvedere---burial/image_50cb0eb6-05d1-59ca-9133-bd88f6889597.html|website = Tulsa World|accessdate = 2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was felt that these items, when the vault was opened in 2007, would help acquaint future generations with life in 1957. When asked why the 1957 Plymouth Belvedere was chosen, event chairman Lewis Roberts Sr. was quoted that the car represented "an advanced product of American industrial ingenuity with the kind of lasting appeal that will still be in style 50 years from now."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tulsarama - Buriedcar.com |url=http://www.buriedcar.com/tulsarama.asp |date=2007-07-03 |accessdate=2015-11-21 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703212633/http://www.buriedcar.com/tulsarama.asp |archivedate=July 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The car was donated by [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth Motors]] and a group of Plymouth car dealers from the Tulsa area .&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Ultimately, the car was intended to be a prize awarded upon the vehicle's unearthing for the individual, or their descendant, who came nearest to guessing Tulsa's population in 2007. An additional prize of the value of a savings account, started with a $100.00 deposit in 1957, would also be awarded to the winner of the car.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; The contest for the ''Miss Belvedere'' was advertised with the slogan “Suddenly It’s 2,007” which was a variation of the 1957 Plymouth advertising campaign “Suddenly, it’s 1960 ...”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burrell|first1=David|title=Suddenly . . . it’s 1960 - best campaign of all time! - Motoringuru.com.au|url=https://motoringuru.com.au/classics/suddenly-1960-best-campaign-time/|accessdate=7 January 2018|work=Motoringuru.com.au|date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kowalke|first1=Ron|title=Recalling the burial of the Tulsarama 1957 Plymouth Belvedere|url=http://www.oldcarsweekly.com/news/hobby-news/unearthing_memories_recalling_the_burial_of_the_57_plymouth|accessdate=7 January 2018|work=Old Cars Weekly|date=21 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second matching Plymouth Belvedere had been awarded, in a separate contest, a few days prior to ''Miss Belvedere'''s burial in the vault.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

A large number of items were placed inside the trunk and [[Glove compartment|glove box]] of ''Miss Belvedere''. A partial list of items included a five-gallon container of gasoline, a case of motor oil, a case of [[Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company|Schlitz beer]] and items that were considered typical contents of a woman's purse, which included a bottle of tranquilizers, an unpaid parking ticket, 14 bobby pins, a compact, cigarettes and matches, two combs, a tube of lipstick, a package of gum, a plastic rain hat, pocket facial tissues, and $2.73 in bills and coins.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Truth Unearthed!|url = http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/truth-unearthed/article_042a8808-257e-54c1-9a64-98ad5ca1a720.html|website = Tulsa World|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some of the items placed in the sealed steel capsule, welded shut and painted white, behind the car included a 48-star American Flag, letters from various state and city officials and documentation for a savings account valued at $100 in 1957 along with entry postcards for the contest regarding the city's population in 2007.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tulsans bury a new car|url = http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/tulsans-bury-a-new-car/article_982862e7-4833-546c-a16e-e77a31e979cf.html|website = Tulsa World|accessdate = 2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = That Buried Car?

A {{convert|12|ft|m|1}} by {{convert|20|ft|m|1}} underground [[formwork|poured in place concrete]] vault, with pneumatically applied gunite on its interior walls, had been prepared in the courthouse lawn with the top of the vault being three feet below the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morgan|first1=David|title=1957 Plymouth Unearthed After 50 Years|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/1957-plymouth-unearthed-after-50-years/|accessdate=7 January 2018|publisher=Associated Press|date=15 July 2007|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Miss Belvedere'' was placed on a steel skid with her tires off the ground and the vehicle was lowered into the vault a number of times for [[Press kit|publicity photos]] to be taken.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; After being lowered for the final time the ''Miss Belvedere'' was coated in a [[cosmoline|cosmoline like substance]] and was then wrapped in layers of sealed plastic. It was hoped that these actions would protect the car from moisture that might seep in.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Though freed from a muddy gumbo, Miss Belvedere now mired in limbo {{!}} Hemmings Daily|url = http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2014/04/14/though-freed-from-a-muddy-gumbo-miss-belvedere-now-mired-in-limbo/|website = Hemmings Motor News|accessdate = 2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tulsans bury a new car|url = http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/tulsans-bury-a-new-car/article_982862e7-4833-546c-a16e-e77a31e979cf.html|website = Tulsa World|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concrete beams were set on top of the vault as a lid and then the beams were sprayed with gunite to seal the vault. Following the replacement of dirt and sod a bronze marker, donated by a local cemetery, was placed to mark the spot.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In 1997 there were some people expecting that the ''Miss Belvedere'' would be unearthed due the inscription on the marker which read "Golden Jubilee, Inc. Time Capsule with 1957 Plymouth To Be Opened in 2007 by Centennial Committee." It was mistakenly thought that the "Centennial Committee" referred to the group that was organizing the centennial celebration for the City of Tulsa in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Espinosa|first1=Rik|title=Truth Unearthed!|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/truth-unearthed/article_042a8808-257e-54c1-9a64-98ad5ca1a720.html|accessdate=7 January 2018|work=Tulsa World|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;gallery perrow="1"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Unearthing (2007)===
In the years leading up to the anticipated opening of the vault, speculation abounded on the car's condition. Many felt that the car would be found in near pristine condition, but others expressed concern that moisture may have entered the vault causing moderate to extensive damage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Memories: Recalling events of 50 years ago can be fuzzy|url = http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/memories-recalling-events-of-years-ago-can-be-fuzzy/article_16e8f4ee-1f4b-5b9f-b91d-9d5021a89316.html|website = Tulsa World|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not known if a nearby construction accident in 1973, in which a [[Water supply network#Topologies of water distribution networks|water main]] was damaged flooding the area, had any effect on the vault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Keith|title=Strange But True Tales of Car Collecting: Drowned Bugattis, Buried Belvederes, Felonious Ferraris and Other Wild Stories of Automotive Misadventure|date=2017|publisher=Motorbooks|isbn=9780760353608|page=93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MFA0DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=miss+belvedere+plymouth&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pzBNdm66-g&amp;sig=J_7bRuDJ3Ef5GXOGt398Cbn6htc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-v9mEi4DYAhUP8YMKHbPfDSc4KBDoAQg-MAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=miss%20belvedere%20plymouth&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After eighteen months of preparations by a group of volunteers, the vault was opened on June 14, 2007, during the state's centennial celebration.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In press interviews, the 2007 organizing committee co-chairwoman Sharon King Davis acknowledged that she was the person who had named the vehicle  ''Miss Belvedere''.&lt;ref name="Tulsa-World-6-22-2015" /&gt; However, the official website used leading up to the event did not feature the ''Miss Belvedere'' name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1957 Plymouth Belvedere Alive in 2007!|url=http://buriedcar.com/|website=Buriedcar.com|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614121325/http://buriedcar.com/|archivedate=2007-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in the event became international, with news organizations and interested people from abroad making plans to attend the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Previch|first1=Chad|title=June unveiling of 1957 coupe turning heads|url=http://newsok.com/article/3051294|accessdate=8 January 2018|work=NewsOK.com|date=9 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizers had made arrangements with vehicle customizer [[Boyd Coddington]], under a [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship arrangement]] with [[Amsoil]], to use the sponsors products in starting the car when it was removed from the vault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Newman|first1=Ed|title=Story of Miss Belvedere Brings Back Memories of Tulsa|url=http://oilordering.com/story-miss-belvedere-brings-back-memories-tulsa/|accessdate=7 January 2018|work=Synthetic Warehouse Oil Ordering Dealer|date=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boyd Coddington Scheduled to Install AMSOIL Synthetic Lubricants in Tulsarama Belvedere|url=http://www.enhancedsyntheticoil.com/Boyd_Coddington.htm|website=www.enhancedsyntheticoil.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local [[Rigging (material handling)|crane service]] had volunteered to lift the ''Miss Belvedere'' out of the vault, and customized lifting equipment was fabricated for the job. An identical model Plymouth Belvedere was found and test lifts were made with the vehicle to ascertain the [[Center of mass|center of gravity]] for the lift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Despotovic|first1=Jenny|title=Lift of Tulsa's Historic Buried Belvedere|url=http://www.taylorcrane.com/projects/203-tulsa-s-historic-buried-belvedere-life|website=www.taylorcrane.com|accessdate=31 December 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Those working on the project were dismayed when it was found that the car was sitting in nearly {{convert|2000|usgal}} of standing water that was {{convert|4|ft}} high.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; It also appeared that at some point the vault had been filled with water to a point just below the lid, covering the entire vehicle.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In line with the [[Cold War]] realities of late 1950s America, the concrete enclosure was advertised as having been built to withstand a [[Effects of nuclear explosions|nuclear attack]]; however, it was not [[Hermetic seal|airtight]], which allowed water to seep in.&lt;ref name="tulsaworld.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  While the car was still wrapped in the ripped plastic covering, the exact condition of the ''Miss Belvedere'' was unknown. Previous speculation that water entering the vault may have caused significant damage to the vehicle was soon realized.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A [[Dangerous goods|hazmat team]] had been brought in to assess any danger to the public when the vault was opened. Their testing revealed only [[hydrocarbon]]s that were from the oil and gas that was buried with the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Previch|first1=Chad|title=Buried car not a pretty sight|url=http://newsok.com/article/3065823|accessdate=31 December 2017|work=NewsOK.com|date=13 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standing water was then pumped out of the vault and preparations were made to lift the ''Miss Belvedere'' out. ''Miss Belvedere'' was lifted from the vault and transported to the Tulsa Convention Center, where it was publicly unveiled on June 15, 2007. Boyd Coddington and his team were on hand to evaluate and start the car, but that proved impossible due to the car's condition.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Time is kinder to Tulsa than to buried auto|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/16/nation/na-plymouth16|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|date = 2007-06-16|access-date = 2015-11-21|issn = 0458-3035|language = en-US|first = Miguel|last = Bustillo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Car's poor condition comes as no surprise|url = http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/car-s-poor-condition-comes-as-no-surprise/article_884dc718-d981-5e86-9b9b-e845009114b3.html|website = Tulsa World|accessdate = 2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon inspection, it was found that the keys for the ''Miss Belvedere'' were corroded in the ignition.

The ''Miss Belvedere'' was intended to be a prize awarded to the individual, or his or her descendant, who came nearest to guessing Tulsa's population in 2007. Out of 812 entries, the winning entrant was Raymond Humbertson, whose guess of 384,743 was closest to the actual figure of 382,457. It was found out that Raymond Humbertson had died in 1979, his wife in 1988, and the couple did not have any children.

===Stabilization efforts===

In November 2007, Humbertson's relatives shipped the ''Miss Belvedere'' to the [[New Jersey]] facilities of Ultra One, a restoration firm whose specialty product is a de-rusting solution which is designed to remove only rust while leaving the underlying metal, paint and decals intact.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It was estimated that the stabilization project would take roughly six months or perhaps longer, given the difficulty of removing the mix of [[cosmoline]] and mud that were caked on the car. While there were no plans to disassemble or restore the vehicle, there were discussions regarding the return of the driveline and electrical system to operating condition.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In May 2009, when Dwight Foster of Ultra One participated in a podcast and provided details and new pictures, it was shown that ''Miss Belvedere'''s restoration was still underway, with the car's exterior having been virtually freed of its rust and mud concretions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2009/05/06/hemmings-collector-car-radio-episode-16-de-rusting-miss-belvedere-why-cash-for-clunkers-doesnt-work/ ''Hemmings Collector Car Radio, episode 16: De-rusting Miss Belvedere, why cash for clunkers doesn’t work'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Foster noted that he had purchased a 1957 Plymouth Savoy as a donor car to replace needed parts to keep ''Miss Belvedere'' from further deterioration, and the initial offer was a [[Promotion (marketing)|promotional stunt]] for his business.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It was hoped that the frame and trunk under body would be used from the Savoy to replace the weakened parts of the ''Miss Belvedere''.&lt;ref name="Schembari"/&gt;  However, after investing of more than $15,000, and after evaluating the condition of the frame and body, Mr. Foster halted further restoration efforts of the ''Miss Belvedere''.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The ''Miss Belvedere'' stayed in Ultra One's warehouse for ten years, while a permanent display location was sought.&lt;ref name="Tulsa-World-6-22-2015" /&gt;

=== Search for a permanent site  ===
After the stabilization work on ''Miss Belvedere'' was completed, the city of Tulsa was approached and offered the chance to have the car returned as part of a permanent display.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The offer was refused by the city, as was an offer to the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian Museum]].&lt;ref name="Tulsa-World-6-22-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Foster stated that he hoped to find another museum that would accept ''Miss Belvedere'' for display.

In 2015, Dwight Foster announced that ''Miss Belvedere'' would be permanently displayed at the Historic Auto Attractions Museum in [[Roscoe, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="Tulsa-World-6-22-2015"&gt;Covington, Hannah.

The '''Plymouth Prowler''', later the '''Chrysler Prowler''', is a [[retro-style automobile|retro-styled]] production car manufactured and marketed from 1997 to 2002 by [[DaimlerChrysler]], based on the 1993 [[concept car]] of the same name.

The Prowler was offered in a single generation in a front-engine, rear-drive, rear-transmission configuration &amp;mdash; with an overall production of 11,702.

== Design ==
Chrysler engineers were given free rein to design whatever they wanted in a "[[hot rod]]" or "sportster" type vehicle. Chrysler's design and international director [[Tom Gale (designer)|Thomas C. Gale]] said his "love for 1930s-era hot rods inspired Chrysler's latest design triumph, the retro-styled Plymouth Prowler."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/1996-11-24/can-chrysler-keep-it-up |journal=Businessweek |title=Can Chrysler Keep It Up? |date=November 24, 1996 |accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gale, who has a hotted up 1932 Ford in his garage approved the hotrod-inspired Plymouth Prowler as the company's follow-up show-stopper to the [[Dodge Viper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6SEYAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=who+has+a+hotted+up+1932+Ford+in+his+garage+-+into+approving+the+rod-inspired+Plymouth+Prowler+as+the+company's+follow-up+show-+stopper+to+the+Dodge+Viper |page=38 |title=Design |journal=Bulletin with Newsweek |volume=115 |year=1993 |accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early influence is credited to a Chrysler-sponsored project at the [[Art Center College of Design]] that resulted in a thesis by [[Chip Foose|Douglas "Chip" Foose]] that included drawings of a retro-roadster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=mOukheSUM0cC&amp;q=Douglas+“Chip”+Foose,+an+Art+Center—trained+designer+whose+thesis+for+a+Chrysler-sponsored+project+at+the+school |page=302 |title=Retro design |journal=Automobile |volume=14 |year=1999 |accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foose "designed it as a coupe for Chrysler to begin with but modified it to a roadster version."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0CWXn7eY4v0C&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=designed+it+as+a+coupe+for+Chrysler+to+begin+with+but+modified+it+to+a+roadster |page=130 |title=Rods and Customs |first=Bo |last=Bertilsson |publisher=Motorbooks |year=2006 |isbn=9780760324035 |accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most striking design features of the Prowler are the open, [[Indy Racing League|Indy]] racer-style front wheels.
The Prowler featured a [[powertrain]] from [[Chrysler LH platform|Chrysler's LH-cars]], a 24-valve, 3.5&amp;nbsp;L [[Chrysler SOHC V6 engine]] producing {{convert|214|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 5850 rpm. For the 1999 model year, the engine was replaced with a more powerful, aluminum-block, {{convert|253|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 6400 rpm version of the engine. Both engines were coupled to a four-speed [[Autostick]] [[semi-automatic transmission]]. The transmission was located at the rear of the vehicle and joined to the engine by a torque tube that rotated at engine speed, an arrangement similar to that used by the [[Chevrolet Corvette C5|C5 Corvette]], [[Porsche 944]], and [[Alfa Romeo 75]], and helped to facilitate a desirable 50-50 front-rear weight distribution. The Prowler was the first [[automobile layout|rear-wheel drive]] Plymouth since the 1989 [[Plymouth Gran Fury]] and would stand as the last Plymouth model with that layout. While criticized for having only a V6 engine, Chrysler's High Output 3.5 had a horsepower rating similar to (or higher than) the company's Magnum V8s of that era. While not making nearly as much torque as a V8, Prowler's light weight helped to achieve rapid off-the-line acceleration.

The car prominently featured [[aluminium|aluminum]] construction, in many cases adhesively bonded, chiefly in the [[chassis]]. The body was produced in [[Shadyside, Ohio]], and the car was assembled by hand at the Conner Avenue Assembly Plant (CAAP) in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]].

== Features ==

Unlike the [[Dodge Viper]], the Prowler was equipped with many features that allowed it to be used as a daily driver. These features included keyless entry, power windows and door locks, dual [[airbags]], leather-trimmed bucket seats, [[air conditioning]] with manual controls, an AM/FM stereo with cassette player (a multi-disc CD changer was an available option as well) and a high-fidelity sound system, a leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio system controls mounted on the rear of the wheel, a color-keyed instrument panel bezel painted to match the exterior color of the Prowler (a similar feature found on the [[Chrysler PT Cruiser]], which was also originally intended to be sold as a [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]]), digital odometer and full instrumentation, and, on later models, a speed-sensitive volume control activated via a switch mounted on the Prowler's instrument panel.

== Production ==
The Plymouth Prowler was produced for the 1997 and 1999-2000 model years. After the Plymouth [[brand]] was discontinued in 2001 the Prowler was sold as a [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] Prowler for the 2001 and 2002 model years. However, DaimlerChrysler marketed the Prowler as a Plymouth in Canada for the 2000 model year; the Prowler was the last Plymouth sold in Canada.

=== Pricing ===
[[File:Prowler_with_Trailer.jpg|thumb|right|Prowler with trailer]]
The original manufacturer's [[suggested retail price]] (in [[United States dollar|US$]]) for each model year for the Prowler:
* 1997 - $38,300
* 1999 - $39,300
* 2000 - $43,000
* 2001 - $44,225
* 2002 - $44,625

Due to limited trunk space, a $5,000 Prowler [[trailer (vehicle)|trailer]] option was available from Chrysler dealers. These trailers resembled the back end of a Prowler and had smaller versions of the five-spoke wheels found on the car. They could be ordered to match a car's factory color. The cars were equipped with a trailer hitch to accommodate the trailer option, however, a warning was affixed to the hitch that indicated that the trailer hitch was not to be used to tow any other accessory (boats, recreational vehicles (R/V's), campers, etc.) other than the accessory trailer. By doing so, the factory warranty would be considered void.

Other retro-styled vehicles followed the Prowler, including the [[Chrysler PT Cruiser]], [[Chevrolet]]'s [[Chevrolet SSR|SSR]], [[Chevrolet HHR|HHR]], and the [[Chevrolet Camaro (fifth generation)|2010 Camaro]], Ford's [[Ford Thunderbird (eleventh generation)|2002 Thunderbird]] and [[Ford Mustang (fifth generation)|2005 Mustang]], 1999 Jaguar S-Type, 1995 and 2004 Jaguar XJ, 2002 Jaguar X-Type, as well as the [[Dodge Challenger#Third generation .282008–present.29|2008 Dodge Challenger]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In 1998, a Plymouth Prowler was sealed in a [[mausoleum]] as a [[time capsule]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. While similar in concept to the [[Miss Belvedere|buried 1957 Plymouth Belvedere]] that formerly resided near the courthouse, the buried Prowler was sealed in Centennial Park in an above-ground vault and sealed within a plastic box instead of plastic sheets that covered the [[Plymouth Belvedere|Belvedere]]. Experts believe the Prowler has a better chance of looking how it did when it was sealed when the time capsule is opened in 2048, when it will be returned to Chrysler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tulsawalk.com/parks-places/tulsaparks-centennial.html |title=Centennial Park &amp; Central Senior Center |publisher=TulsaWalk.com |accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 at the [[Specialty Equipment Market Association]]'s annual car show in Las Vegas, Nevada, Chrysler unveiled the [[Plymouth Howler]] concept. Inspired by hot rod trucks, and based on the Prowler, the Howler featured a small, truck-like bed with a tailgate and hard [[tonneau]] cover. Under the hood, an adapted version of [[Jeep]]'s new 4.7&amp;nbsp;L [[Chrysler PowerTech engine|PowerTech]] V8 engine replaced the production model's 3.5&amp;nbsp;L [[V6 engine|V6]]. A [[Borg-Warner]] five-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] replaced the production four-speed automatic.

In 2004, [[Chrysler]] introduced the [[Chrysler PT Cruiser]] Convertible, which was a two-door, four-passenger version of its popular PT Cruiser Wagon with a shorter roof line and a power-retractable soft convertible roof. The PT Cruiser Convertible went on sale in the spring of 2004 as an early 2005 [[model year]] vehicle. The car was restyled with slightly revised exterior styling and a new interior in 2006, and then was subsequently discontinued after the 2008 [[model year]] (The PT Cruiser (Wagon) itself was discontinued entirely in 2010). 

Chrysler Corporation hosted a 10th-anniversary celebration on August 16, 2007, at the Walter P. Chrysler Museum in Auburn Hills, Michigan, to commemorate the production of the Plymouth Prowler in 1997.

==1949 to 1955==
[[File:Henry Ford Museum August 2012 57 (1950 Plymouth Deluxe Suburban station wagon).jpg|thumb|1950 Plymouth De Luxe Suburban]]
Prior to 1949, Plymouth had offered only a 4-door "woodie" station wagon, which was expensive not only to build, but also to buy. In 1949, Plymouth revolutionised the US station wagon market by introducing the industry's first all-steel body station wagon, the Suburban.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;A Pictorial History Of Chrysler Corporation Cars&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, for the first time in a low-priced car, automatic "turn-the-key" ignition/starter combination was introduced.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Suburban featured a two-door body (plus tailgate) and seated six. The back row of seating folded flat to allow {{convert|42|in|mm}} of flat floor space,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and became popular as a commercial wagon.

The Suburban for 1950 was accompanied by a four-door Special Deluxe wagon, the last of the "woodies", for those wanting something a little more traditional. There were two Plymouth wheelbases, with the Suburban riding on the shorter {{convert|111|in|mm|adj=on}} platform (the Special Deluxe was 118.5 inches). Vinyl upholstery was used, as this was more hard-wearing for utilitarian use. Motive power was the Chrysler Corporation's smallest six, a 217.8cid L-head that produced 97&amp;nbsp;bhp @ 3,800rpm.&lt;ref&gt;Consumer Guide: Cars Of The 50s, page 73&lt;/ref&gt; The Suburbans rode on 6.40x15 inch Goodyear tyres, though a 6.70x15 inch "Super Cushion" tyre option with higher gearing was offered, as was a high-clearance {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on}} wheel option.&lt;ref name="allpar.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Benjaminson |first=Jim |url=http://www.allpar.com/history/plymouth/1946-1959/plymouth-1951.html |title=Plymouth cars for 1951 |publisher=Allpar.com |date=2015-07-02 |accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "taxi package" was recommended to owners expecting to carry heavy loads, featuring heavy-duty chassis springs and shock absorbers, a 100amp/hr battery with a heat shield, and even heavier grade springs in seats and seat backs.&lt;ref name="allpar.com"/&gt;

The Suburban continued to 1955 with few changes other than annual styling applications (including a new body in 1953 and again in 1955). New for 1953 was the Hydrive automatic transmission, which was really a manual with a torque converter that eliminated shifting between second and third,&lt;ref&gt;Consumer Guide: Cars Of The 50s, page 74&lt;/ref&gt; sharing lubrication between engine and transmission. The 1954 models benefitted from a power upgrade to 117&amp;nbsp;bhp from the ageing L-head six, as well as an optional two-speed "Power-Flite" automatic. In 1955 Plymouth introduced a range of V8 engines, extending the power plant range to a 117&amp;nbsp;bhp 230cid L-head six, a polyspherical-head 157&amp;nbsp;bhp 241cid V8, a 167&amp;nbsp;bhp 260cid V8, and a 177&amp;nbsp;bhp 260cid V8 (with 4bbl carbs), the former two of which were available for the Suburban. All-new Virgil Exner styling and a good year for all manufacturers, contributed to Plymouth's best year ever of 705,455 cars.&lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Automobile Production Figures]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1956-1961: Separate series==
[[File:Plymouth Suburban Wagon (16344842661).jpg|thumb|1959 Plymouth DeLuxe Suburban 4-door]]
For 1956 the Plymouth station wagons were grouped in their own separate series &lt;ref name=Gunnell_652&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975, Revised 4th Edition, page 652&lt;/ref&gt; instead of being a part of the standard range of models (the Deluxe in 1950, the Concord in 1951-1952, the Cambridge for 1954 and the Plaza and Belvedere in 1955). The 1956 wagon range comprised the De Luxe Suburban 2-Door, the Custom Suburban 2-Door, the Custom Suburban 4-Door and the Sport Suburban 4-Door &lt;ref&gt;[http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Plymouth/1956-Plymouth/1956-Plymouth-Suburban-Brochure ''1956 Plymouth Suburban Brochure'', oldcarbrochures.org] Retrieved 12 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; with '''De Luxe Suburban''', '''Custom Suburban''' and '''Sport Suburban''' models equating to the [[Plymouth Plaza]], [[Plymouth Savoy|Savoy]] and [[Plymouth Belvedere|Belvedere]] models respectively.&lt;ref name=Gunnell_652/&gt;

The 1956 models came with more V8 power upgrades, up to 180&amp;nbsp;bhp 270cid V8, 187&amp;nbsp;bhp 277cid V8, 200&amp;nbsp;bhp 277cid V8, with a 240&amp;nbsp;bhp 303cid V8 for the Fury.&lt;ref name="Consumer Guide page 75"&gt;Consumer Guide: Cars Of The 50s, page 75&lt;/ref&gt; Tail fins featured for the first time, in what Exner christened the "Forward Look".&lt;ref name="Consumer Guide page 75"/&gt; A 1956 Suburban can be discerned from a 1955 Suburban by the grille centre section - 1955 models had a ribbed center section, with a chrome V badge on the hood identifying a V8 engine. The V was moved down into the grille center for 1956 models and block P-L-Y-M-O-U-T-H lettering appeared on the hood front. The 1956 tail lamps were larger.

A new body arrived in 1957, again by Exner. So modern was the design in comparison to the 1956, that Plymouth's ad men proclaimed "Suddenly it's 1960!".&lt;ref name="Consumer Guide page 75"/&gt; Styling on both Suburbans (and the entire line) was cleaner, without the hugely ornate grille castings Plymouths had worn before. The sedans rode on a {{convert|118|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase, and the wagons were {{convert|122|in|mm}}. The Suburban was a separate model line in its own right.

Separating the wagons from the other lines was done to limit confusion when ordering parts.  Station wagons were growing in popularity, but never matched sedans in volume. Hence there were certain compromises made over the years by all manufacturers.  [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] was known to sell [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] wagons on the shorter Ford wheelbase, particularly in the [[Mercury Comet|Comet]] and [[Mercury Meteor|Meteor]] series, and [[Oldsmobile]], [[Buick]] and [[Pontiac Bonneville]] full size wagons all shared [[Chevrolet]]'s 119 inch wheelbase for a time (unlike the sedans and coupes on their 123.5 inch wheelbase).  [[Chrysler]] reversed this.  Preferring to maintain the exclusive nature of the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country (1941-1988)|Town &amp; Country]], the company based all wagons on the larger bodies and smoother suspensions of the senior divisions.  This made it difficult for Plymouth to compete in price with [[List of Ford vehicles|Ford]] and [[Chevrolet]], but did allow them to claim the roomiest wagon in the low-priced field.  It also meant the wagons used many parts shared with Chryslers, DeSotos and Dodges, but not other Plymouths.  The unique name meant Plymouth dealers were limited in liability; when a mechanic found his new torsion bar was inches too short to fit, he had no one but himself to blame for requesting a Belvedere part instead of a Sport Suburban part.

Suburbans for 1958 were quite similar to those sold in '57, but with detail changes like an under-bumper grille and a V in the grille centre. The P-L-Y-M-O-U-T-H lettering was gone again, replaced by a hood emblem. The rear vision mirror was mounted on the dashboard moved off center  toward the driver's side. The old L-head six was available (though not much longer) and there were now three "Dual Fury" V8s; 225&amp;nbsp;bhp, 250&amp;nbsp;bhp (4bbl) and 290&amp;nbsp;bhp (8bbl), as well as a 350cid "Golden Commando" option.

Although based on the same body, 1959 Plymouth Suburbans featured an 'egg-crate' grille and side trim changes, while the front bumper lost its raised centre section and larger tail lamps set the 1958s apart from the rear.

Unitary construction was the song being sung of the 1960 Plymouth range. Styling changes included a flat hood from fender to fender, and more pronounced tail fins tacked on the rear. The P-L-Y-M-O-U-T-H lettering returned, along the front of the hood, and a short side flash (for two-toning purposes) finished just after the front wheel arches. A 225cid "Slant Six" replaced the old L-head six - this came from development of the new Valiant V-200 series 'compact' cars.

In 1961, a year "most beholders would agree...it was hit with the ugly stick",&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p.123.&lt;/ref&gt; it was available in six models: one two-door and five four-doors, selling at between US$2,604 for the base two-door (style number 255) and US$3,136 for the top four-door (style number 377).&lt;ref name="Flory, p.127"&gt;Flory, p.127.&lt;/ref&gt; It ran on a {{convert|122|in|mm|abbr=on}} [[wheelbase]], measured {{convert|215|in|cm|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|80|in|cm|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|55.4|in|cm|abbr=on}} high, with standard {{convert|7.5|by|14|in|cm|abbr=on}} wheels ({{convert|8|by|14|in|cm|abbr=on}} were optional) and blackwall tires.&lt;ref name="Flory, p.127"/&gt; It had a cargo capacity of {{convert|95.8|ft3|l|abbr=on}}, with {{Convert|21|usgal|impgal l|0|abbr=on}} fuel, and weighed between {{convert|3675|lb|kg|abbr=on}} (for the two-door) and {{convert|3995|lb|kg|abbr=on}} (for the top four-door).&lt;ref name="Flory, p.127"/&gt; It was available with the {{convert|225|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} [[slant 6]] or {{convert|318|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler LA engine#318 V8|Fury]] (single four-barrel [[carburetor]]), {{convert|318|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} Super Fury {{convert|318|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} (dual four-barrel carburetors), {{convert|361|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler B engine#361|Golden Commando]], or {{convert|383|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler B engine#383|SonoRamic Commando]] V8.&lt;ref name="Flory, p.124"&gt;Flory, p.124.&lt;/ref&gt; Either three-speed manual or [[TorqueFlite]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]] [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] were available.&lt;ref name="Flory, p.124"/&gt; It was aimed at the [[Chevrolet Impala]]/[[Chevrolet Biscayne|Biscayne]], [[Ford Galaxie]], and up-market [[AMC Ambassador]].&lt;ref name="Flory, p.127"/&gt;

The Suburban series was discontinued for 1962 with the Plymouth Station Wagon models now included in the Savoy, Belvedere and Fury lines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Plymouth/1962_Plymouth/1962_Plymouth_Full_Size_Brochure ''1962 Plymouth Full Size Brochure'' www.oldcarbrochures.org] Retrieved 12 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Plymouth Barracuda''' is a two-door [[pony car]] manufactured by [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] from 1964 to 1974.

The first-generation Barracuda, a [[hardtop]] [[fastback]], was based on the [[Chrysler A platform|A-body]] platform (shared with the [[Plymouth Valiant|Valiant]]). The first generation car featured distinctive wraparound back glass and was marketed from 1964 to 1966.

The second-generation Barracuda, built from 1967 to 1969, though still Valiant-based, was heavily redesigned. Body designs were now available in fastback, hardtop [[coupé]], and [[convertible]] versions.

The third generation, offered from 1970 to 1974, was no longer based on the A-body, but on the [[Chrysler E platform|Chrysler E-body]]. The completely new design was similar to the [[Dodge Challenger]] and available in hardtop and convertible body styles. The Barracuda was discontinued after the 1974 model year.

[[File:1965 Plymouth Barracuda fastbak ivory.jpg|thumb|1965 Plymouth Barracuda]]

During development of the Barracuda, one of the worst kept secrets was Ford's plan to introduce a new sporty compact car based on the inexpensive [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Falcon]] chassis and running gear (which was eventually released as the 1964 1/2 [[Ford Mustang|Mustang]]); the extent of the other changes was not known.&lt;ref name="Grist"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grist |first=Peter |title=Dodge Challenger &amp; Plymouth Barracuda: Chrysler's Potent Pony Cars |year=2009 |publisher=Veloce Publishing |isbn=9781845841058 |pages=15–22 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=o4wNh7QuIr4C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=1964+Barracuda+The+design+for+a+new |accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysler stylist Irv Ritchie sketched a fastback version of the compact Valiant, as this body style "has always been considered sporty."&lt;ref name="Grist"/&gt; Budgets were limited, but the company's executives wanted to have an entry in this quickly growing sporty-compact car market segment and to capture some of the sales from Chevrolet's [[Chevrolet Corvair|Corvair]] Monza models.&lt;ref name="Grist"/&gt; Plymouth's executives had wanted to name the new model ''[[Giant panda|Panda]]'', an idea unpopular with its designers. In the end, [[John Samsen]]'s suggestion of ''[[Barracuda]]'' prevailed.&lt;ref name="samsen"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://cardesign.homestead.com/barracuda.html |first=John "Dick" |last=Samsen |title=Plymouth Barracuda design history |publisher=Cardesign.homestead.com |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120307002749/http://cardesign.homestead.com/barracuda.html |archivedate=2012-03-07 |accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on Chrysler's A-body,&lt;ref name=Mighty&gt;{{cite book |last=Young |first=Tony |title=Mighty Mopars 1960–1974 |publisher=Motorbooks International |year=1984 |page=25 |isbn=978-0-87938-124-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Barracuda debuted in fastback form on April 1, 1964. The new model used the Valiant's {{convert|106|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase and the Valiant hood, headlamp bezels, windshield, vent windows, quarter panels, doors, A-pillar, and bumpers; the trunk and some of the glass was new. Utilizing the same hybrid design approach as Ford did turning its Falcon into the Mustang significantly reduced Plymouth's development and tooling cost and time for the new model. The greatest effort was put into creating its distinguishing {{convert|14.4|sqft|m2|2|abbr=on}} rear window,&lt;ref name="Motorbooks"/&gt; a collaboration between [[PPG Industries|Pittsburgh Plate Glass]] (PPG) and Chrysler designers that created the largest ever installed on a standard production car to that time.&lt;ref&gt;''Young'', p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Powertrain]]s were identical to the Valiant's, including two versions of Chrysler's [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine|slant-6]] [[Straight-six engine|six-cylinder engine]]. The standard-equipment engine had a [[Engine displacement|displacement]] of {{convert|170|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} and an output of {{convert|101|bhp|kW|abbr=on}}; the {{convert|225|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} option raised the power output to {{convert|145|bhp|kW |abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The highest-power option for 1964 was Chrysler's all-new {{convert|273|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler LA engine|LA V8]]. A compact and relatively light engine equipped with a two-barrel [[carburetor]], it produced {{convert|180|bhp|kW|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weertman |first=Willem L. |last2= Beckman |first2=E.W. |title=Chrysler Corp.'s new 273 cu in. V-8 engine |publisher=Society of Automotive Engineers |date=January 1964 |id=640132 |url= http://papers.sae.org/640132/ |accessdate=2010-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Barracuda sold for a base price of [[United States dollar|US$]]2,512 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2512|1964|r=-3}}}} today).

The 1964 model year was the first for the Barracuda and also the last year for push-button control of the optional [[TorqueFlite|Torqueflite]] automatic transmission.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} It also marked the first use of the smaller "TorqueFlite 6" (A904) transmission behind a V8.

In the marketplace, the Barracuda was "obviously" a fastback version of the Valiant that had a frugal family transportation image. The sales brochure for the first Barracudas pitched it as a car "for people of all ages and interests."&lt;ref name="Grist"/&gt; The more "sporty" Mustang was marketed with abundant advertising to young professionals and with its youthful image proved widely successful following its mid-1964 introduction.&lt;ref name="Grist"/&gt; This became known as the "[[pony car]]" niche of modestly appointed compact-sized sedans and convertibles, which came with standard 6-cylinder engines and basic interiors, but could be outfitted with powerful V8s and "custom" appointments and luxury features. The success of the Mustang has long obscured the fact that the Barracuda actually predated the Ford's introduction by two weeks.&lt;ref name=allpar&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/model/cuda.html |first=Doug |last=Zwick |first2=Lanny |last2=Knutson |title=The Plymouth Barracuda: First Pony (Fish?) Car |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abbreviated sales season for the 1964 Barracuda totaled 23,443 units compared to the 126,538 Mustangs sold during the same time.&lt;ref name="Grist"/&gt;

===1965===
[[File:1965 Plymouth Barracuda Formula S.jpg|right|thumb|1965 Barracuda Formula S]]
In 1965, the 225 slant-6 became the base engine for the U.S. market, though the 170 remained the base engine in Canada.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

New options were introduced for the Barracuda as the competition among pony cars intensified. The 273 engine was made available as an upgraded ''Commando'' version with a four-barrel carburetor, 10.5:1 compression, and a more aggressive camshaft, still with solid [[tappet]]s. These and other upgrades increased the engine's output to {{convert|235|bhp|kW|abbr=on}}.

Also in 1965, the ''Formula 'S' '' package was introduced. It included the Commando V8 engine, suspension upgrades, larger wheels and tires, special emblems, and a tachometer. Disc brakes and factory-installed air conditioning became available after the start of the 1965 model year.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===1966===
[[File:1966 Plymouth Barracuda photo-3.JPG|thumb|1966 Plymouth Barracuda]]
For 1966, the Barracuda received new taillamps, new front sheet metal, and a new instrument panel.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The latter had room for oil pressure and tachometer gauges on models so equipped. The 1966 front sheet metal which, except for the grille, was shared with the Valiant, and gave a more rectilinear contour to the fenders. Deluxe models featured fender-top turn signal indicators with a stylized fin motif. The bumpers were larger, and the grille featured a strong grid theme. A center console was optional for the first time.

Although the first Barracudas were heavily based on the contemporary Valiants, Plymouth wanted them perceived as distinct models. Consequently, the "Valiant" chrome script that appeared on the {{frac|1964|1|2}} model's trunk lid was phased out at the end of the 1965 model year in the U.S. market, and the large stylized "V" trim above the deck lid was changed to a unique Barracuda fish logo for 1966,&lt;ref name="samsen"/&gt; though in markets such as [[Canada]] and [[South Africa]], where Valiant was a marque in its own right, the car remained badged as ''Valiant Barracuda'' until the A-body Barracuda was discontinued.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The second-generation Barracuda, now a {{convert|108|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase A-body, still shared many components with the Valiant but was stylishly redesigned with model-specific sheet metal, and a convertible and [[hardtop]] coupe joining the original fastback offering.
[[File:1967-plymouth-barracuda.jpg|thumb|left|1967 Barracuda hardtop]]

The new Barracuda was chiefly the work of [[John E. Herlitz]] and [[John Samsen]],&lt;ref name="samsen"/&gt; with Coke-bottle side contours and heavily revised front and rear ends. Design cues included a concave rear deck panel, wider wheel openings, curved side glass, and S-curved roof pillars on the hardtop.

The rear portion of the roof on the fastback [[coupé|coupe]] was more streamlined, and the back glass, raked at a substantially horizontal angle, was much smaller compared with that of the previous model. Also, the use of chrome trim on the external sheet metal was more restrained.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

During this time the first U.S. [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108|Federal auto safety standards]] were phased in, and Chrysler's response to the introduction of each phase distinguishes each model year of the second-generation Barracuda:{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

*1967: no [[Automotive lighting|sidemarker lamps or reflectors and backup lights on the rear valance by the license plate.]]
*1968: round side marker lamps without reflectors, mostly white tail lamps with backup lights in the tail lamp housing.
*1969: little tweak on the front grill, rectangular side marker reflectors without lamps, and the backup lamps were moved back to the rear valance by the license plate.

As the pony-car class became established and competition increased, Plymouth began to revise the Barracuda's engine options.
[[File:1967 Barracuda fastback yellow.jpg|left|thumb|1967 Barracuda fastback]]

In 1967, while the {{convert|225|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} slant-6 was still the base engine, the V8 options ranged from the two- and four-barrel versions of the {{convert|273|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} to a seldom-ordered {{convert|383|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler B engine#383|"B" big-block]], rated at {{convert|280|bhp|0|abbr=on}}, the latter available only with the ''Formula S'' package.
[[File:Plymouth Barracuda (Centropolis Laval 2010).jpg|thumb|left|1968 Barracuda]]

Some points of interest with the 1967 Cudas were that the front and rear bumpers were identical. They have the same license plate indent and mounting bracket.

In 1968, the 273 was replaced by the {{convert|318|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} LA engine as the smallest V8 available, and the new {{convert|340|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} LA four-barrel was released. The 383 Super Commando engine was upgraded with the intake manifold, camshaft, and cylinder heads from the [[Plymouth Road Runner|Road Runner]] and [[Dodge Super Bee|Super Bee]], but the more restrictive exhaust manifolds specific to the A-body cars limited its output to {{convert|300|bhp|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Barracuda and Challenger (Muscle Car Color History) |first=Paul |last=Zazarine |publisher=Motorbooks |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-87938-538-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1968, Chrysler made approximately fifty fastback Barracudas equipped with the {{convert|426|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler Hemi engine|Hemi]] for Super Stock drag racing.&lt;ref name=allpar/&gt; These cars were assembled by [[Hurst Performance]] and featured items such as lightweight [[Corning Glass|Chemcor]] side glass, fiberglass front fenders, hood scoop, lightweight seats, sound deadener, and other street features such as rear seats omitted. An included sticker indicated that the car was not for use on public roads; it could run the quarter-mile in the mid-tens in 1968.&lt;ref name=allpar/&gt;
[[File:1968 Plymouth Barracuda Hardtop Coupe, rear left (Hershey 2019).jpg|thumb|right|1968 Plymouth Barracuda Hardtop]]

For the South African export market, a {{convert|190|bhp|0|abbr=on}} high-performance version of the 225 slant-6 called ''Charger Power'' was offered with 9.3:1 compression, two-barrel carburetor, more aggressive [[camshaft]], and low-restriction exhaust system.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} A handful of [[Savage GT]]s were also built from the second-generation Barracuda.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In 1969, Plymouth placed an increased emphasis on performance. A new option was the ''[[Mod (subculture)|Mod]] Top'', a [[vinyl roof]] covering with a floral motif, available in 1969 and 1970. Plymouth sold it as a package with seat and door panel inserts done in the same pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mooresmopars.com/modregistry.html |title=MoPar Mod Top and Mod Interior Registry |publisher=Mooresmopars.com |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1969 version of the 383 engine was upgraded to increase power output to {{convert|330|bhp|0|abbr=on}}, and a new [[trim package]] called'' 'Cuda'' was released. The 'Cuda, based on the Formula S option, was available with either the 340, 383 and, new for 1969, the 440 Super Commando V8.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
The successor for this generation of the Barracuda as a sporty [[Plymouth Valiant|Valiant]] was the 1970 [[Plymouth Duster]].

The redesign for the 1970 Barracuda removed all its previous [[Automobile platform|commonality]] with the Valiant. The original fastback design was deleted from the line and the Barracuda now consisted of coupe and convertible models. The all-new model, styled by [[John E. Herlitz]], was built on a shorter, wider version of Chrysler's existing [[Chrysler B platform|B platform]], called the [[Chrysler E platform|E-body]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newhardt |first=David |title=Dodge Challenger &amp; Plymouth Barracuda |year=2000 |publisher=MotorBooks International |isbn=9780760307724 |page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing this platform was the newly launched [[Dodge Challenger]]; however no exterior sheet metal interchanged between the two cars, and the Challenger, at {{convert|110|in|0|abbr=}}, had a wheelbase that was {{convert|2|in|mm}} longer than the Barracuda.

The E-body Barracuda was now "able to shake the stigma of 'economy car'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newhardt |first=David|title=Dodge Challenger &amp; Plymouth Barracuda|publisher=MotorBooks/MBI |year=2000 |page=7 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=31CLdf2RfFAC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Barracuda+stigma+of+economy+car+1970 |isbn=978-0-7603-0772-4 |accessdate=2010-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three versions were offered for 1970 and 1971: the base Barracuda (BH), the luxury oriented Gran Coupe (BP), and the sport model 'Cuda (BS).&lt;ref name="Hamtramck Historical Registry: Salesman Pocket Guide"&gt;[http://www.hamtramck-historical.com/images/dealerships/SalesmansPocketGuides/1970/Pg%20027.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning mid year 1970, and ending with the 1971 model, there also was the Barracuda Coupe (A93), a low-end model which included the 198ci Slant Six as a base engine, lower grade interior, and (like other Coupe series Chrysler Corp. offered that year) had fixed quarter glass instead of roll-down rear passenger windows.&lt;ref name="www.challengerspecs.com"&gt;[http://www.challengerspecs.com/1970challenger_deputy.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The high-performance models were marketed as'' 'Cuda'' deriving from the 1969 option. The E-body's engine bay was larger than that of the previous A-body, facilitating the release of Chrysler's {{convert|426|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler Hemi engine#Second generation: 426|Hemi]] for the regular retail market.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

[[Swede Savage]] and [[Dan Gurney]] raced identical factory-sponsored AAR ([[All American Racers]]) 'Cudas in the 1970 [[Trans-Am Series]]. The cars qualified for three [[pole position]]s but did not win any Trans-Am races; the highest finish was second at [[Road America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.scca.com/documents/Pro%20Racing/Archives/Trans-Am/1970.pdf |title= 1970 Trans-Am Box Scores |publisher= SCCA |accessdate= 2010-07-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100207055104/http://scca.com/documents/Pro%20Racing/Archives/Trans-Am/1970.pdf |archivedate= 2010-02-07 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A street version of the AAR 'Cuda was produced, powered by the {{convert|340|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} "Six Pack" (three two-barrel carburetors) engine.

The Barracuda was changed slightly for 1971, with a new grille and taillights, seat, and trim differences. This would be the only year that the Barracuda would have four [[headlight]]s (which the Challenger had for all five years of their concurrent run), and also the only year of the fender "gills" on the 'Cuda model.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The 1971 Barracuda engine options would remain the same as that of the 1970 model, except that the 340 6-Bbl was gone, and the four-barrel carbureted 440 V8 engine was no longer on the option list, but could be had via a special order and perhaps a dozen cars were built with it installed; otherwise the 440-powered Barracudas had a six-barrel carburetor setup instead.

In 1971 the big-block power options offered to the customer were:
#{{convert|275|hp|kW|abbr=on}} SAE Gross in the 383-2V
#{{convert|300|hp|0|abbr=on}} SAE Gross in the 383-4V
#{{convert|385|hp|kW|abbr=on}} SAE Gross in the 440-6V
#{{convert|425|hp|kW|abbr=on}} SAE Gross in the 426-8V

In 1970 and 1971 only, the [[shaker hood]] (option code N96), elastomeric (rubber) colored bumpers, and the Spicer-built [[Dana 60]] rear axle were available. The shaker hood was available with 340, 383, 440 four-barrel, 440 six-barrel, and 426 Hemi engines. The elastomeric (rubber) colored bumpers were available either as a front-only option, option code A21, or as a front and rear combination, option code A22. The heavy-duty (and heavy) Dana 60, with a {{convert|9.75|in|mm|abbr=on}} ring gear, was standard equipment with [[manual transmission]]s and 440 six-barrel and 426 Hemi engines, and was optional on those with the [[automatic transmission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1970/2687900/plymouth_cuda_hardtop_hemi_torqueflite.html|website=automobile-catalog|title=1970 Plymouth Cuda Hardtop Hemi TorqueFlite|accessdate=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1970/2687885/plymouth_cuda_hardtop_hemi_4-speed.html|website=automobile-catalog|title=1970 Plymouth Cuda Hardtop Hemi 4-speed|accessdate=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a new grille and single headlights (very similar to the 1970 model) and four circular taillights for 1972, the Barracuda would remain basically unchanged through 1974, with new body side stripes, and minor changes to the bumpers to conform with federal impact standards being the only significant variations.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Big block engines (383, 440, &amp; 426 Hemi), heavy duty suspensions and rear axles, and large/wide tires mounted on 15" x 7" wheels were no longer offered. Additionally; the convertible model was dropped; though a few late build 1971 convertibles were built with 1972 grills and back end panels and provided to Paramount Studios for TV and movie work; being seen on ''[[Mannix]]'', ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' and other shows.  Convenience and comfort items such as power seats, power windows, and upgraded interior (leather seats and plush carpeting) options were dropped, though heavy-duty air conditioning and a sun roof could still be ordered. For 1972 only, three engine choices were offered: a 225 [[Straight-six engine|six]], the 318 (base engine for both 'Cuda and Barracuda), and a revised 340 detuned to meet emission standards.  In addition, all three were tuned to run on low/no-lead gas and were power rated on the NET (installed) method. Three transmissions were offered: a 3-speed manual, the [[Torqueflite]] automatic, and the ''[[Hurst Performance|Hurst]]'' shifter equipped four-speed. For 1973 federally mandated safety bumpers were added front and rear, and the 225 six was dropped, with the 318 and 340 V8s being the only engine choices. For late production 1973 cars, and for 1974 a slightly more powerful 360 V8 (245 E bodyhp) replaced the 340. As since 1970; optional was a four-speed manual transmission (equipped with a [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] shifter) mated to a performance ratio (3.55 to 1) rear axle for the 340 and 360 engines, though as many as three cars (in both 1973 and 1974) were built with the 318 engine and Hurst 4-speed thru special orders or factory errors.

As with other American vehicles of the time,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} there was a progressive decrease in the Barracuda's performance. To meet increasingly stringent safety and [[Automobile emissions control|exhaust emission]] regulations, big-block engine options were discontinued. The remaining engines were detuned year by year to reduce exhaust emissions, which also reduced their power output. There was also an increase in weight as bumpers became larger and, starting in 1970, E-body doors were equipped with heavy steel side-impact protection beams. Higher fuel prices following the [[1973 oil crisis]] and performance-car insurance surcharges deterred many buyers as the interest in high-performance cars waned. Sales of pony cars were on the decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JHVaQFDrx_MC&amp;pg=RA1-PA1973&amp;dq=sales+of+pony+cars+were+on+the+decline,+with+a+few+exceptions |page=55 |last=Mitchell |first=Larry G. |title=AMC Muscle Cars |year=2000 |publisher=MBI Publishing |isbn=9780760307618 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales had dropped dramatically after 1970, and while 1973 showed a sales uptick, Barracuda production ended 1 April 1974, ten years to the day after it had begun.

[[Horsepower#SAE gross HP|SAE gross hp]] ratings were tested with no accessories, no air cleaner, or open headers. In 1971, compression ratios were reduced in performance engines, except the 426 cu in and the high performance 440 cu in, to accommodate regular gasoline. 1971 was the last year for the 426 Hemi. 

Chrysler had plans to continue the 1970 Dodge Challenger T/A for 1971, even publishing advertisements for a 1971 Dodge Challenger T/A. However, no 1971 Dodge Challenger T/A was made. Similarly, no 1971 Plymouth AAR Cuda was made.

The 383 Magnum was the standard engine for the 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T, 1970 Dodge Coronet Super Bee, 1970 Plymouth Cuda, and 1970 Plymouth Road Runner; it was not available in any other models.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==After 1974==
A 1975 Barracuda was planned before the end of the 1970-74 model cycle. Plymouth engineers sculpted two separate concepts out of clay, both featuring a [[Plymouth Superbird|Superbird]]-inspired aerodynamic body, and eventually reached a consensus upon which an operational concept car could be built. Due to a rapidly changing automotive market, the concepts were scrapped, and the 1975 Barracuda was not put into production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularhotrodding.com/features/0709phr_1975_barracuda/index.html|title=1975 Barracuda - The Fish that Got Away|publisher= Popularhotrodding.com|accessdate=2010-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Barracuda was abandoned after 1974, a victim of the [[1973 energy crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1970-1971-plymouth-barracuda-convertibles.htm |title=1970-1971 Plymouth Barracuda Convertibles |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |date=2007-07-25| accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine reported a rumor that Chrysler was considering reviving the Barracuda in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.motortrend.com/6208266/car-news/chrysler-considering-resurrecting-the-barracuda/index.html |last=Ougarov |first=Kirill | title=Return of the 'Cuda? |publisher=Motor Trend Blogs |date=2007-04-26| accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new Barracuda would've been badged as a [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]], due to the Plymouth brand having been phased out in 2001. However, the Barracuda has not been reintroduced alongside the third generation [[Dodge Challenger]]. Rumors of the Barracuda making a comeback were brought up again by ''Motor Trend'' in 2012 when reports leaked that the Barracuda would come back in 2014 under the [[Street and Racing Technology|SRT]] Marque, ''replacing'' the Challenger instead of being built alongside it. It was also stated the car would not be of a retro design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.motortrend.com/detroits-hottest-rumor-chrysler-to-replace-dodge-challenger-with-a-barracuda-20329.html |first=Todd |last=Lassa |title=Hot Detroit Rumor: Chrysler to Replace Dodge Challenger with a Barracuda! |publisher=Blogs.motortrend.com |date=2012-01-08 |accessdate=2012-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610124241/http://blogs.motortrend.com/detroits-hottest-rumor-chrysler-to-replace-dodge-challenger-with-a-barracuda-20329.html |archivedate=2012-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the SRT division was re-consolidated under the [[Dodge]] banner and the Challenger remained in production without a Barracuda replacement.

After years of silence, an all-new Barracuda, now under the Dodge brand, was shown to [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles|FCA]] dealers along with other future vehicles on August 25, 2015. Based on stretched underpinnings of the rear-drive [[Alfa Romeo Giulia (952)|Alfa Romeo Giulia]], it is rumored to be powered by a turbocharged V6 and arrive within the 2019 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1099750_barracuda-coming-back-as-a-dodge |first=Joel |last=Feder |title=Barracuda Coming Back As A Dodge? |publisher=Motor Authority |date=2015-08-26 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collectibility==
The Barracuda (particularly the 1970–1974 E-Body cars) is a collectible car today, with the high-performance versions and convertibles commanding the highest prices. The small number of Barracudas remaining in existence is the result of low buyer interest (and low production/sales) when the vehicles were new.

The '''Plymouth Road Runner''' is a [[mid-size car]] with a focus on performance built by [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] in the [[United States]] between 1968 and 1980. By 1968, some of the original [[muscle car]]s were moving away from their roots as relatively cheap, fast cars as they gained features and increased in price. Plymouth developed the Road Runner to market a lower priced, basic trim model to its upscale [[Plymouth GTX|GTX]].
[[File:Plymouth Road Runner 1969 Emblem LakeMirrorClassic 17Oct09 (14598616764).jpg|thumb|Plymouth licensed the Road Runner name, likeness, and "beep beep" sound from the popular Warner Brothers cartoons.]]

==Origin==

Plymouth paid $50,000 to [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] to use the Road Runner name and likeness from their [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner]] cartoons (as well as a "[[beep, beep (sound)|beep, beep]]" horn, which Plymouth paid $10,000 to develop).&lt;ref name="Motorbooks"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mueller |first=Mike |title=The Complete Book of Classic Dodge and Plymouth Muscle every model from 1960 to 1974 |date=2013 |publisher=Motorbooks |isbn=978-0-7603-4477-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Road Runner was based on the [[Chrysler B platform]] (the same as the Belvedere and Satellite), as a back-to-basics mid-size performance car.

===1968===
[[File:1968 Road Runner green rear.jpg|right|thumb|1968 Road Runner rear view]]
[[File:Plymouth Road Runner BW 2016-07-17 13-30-55.jpg|thumb|right|1968 Plymouth Road Runner]]
The earliest of the 1968 models were available only as 2-door pillared coupes (with a [[Pillar (car)|B-pillar]] between the front and rear windows), but later in the model year a 2-door "[[hardtop]]" model (sans pillar) was offered. The Road Runner of 1968-1970 was based on the Belvedere, while the GTX was based on the Sport Satellite, a car with higher level trim and slight differences in the grilles and taillights.

The interior was spartan with a basic vinyl bench seat, lacking even carpets in early models, and few options were available — such as power steering and front disc brakes,&lt;ref name="Motorbooks"/&gt; AM radio, air conditioning (except with the 426 Hemi) and automatic transmission. A floor-mounted shifter (for the four-speed) featured only a rubber boot and no console so that a bench seat could be used.

The standard engine was an exclusive "Roadrunner" [[Chrysler B engine#383|{{cvt|383|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} B-series]] [[V8 engine]] with a 4-barrel [[Carter Carburetor]] rated at {{convert|335|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5200 rpm and {{convert|425|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3400 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1968/2692895/plymouth_road_runner_383_hardtop_4-speed.html|website=automobile-catalog.com|title=1968 Plymouth Road Runner 383 Hardtop 4-speed|accessdate=June 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its extra {{convert|5|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} rating was the result of using the radical cam from the 440 Super Commando and a .25 raise in compression to 10.5:1 (vs. 10.25:1 with the {{convert|330|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 383). When air conditioning was ordered, the cars received the {{convert|330|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version, as the radical cam specs of the {{convert|335|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version did not create enough vacuum to accommodate air conditioning. A $714 option was the [[Chrysler Hemi engine#Second generation: 426|{{convert|426|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Hemi]] with 2X4 [[Carter Carburetor|Carter AFB carburetor]]s rated at {{convert|425|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5000 rpm and {{convert|490|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1970/2696570/plymouth_road_runner_hemi_hardtop_4-speed.html|website=automobile-catalog.com|title=1970 Plymouth Road Runner Hemi Hardtop 4-speed|accessdate=June 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard equipment transmission was a 4-speed [[manual transmission]] with floor shifter and the three-speed TorqueFlite [[automatic transmission]] was optional. Early four-speed 1968 Road Runners featured Inland shifters, which were replaced by Hurst shifters during the course of the model year.

Plymouth expected to sell about 20,000 units in 1968; actual sales numbered around 45,000. This placed the Road Runner third in sales among muscle cars with only the Pontiac GTO and Chevy's SS-396 Chevelle outselling it. Dodge debuted the Road Runner's cousin, the [[Dodge Super Bee|Super Bee]], as a mid-1968 offering after seeing Plymouth's success with the Road Runner.

===1969===
[[File:1969 Plymouth Road Runner 383.jpg|thumb|1969 Plymouth Road Runner 383]]
The 1969 model kept the same basic look, but with slight changes to the [[taillight]]s and [[Grille (car)|grille]], side marker lights, optional [[bucket seat]]s, and new Road Runner [[decal]]s. The Road Runner added a [[convertible]] option for 1969 with 2,128 such models produced that year. All were [[Chrysler B engine#383|{{convert|383|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine]] cars, except for ten which were equipped with a [[Chrysler Hemi engine|{{convert|426|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Hemi]].

An ''Air Grabber'' option (N96 code) was introduced this year; it consisted of a [[fiberglass]] air duct assembly bolted to the underside of the [[Hood (car)|hood]] that connected to twin rectangular upward-facing vents in the hood with rallye red vent screens. The fiberglass hood box had an "Air Grabber" sticker on the front. When the hood was closed, a rubber seal fitted over the large-oval unsilenced air cleaner. A decal with Wile E. Coyote saying "Coyote Duster" was on the [[air cleaner]] lid.&lt;ref name="Motorbooks"/&gt; The assembly ducted air directly into the engine. The vents in the hood could be opened and closed via a lever under the [[dashboard]] labeled "Carb Air." &lt;ref name="autogenerated1946"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Motorbooks"/&gt;

The 383 engine was standard with the 426 Hemi the only option available for the Road Runner until mid-year production. The 383 was marketed as the "383 Road Runner" engine.

The (A12) 440 engine option with 3X2 barrel [[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] [[carburetor]]s was added to the lineup at mid-year. The "440 Six Pack" had no wheel covers or [[hubcap]]s, only the 15x6" "H" stamped steel black wheels with chrome lug nuts. It featured a black fiberglass lift-off hood with 4 hood pins and a large functional [[hood scoop]] with a red sticker on each side saying "440 6BBL". The scoop sealed to the large air breather. All cars had a [[Dana 60]] [[rear axle]] with a 4.10 [[Gear train|gear ratio]]. Production of the 440 6-BBL A12 option Road Runner was approximately 1,432. The A12 option had an "M" as the fifth character in the [[VIN]], rated at {{convert|390|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,700 rpm and {{convert|490|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 3200 rpm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1970/2697500/plymouth_road_runner_440_6-bbl_hardtop_4-speed.html|website=automobile-catalog.com|title=1970 Plymouth Road Runner 440 6-bbl Hardtop 4-speed|accessdate=June 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same torque as the Hemi but at a lower engine speed. The Plymouth Road Runner was named [[Motor Trend Car of the Year]] for 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6zSfB-ph6yYC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;dq=Road+Runner+took+home+Motor+Trend's+coveted+Car+of+the+Year+trophy+in+1969 191] |title=The Complete Book of Dodge and Plymouth Muscle |first=Mike |last=Mueller |publisher=Motorbooks |year=2009 |isbn=9780760330791 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic production for the three body styles was 81,125 with an additional 3,295 deliveries in Canada and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=M_Zuroh1si8C&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=domestic+production+for+all+three+body+styles+was+81,125+(exports+and+Canadian+deliveries+pushed+that+number+up+to+84,420 |title=Chrysler Muscle Cars: The Ultimate Guide |page=168 |first=Mike |last=Mueller |publisher=Krause |year=2006 |isbn=9780873499705 |accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970===
[[File:1970 Plymouth Road Runner.jpg|thumb|1970 Plymouth Road Runner]]
The 1970 model year brought new front and rear end looks to the basic 1968 body, and it would prove to be another success. Updates included a new grille, a cloth &amp; vinyl bench seat, hood, front fenders, quarter panels, single-piston Kelsey-Hayes disc brakes (improved from the rather small-rotor Bendix 4 piston calipers of '68 - '69 ), and even non-functional scoops in the rear quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autotraderclassics.com/car-article/1970+Plymouth+Road+Runner+-66634.xhtml |title= 1970 Plymouth Road Runner Buyer's Guide |publisher=Autotraderclassics.com|accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design and functionality of the Air Grabber option was changed. A switch below the dash actuated a vacuum servo to slowly raise the forward-facing scoop, exposing shark-like teeth on either side. "High Impact" colors, with names like In-Violet, Moulin Rouge, and Vitamin C, were options available for that year. The engine lineup was left unchanged although a heavy-duty three-speed manual became the standard transmission, relegating the four-speed to the option list along with the TorqueFlite automatic. This was to be the second and last year of the Road Runner convertible, with only 834 made. The new high-back bucket seats shared with other Chrysler products which featured built-in headrests.

The 440 Six Barrel remained an option for 1970. The 1969 "M" Code Edelbrock aluminum intake was replaced by a factory-produced cast iron piece; however there were some early cars built prior to January 1, 1970 that were equipped with the left over aluminum Edelbrock intake from the year prior.

Sales of the 1970 Road Runner dropped by more than 50 percent over the previous year to around 41,000 units (about 1,000 ahead of Pontiac's GTO but still about 13,000 units behind Chevy's Chevelle SS-396/454). This would also be the last year of the Road Runner convertible with 834 total production. Only 3 Hemi (R) code Road Runner convertibles were built (plus 1 to Canada). The declining sales of Road Runner and other [[Muscle car|muscle cars]] were the result of a move by insurance companies to add surcharges for muscle car policies - making insurance premiums for high-performance vehicles a very expensive proposition. Also, Plymouth introduced another bargain-basement muscle car for 1970, the compact [[Plymouth Duster|Duster 340]] which was powered by a {{convert|275|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 340 4-BBL V8 which in the lighter-weight compact A-body could perform as well if not better than a 383 Road Runner. Furthermore, the Duster 340 was priced even lower than the Road Runner and its smaller engine qualified it for much lower insurance rates.

===Plymouth Duster I===
The '''Plymouth Duster I''' was a high-performance concept car version of the Road Runner produced in the late 1960s. It featured the usual low-curved racing-type of windshield and had airplane-type flaps on the top and sides. A set of adjustable spoilers on the side of the rear fender (near the gas tank filler cap) helped prevent side-to-side yaw when slipstreaming in a race, with two more of them on top behind the driver, plus spoilers in the front as rock shields to reduce frontal lift. It was powered by a 383 4-BBL V-8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cars Detroit Never Built: Fifty Years of Experimental Cars |author=Edward Janicki |page=113 |isbn=0-8069-7424-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1970 Superbird ==
{{main|Plymouth Superbird}}
[[File:Plymouth Superbird.jpg|right|thumb|Plymouth Superbird]]

During the 1969 NASCAR "aero wars", Chrysler first fielded the Dodge Charger 500 that featured aerodynamic improvements to a standard 1969 Charger. Later in the season Chrysler and Dodge debuted the [[Dodge Charger Daytona]]. The Daytona featured an elevated spoiler raised 23 inches off of the trunk deck by upright pylons and an aerodynamic nose cone. The Charger 500, especially, and the Daytona to a lesser degree struggled to equal the fastback [[Ford Torino Talladega]] and [[Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II]] in 1969. Dissatisfied with the performance of the 1968 Road Runner, [[Petty Enterprises|Petty Engineering]] had asked the Chrysler managers for 1969 Dodge Charger 500s and Charger Daytonas for the 1969 season. The Chrysler managers told the Pettys that they were "a Plymouth team." The Pettys signed with Ford in days and [[Richard Petty]] and Petty Engineering won 10 races in 1969 and finished second in the [[NASCAR]] points championship.

To meet NASCAR [[homologation]] rules and also to bring Petty Engineering back to Chrysler, it was decided that Plymouth would get its own version of Dodge's winged wonder for the 1970 NASCAR season. While spectacular {{peacock inline|date=May 2015}} on the track, consumer response was lukewarm, leading a few dealers to remove the wing and nose, making them appear more like normal Road Runners.{{citation required|date=August 2015}} Significantly all public sold Superbirds had vinyl tops, while the Charger Daytonas did not. [[NASCAR]] only required 500 copies to be built in 1969, but in 1970, NASCAR required a manufacturer to build one unit per dealer. Production was 1,935 for the US market. Superbirds were available with three different engines. The most popular was the basic Super Commando 440&amp;nbsp;V8 with a single four barrel [[carburetor]] rated at {{convert|375|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Next up was the 440 Six Barrel rated at {{convert|390|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. At the top, and ordered by just 135 buyers, was the 426 Hemi, rated at {{convert|425|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. 135 Hemis (58 4-Spd and 77 Automatics), 1,084 - 440 4-BBL Super Commandos (458 4-Spd and 626 Automatics) and 716 - 440 Six Barrels (308 4-Spd and 408 Automatics).

According to Road Test magazine, performance was around 0 to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 5.5&amp;nbsp;seconds, 1/4&amp;nbsp;mile in 14.3&amp;nbsp;seconds at 104&amp;nbsp;mph with the Hemi.&lt;ref name="aerowarriors"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aerowarriors.com/sss.html | title=Street Superbird Specifications | accessdate=2008-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although similar in appearance, the Superbird was actually quite different from the Daytona. The Superbird was based on the Plymouth Road Runner and the nose, airfoil, and basic sheet metal was different between the Daytona and Superbird. The Superbird actually used the front fenders and a modified hood from the '70 Dodge Coronet that lent themselves better to the nose design. It was an easy fix due to the fact that the mounting points for fenders on both cars were identical. The special nose added 19-inches (483&amp;nbsp;mm) to the overall length (the Daytona's was 18-inches or 457&amp;nbsp;mm), and the trunk spoiler was more angled and higher than the Daytonas. On both models, the spoiler was two feet high. Although it created quite an impression on the street, the wing was not needed at normal highway speeds; it was designed for speedways, to keep the rear wheels to the ground at {{convert|150|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and higher speeds. The reason for using such a tall spoiler was to access 'clean air' according to the engineers who designed the spoiler. In test the spoiler didn't need to be so tall.  The spoiler was this tall, to clear the trunk lid. The tallest the spoiler had to be was the same height as the roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =The Plymouth Superbird and Dodge Charger Daytona |work=allpar.com |url= http://www.allpar.com/model/superbird.html |accessdate = 2007-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the success of the Superbird on the track, 1970 would be the only year it was made.

===1971===
[[File:1971 440 6pack roadrunner engine.jpg|thumb|left|1971 Road Runner 440+6 engine]]
In 1971, the coupe bodywork was completely changed to a more rounded "fuselage" design in keeping with then-current Chrysler styling trends, including a steeply raked windshield, hidden cowl, and deeply inset grille and headlights. In a departure from previous thinking, the B-Body two-door bodies shared little if any sheet metal, glass, or trim with the four-door bodies. The convertible was canceled. The interiors could be ordered with 6-way power leather seats, thick deep-pile carpeting, and additional sound-proofing was installed. A/C, and power steering could be had, except on the Hemi. 1971 was a high-water year for ride and handling for the Road Runner. The overall length was increased, but the wheelbase was shortened an inch. It also saw the introduction of the 340 4-BBL option, and a detuned 383 "Road Runner" engine with 8.7:1 compression, and power dropping to {{convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. In return, Road Runners with the 340 and 383 engine received a standard insurance rating without the costly premiums normally tacked onto muscle cars. The 383 would now run on regular gas.The 440+6 and 426 Hemi were available, though this would be the last year for them. The tall axle ratios with the 8 3/4" Chrysler and Dana 60 rear ends, as well as the wide and close ratio 4-speed transmissions could be had with any of the engine choices, though few cars were built with the ''six-pack'' or ''Hemi'' engines. Aerodynamics were much improved over the first generation Road Runners, resulting in much-improved high-speed handling.

===1972===
1972 saw new emission regulations drive power down and 1/4&amp;nbsp;mile times up.[[File:'72 Plymouth Road Runner (Les chauds vendredis '10).jpg|thumb|left|1972 Plymouth Road Runner]]The 1972 model was nearly identical to the 1971 with a few minor changes. The grille design was cleaned up, and the tail lights were changed to match the new aerodynamic look of the grille. Side marker lights changed from the flush mounted side markers to the surface-mounted units that were adopted across the entire Chrysler line-up for the 1972 model year. The optional bumper guards for 1972 included a rubber strip surrounding the tail lights and a rubber strip below the grille. The big differences came in the cutting back of performance options for the car. The suspension, rear axle ratios (a 3:55 ratio was the tallest available), and most noticeably the engines changed, with the big-block 383 being replaced by a larger-bore (and lower performance) 400 CID version as the standard engine. The small-block 340 CID as well as the performance version of the 440&amp;nbsp;CID engine (with a 4-barrel carburetor, performance camshaft, and dual exhausts) were also available, and for the last time a 4-speed manual transmission could be paired with any of the three engines. All of the engines suffered a drop in compression ratios to allow use of low-lead/no-lead gas and to meet the first round of [[emissions regulations]]. The {{convert|280|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 440 engine was the basis for the Road Runner GTX (the GTX was no longer a separate model) and was available on Road Runners from 1972 to 1974. The 1971-72 Road Runner sheetmetal was used by several [[NASCAR]] racing teams for their racecars and ran well on the circuit during the 1971-74 seasons. [[Richard Petty]] won the championship both in 1971 and 1972 using the Road Runner-based cars, winning 30 races over the two seasons.

For 1972 power ratings on all engines looked much lower on paper due to the new [[Horsepower#SAE net power|SAE net]] measurement system. The famed 426&amp;nbsp;Hemi was discontinued for 1972, and only five 440 Six Barrel equipped cars were produced before this engine option was dropped (it was determined the 440 six-pack could not meet the stricter 1972 emissions regulations) in the fall of 1971.

===1973–74===
The 1973-74 models received completely new sheet metal and had more conventional squared-up front-end styling and changes to the rear that more closely resembled the four-door models than the 71-72s. In addition, the interior options included retaining power seats and windows as well as offering plusher carpeting and seat covers, moving the car to a slightly higher level of luxury.  The restyling helped sales which were up 40% over the 1972 models. In testing 1/4 mile times were getting close to the 16s, top speeds had dropped to barely over {{convert|125|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, and the car moved further away from "musclecar" status. The base engine for the 1973-74 models had dropped down to Chrysler's workaday 318 CID [[V8 engine|V8]] but equipped with dual exhausts which bumped the power up to {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. After 1972, no 440 with [[Manual transmission|four-speed manual]] cars were built. The code E68 400 cu in 260 hp engine was the biggest Plymouth offered with the 4-speed, which could also be had with the 340 (1973), and 360 (1974) engines. The 318 was equipped with a 3-speed manual transmission as standard (though very few were built), and the TorqueFlite as an option, though at least one 318 engine 1974 car was built with the 4-speed manual transmission equipped with a [[Hurst shifter]]. The 440 cu in engine, boasting 280 hp was still available for 1973 and 1974, but only mated to the 727 [[TorqueFlite]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]], with 3.55 ''sure-grip'' 8 3/4 rear axle gearing available.

=== 1975 ===
The 1975 model was based on the newly restyled, more formal-looking B-body which was now called the [[Plymouth Fury|Fury]] (the former full-sized Fury being called "[[Plymouth Gran Fury|Gran Fury]]"). Like the Fury, the Road Runner could be ordered with plush interiors, a rally instrument cluster in the dash board, power seats as well as windows. The Road Runner came with a blacked-out grille and a special stripe treatment to distinguish it from the Fury, as well as a heavy-duty suspension with front and rear sway bars, and rallye 14-inch or 15-inch wheels. As before the 318 was the standard engine, but it was now just with a single exhaust and {{convert|145|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The engine options were however extensive; with a two-barrel/single-exhaust {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 360, a high-performance four-barrel/dual-exhaust (Code E58) {{convert|220|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 360, and three 400 CID offerings; a two-barrel/single-exhaust {{convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, a four-barrel/single-exhaust {{convert|185|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, and a high-performance (Code E68) four-barrel/dual-exhaust/moderate cam {{convert|235|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} were also available. In ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine testing of a 1975 car with the Code E68 400 engine; 0-60 happened in 8.1 seconds, the quarter-mile times were solidly in the 16-second range, and the top observed speed was {{convert|121|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. While just a shadow of the 1970 figures, this performance was at least respectable for the times. All engine choices were limited to the 3-speed ''Torqueflite'' automatic, with the E58 360 and the 400 engines being available with the 3.21 axle ratio gearing. Plymouth's most powerful engine; the 440, was restricted to police models, though it has been rumored that a few 1975 Road Runners were built (via special factory order by checking off the A38 Police Pkge option) with the {{convert|255|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} police spec 440, along with the police spec suspension and wider (7") rims. Only 7,183 Road Runners were built in 1975, and most (just over 50%) had the 318 engine.

Although the name of the model the Road Runner was based on changed from Belvedere to Satellite to Fury, the Road Runner remained a B-body through 1975. While the Road Runner name was planned to be on a B-body in Plymouth's published literature for the 1976 model year, the name was transferred to an optional appearance package for the all-new [[Plymouth Volare|Volare]].

==1976–1980: F-body trim package==
[[File:Plymouth Roadrunner (9343628720).jpg|thumb|left|A Volare-based Plymouth Road Runner]]
In 1976 the Road Runner name was switched to the 2-door model of the replacement for the [[compact car|compact]] [[Chrysler A platform|A-body]] [[Plymouth Valiant|Valiant]]/[[Plymouth Duster|Duster]] series. The new [[Chrysler F platform|F platform]] was marketed as the [[Plymouth Volaré]] and the new Road Runner became primarily a trim and graphics package. The standard engine was the 318&amp;nbsp;V8 with the 360&amp;nbsp;CID V8 offered as an option (with a two barrel carb for 1976-'77 and single exhaust) producing {{convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and only paired with the three-speed automatic transmission Suspension parts were borrowed from the police packages.

In 1978 and 1979, the 360 was offered with a four-barrel carb and, for 1979, dual exhaust, bringing power up to {{convert|195|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The standard engine for the 1979 model year was the 225&amp;nbsp;CID "[[Chrysler Slant 6 engine|Slant 6]]" [[Straight-6|six-cylinder]]. For 1980, the 360 was no longer offered, and the 318 was the top engine.

The Road Runner continued as part of the Volaré line until its discontinuation in 1980.

The '''first-generation [[Chrysler minivans]]''' are a series of [[minivan]]s produced and marketed by the [[Chrysler Corporation]] in North American and Europe from 1984 to 1990.  Sold in both passenger and cargo configurations, the series is the first of six generations of Chrysler minivans.  Launched ahead of chief competitors [[Chevrolet Astro|Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari]] and [[Ford Aerostar]], the first-generation Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager effectively created the modern minivan segment in North America, with many later North American minivans adopting a similar body configuration.

Launched in November 1983 for the 1984 model year, the Chrysler minivans were produced in a single body style, with the extended-length Grand Caravan and Grand Voyager introduced in 1987.  For 1990, the minivan was added to the Chrysler brand, adopting the Chrysler Town &amp; Country nameplate.  For export, Chrysler sold the Chrysler Voyager, competing against the [[Renault Espace]] (which began life as a Talbot, part of the former Chrysler Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.matrasport.dk/Cars/Espace/history.html|title=The Matra/Renault Espace|last=Sorth|first=Lennart|website=www.matrasport.dk|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Background and development ==
[[File:1986 Dodge Caravan Smithsonian National Museum of American History.jpg|thumb|right|A 1986 Dodge Caravan at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History]]

The development of what became the Chrysler minivans began in the early 1970s, as both Ford Motor Company and the truck division of Dodge began separate projects on "garageable vans".  Intended as a more powerful, safer-handling alternative to the Volkswagen Microbus, both companies sought to create vehicles capable as a second car.&lt;ref name="allpar.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/m/history.html|title=A Brief History of the Chrysler Minivan|publisher=Allpar|accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dodge project did not progress past the clay model stage; Chrysler chairman [[Lynn Townshend]] argued that if a market for such a vehicle existed, Ford and GM would have already done it. At Ford, Lee Iaccoca and Hal Sperling developed a proposed garageable van called the [[Ford Carousel]]. It was rejected for the same reason, that GM would have done it already if it was a viable idea.

At the end of 1977, development of Chrysler minivans restarted with four main goals, with a planned 1982 model year launch.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;

# The ability to park in a standard-size garage 
# Car-like [[Noise, vibration, and harshness|NVH]]
# Low, flat load floor
# Removable rear seats (ability to carry a 4×8 sheet of building material on the floor)

Although both the front-wheel drive [[Chrysler K platform|K-Cars]] and L-body ([[Dodge Omni|Omni/Horizon]]) were being considered as donor platforms, Chrysler also allowed consideration of rear-wheel drive.  Ultimately, the L-body was ruled out, as it was considered too light-duty for either the size of the vehicle or its planned six-cylinder engine.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;

In 1978, both [[Lee Iacocca]] and Hal Sperlich were fired from Ford Motor Company, joining Chrysler Corporation.  The same year, the truck engineering division of Dodge was merged within its car counterpart of Chrysler.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  During 1978, Chrysler began research across the United States, seeking what features customers desired in a potential minivan, finding agreement in its planned goals.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  Though potential customers found concept sketches "ugly", Chrysler still found a potential market of nearly 1 million vehicles per year, with Chrysler selling 215,000 of them.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;

By 1979, Chrysler chose front-wheel drive for the minivan project, codenamed "T-115".&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  Though the van would share its transverse engine and transmission with the K-cars, it would be based on a separate body structure.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  Approved by Lee Iaccoca at the end of 1979, the T-115 project would cost $500 million to produce, funded as part of the $1.5 billion in federal loan guarantees given to Chrysler.

From is 1979 approval to the 1984 launch, the proposed design would undergo several major changes.  Originally intended to use four sedan-style doors (similar to a station wagon), Chrysler changed to two sliding doors for the rear, claiming better parking-lot access. The design was later changed to a single sliding door, as Chrysler wanted to market the van to commercial buyers; while engineers wanted to make the left-side door an option. The decision to go with a single sliding door was done to reduce costs.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  During development, the configuration of the rear door was also contentious, with a liftgate winning out over a station wagon-style tailgate.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  On the exterior, in 1981, the side windows were redesigned to become flush with the body; while requiring a major redesign of components and tooling, the design change allowed for a reduction of wind noise and drag.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  To further reduce costs, a number of visible interior components were shared with the [[Plymouth Reliant|Dodge Aries/Plymouth Reliant]], including the instrument panel, interior controls, radio, and various trim items. Drivetrain choices proved problematic as the K-car 2.2&amp;nbsp;L four was considered inadequate and the Slant Six was unsuited for transverse FWD mounting. The Mitsubishi 2.6&amp;nbsp;L four could however be offered as an interim engine until a V6 became available.

==Overview==
Launched in November 1983 for the 1984 model year, Chrysler marketed the first-generation minivans as the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager, along with the Mini Ram Van cargo van.  While the Dodge Caravan nameplate was used for the first time, Plymouth had used the Voyager nameplate since 1974 on its version of the Dodge Sportsman full-size passenger van.

Initially released in a single 112-inch wheelbase, Chrysler introduced a 119-inch wheelbase as part of a 1987 update, launching the Grand Caravan/Grand Voyager.  Starting in 1988, the Chrysler Voyager was exported to markets outside of the United States and Canada.  For 1990, Chrysler began production of the Chrysler Town &amp; Country, among the first luxury vehicles produced as a minivan.

=== Body ===
[[File:1984 Plymouth Voyager LE (30965894313).jpg|left|thumb|LE-trim Chrysler minivan rear seats (1984-1986)]]
Designed as an alternative to full-size station wagons, the standard-length Dodge Caravan/Plymouth Voyager (two inches shorter and two inches wider than a K-car station wagon), presented nearly double the cargo space of a K-car station wagon with a 7-foot long cargo floor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/original-minivans.html|title=Original Minivans: 1984-91 Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager, Chrysler Town &amp; Country|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to the K-car station wagons, the minivans use a liftgate rear door (supported by gas struts), unlocked by key.

Several seating configurations were offered, depending on trim level.  The standard configuration of five-passenger seating in two rows was included with seven or eight-passenger seating in three rows; the back two seats were two-passenger and three-passenger bench seats (in the style of a larger van, these latched to the floor).  The more popular two-passenger configuration was offered in several configurations, with low-back seats (as the minivan was technically a light truck), or high back seats with headrests; depending on trim level, seats could have vinyl, "deluxe" cloth or vinyl, or "luxury" cloth/vinyl upholstery.  Two styles of rear seats were offered.  The three-passenger rear bench was adjustable for passenger legroom or cargo space; the seatback also folded down when not in use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In 1985, a five-passenger version was introduced with a fold-flat rear seat; called "Convert-a-bed", the option allowed the rear seat to fold backwards into a bed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

To lower production and development costs of the Chrysler minivans, the vehicles maintained a high degree of visible parts commonality with other Chrysler vehicles, sharing wheel covers, door handles, instrument panels, and other visible trim pieces with the Aries/Reliant and other Chrysler vehicles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  As the design of the dashboard precluded a conventional glove box, Chrysler added a large storage drawer underneath the passenger seat (a feature retained in later generations of Chrysler minivans and the Chrysler PT Cruiser).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The minivans also became the first automobiles ever with modern cup holders.&lt;ref&gt;https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2013/03/08/when-did-cars-get-cup-holders/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dean |first1=Sam |title=The History of the Car Cup Holder |url=https://www.bonappetit.com/trends/article/the-history-of-the-car-cup-holder |accessdate=24 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1984–1986 ===
At their 1984 launch, as with the K-Cars, the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager were externally distinguished largely by their grilles.  Both vehicles were fitted with four headlights, with the Caravan fitted with an eggcrate grille while the Voyager was fitted with a horizontally-oriented grille.  In what would become a signature styling feature of 1980s Chrysler minivans, top-trim Caravans and Voyagers were both offered with [[Woodie (car body style)#simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] as an option.

In following with many other Chrysler vehicles, for 1986, Chrysler minivans shifted from 4-lug to 5-lug wheels.  To reduce high-speed wind noise, Chrysler added a bumper-mounted air dam.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== 1987–1990 ===
The 1987 model year saw a mid-cycle update to the S-platform minivans.  Largely centered around the May 1987 introduction of the Grand Caravan and Grand Voyager, the update brought a new front fascia and taillights.  To better differentiate the Caravan from the Voyager, the model lines received different grilles; all models except the Mini Ram Van (cargo van) were shifted to flush-lens composite headlamps.  Fourteen inches longer in length than a standard-wheelbase Chrysler minivan, the Grand Caravan/Grand Voyager was the largest minivan in North America in 1987. The first Chrysler minivans fitted with a V6 engine, the Grand Caravan/Grand Voyager eventually became the two most popular configurations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  With both rear seats removed, the "Grand" minivans offered 150 cubic feet of cargo room, 25 extra than a standard wheelbase Chrysler minivan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The front bench seat and Convert-A-Bed, both seldom ordered, did not return for 1987. Interior upholstery was upgraded on several trims, with base vinyl seats removed (and deluxe vinyl remaining as an option on SE trim); for the first time, leather seating was offered on LE/Grand LE trim.

For 1989, the minivans saw a minor update.  To improve fit and finish, Chrysler redesigned the front and rear bumpers, with single-piece bumper covers, painted to match the color of the body.  The early-1980s K-Car steering wheel was replaced by a 3-spoke design (though the rest of the dashboard remained unchanged).  In addition to the standard trim levels, Chrysler added the top-line Dodge Caravan ES and Plymouth Voyager LX; as an early 1990 model, the Chrysler Town &amp; Country luxury minivan was introduced in early 1989.

=== Chassis ===
The first-generation Chrysler minivans are based upon the Chrysler S platform, using unibody construction.  Contrary to popular belief, the S platform is not directly related to the K platform;&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; though sharing powertrains to lower development and production costs, the S platform has a distinct body structure, allowing for a higher hoodline and seat height.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  The S platform is produced in two wheelbases: 112.1 inches for standard-length minivans; 119.1 inches for "Grand"-length minivans.

Adapting the layout of the K platform for a larger vehicle, the S-platform vans were fitted with [[MacPherson strut]] front suspension and a [[Beam axle|beam rear axle]] with [[leaf spring]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  All S-platform minvans are fitted with front disc and rear drum brakes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Engines ====
For the first three years of production, two engines were offered&amp;nbsp;– both [[inline-4]] engines with two-barrel [[carburetors]]. The base [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2&amp;nbsp;L]] was borrowed from the [[Chrysler K platform|Chrysler K-cars]], and produced {{convert|96|hp|kW|abbr=on}} horsepower. The higher performance fuel-injected version of the [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2&amp;nbsp;L]] engine later offered in the K-cars was never offered in the Caravan, and the 2-bbl version would remain the base power plant until mid-1987. Alongside the [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2&amp;nbsp;L]], an optional Mitsubishi [[Astron 2.6|2.6&amp;nbsp;L]] engine was available, producing {{convert|104|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.

[[File:Dodge V6 EFI fender badge.jpg|thumb|right|Fender badge originally used on V6 equipped minivans]]

In mid-1987, the base [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2&amp;nbsp;L]] [[Straight-4|I4]] was replaced with a [[fuel-injected]] [[Chrysler K engine#2.5|2.5&amp;nbsp;L]] [[Straight-4|I4]], which produced {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while the [[Mitsubishi Astron engine|Mitsubishi ''G54B'']] I4 was replaced with a new [[fuel-injected]] [[Mitsubishi 6G7x engine#6G72|3.0&amp;nbsp;L Mitsubishi]] [[V6 engine|V6]] producing {{convert|136|hp|kW|abbr=on}} in March of that year.

Shortly thereafter, in model year 1989, a more powerful engine became optional: a [[Chrysler K engine#2.5 Turbo|turbocharged version]] of the 2.5&amp;nbsp;L I4 producing {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Revisions to the Mitsubishi V6 increased its output to {{convert|142|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, and in 1990 a new {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.3|3.3&amp;nbsp;L V6]] was added to the option list. The V6 engines became popular as sales of the 2.5 turbo dwindled, and it was dropped at the end of the year.

None of the V6 engines nor the turbocharged four were available on the European Chrysler Voyager. The Chrysler Town &amp; Country was only available with one engine option, the Mitsubishi 3.0&amp;nbsp;L V6, until June 1989 when it was replaced by the newly introduced 3.3&amp;nbsp;L V6.

====Transmissions====
Both a three-speed [[TorqueFlite]] A413 [[automatic transmission]] and a five-speed manual were available with most [[inline-4]] engines, including the turbocharged 2.5 L (this was a rare combination). Manual transmissions were not available on 2.6&amp;nbsp;L Mitsubishi 4-cylinder models nor V6 models of the passenger Caravan, but were an option on the Mini Ram Van and Caravan C/V's long wheelbase models with a 3.0 L V6.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[V6 engine]]s were only offered with the fully hydraulically operated TorqueFlite until the computer controlled [[Ultradrive]] 4-speed automatic became available in 1989. The [[Ultradrive]] offered much better fuel economy and responsiveness, particularly when paired with the [[inline-4]] engine. However, it suffered from reliability problems, usually stemming from what is known as "gear hunt" or "shift busyness", resulting in premature wear of the internal clutches. It also required an uncommon type of automatic transmission fluid and is not clearly labeled as such, leading many owners to use the more common [[Dexron|Dexron II]] rather than the specified "Mopar ATF+3", resulting in transmission damage and eventual failure.

The [[Ultradrive]] received numerous design changes in subsequent model years to improve reliability,{{Original research inline|date=February 2015}} and many early model transmissions would eventually be retrofitted or replaced with the updated versions by dealers, under warranty. These efforts were mostly successful, and most first-generation Caravans eventually got an updated transmission.{{Original research inline|date=February 2015}}

=== Trim ===
The S-platform Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager were both offered in three trim levels, an unnamed base trim level, mid-range ''SE'', and top-range ''LE''; LE-trim minivans were marketed with the option of [[Woodie (car body style)#simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] paneling.  In 1989, as part of a minor exterior update, Dodge and Plymouth each gained an additional trim level for the top of the model range, the Dodge Caravan ES and Plymouth Voyager LX, available only in standard-wheelbase configuration.

== Variants ==

=== Cargo van ===
[[File:Dodge Caravan CV.jpg|thumb|1989-1990 Dodge Caravan C/V]]
Chrysler produced two cargo van variants of the S platform, both based upon the Dodge Caravan.  From 1984 to 1988, Dodge marketed the Mini Ram Van.  Distinguished by a "Ram" nameplate under the side-view mirror, the Mini Ram Van was renamed the Caravan C/V (Cargo Van) for 1989.  In contrast to passenger vans, the Caravan C/V was fitted with model-specific headlight clusters, using dual sealed-beam headlamps (shared with the export Chrysler Voyager).  Several window configurations were available, ranging from either no windows to a full set of windows.  Coinciding with the 1987 introduction of the Grand Caravan, cargo van production expanded to both wheelbases.

On the Caravan C/V, in addition to the liftgate rear door, Chrysler offered 50/50 split rear doors (similar to the [[Chevrolet Astro]] and traditional cargo vans).  Produced as an option, the 50/50 doors were constructed of fiberglass; custom-installed by an outside vendor, the doors were installed between the factory and shipment to a dealer.

As with the larger [[Dodge Ram Van]], the Mini Ram Van and Caravan C/V also served as a basis for [[conversion van]]s, sold through Chrysler dealers as well as through converters themselves.

=== Chrysler Voyager (export) ===
{{Main|Chrysler Voyager}}
[[File:VoyagerIEuropeLeft.jpg|thumb|1989-1990 Chrysler Voyager]]
Starting for the 1988 model year, Chrysler began exports of minivans to Europe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  As neither the Plymouth nor the Dodge brands were marketed outside of North America by Chrysler, minivans were exported under the [[Chrysler Voyager]] nameplate, competing against the [[Renault Espace]] and [[Volkswagen Type 2 (T3)|Volkswagen Transporter/Caravelle]] (sold as the Vanagon in North America).

While the Voyager name was derived from the Plymouth division, the Chrysler Voyager was a rebranded version of the Dodge Caravan, fitted with the front fascia of the Caravan C/V cargo van.  To accommodate the vehicle for European sale, the Chrysler Voyager was fitted with amber turn signal lenses (requiring new taillights), turn signal repeaters, and a model-specific license plate surround (adapted for European license plates and embossed with "Chrysler").

Along with its rebranding, the Chrysler Voyager saw internal modifications, largely to comply with European safety and emissions regulations.  With the exception of the turbocharged 2.5&amp;nbsp;L I4 and 3.3&amp;nbsp;L V6, the Chrysler Voyager shared its powertrain with its North American counterpart; many examples were produced with manual transmissions.

=== Chrysler Town &amp; Country ===
{{Main|Chrysler Town &amp; Country}}
[[File:1990 Chrysler Town &amp; Country minivan.jpg|thumb|1990 Chrysler Town &amp; Country]]After being discontinued in the 1988 model year, the Chrysler Town &amp; Country nameplate was revived as Chrysler released a minivan for its namesake division.  Introduced in the spring of the 1989 as an early 1990 model, the Town &amp; Country was released as the highest-trim version of the three Chrysler minivans, sold exclusively in the long-wheelbase body length.  Originally slated for a 1989 release,&lt;ref&gt;[http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/wqIAAOxy4c5RsPPu/$T2eC16FHJIQE9qUHrjB(BRsPPur4DQ~~60_57.JPG?rt=nc Early sales material for the model referring to it as a 1989 model], retrieved on 2014-12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; the Town &amp; Country was the first of the three minivans produced as a 1990 model.

Designed as a competitor to luxury-themed minivans such as the Ford Aerostar Eddie Bauer and the (then-upcoming) [[Oldsmobile Silhouette]], the Town &amp; Country included nearly every feature of the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager as standard equipment, with a number of trim features of its own.  All examples were produced with woodgrain trim (a feature associated with the nameplate).  Initially, Bright White Clearcoat was the sole color available, with Black Clearcoat added as an option in June 1989 (as 1990 Caravans/Voyagers entered production&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imperialclub.com/Yr/1990/index.htm "1990 Chrysler Showroom Brochure" pg. 30], retrieved on 2011–06–18.&lt;/ref&gt;).

To externally distinguish the Town &amp; Country, Chrysler added a chrome waterfall grille (styled similar to the [[Chrysler New Yorker]]), clear-lens turn front turn signals, body-color mirrors, a crystal Pentastar hood ornament (shared with the New Yorker/Fifth Avenue), lower body trim (a monochromatic, long-wheelbase version of the Dodge Caravan ES body trim), and 15" alloy wheels&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imperialclub.com/Yr/1990/index.htm "1990 Chrysler Showroom Brochure" pg. 20-21], retrieved on 2011–06–18.&lt;/ref&gt; (later used with the Plymouth Voyager LX and other Plymouth models).  The interior featured model-specific leather seating, leather interior trim panels, all available power-operated equipment, front and rear air conditioning, and an [[Infinity (audio)|Infinity II sound system]].

Depending on production date, the 1990 Chrysler Town &amp; Country was produced with one of two V6 engines.  Prior to June 1989, it was fitted with a 142&amp;nbsp;hp 3.0L Mitsubishi V6.  From June 1989 onward, all examples were fitted with the 150&amp;nbsp;hp Chrysler 3.3L V6.  Although all S-platform Town &amp; Country minivans have 1990 VINs, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] classifies examples with the 3.0L V6 as 1989 vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/noframes/6255.shtml "Fuel Economy of the 1989 Chrysler Town and Country"], retrieved on 2015-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both engines were paired with the 4-speed [[Ultradrive]] automatic transmission.

In total, 5,404 examples of the Chrysler Town &amp; Country were produced, making this variant the rarest of all Chrysler minivans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/cars/production/chrysler-US.html|title=Chrysler Cars and Production Numbers, United States|last=Wilson|first=Gerard|date=June 2013|work=Allpar|accessdate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=July 2019}}

The '''second-generation [[Chrysler minivans]]''' are a series of [[Minivan|minivans]] that were manufactured and marketed by [[Chrysler|Chrysler Corporation]] in North America and Europe from 1991 to 1995.  Officially designated the AS platform by Chrysler, the second-generation minivans were an extensive revision of the first-generation chassis and body.  As before, passenger and cargo configurations were sold by Dodge, Plymouth, and Chrysler divisions.  The first minivans offered with driver-side airbags (in 1991) and with optional integrated child safety seats (in 1992), the second-generation Chrysler minivans offered all-wheel drive as an option for the first time; a manual transmission would be offered for the last time in the North American market.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/1991-voyager.html|title=1991-1995 Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager minivans|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;      

As with its predecessor, Chrysler assembled second-generation minivans at [[Windsor Assembly]] in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, with additional production at [[Saint Louis Assembly|Saint Louis (North) Assembly]] in Fenton, Missouri from 1990 to 1994.  In 1992, to supplement exports from the United States, the Chrysler Voyager and Dodge Mini Ram Van began production in Graz, Austria (in the [[Eurostar Automobilwerk|Eurostar]] joint venture factory between Chrysler and [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch]]).  

For the 1996 model year, the AS-generation minivans were replaced by the [[Chrysler minivans (NS)|NS platform]], marking the first complete redesign of the Chrysler minivans since their 1984 introduction.

==Overview==
Introduced in November 1990, the second-generation Chrysler minivans were marketed by the Dodge, Plymouth, and Chrysler divisions.  The Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager nameplates returned, with both short-wheelbase and long-wheelbase (Grand) body configurations.  As with the first-generation minivans, base-trim examples were equipped with 5-passenger seating, with 7-passenger seating as standard in higher-trim versions (SE, LE, ES/LX, and all Town &amp; Country vans).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For 1994, the model range underwent a mid-cycle revision, primarily intended to comply with 1998 upgrades to US federal safety standards for cars (although the entire model range was officially considered a light truck).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/1994.html|title=1994 minivans: Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager, Chrysler Town &amp; Country|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alongside minor exterior styling changes, the minivans were given dual airbags, four-wheel disc brakes with ABS, and side impact beams in the front and sliding doors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In another set of revisions, Chrysler sought to make the vans quieter, improving fit and finish.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Chassis ===
The second-generation Chrysler minivans are officially designated the Chrysler AS platform (matching the Chrysler shift to two-letter platform designations in 1990).  Largely a substantial revision of the first-generation S-platform minivans, the AS chassis retained the 112.0 inch wheelbase for standard-wheelbase vans and 119.1 inches for extended-wheelbase "Grand" vans.  While structurally unrelated to the (discontinued) [[Chrysler K platform|Chrysler K-cars]], the second-generation minivans shifted mechanical commonality towards its larger derivatives, adopting engines and transmissions from the Chrysler AA platform (Dodge Spirit/Plymouth Acclaim) and the Chrysler AC/AY platform (Chrysler New Yorker/Fifth Avenue/Imperial and Dodge Dynasty).  

Retaining the unibody construction of the first-generation minivans, the second-generation minivans are fitted with a MacPherson strut front suspension with coil rear springs; all-wheel drive versions have 4-wheel independent suspension with a leaf-sprung rear axle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  During the development of the platform, attention was paid on refining the handling over the first-generation vans, in order to improve stability, maneuverability, and steering feel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For 1991 to 1993, a disc front/rear drum brake configuration was utilized, with a four-wheel disc brake system introduced in 1994.  All versions were fitted with anti-lock brakes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

====Powertrain====
With the lone exception of the Chrysler 2.5L Turbo I inline-4, the second-generation minivans returned the powertrain from their 1990 predecessors. The standard engine was a naturally-aspirated Chrysler 2.5L inline-four, producing 100 hp; this engine was standard on standard-wheelbase passenger vans and all cargo vans. A Mitsubishi-produced 3.0L V6 (producing 142 hp) was an option on short-wheelbase vans. Introduced in 1990, the Chrysler 3.3L V6 (producing 150 hp; increased to 162 hp in 1994) was standard on all Grand Voyagers/Grand Caravans, Town &amp; Countrys, and vans with all-wheel drive; the 3.3L V6 was offered on short-wheelbase as a second option.

For 1994, the AS-platform minivans adopted the 3.8L V6 engine from the Chrysler Imperial.  A larger-bore version of the 3.3L V6 tuned for additional torque output, while producing the same 162 hp of the 3.3L V6, produced 213 lb-ft of torque. The standard engine of the Chrysler Town &amp; Country and all-wheel drive vans, the 3.8L engine became an option on the Grand Voyager/Grand Caravan. In January 1992 a 2.5-liter turbodiesel built by Italy's [[VM Motori]] was made available in Austrian-built Voyagers.&lt;ref name="AR93"&gt;{{citation | ref = AR93 | title = Automobil Revue 1993 | editor-last = Büschi | editor-first = Hans-Ulrich | publisher = Hallwag AG | location = Berne, Switzerland | language = German, French | page = 206 | volume = 88 | date = 4 March 1993 | isbn = 3-444-00559-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially deleted from the model line for 1991, the 5-speed manual transmission made a return for 1992 through 1994 on base-trim or cargo vans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The 2.5L engine was available with a 3-speed TorqueFlite automatic, along with the 3.0L V6. The 4-speed Ultradrive overdrive automatic transmission was fitted to both the 3.3L and 3.8L V6 engines. The Europe-only turbodiesel was only available with a five-speed manual transmission.&lt;ref name=AR93B&gt;[[#AR93|''Automobil Revue 1993'']], p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Body ===
In an extensive redesign, the second-generation minivans featured a major revision of the exterior, lowering the exterior coefficient of drag from 0.43 to 0.39.  While the styling changes were largely evolutionary, the only shared body panels from the first-generation vans were the front doors and the sliding door.    

The front fascia saw the largest degree of change, with redesigned front fenders allowing for a lower hoodline.  Introduced in 1987, composite headlamp units made their return, wrapping into the front fenders.  With the lower hoodline, a smaller grille was used.  As part of the model change, stylists sought to differentiate the three model ranges from each other.  The Plymouth Voyager was given chrome-trimmed headlights and a sleeker version of its 1987-1990 grille; the Dodge Caravan was given headlamps without chrome trim and adopted the Dodge divisional four-segment grille for the first time.  The Chrysler Town &amp; Country shared its headlamps with the Plymouth Voyager with a model-specific waterfall-style grille.  In an effort to lessen rust and improve fit and finish, front and rear bumpers were redesigned, with wraparound plastic bumpers replacing steel and rubber-ended bumpers.

For 1991, the exterior door handles were carried over from the 1984-1990 vans; for the 1992 model year, the door handles were replaced by a larger design, fitted flush with the body.  

In line with the front fascia, the rear fascia underwent several major changes, with the rear liftgate redesigned.  In addition to rounded edges to improve aerodynamics, the liftgate added a larger rear window and a center/third rear brake lamp;  the rear window wiper was updated to feature intermittent modes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In addition to the extensive exterior changes, the interior saw a complete redesign; as with the previous generation, the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager shared nearly identical interiors (across comparable trim levels).  Coinciding with the addition of a driver-side airbag, the dashboard was reconfigured, placing many primary and secondary controls within closer reach of the driver.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Dodge and Plymouth vans were offered with two different analog instrument panels, with the Chrysler Town &amp; Country fitted with a digital instrument panel.  For the first time, a glovebox was added to the dashboard (the underseat storage drawer made its return).  

The 1991 redesign adopted the seating configurations offered on the 1989-1990 vans.  While 5-passenger seating remained available on base-trim vans, 7-passenger seating became standard for all SE and LE-trim vans (regardless of wheelbase).  To meet federal safety standards, all outboard seating positions were fitted with 3-point seatbelts.  The Chrysler Town &amp; Country (in line with other high-content minivans) shifted from a second-row bench seat to second-row bucket seats as part of the redesign.  Marketed as "Quad Command" seats, the configuration was available on higher-trim (LE and LX/ES) Dodge and Plymouth vans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For 1992, for vans with second-row bench seats, Chrysler introduced integrated child safety seats as an optional feature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For 1994, the integrated child safety seats were modified, allowing for a recline position (closer to a standard carseat).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;    

=== Marketing variations ===
From the first-generation minivans, Chrysler carried over the previous trim levels essentially unchanged (the Mini Ram Van was replaced by the Dodge Caravan C/V, although the nameplate continued to be used in the Netherlands).  Although once a distinguishing feature of the Chrysler minivans in the 1980s, simulated woodgrain trim began to fall out of favor in the 1990s.  In 1992, woodgrain became a delete option from the Chrysler Town &amp; Country and removed entirely from the Dodge Caravan for 1994.  

As part of the 1994 model revision, the liftgate badging was changed from a stamped silver-on-black badge to a smaller embossed silver font; this was the first change to badging since 1984.  Chrysler Town &amp; Country versions retained their script-style badging.

==== Chrysler Town &amp; Country ====
As part of the introduction of the second-generation minivans, the Chrysler Town &amp; Country became a permanent member of the minivan model range, intended as its flagship.  Produced only in the long-wheelbase body configuration, the Town &amp; Country was equipped with woodgrain trim, body-color mirrors, and alloy wheels; the Town &amp; Country is the only version of this generation produced with a [[Electronic instrument cluster|digital instrument panel]].  As with its Chrysler New Yorker and Imperial counterparts, the Town and Country was fitted with a crystal Pentastar hood ornament.  Along with tufted leather interior trim, the Town &amp; Country was fitted with "Quad Command" seating, replacing the second row bench seat with bucket seats matching those of the front row.

Although woodgrain trim had been associated with the Town &amp; Country nameplate since the 1940s, in 1992, the feature became a delete option (replaced by a gold pinstripe and a Town &amp; Country fender script) as it began to fall out of favor with buyers.  In 1993 for [[Model year|MY]]1994, Chrysler introduced a version of the Town &amp; Country with a body-color grille alongside the woodgrain side trim.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Chrysler Voyager (export) ====
Outside North America, as Chrysler does not own the rights to the Dodge or Plymouth brands, exports of the Chrysler minivans were done under the Chrysler nameplate.  In Europe, Chrysler began sales of the Voyager in 1988.  As with its first generation counterpart, the second-generation Chrysler Voyager is largely related to the Dodge Caravan in trim. Initially produced by St. Louis Assembly, in late 1991, Chrysler began sourcing the Voyager from Eurostar in Austria. In January 1992, the Chrysler Voyager began production with a 2.5L VM Motori diesel engine. The Chrysler minivans have never been sold with a diesel option in North America, however.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager ====
As with the first generation minivans, the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager were trimmed nearly identically, with the exception of cargo vans marketed exclusively by the Dodge division (as the Dodge Caravan C/V and Grand Caravan C/V in North America, and Mini Ram Van in the Netherlands).  With the exception of the steering wheel, second-generation Dodge and Plymouth minivans are nearly identical internally across comparable trim levels; Dodge Caravans are fitted with a four-spoke steering wheel while Plymouth and Chrysler minivans use a two-spoke steering wheel.

Along with the base-trim 5-passenger vans, both divisions continued the mid-grade SE and deluxe-trim LE, with the LX serving as the top trim for the short-wheelbase Voyager and the ES serving as the top.

In a change from the first-generation vans, all SE and LE vans were offered with 7-passenger seating, regardless of wheelbase.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  LE-trim vans included many features available on SE-trim vans as option as standard, along with additional sound insulation; long-wheelbase ("Grand") vans and all-wheel drive models were equipped with 15-inch wheels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The top trim in the Caravan and the Voyager was the ES (for both versions of the Caravan) and the LX (for the short-wheelbase Voyager).  Sharing its model features with LE-trim models included as standard equipment,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA2"&gt;Chrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure "1991 Plymouth Voyager/Grand Voyager"&lt;/ref&gt; the LX/ES trims served as a cosmetic upgrade similar to namesake trims in the [[Plymouth Acclaim]] and [[Dodge Spirit]].  In place of woodgrain trim, the LX was given color-keyed two-tone exterior; the ES was given nearly monochrome trim (as with the Dodge Spirit, ES-trim Caravans were fitted with white-painted wheels).  In line with the European Chrysler Voyager, the Dodge Caravan ES was not fitted with a stand-up hood ornament (with a body-color Chrysler Pentastar affixed directly onto the hood).

== Alternative-fuel vehicles ==

=== CNG minivan (1994) ===
Following the production of CNG-fuel ([[compressed natural gas]]) van prototypes derived from the [[Dodge Ram Van]] in 1992, Chrysler began production of a CNG-fuel version of its minivan in 1994.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/CNG-van.html|title=Chrysler CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) Minivans|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using the 3.3L V6 and 4-speed Ultradrive transmission powertrain, the CNG minivans underwent several modifications to accommodate the change in fuel.  Along with modifications to the engine valvetrain, four 3000PSI CNG fuel tanks were added to the vehicle, taking the place of the spare tire well and gasoline tank, holding the energy equivalent of 8.5 gallons of gasoline.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Electric vehicles (1992-1995) ===
{{Main|Chrysler TEVan}}
The Chrysler TEVan is a [[battery electric vehicle]] developed between Chrysler and the Electric Power Research Institute.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/corporate/electric-cars.html|title=Chrysler and Electric Cars and Minivans: TEVan, EPIC, and more|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First unveiled as a concept in 1992, an unknown number were produced between 1993 and 1995 (between 56 and 80).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Deriving its name from the original T-115 codename for the Chrysler minivans and EV, the TEVan was sold nearly exclusively to fleet buyers; the vehicle was based on a standard-wheelbase five-passenger Dodge Caravan.

The TEVan used a 27&amp;nbsp;hp, 65&amp;nbsp;hp max (48&amp;nbsp;kW) Separately-Excited [[GE]] DC traction motor coupled to a two-speed FWD trans-axle that featured Hi, Lo, Reverse and Park. The owner's manual referred to it as a 'semi-automatic transmission' although it used a clutch. The motor controller was also manufactured by GE.

Two different battery types were available for the TEVan during its production;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; weighing in at {{convert|1800|lb}}, the battery pack brought the curb weight the minivan to {{convert|5060|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}.  The 180 V nickel-cadmium pack consisted of 30 [[Saft Groupe S.A.|SAFT]] STM5-180 6 V 180 Ah batteries in six removable pods under the floor of the car, delivering over {{convert|50|mi|km}} of range, and used an automatic watering system for easy battery maintenance.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The nickel-iron pack consisted of 30 Eagle-Pitcher 6 V 200 Ah batteries in six pods under the floor and delivered over {{convert|60|mi|km}} of range. The TEVan owner's manual stated {{convert|80|mi|km}} of range.  The TEVan's on-board charger was a PFC Martin-Marietta and accepted 120 V AC@20 A or 40 A, 240 V AC@20 A or 40 A, and as high as 220 V AC@40 A three-phase inputs.

The TEVan had an 8.8&amp;nbsp;kW three-stage ceramic [[electric heater]]. The 120 A DC/DC converter provided all the 12 V power, there was no auxiliary (12 V) battery. [[Dashboard#Dashboard items|Gauges]] included motor temperature and SOC (state of charge, akin to "Fuel Level") using the stock instruments. It was also equipped with electric [[air conditioning]] (R-134a), regenerative braking, power brakes using a Delco electric vacuum pump, [[power steering]], [[Radio|AM/FM Stereo]], and [[airbag]]s. The original equipment tires were LRR, (Low Rolling Resistance), Goodyear P205/75R15 Momentum at 50 PSI.

As a successor, Chrysler would produce the 1997-1999 EPIC (Electric Powered Interurban Commuter Vehicle), based upon the third-generation minivans.

}}The '''third-generation [[Chrysler minivans|Chrysler minivan]]s''' are a series of passenger [[Minivan|minivans]] that were marketed by the [[Chrysler Corporation]] (later [[Daimler AG#Merger with Chrysler|DaimlerChrysler]]) from the 1996 to 2000 model years.  Designated the NS platform by Chrysler, these minivans were sold by Chrysler, Dodge and Plymouth divisions in passenger configurations; minivans were exported under the Chrysler brand.  While the second-generation AS platform was a revision of the original vans, the NS platform marked the first ground-up redesign of the Chrysler vans since their 1984 introduction, ending the use of components from [[Chrysler K platform|K-Car]] derivatives.

The first non-compact minivans{{Original research inline|date=November 2019}} in North America to adopt four sliding passenger doors, the third-generation Chrysler minivans saw its form factor adopted by many competitors.  In addition to chief competitors [[Ford Windstar]], [[Honda Odyssey (North America)|Honda Odyssey]], and [[Toyota Sienna]], the NS-platform configuration was adopted by the [[Chevrolet Venture]], [[Oldsmobile Silhouette]], and [[Pontiac Montana|Pontiac (Trans Sport) Montana]], and the [[Mercury Villager]]/[[Nissan Quest]].

In line with the first and second-generation minivans, the third-generation minivans were assembled at [[Windsor Assembly]] in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor, Ontario, Canada]], with additional production sourced from [[Saint Louis Assembly|Saint Louis (South) Assembly]] in [[Fenton, Missouri]].  To supplement exports from the United States, production of the Chrysler Voyager was sourced from [[Graz|Graz, Austria]] (in the [[Eurostar Automobilwerk|Eurostar]] joint venture factory between Chrysler and [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch]]).

== Development ==
Development of the NS platform minivans commenced in 1990; with a team lead by [[Tom Gale (designer)|Tom Gale]] and Chris Theodore, design work (by Don Renkert) was approved in September 1991 with a design freeze in May 1992.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQhTq18vi7AC&amp;pg=PA300&amp;lpg=PA300&amp;dq=chrysler+ns+may+1992+november+prototype&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Baa1wOSccR&amp;sig=AzR2pxZT2AWQuP-2jLCW3ZGN--0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9GBiUZCpAvSC2gWRk4DoBg&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=chrysler%20ns%20may%201992%20november%20prototype&amp;f=false|title=Riding the Roller Coaster: A History of the Chrysler Corporation – Google Books|date=1991-09-23|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to becoming the first all-new Chrysler minivan in a decade, the third-generation vans were also a response to the development of a front-wheel drive replacement for the [[Ford Aerostar]] (unveiled in 1994 as the 1995 Ford Windstar).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.org/NLD_docs/DHUM0006.pdf|title=Civil Action File No. 0110133833|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016062810/http://www.justice.org/NLD_docs/DHUM0006.pdf|archivedate=October 16, 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the S/AS-platform vans did not share direct structural underpinnings with the Chrysler K-Cars, in contrast to their predecessors, the NS vans were the first generation designed from the ground up as a minivan.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/96-development.html|title=1996-2000 Chrysler, Plymouth, and Dodge Minivans: the reasons behind the choices (development story)|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the first Chrysler vehicles designed with [[CATIA#Automotive|CATIA]], which allowed for much tighter design tolerances.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In its effort to design the third-generation minivans, Chrysler benchmarked the vehicle from various sources of data, using customer input, warranty data, and research based on various other minivans (the Ford Aerostar, Mercury Villager, and Toyota Previa)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  During its market research, Chrysler sought owner feedback on adding a $300 driver-side sliding door option from minivan owners, with 85% of participants answering that they would buy the van with the second sliding door, even as an extra-cost option.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Ironically, the feature was planned for the first-generation minivans, but was removed in 1980 due to concerns over additional tooling costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/history.html|title=Creating the Plymouth, Dodge, and Chrysler Minivan: The Caravan/Voyager Development Story|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside the sliding door, several designs underwent consideration for the floor layout.  Initially, a lower floor height was considered (research feedback felt that the step-in height was too high), but was rejected as it jeopardized the higher driving position sought by buyers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  For production, a compromise design was approved, retaining the same floor height as the previous generation eased into lower door sills.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In addition to preserving the higher driving position, the floor design allowed the fitment of all-wheel drive without major modification, larger wheels and tires, CNG tanks, and batteries for electric vehicles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

While the V6 powertrains of the previous-generation platform were retained, during the development of the NS platform, several configurations underwent configuration.  To improve the body structure, a mid-engine powertrain (in line with the [[Toyota Previa]]) was initially considered, but was rejected for cost and complexity considerations.  A transition to a longitudinal-mounted powertrain (to simplify V6 engine access and all-wheel drive configuration) underwent strong consideration; the transverse layout was chosen in order to reduce overall length.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In an extensive shift from the boxy design of the first two generations, the body adopted [[Cab forward|cab-forward design]], shifting the dashboard and windshield forward.  In contrast to the controversial styling of the GM APV minivans, the roof was moved upward (nearly 3 inches) and the cowl moved lower&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, allowing for a less radical windshield angle.  To move the base of the windshield back several inches (to further improve visibility), Chrysler designed the windshield wiper module/lower windshield cowl to be removable (allowing for improved engine bay access).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In total, the development of the NS platform would cost Chrysler Corporation $2.8 billion dollars (approximately $4.6 billion in 2017 dollars&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://westegg.com/inflation/infl.cgi|title=The Inflation Calculator|website=westegg.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the most costly vehicle ever developed by Chrysler at the time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Model overview ==

=== Chassis ===
The third-generation Chrysler minivans use the Chrysler NS platform designation.  Using a completely new unibody chassis, the NS platform uses a 113.3 inch wheelbase for standard-wheelbase vans (1.3 inches longer) and a 119.3 inch wheelbase for long-wheelbase vans (same as 1994-1995 AS-platform vans).  Front-wheel drive is the standard drivetrain configuration with all-wheel drive offered as an option.

The suspension of the NS platform is a modified version of the previous two generations.  In front, the use of [[MacPherson struts]] continued, with leaf springs and a beam axle in the rear.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/96-development.html|title=1996-2000 Chrysler, Plymouth, and Dodge Minivans: the reasons behind the choices (development story)|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During its development, a number of suspension configurations were considered, including a 4-wheel double wishbone layout.  Rear leaf springs were retained largely in an effort to provide an ideal handling balance with a load in addition to maximize interior load space.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

In a major modification, the front track width was widened three inches, allowing for lower mounting of the engine and transaxle, reduction in turning radius, and a lower cowl height.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

Front-wheel drive vans had front-wheel disc brakes and rear drum brakes.  From 1997, all-wheel drive vans were fitted with four-wheel disc brakes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/overview.html|title=1996-2000 Chrysler, Plymouth, and Dodge Minivans: Caravan, Voyager, Town &amp; Country|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Powertrains====
For 1996, the Chrysler minivans received the first new four-cylinder engine in the powertrain line since 1987, with the introduction of a 2.4L engine (shared with the JA-platform cars).  While smaller in displacement than its 2.5L predecessor, the 150hp engine nearly matched the 3.0L V6 in both output and fuel economy.

In states that did not observe [[California emission standards]], the Mitsubishi 3.0L V6 was the standard V6 option.  In those that followed California emissions standards, the Chrysler 3.3L V6 was the standard V6 option.  In the Dodge Caravan ES and Chrysler Town &amp; Country LXi, the 3.8L V6 was standard.

In 1999, the 3.8L V6 became optional on the Plymouth Voyager Expresso; in Canada, the 2.4L engine was dropped, with the 3.0L V6 becoming the standard engine.

In the United States and Canada, a manual transmission was no longer available, with a 3-speed [[TorqueFlite]] automatic fitted to the 2.4L and 3.0L engines.  The 3.3L and 3.8L engines were fitted with a 4-speed  [[Ultradrive]] automatic.

For the first time, export vehicles were fitted with different powertrains, with the standard engine being a SOHC 2.0L engine with an optional  DOHC 2.0L engine (from the Neon); a VM Motori 2.5L inline-4 was offered, becoming the first diesel Chrysler minivan.  All three engines were offered with either a 5-speed manual or an automatic transmission.  In addition to the four-cylinder engines, export vehicles were offered the 3.3L and 3.8L V6 engines offered in American-market minivans.  AWD models were not sold in the [[United Kingdom]].

=== Body ===
In an extensive shift from the second-generation minivans, the NS-platform minivans abandoned the boxy body design of the previous two Chrysler minivan generations.  While (on average) three inches taller than their predecessors, the new design lowered the exterior coefficient of drag from 0.39 to 0.35&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/overview.html|title=1996-2000 Chrysler, Plymouth, and Dodge Minivans: Caravan, Voyager, Town &amp; Country|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; (matching the Ford Windstar, bested only by the GM APV minivans).   In the redesign, no body panels were carried over, with all three brands adopting new model badging.

A central feature of the redesign (later becoming a standard feature on some trim levels) was the driver-side sliding door.  While first used on compact minivans, including the [[Nissan Stanza Wagon]] and [[Nissan Axxess]], the NS-platform minivans were the first mid-size minivans to adapt the feature.  Though again using a 3-track mounting system for the sliding doors, the system was redesigned to consume less interior space; the exterior door track was hidden below the side windows.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;  In addition to its styling, the function of the liftgate was changed for the first time, with an exterior handle available for the first time, eliminating the pop-and-lift maneuver of the two previous generations (adapted from the K-car station wagon).  The exterior door handles were redesigned, switching from a flip-up design to a pull-out design.

Alongside the exterior, major changes were made to the interior of the NS-platform minivans.  Again offered with 7 passenger seating, the latching system for the 2nd and 3rd row seats was redesigned; in a single motion, owners could release 2nd and 3rd-row bench seats by floor latch, raising them onto rollers to move them out of the vehicle (the lighter 2nd-row bucket seats did not have them).&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;  For the first time, the seatbacks of front bucket seats folded forward.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;  The mounting positions for the third-row seat were moved inboard, matching the second row, eliminating a separate set of seat mounts on the floor.

While styled far differently from its 1995 predecessor, the dashboard of the NS-platform minivans adopted a similar layout to the second-generation minivans.  For the first time since 1988, each Chrysler minivan shared the same steering wheel (among the only Chrysler Pentastars visible to the driver).  While the glovebox was enlarged, the underseat storage drawer made its return as an option, complemented by a second locking storage compartment mounted to the side of the passenger seat.  As a first for minivans, the NS minivans introduced dual-zone climate control (as an option) and adjustable cupholders.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

=== Safety ===
The 1996–2000 Dodge Grand Caravan received a "Marginal" rating in the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]'s 40&amp;nbsp;mph offset test.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} The structural performance and restraints were graded "Acceptable", but the foot injuries were very high.

In the NHTSA crash tests, it received 4 stars for the driver and front passenger in the frontal-impact. In the side-impact test, it received 5 stars for the driver, and 3 stars for the rear occupant, and resulted in a fuel leak that could cause a fire hazard.

According to EuroNCAP crash test results, the 1999 model Chrysler Voyager did so badly in the frontal impact that it earned no points,&lt;ref name="euroncap.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroncap.com/tests/chrysler_voyager_1999/56.aspx|title=Chrysler Voyager 1999|work=euroncap.com|accessdate=2015-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the worst of the group.{{Cn|date=September 2018}} The body structure became unstable and the steering column was driven back into the driver's chest and head'. The 2007 model Chrysler Voyager fared little better, achieving just 19% in the frontal impact test, with an overall score of 2 stars out of a possible 5.&lt;ref name="www.euroncap.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroncap.com/tests/chrysler_voyager_2007/277.aspx|title=Chrysler Voyager 2007|work=www.euroncap.com|accessdate=2015-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, chest compression measurements on the test dummy 'indicated an unacceptably high risk of serious or fatal injury. As a result, the final star in the adult occupant rating is struck-through'.

Despite the bad results in the EuroNCAP crash tests, statistics from the real world indicate that this is not the whole picture. [[Folksam]] is a Swedish insurance company that in May 2009 published a report on injuries and survivability of 172 car models.  The 88–96 generation got a real world rating of "Average", and the 96-00 generation got a rating called "Safest" (at least 30% safer than the average car.){{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

== Marketing variations ==
Introduced in March 1995 for the 1996 model year&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQhTq18vi7AC&amp;pg=PA300&amp;lpg=PA300&amp;dq=chrysler+ns+may+1992+november+prototype&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Baa1wOSccR&amp;sig=AzR2pxZT2AWQuP-2jLCW3ZGN--0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9GBiUZCpAvSC2gWRk4DoBg&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=chrysler%20ns%20may%201992%20november%20prototype&amp;f=false|title=Riding the Roller Coaster: A History of the Chrysler Corporation – Google Books|date=1991-09-23|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the third-generation Chrysler minivans were marketed by the Chrysler, Dodge, and Plymouth divisions, with the return of the [[Plymouth Voyager]], [[Dodge Caravan]], and [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]].  In a change from the previous two generations, to better distinguish its three divisions, the Plymouth Voyager was marketed as an entry-level minivan, with the Dodge Caravan slotted between the Voyager and the Chrysler Town &amp; Country.    

As before, the Voyager and Caravan were produced in standard and extended-length (Grand) configurations, with the Town &amp; Country introducing a standard-length configuration for the first time.  For the first time, all Chrysler minivans were passenger vans, as the Dodge Caravan C/V cargo van was discontinued.    
[[File:2000 Chrysler Town &amp; Country Limited.png|thumb|2000 Chrysler Town &amp; Country Limited]]

=== Chrysler Town &amp; Country ===
Again positioned as the flagship of the Chrysler minivans, the third-generation Chrysler Town &amp; Country underwent an extensive revision of its model range.  For the first time, a short-wheelbase body was offered, along with multiple trim levels.  As part of the redesign, the model line saw its long-running simulated woodgrain trim (dating to 1965) deleted in favor of body color moldings with chrome exterior trim.  In another change, the Chrysler crystal Pentastar hood ornament was replaced by a medallion-style Chrysler grille badge.

Replacing the LE-trim Voyager/Grand Voyager (in the United States), the base trim was LX (short-wheelbase, SX for 1997-1999) with LXi serving as the top-level trim.  In 1997, the driver-side sliding door became standard on the Town &amp; Country (1996 examples produced without one are very rare).

For 1998, the Town &amp; Country underwent a mid-cycle revision to further differentiate it from its Dodge and Plymouth counterparts, centered around the introduction of a redesigned grille (introducing a "winged" Chrysler badge) and an updated interior.  Above the LXi, the Town &amp; Country Limited made its debut.  For 2000, the short-wheelbase body was discontinued, ending the SX trim.  [[File:2001 Chrysler Grand Voyager LE Automatic 3.3.jpg|thumb|2001 Chrysler Grand Voyager LE (RHD)]]

=== Chrysler Voyager (export) ===
Outside the United States and Canada, Chrysler exported the third-generation minivans to a number of global markets under the Chrysler (Grand) Voyager nameplate.  Using the body and interior of the Dodge Caravan, the Voyager was produced by Saint Louis Assembly in Fenton, Missouri and by Eurostar in Graz, Austria. Despite being discontinued for most markets, a commercial version continued to be offered in the Netherlands under the Dodge Ram Van nameplate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/autohistorian/31839325642 |title=1996 Dodge Ram Van |date=December 30, 2016 |first=Alden |last=Jewell |accessdate=December 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time, the Voyager was produced in right-hand drive, allowing wide sales in Australia and the United Kingdom.  Sharing its V6 engines with its domestic counterpart, the Voyager was also offered with a 2.0L inline-4 (from the Neon, in place of the 2.4L engine), and a 2.5L diesel inline-4.  Along with automatic transmissions, a 5-speed manual transmission was offered (the only third-generation Chrysler minivan produced with a manual transmission).

In some markets (including Brazil and South Korea), Chrysler minivans were offered under the Chrysler Caravan nameplate, using Dodge Caravan bodyshells.[[File:Dodge-Caravan.jpg|thumb|1996 Dodge Caravan (no driver-side sliding door)]]

=== Dodge Caravan ===
In a break from its predecessors, the third-generation Dodge Caravan was marketed distinctly from the Plymouth Voyager, becoming the mid-range model of the Chrysler minivan product line.  The Caravan C/V cargo van was discontinued, with all examples serving as passenger vans.  In place of the Pentastar, Chrysler adopted the Dodge "Ram" hood emblem; the Caravan is the only NS minivan with a hood-mounted emblem.  

As with its predecessor, the Caravan and Grand Caravan used base, SE, LE, and ES trims.  Base and SE/LE trims were fitted with gray bumpers with gray moldings; ES trims (and Sport-package versions) featured body-colored trim.  7-passenger seating was standard, regardless of body length.  For 1999, the driver-side sliding door became offered as an option on all versions of the Caravan.    

For 1999, the Dodge Caravan ES was equipped with an [[Autostick#Chrysler%20Autostick|Autostick gear selector]] for its automatic transmission, a first for a minivan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/first.html|title=Chrysler minivan firsts|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the Caravan is designed with a column-mounted automatic transmission shifter, Autostick is operated via a momentary switch on the gear selector.  [[File:Plymouth Grand Voyager.jpg|thumb|Plymouth Grand Voyager SE]]

=== Plymouth Voyager ===
In a shift from previous minivans, the third-generation Voyager was marketed as the entry-level Chrysler minivan rather than as a direct counterpart of the Dodge Caravan.  While sharing the same bodyshell, the Voyager and Caravan saw significant changes in body trim and feature content.  Distinguished by a dark gray eggcrate grille (a body-color grille became an option in 1998), the Voyager used matte gray bumpers across all trim levels with matte gray side moldings (fog lights were not available as an option).   Before calendar 1996, the NS Voyager was produced with the Pentastar, shifting to the "sailboat" Plymouth grille emblem afterward.  

The Voyager retained the base, SE, and LE trims from its predecessor.  To reduce model overlap, the LE trim was discontinued in the United States (in favor of an expanded Town &amp; Country range).  To allow the Plymouth brand to remain competitive, the Rallye option package was introduced on the SE trim&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure "1996 Plymouth Voyager/Grand Voyager"&lt;/ref&gt;; along with exterior badging, the Rallye offered interior content featured in LE-trim Voyagers and Caravans.  For 1998, the Rallye trim was renamed Expresso.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure "1998 Plymouth Voyager"&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2000, as Chrysler withdrew the Plymouth brand, the Voyager was marketed by both Chrysler and Plymouth.  

== Alternative-fuel vehicles ==
In 1999, Dodge introduced the Caravan EPIC, a fully electric minivan. The EPIC was powered by 28 12-volt NiMH batteries and was capable of traveling up to {{convert|80|mi|km}} on a single charge. The EPIC was sold as a fleet-only lease vehicle. Production of the EPIC was discontinued in 2001. Only a few hundred of these vehicles were produced and sold. After the leases expired they were returned and crushed. Approximately 10 vans remain in private hands today.

== Concept vehicles ==
&lt;p&gt;In 1999, coinciding with the 15th anniversary of Chrysler minivan production, Chrysler unveiled three concept minivans, largely intended to further advance the divisional styling and design of each vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Chrysler Pacifica ===
&lt;p&gt;The [[Chrysler Pacifica (1999 concept vehicle)|Chrysler Pacifica]], derived from the Chrysler Town &amp; Country, was given an exterior and interior restyling.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allcarindex.com/auto-car-model/United-States-Chrysler-Pacifica-Concept-1/|title=Chrysler - Pacifica Concept [1]|website=ACI|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to a full-size conversion van, the Pacifica was given a raised roof for increased headroom, with a full-length skylight. In a 2+2+2 seating layout, the Pacifica was fitted with power-operated middle-row seats (with power-operated footrests).&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  The exterior adapted design elements of the flagship [[Chrysler LHS]] sedan, including a (smaller) version of its grille and modified versions of its headlamps.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2004 to 2008, the Chrysler Pacifica nameplate saw use on a production vehicle, as a CUV derived from the Grand Caravan/Town &amp; Country.  For 2017, the Pacifica nameplate was again revived, used on the current generation of Chrysler-division minivans.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Dodge Caravan R/T ===
&lt;p&gt;As a follow-up to the 1996 Dodge Caravan ESS&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motortrend.com/news/dodge-caravan-ess/|title=Motor Trend {{!}} Car Reviews {{!}} DODGE CARAVAN ESS - FIRST TEST}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the 1999 Dodge Caravan R/T replaced the 3.8L V6 with the 3.5L V6 of the Chrysler 300M, increasing output to 253 hp, paired with the 4-speed AutoStick transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motortrend.com/news/dodge-caravan-2/|title=Motor Trend {{!}} News {{!}} DODGE CARAVAN - DODGE'S CORNER-CARVING CARAVAN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dodge Caravan adapted several styling elements from the Dodge Viper RT/10, including hoodscoops (carried directly over from the Viper), and a redesigned lower fascia that shifted the Dodge "crosshair" grille into the lower bumper (with the addition of foglamps from the Viper).  The interior featured a performance-oriented theme, with brushed aluminum trim for the trim and door panels, with black leather seats and racing-style pedals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2011 to 2016, Dodge produced the Grand Caravan R/T as an trim variant, though the option was largely cosmetic.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Plymouth Voyager XG ===
&lt;p&gt;Derived from the Plymouth Voyager, the Plymouth Voyager XG was a four-seat minivan geared towards active lifestyles of younger drivers.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carstyling.ru/en/car/1999_plymouth_voyager_xg/|title=1999 Plymouth Voyager XG - Concepts|last=Site-Mechanics|website=www.carstyling.ru|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Externally similar to the standard Voyager, the XG was distinguished by its 17-inch wheels (shared with the Plymouth Prowler), and body-color bumpers and grille.  The interior was given a full-length retractable fabric sunroof, with a large removable storage pod placed behind the seats.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Voyager XG featured the powertrain of the export-market Chrysler Voyager, with a 2.5L diesel engine and a 5-speed manual transmission.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

== Awards ==
&lt;p&gt;The new minivans earned unanimous critical acclaim: the Dodge Caravan was the 1996 [[Motor Trend Car of the Year]] (the first and only minivan to ever win the award), the 1996 [[North American Car of the Year]], and the vans were on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 1996 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120724084058/http://www.caranddriver.sg/features/archive/1996_10best_cars-10best_cars "1996 10Best Cars"], retrieved on 2010–08–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caranddriver.sg/features/archive/1997_10best_cars-10best_cars "1997 10Best Cars"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120730194234/http://www.caranddriver.sg/features/archive/1997_10best_cars-10best_cars|date=July 30, 2012}}, retrieved on 2010–08–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The '''Plymouth De Luxe''' and '''Special De Luxe''' were [[full-size]]d [[automobile]]s which were produced by American manufacturer [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] during the 1941-42 and 1946-50 model years. 

The De Luxe was offered in two trim levels, the De Luxe and the top-of-the-line Special De Luxe.&lt;ref name="Chrysler Corporation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Travel there and Back in a Plymouth|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Plymouth/1946%20Plymouth/album/1946%20Plymouth-16.html|publisher=Chrysler Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine in 1946 was a {{convert|95|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} {{convert|217.8|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-six engine|inline-six]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Plymouth/1946%20Plymouth/album/1946%20Plymouth-16.html |title=Directory Index: Plymouth/1946 Plymouth/album |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 this engine was upgraded to produce {{convert|97|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1949"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Plymouth/1949%20Plymouth/album/1949%20Plymouth-12.html |title=Directory Index: Plymouth/1949 Plymouth/album |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Plymouth Acclaim''' was a [[mid-size]] [[sedan (car)|sedan]] produced in the 1989 to 1995 model years. The Acclaim was [[Plymouth (division)|Plymouth]]'s updated replacement for both the similarly sized [[Chrysler E platform|E-body]] [[Plymouth Caravelle|Caravelle]] and the K-body [[Plymouth Reliant|Reliant]].&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Corporation Master Technician Service Conference book "New Model Service Highlights '89" p.4: "Spirit and Acclaim are the new midsize sedans, replacing 600 and Caravelle."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Badge engineering]] was employed to give [[Dodge]] and [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] their own versions of the [[Chrysler A platform#AA|AA-body]] Acclaim: the [[Dodge Spirit]], the [[Chrysler LeBaron#1990–1994 sedan|Chrysler LeBaron sedan]], and the export-market [[Chrysler Saratoga]]. It was replaced by the [[Plymouth Breeze]] in 1996.

==Platform==
The Acclaim was a version of the [[Chrysler|Chrysler Corporation]]'s [[Chrysler A platform|AA-body]] 4-door sedan, which was an evolutionary development of Chrysler's extended [[Chrysler K platform|K-car platform]]. The Acclaim production ended on December 9, 1994 and the Cab-forward Plymouth Breeze was introduced as a replacement. The Acclaim was one of the last K-car derivatives produced by Chrysler.

==Market positioning==
The AA-body cars were [[Badge engineering|badge-engineered]] triplets, as were most Chrysler products of this time. The Acclaim differed from its siblings primarily in wheel choices, bodyside molding, and fascias where it sported its unique taillights and the corporate Plymouth eggcrate-grille. Like the K-body and E-body vehicles they replaced, the Acclaim and Dodge Spirit were both marketed as mainstream variants, while the Chrysler LeBaron was marketed as the luxury variant. Despite this, there was substantial overlap in trims and equipment among each car. For example, a fully loaded Acclaim was almost similar to a base LeBaron in features and price.&lt;ref name="msn.com"&gt;[http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/pricing.aspx?year=1991&amp;make=Plymouth&amp;model=Acclaim "Plymouth Acclaim Prices"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315222312/http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/pricing.aspx?year=1991&amp;make=Plymouth&amp;model=Acclaim |date=2012-03-15}}, retrieved 2011–01–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its entry-level base model, the Acclaim was initially available in mid-range '''LE''' and high-end '''LX''' trim. LE and LX models came equipped with features such including premium cloth seating, power windows/door locks, premium sound systems, bodyside cladding, additional exterior brightwork, and on the latter 15-inch lace-spoke aluminum wheels.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Chrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure "1990 Plymouth Acclaim"&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, the base model accounted for nearly 85 percent of Acclaim sales.&lt;ref name="auto.howstuffworks.com"&gt;[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/plymouth-cars16.htm "How Plymouth Works: 1990, 1991, 1992 Plymouths" by the Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide''], retrieved 2011–01–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Spirit, the Acclaim did not receive any sport-oriented models.&lt;ref name="allpar.com"&gt;[http://www.allpar.com/model/acclaim.html "Plymouth Acclaim, Dodge Spirit, Chrysler LeBaron and Saratoga" Information courtesy of Chrysler, allpar], retrieved 2011–01–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Acclaim has also been characterized as the replacement for the smaller [[Plymouth Reliant|Reliant]],&lt;ref&gt;Fifty Years of American Automobiles, the editors of Consumer Guide, Beekman House 1989, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Changes through the years==
[[File:Plymouth-Acclaim.jpg|thumb|right|1989-1990 Plymouth Acclaim]]
[[File:1989-92 Plymouth Acclaim LX.jpg|thumb|right|1989-1992 Plymouth Acclaim LX]]
[[File:Plymouth Acclaim -- 04-07-2010.jpg|thumb|right|1993-1995 Plymouth Acclaim]]

For 1992, the Acclaim's three trim levels were consolidated into one base model.&lt;ref name="auto.howstuffworks.com"/&gt; At extra cost, it could be equipped with packages and stand-alone options previously included in LE and LX models. 

The Acclaim was mildly facelifted for 1993, with a new radiator grille and other minor trim detail changes including a new chrome Pentastar hood ornament. Starting in 1993, the Acclaim was offered with a "Gold Package". This included gold pinstripes, gold bodyside trim, and gold-accented alloy wheels accented with gold paint. There was also a dealer installed "Shelby package" that added an upgraded intake, exhaust manifolds, and fuel pump.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Overall performance of the Shelby Acclaim was comparable to that of the 1993 Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro. There were only 15 Shelby Acclaims said to be produced, and only 11 are still licensed in the United States. Attempting to identify a Shelby Acclaim can be difficult as there is little physical difference in the Shelby and the Gold Package unless seen under the hood. 

A [[Seat_belt#Automatic_seat_belts|motorized shoulder belt]] was added to the front passenger seating position of [[United States Domestic Market|US-market]] Acclaims in 1994, to comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208's requirement for passive restraints. These motorized belts did not comply with [[Canada]]'s safety standards. As a result, Canadian-market Acclaims continued to use a manual passenger seatbelt, and 1994-1995 Acclaims could not be legally imported in either direction.&lt;ref name="riv.ca"&gt;[http://www.riv.ca/english/html/how_to_import.html "Registrar of Imported Vehicles"].&lt;/ref&gt; For 1995, its final year, the 2.5-liter engine got a slightly revised cylinder head and the 4-speed A604 automatic transmission and anti-lock brakes were both dropped. Otherwise, the Acclaim remained mostly unchanged during its 6-year run.

==Engines==
[[File:WhitePlymouthAcclaim.jpg|right|thumb|Plymouth Acclaim LE rear view]]
The Acclaim was available with several different engines. A {{convert|2.5|L|cuin|0|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler 2.2 &amp; 2.5 engine|Chrysler inline-4]] engine producing {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with [[Fuel_injection#Throttle_body_injection|throttle-body fuel injection]] was standard equipment. A {{convert|3.0|L|cuin|0|abbr=on}} [[Mitsubishi 6G7x engine|Mitsubishi V6]] producing {{convert|141|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with [[MPFI|multi-point fuel injection]] was standard on Acclaim LX, optional on the others. Also available on base and LE models from 1989 through 1992 was a [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] version of the 2.5-liter four-cylinder producing {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. In 1993, 1994 and 1995, a [[flexible fuel vehicle|flexible-fuel]] Acclaim was offered, powered by a {{convert|107|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} multipoint fuel injected version of the 2.5-liter engine specially modified to run on fuel containing up to 85% [[ethanol]].

==Transmissions==
Several five-speed [[manual transmission]]s were available, depending on which engine was installed, but relatively few Acclaims were equipped with manual transmissions. The three-speed [[TorqueFlite#A413|Torqueflite]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] was the most popular installation on Acclaims with TBI and MPFI 4-cylinder engines, and was also widely installed in conjunction with the V6 in 1993 through 1995. From 1989 to 1992, most [[V6]] Acclaims came with the four-speed [[Ultradrive|A604]] electronically controlled [[Automatic transmission|automatic]].

==Discontinuation and replacement==
Production ended on December 9, 1994, along with the [[Dodge Spirit]] and the [[Chrysler LeBaron]] after a short run of 1995 models was produced.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Chrysler did not initially replace the Acclaim, but in 1996 released the [[Plymouth Breeze]] version of the [[Chrysler JA platform|JA platform]].&lt;ref name="allpar.com2"&gt;[http://www.allpar.com/model/cirrus.html "1995-2000 Dodge Stratus, Plymouth Breeze, and Chrysler Cirrus" Information courtesy of Chrysler, allpar], retrieved 2011–01–18.&lt;/ref&gt;
