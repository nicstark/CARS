The '''Dodge Mirada''' is a [[mid-size]]d, [[rear-wheel drive]] [[coupe]] manufactured and marketed by [[Dodge]] for the model years 1980 to 1983, sharing the [[Chrysler J platform]] along with its [[badge engineering|badge engineered]] variants, the second generation [[Chrysler Cordoba]] and the [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]]. Production of the Mirada reached just under 53,000 units, staying relatively unchanged during its four-year run, with the exception of paint colors and engines. The Mirada was marketed as a sporty [[personal luxury car]] with limited advertising and marketing during a period when Chrysler was in deep financial difficulty.
__TOC__

==Design==
To help Chrysler meet the ever stricter [[Corporate average fuel economy|Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)]] standards, the Mirada/Cordoba were downsized considerably from their predecessors, with the new models sitting on a modified version of the [[Dodge Aspen|Dodge Aspen/Plymouth Volaré]]'s platform.&lt;ref name=HemMem&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://www.hemmings.com/blog/article/memorable-mirada-1980-dodge-mirada/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20191127201158/http://www.hemmings.com/blog/article/memorable-mirada-1980-dodge-mirada/ | archivedate = 2019-11-27 | title = Memorable Mirada – 1980 Dodge Mirada | journal = Hemmings Classic Car | publisher = American City Business Journals | last = LaChance | first = David | date = June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mirada was designed after the [[Chrysler Cordoba|Cordoba]]'s design was locked in, with various changes made to distinguish it and make it more sporting. Chief designer Ernie Barry had to include the [[Landau (automobile)|landau roof]] even though the design team would have preferred not to, as such "classic" features were favored by Chrysler Chairman [[Lee Iacocca]]. The front end was from flexible plastic, with a grille design inspired by the "coffin-nosed" [[Cord 810/812]].&lt;ref name=HemMem/&gt;

==Trims and options==
[[File:1980 Dodge Mirada, Eggshell White, rear right (Hershey 2019).jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of 1980 Mirada]]
[[File:1983 Dodge Mirada Convertible.jpg|thumb|left|1983 Dodge Mirada with the "cabriolet" roof]]
The base models all received a basic metal roof with a chrome beauty strip extending from the bottom of the opera windows and across the roof.  Those who chose to have their Mirada look a bit sportier could opt for either a power sunroof, or a glass T-top roof; and those who wanted a more luxurious look could choose either chose a vinyl landau roof or a cabriolet roof, which was basically a mock convertible top. The T-tops and landau were offered every year except for 1983, and the cabriolet top was offered every year. A power sunroof was offered for 1980 and 1981.

Base models came with 15” steel wheels with turbine-like hubcaps, or polished ten-spoke, 15” aluminum wheels with painted sections and bright chrome center caps.

'''The Mirada was offered in the following trims:'''

*Base
*S (also referred to as "SE")
*CMX

===Interior===
The base model dashboard was black with a faux woodgrain finish, which surrounded the gauges and center console, while the CMX came with a brushed aluminum finish replacing the woodgrain.  The seat options were vinyl bucket seats, leather bucket seats, or a 60/40 split cloth bench seat.  Since the Mirada could be chosen with either a column shift or floor shift, the bench seat was only offered with the column shifter.  Buyers had the choice of either an AM/FM stereo or an AM/FM/cassette stereo, an AM/FM/8-track stereo, and a Chrysler CB radio could be chosen as well.  The steering wheels offered were either an interior-matched two-spoke wheel with horn buttons in the spokes. The standard steering wheel for the CMX in 1980 and 1981 was the Mopar “Tuff Wheel”, which was similar to the sport wheel found on the vintage Mopar muscle cars such as the early 1970s [[Dodge Challenger]].  Manual windows were standard on the base model, but the power windows from the CMX could be ordered on the base models as well. An optional cabriolet mock-convertible roof, featured a blocked-out quarter window.

==Powertrain==
The 3.7 L inline [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine|slant-6]] engine was available in the base Mirada, with the 5.2 L V8 offered as optional, and the code E58 360 5.9 L [[V8 engine|V8]] available in the Mirada CMX, though only in 1980. For un-explained reasons the 360 was not available in any Chrysler automobiles from 1981 and on. All of these engines were mated to the A904 automatic transmission except the 360 (5.9L), which received the stronger A727. With the 185-horsepower 360, it was one of the fastest American cars available in 1980, on par with the [[Chevrolet Corvette]].{{cn|date=November 2019}}

==Suspension==
The suspension of the Mirada utilized transverse [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] in the front and [[leaf spring]]s with a [[sway bar]] in the rear.  A "sport handling package" was offered, which included heavy-duty [[shock absorber]]s, torsion bar bushings, springs, as well as anti-sway bars in both the front and rear. The braking system used power assisted [[disc brake]]s in the front and [[drum brake]]s in the rear.

==NASCAR==
[[File:BuddyArrington67racecar1983.jpg|thumb|left|[[Buddy Arrington]] driving his No. 67 Dodge Mirada at the 1983 Van Scoy 500]]
It was hoped that the Mirada would reopen the door to Dodge success in NASCAR racing, as the nameplate had not won a race since November 1977. [[Lee Iacocca]] personally called [[Richard Petty]], a longtime Dodge driver, in late October 1980 and asked him to build and test a race spec Mirada, saying [[Chrysler]] would supply Petty Enterprises the necessary body sheetmetal and engine parts Petty would need to build and campaign the car. Petty, who had left Dodge for General Motors in 1978, agreed, and had his team immediately set about and built a Mirada-based race-car. A few other teams including [[Junior Johnson &amp; Associates|Junior Johnson's]] team built race-spec Miradas to test. Johnson's team would have been a major coup for Dodge, as they had been running GM cars since the team's inception and the team had just signed [[Darrell Waltrip]] away from [[DiGard Motorsports]] to drive for them (Waltrip having won 22 races in GM cars prior to this).

After their car was built, the Petty team thought the Mirada looked like a great race car, and some initial testing pleased the longtime Dodge driver. A January 17, 1981, test session at [[Daytona Speedway]] where around 15,000 Petty fans showed up to watch. However the Mirada was {{Convert|8|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}} slower than the GM and Ford cars of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B2_j_qJ4dqcC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=Dodge+Mirada+NASCAR#v=onepage&amp;q=Dodge%20Mirada%20NASCAR&amp;f=false |title=The Earnhardts: A Biography - Google Books |publisher=|date= |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This testing of the car, as well as the Junior Johnson team's testing, revealed that while it looked fairly aerodynamic, the bodystyle actually had a very high coefficient of drag that made it incapable of speeds over 185&amp;nbsp;mph. The Petty team removed the Mirada sheet metal (passing it to [[Buddy Arrington]]) and, like the Johnson team, elected to build [[GM G platform]] bodied racecars (as shared by the [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]], [[Pontiac Grand Prix]], [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]] and [[Buick Regal]]), and this put an end to Chrysler's attempt to re-establish itself in NASCAR. 

However, two small and independent racing teams, Arrington Racing (which was using secondhand rebadged Petty Dodges) and Negre Racing, decided to make a go of the car and campaigned it during the 1981 to 1984 racing seasons.  Arrington managed 17 top-ten finishes during those years, though all were on short (1 mile or less) length tracks. A few other drivers (Dave Marcis in four races, and Dick May in three) ran Miradas occasionally in 1981, but the cars were either plagued with mechanical issues, or finished several laps off the leaders. Up until the end of 1984, Miradas raced from time to time, but without much success, and ultimately lead to Dodge disappearing from NASCAR until 2001.

The '''Dodge Matador''' is a full-sized automobile that was produced for the 1960 model year (27,908 units) by [[Dodge]]. The Matadors were base model equivalents to the top [[Car model#Trim levels|trim]]med  [[Dodge Polara]] that also used the {{convert|122|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase [[Car platform|platform]] of the [[Chrysler Windsor]] and [[Chrysler Newport]] models.

==Design==
The Matador, was one of two new models produced by Dodge in 1960 when the marque dropped its long-running [[Dodge Coronet|Coronet]], Custom, Custom Royal, and Lancer models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/history/dodge/1960.html |title=1960 Dodge cars: Dart, Polara, and Matador |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing the same newly engineered unibody platform as the slightly smaller Dodge Dart, the Matador was designated Dodge's full-size base trim vehicle, with the [[Dodge Polara]] becoming the make's full-sized premium model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1960-1961 Dodge Polara/Matador - page 1|date=28 November 2007 |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1960-1961-dodge-polara-matador.htm |accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960 Matador and Polara were built on {{convert|4|in|mm|0|adj=on}} longer wheelbase along with the 1960 DeSoto and Chrysler models. All Matadors featured a standard "Super Red Ram" {{convert|295|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|361|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1960-1961 Dodge Polara/Matador - page 2|date=28 November 2007 |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1960-1961-dodge-polara-matador.htm |accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "D-500 with Ram Induction" {{convert|383|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} with dual four-barrel carburetors was optional, along with a three-speed [[TorqueFlite]] automatic transmission.&lt;ref name="brochure13"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/dodge/60dwag/bilder/13.jpg |title=Dodge Dart and 1960 Dodge Station Wagon Specifications |page=13 |publisher=lov2xlr8.no |accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  LIke all contemporary Chrysler automobiles, the automatic transmission was controlled by mechanical pushbuttons on the left side of the instrument panel.

The Matador (and the similar, better-trimmed Polara) featured styling cues that were carried over from 1959 models, themselves an evolution of [[Virgil Exner]]'s "[[Forward Look]]" cars introduced in 1957. Now built on a new unibody chassis, the 1960 Matador continued the Dodge styling hallmarks of stacked "jet pod" taillights, however, the size of the lights was greatly exaggerated, with the lower light set into the rear bumper.  The design also incorporated Dodge’s trademark (shortened) tailfins, which included small vertical taillight lenses placed on the vertical surface at the back of the fin; again. The purpose of the shortened fin was meant to exaggerate the length of the “jet pods” holding the taillights. The front end featured a small grille comprising six stacks of aluminum rectangles nested in a massive (and complex) front bumper assembly.

All 1960 Dodge station wagons used the {{convert|122|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase providing {{convert|98.5|cuft|2}} of cargo space with the back seats folded flat.&lt;ref name="brochure13"/&gt; The Matador trim was available in six- or nine-passenger (with rear-facing third row bench seat) versions featuring a roll-down rear window into the tailgate.&lt;ref name="brochure13"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/dodge/60dwag/bilder/8.jpg |title=Dodge Dart and 1960 Dodge Station Wagon Specifications |page=8 |publisher=lov2xlr8.no |accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Matador had less exterior chrome trim and plainer interiors than found on the Polara. The majority of cars built by Dodge and sold during the 1960 model year were in Dodge's new "smaller" and less expensive full-sized model, the [[Dodge Dart]], which fielded three sub-series (Seneca, Pioneer and Phoenix) of its own.

A total of 27,908 Dodge Matadors were produced for 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1960-1961 Dodge Polara/Matador - Specifications |date=28 November 2007 |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1960-1961-dodge-polara-matador.htm |accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low sales volume — and the popularity of the Dart model — led Dodge to drop the Matador nameplate for the 1961 model year.

==Legacy==
The name was subsequently used by [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]] from 1971 to 1978 for the mid- and full-sized [[AMC Matador]] cars. The automaker was purchased in 1987 by [[Chrysler Corporation]].

The '''Dodge Diplomat''' is an [[United States|American]] [[mid-size car]] that was produced by [[Dodge]] from 1977 to 1989. It was built using the same design as the [[Plymouth Gran Fury#1982–1989|Plymouth Gran Fury]] in the U.S. market and the [[Plymouth Caravelle#Canada|Plymouth Caravelle]] in Canada. It was also sold in Mexico between 1981 and 1982 as the [[Dodge Dart#Foreign markets|Dodge Dart]], and in [[Colombia]] as the [[Dodge Coronet#Eighth generation (1980s)|Dodge Coronet]]. The Diplomat was initially offered in a [[coupe]] and a [[sedan (car)|sedan]]. In 1978, [[station wagon]]s were added as replacements for the discontinued [[full-size car|full-sized]] [[Chrysler C platform|C-body]] [[station wagon|wagon]]s.

The Diplomat was offered with a {{convert|225|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[straight-6]] engine a well as optional {{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8s. The Diplomat, along with its Plymouth Gran Fury/Caravelle twin, were popular [[police car]]s both in the US and Canada. The three-speed [[Torqueflite]] automatic transmission was most popular, but a [[Manual transmission|manual]] transmission was available until 1981 only on six cylinder and 318 V8 models.

==Background==
The Diplomat name was originally used by Dodge on 2-door [[hardtop]] models from 1950 to 1954. It was also used on the export version of the [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] from 1946 through 1961. In 1975–77, the Diplomat name was also used on a trim package available on the Royal Monaco two-door hardtop. Starting with the 1977 model year, the Diplomat became a full model line, rather than as the name of a particular body style. 

==First generation (1977)==
[[File:1979 Dodge Diplomat, brown, rear right.jpg|thumb|left|1979 Dodge Diplomat sedan]]

Introduced as a late 1977 model during spring 1977, the first generation Diplomats were a longer, fancier upmarket version of the [[Chrysler F platform|F-body]] [[Dodge Aspen|Aspen]]. The chassis and mechanical components are similar with doors and various other body panels interchangeable with the Aspens. Unique to the Diplomat were the front and rear header panels, [[bumper (car)|bumper]]s, [[hood (car)|hood]] and [[trunk (car)|trunk lid]]. Larger [[taillight]]s extended into the rear hatch of the [[station wagon]]. The station wagons were shorter than the sedans and coupes, which had unique bodywork with a longer rear overhang. The station wagon, introduced for the 1978 model year, used the same rear sheetmetal as the [[Dodge Aspen|Aspen/Volaré]], albeit with its own wraparound taillights.

[[File:1979 Dodge Diplomat Salon Station Wagon, front right (Hershey 2019).jpg|thumb|left|1979 Dodge Diplomat Salon Station Wagon]]
The first year models were available in base and Medallion trim levels; the base engine was the 318 Lean Burn V8 developing {{convert|145|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and the {{convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} Slant Six was a credit option.&lt;ref name="chrysler"&gt;{{cite book | ref = SCchr |title=Standard Catalog of Chrysler, 1924-1990 |first=John |last=Lee |publisher=Krause Publications |pages=309-310 |date=1990 |isbn=0-87341-142-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[vinyl roof]] was standard on sedans, while a simulated [[Landau (automobile)|landau roof]] cover was an option on coupes. For 1978 the Slant Six with a four-speed manual transmission became the base drivetrain, and the station wagon was added. The wagon featured "teakwood"-grain body appliques (a delete option) and was only available in base trim. The sedans and coupes continued largely unchanged, but a low-cost "Diplomat S" was added. This model was offered for one year, and the 3,322 produced represented only about 5% of overall Diplomat production in 1978.&lt;ref name=Chrys78&gt;[[#SCchr|Lee]], pp. 312-313&lt;/ref&gt; The V8's output dropped by five horsepower, but on the other hand, a {{convert|155|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 became a new option.&lt;ref name=Chrys78/&gt;

For the 1979 model year, the Diplomat received a minor facelift. The grille was now divided into three rows of eight rectangular openings with an internal crosshatch pattern and a broad band on top. The sedan and coupe taillights were also altered, now with a horizontal theme while divided down the middle. The lineup was rearranged, with the base model decontented and a Salon model (corresponding to last year's base version) fitting in the middle below the Medallion.&lt;ref name=Chrys79&gt;[[#SCchr|Lee]], pp. 315-316&lt;/ref&gt; The new base model did not receive the padded vinyl roof (sedans). Coupes had a new landau top design, with much smaller rear side windows. The station wagon came in Salon trim, without any actual changes in equipment. The Slant Six, meanwhile, was available with a single-barrel carburetor and {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. V8 outputs dropped by five horsepower, to {{convert|135|and|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} respectively, but optional was a four-barrel 360 producing {{convert|195|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Chrys79/&gt; This was the last year for the 360 engine in the Diplomat.

{{clear-left}}

==Second generation (1980)==
The 1980 model year brought new exterior sheet metal for the Diplomat, although wagons were unchanged, from the doors back. While the previous coupes used the same 112.7 inch wheelbase as the other models, the 1980 coupe used the 108 inch wheelbase of the Aspen coupe (though the square body was very different).  The front end was more evolutionary than revolutionary, but in order to share a hood with the newly restyled [[Chrysler LeBaron#First generation (1977–1981)|Chrysler LeBaron]] the grille was narrowed considerably, with an arguably unfortunate effect on appearance and sales.  The roofline of the sedan was also made more square, marginally improving headroom, and conservative, Buick-like taillights appeared on all but the wagons.  Manual transmissions were dropped. Following the demise of the [[Dodge St. Regis]] R-body in 1981, the Diplomat remained, becoming the largest sedan in the Dodge lineup, despite technically being a mid-size car. Dodge would not market another truly full-size car (at least based upon [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) passenger volume statistics) until the [[Dodge Monaco#Fifth generation (1989-92)|Monaco]] debuted as a 1990 model.

By 1981, Chrysler was switching to smaller [[front-wheel drive]] designs. However, its older and larger rear-wheel drive Dodge Diplomat (as well as the Chrysler LeBaron and Fifth Avenue) continued to sell. Chrysler's then executive vice president for manufacturing, Steve Sharf, met with officials at [[American Motors]] (AMC) to use the extra capacity at an assembly plant in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] to build the cars.&lt;ref name="AMCbuilt"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://wardsauto.com/news-analysis/oldest-auto-plant-make-newest-v-6 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160406143253/http://wardsauto.com/news-analysis/oldest-auto-plant-make-newest-v-6 | title = Oldest Auto Plant to Make Newest V-6 | first = David C. | last = Smith | journal = Ward's AutoWorld | date = 1 June 2008 | archivedate = 6 April 2016 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysler's tooling was moved from [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] to Kenosha, and from 1987 until 1989 about 250,000 Chrysler and Dodge models were built by AMC at a lower cost than Chrysler could.&lt;ref name="AMCbuilt"/&gt; This relationship evolved into Chrysler's purchase of AMC in 1987.&lt;ref name="AMCbuilt"/&gt;

[[File:1981 Dodge Diplomat coupe, front right.jpg|thumb|left|1981 Dodge Diplomat coupe]]
In 1982, the [[coupe]] and [[station wagon]] were discontinued and Canada's [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] version of the Diplomat came south of the border. The Plymouth Caravelle was offered in the United States as the [[Plymouth Gran Fury#1982–1989|Plymouth Gran Fury]]. 1983 was the last year for the Slant Six, and afterwards, the only available engine was the 318-cid V8 with a two-barrel carburetor. A four-barrel 318 remained the optional engine choice for the police package. For 1984, the appearance of the upscale Special Edition or SE used the Fifth Avenue's front end with its parking lights located above the headlights, and a bright metal cross overlaid on the Chrysler grille's thin vertical bars.  The SE had more exterior trim and an interior that placed the SE between the Diplomat Salon and the Chrysler Fifth Avenue.

As the 1980s progressed, fewer private customers purchased the Diplomat, and the M-body was eventually dropped during the 1989 model year. Sales of cars equipped with the Police Package represented about half of the Diplomat production after the discontinuation of the coupe and station wagons.&lt;ref name=Chrysvar&gt;[[#SCchr|Lee]], pp. 323-336, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Late in the Diplomat's run, the car was subject to the federal "[[Gas Guzzler Tax]]" and required premium unleaded gasoline. Although sales were strong, Chrysler CEO [[Lee Iacocca]] held a low opinion of the M-body line as a relic of the pre-K car era and declined to invest any money in them. Despite lower gas prices in the mid- to late-1980s and a 2.26:1 rear-end gear ratio, the Diplomat's carbureted engine and lack of an overdrive gear on its [[TorqueFlite]] automatic transmission resulted in poor fuel economy compared with its larger competitors from Ford and General Motors, as evidenced by comparing the EPA estimates for 1986 models:

* Dodge Diplomat (5.2&amp;nbsp;L V8, 3-speed automatic): 16 city, 21 highway, 18 combined
* Chevrolet Caprice (5.0&amp;nbsp;L V8, 4-speed automatic with overdrive): 17 city, 25 highway, 20 combined
* Ford LTD Crown Victoria (5.0&amp;nbsp;L V8, 4-speed automatic with overdrive): 18 city, 26 highway, 21 combined

| valign="top" |[[File:1980 Dodge Diplomat station wagon, fR.jpg|250px]]&lt;br /&gt;1980 Station wagon
|}

However, Diplomats built from mid-1988 until the end of production were among the first Chrysler-built products to have a driver's side [[airbag]] as standard equipment, some two model years before the remainder of Chrysler's lineup and they were also among the only cars at the time to offer a tilt steering column with an airbag. Diplomats with airbags differed from earlier models in that they were also equipped with a padded, color-keyed knee blocker which extended out from beneath the instrument panel in front of the driver.

==Discontinuation==
When the Diplomat and similar Plymouth Gran Fury were discontinued, it marked the last [[rear-wheel drive]] non-truck model (aside from the [[Dodge Viper]]) sold by the corporation until the [[Plymouth Prowler]] was introduced in 1997.  The Diplomat's other rear-wheel drive sibling, the Chrysler Fifth Avenue, also ended production, but the nameplate was continued on a front-wheel drive chassis. In the Dodge lineup, the [[Dodge Monaco#Fifth generation (1989-92)|Monaco]] became the top-of-the-line sedan until the introduction of the LH platform.

The '''Dodge Rampage''' was a [[subcompact]], [[unibody]]&lt;ref name="rampage"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.allpar.com/omni/omni.html|title=The Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon|publisher= allpar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[coupe utility]] based on [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]]'s [[Chrysler L platform|L platform]] and manufactured from 1982 to 1984. First released as a 1982 model, the Rampage was later joined for 1983 by its [[badge engineering|rebadged]] variant, the [[Plymouth Scamp]].

The Rampage borrowed the car's unibody construction and the front fascia from the sporty '''[[Dodge Omni 024|024]]/[[Dodge Charger (L-body)|Charger]]''' variant, and used the suspension from the Omni/Horizon with coil struts and a linkless sway bar at the front, and leaf springs with shock absorbers at the rear.&lt;ref name="allparrampage"&gt;{{cite web|title=Plymouth Scamp and Dodge Rampage: economy car based pickups|url=https://www.allpar.com/omni/rampage/scamp-rampage.html|website=Allpar|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was available with a Chrysler built and designed 2.2&amp;nbsp;L [[carburetor|carbureted]] [[inline-four engine]] with {{convert|96|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and a curb weight of around {{convert|2400|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. In the first year, it had leisurely performance due to the four-speed [[manual transmission]] along with a three-speed automatic transmission.
[[File:1984 Dodge Rampage.jpg|thumb|left|1984 Dodge Rampage]]

Performance was improved with the introduction of a five-speed [[manual transmission]] in 1983. The truck had a load capacity of {{convert|1145|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, for a true "half ton" rating. This compared favorably to [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]]' [[Chevrolet El Camino]]'s rating of 1250 lbs. In addition to the El Camino, the [[Volkswagen Caddy|Volkswagen Rabbit Sportruck]] and [[Subaru BRAT]] were the Rampage's main competition.

A rebadged version, the Plymouth Scamp, was only marketed for 1983. The Rampage lasted three years before being dropped from production after the 1984 model year. There was a "Shelby Rampage" built by Chrysler/Shelby engineers in their free time for Carroll Shelby, but there is no official record of the existence of such a vehicle. However, a special "California Shelby Rampage" was built in 1984 and only sold at certain [[California]]-area Dodge dealerships, which featured the front fascia from the Shelby Charger, 15-inch alloy wheels, and a ground effects package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 1984 Dodge California Shelby Rampage|url=https://www.allpar.com/omni/rampage/index.html|website=Allpar|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dodge Rampage (17,636 sold in 1982, 8,033 in 1983, and 11,732 in 1984&lt;ref name="allparrampage" /&gt;) didn't take off in the market as had been expected. Sales totals for the Plymouth Scamp were 2,184 base models and 1,380 Scamp GT models.&lt;ref name="allparrampage" /&gt;

==2006 concept==
{{Main|Dodge Rampage Concept}}

Dodge resurrected the Rampage name at the 2006 [[Chicago Auto Show]] with a front-wheel drive [[concept car|concept]] pickup. As opposed to the original Rampage, this concept vehicle was as large as the full-size [[Dodge Ram]]. It was powered by the 5.7&amp;nbsp;L [[Chrysler Hemi engine|Hemi]] [[V8 engine|V8]] and featured "Stow 'n Go" seating taken from the [[Chrysler minivans]].

The original Dodge Super Bee was based on the [[Dodge Coronet]] two-door [[coupe]], and was produced from 1968 until 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1969 Dodge Coronet - Classic Car Price Guide History of the 1968 - 1970 Dodge Coronet |url= http://www.hagerty.com/price-guide/1969-Dodge-Coronet |work=Hagerty Insurance |accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Dodge's low-priced powerful muscle car and a [[Rebadging|rebadged]] version of the [[Plymouth Road Runner]]. The origin of the name, "Super Bee", has its basis in the [[Chrysler B platform|"B" Body]] designation pertinent to Chrysler's mid-sized cars, including the Road Runner and Charger.&lt;ref name="Brook"&gt;{{cite web|title=266 - 1969 Dodge Super Bee |url= http://www.historics.co.uk/buying/auctions/2012-11-24/car/1969-dodge-super-bee.aspx |work=Historics at Brooklands |date=24 November 2012 |accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plymouth's Road Runner sales were enough to have Dodge Division General Manager, Robert McCurry, request a similar model from the Dodge Styling office. Senior designer, Harvey J. Winn, won a "contest" with the name "Super Bee" and a new logo design based on the Dodge "Scat Pack" Bee medallion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barn Find: 1970 Dodge Super Bee Is Getting Ready To Sting Again|url= http://www.streetlegaltv.com/news/barn-find-1970-dodge-super-bee-is-getting-ready-to-sting-again/ |work=Street Legal TV |first=Michael |last=Harding |date=13 September 2012 |accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the first Super Bee was influenced by the 1968 Coronet convertible and the show car's interior was built by the Alexander Brothers. The show car was introduced at the 1968 [[North American International Auto Show|Detroit Auto Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dodge Coronet and Dodge Super Bee|url= http://www.allpar.com/cars/dodge/coronet.html |publisher=Allpar |first=David |last=Zatz |accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the two cars are similar in external appearance, the Super Bee was slightly heavier (approx. {{convert|65|lb|kg|abbr=on}}) and rode on a {{convert|117|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase compared to the Road Runner's {{convert|116|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Specifications: 1969 Dodge Coronet Super Bee |url= http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/specifications/dodge/1969_dodge_coronet_super_bee.htm|work=Unique Cars and Parts |accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1968 Plymouth Road Runner |url= http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_plymouth_road_runner_1968.htm |work=Unique Cars and Parts|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to minor external differences, such as larger rear wheel openings, the bumblebee tailstripe and fancier grille, and the taillight ornamentation, the Super Bee also used actual diecast chrome-plated "Bee" medallions. These three-dimensional medallions were prominently mounted in a raised position in the grille/hood area and the trunklid/taillight area of the car throughout the first three years of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dodge Coronet Super Bee 1969|url= http://www.dieselstation.com/cars/dodge-coronet-super-bee-1969-a4448.html|work=DieselStation |accessdate=16 December 2012|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Super Bee used dash cluster from the Dodge Charger, while the 4-speed [[manual transmission]] cars received a [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] Competition-Plus shifter with Hurst linkage;&lt;ref name="Brook" /&gt; this shifter compared to the Road Runner's less expensive Inland shifter and linkage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Plymouth Road Runner and Dodge Super Bee|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/roadrunner.html |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=16 December 2012|author=David Zatz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the higher-quality accessories attached to the  Super Bee, the car was sold at a higher price in comparison to the Plymouth version and this had a negative effect on sales.&lt;ref name="Brook" /&gt;

The Super Bee was available with the Hemi engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Freiburger's 1970 Dodge Super Bee Unearthed - Rumble Bee Revival |first=David |last=Freiburger |date=1 July 2010 |url= http://www.hotrod.com/featuredvehicles/hrdp_1007_david_freiburgers_1970_dodge_super_bee_unearthed/photo_15.html |publisher=Hot Rod |accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This option raised the price by 33%, and only 125 were sold. The 1968 model was only sold as a two-door coupe, with two engine options, the base {{convert|335|hp|abbr=on}} 383 Magnum, and the 426 Hemi, rated at {{convert|425|hp|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Brook" /&gt;

The Super Bee included a heavy-duty suspension, an optional [[Mopar]] [[List of Chrysler transmissions#Manual|A833 4-speed manual transmission]], and high-performance tires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MOPAR A833 4-speed transmission |url=http://www.brewersperformance.com/products.asp?id=238|work=Brewer's Performance |accessdate=16 December 2012|year=2004–2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside, a [[Racing stripe|stripe]] (with the bee logo) was wrapped around the tail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1969-70 Dodge Coronet Super Bee Bumble Bee Stripe with Bee Logo.

A [[hardtop]] version joined the existing pillared coupe body in 1969 and a new optional twin-scooped air induction hood, the "Ramcharger", became available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1969 Dodge Super Bee|url=http://andy440.com/69Bee.htm|work=Super Bee|publisher=Andy440|accessdate=16 December 2012|author=Andy440|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This particular option was coded N-96 and was the counterpart to the Plymouth Road Runner's "Coyote Duster" air induction hood. The "Ramcharger" hood featured forward-facing scoops.

A "six-pack" (three two-barrel [[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] [[carburetor]]s) version of Dodge's [[Chrysler B engine#440|{{cvt|440|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine]] was added to the offering list mid-year rated at {{cvt|390|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} @ 4700 rpm and {{cvt|490|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 3600 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1969/1985555/dodge_coronet_super_bee_2-door_hardtop_440_v-8_magnum_six-pack_4-speed.html|website=automobile-catalog.com|title=1969 Dodge Coronet Super Bee 2-door Hardtop 440 V-8 Magnum Six-Pack 4-speed|accessdate=June 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myclassicgarage.com/knowledge-base/1969-Dodge-Coronet|website=myclassicgarage.com|title=1969 Dodge Coronet|accessdate=June 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The option code for this was A12, which changed the 5th digit of the [[VIN]] to M. These special order 1969 1/2 Dodge Super Bees are known as A12 M-code cars. The A12 package also equipped the cars with a [[Dana 60]] [[axle]] with a 4:10 [[gear-ratio]], heavy duty [[automatic transmission]] or a 4-speed manual, and a 'lift off' flat black [[Hood scoop|scooped hood]]. Other components to the A12 package included heavy duty internal engine parts, black steel [[Rim (wheel)|rims]] with high performance G-70 15" tires, and heavy duty 11" [[drum brake]]s. Only 1,907 A12 M-code 440 Six Pack 1969 1/2 Dodge Super Bees were produced. This option fell half-way between the standard engine and the Hemi as a USD463 option. The 1969 model year included the base 383 Magnum, 440 Six Pack, and the 426 Hemi. The 440 Magnum (4bbl) was reserved for the Coronet R/T.

For the 1970 model, the Super Bee received a redesign and a new front-end that consisted of a twin-looped front bumper that Dodge Public Relations referred to as "bumble bee wings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2007 Dodge Charger SRT-8 Super Bee|url= http://www.topspeed.com/cars/dodge/2007-dodge-charger-srt-8-super-bee-ar11097.html |work=TopSpeed |accessdate=16 December 2012|first=Andrew |last=Avarvarii |date=21 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales fell for the year from 15,506 in 1970 to 5,054 in 1971—because of, or in spite of, this new look, with another sales pressure coming from higher insurance rates for performance cars; the similar Plymouth Road Runner and Plymouth Duster both experienced similar sales issues.&lt;ref name="allpar"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/model/roadrunner.html |title=The legendary Plymouth Road Runner and Dodge Super Bee  |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the new looks, engine choices and "ramcharger" hood carried over from 1969, the 1970 cars from Dodge featured several new or improved options. {{Citation needed span|For example, a "C- stripe" variant of the bumble stripe was offered, in addition to new high-back bucket seats, a steering column-mounted ignition and a "[[pistol grip]]" [[Hurst shifter]] on four-speed models.|date=December 2012}}

In 1970, Chrysler of [[Mexico]] introduced the new Dodge Super Bee as a replacement for the company's previous sports car product, the Plymouth Barracuda. As the production and sale costs of the third-generation Barracuda in Mexico were too high, Dodge adapted the semi-fastback A-Body platform and introduced the Super Bee at the beginning.

The Super Bee was only available with the [[V8 engine|V8]] 318 engine (270&amp;nbsp;hp) and either a four-speed or three-speed [[manual transmission]]. The 1970 model was virtually identical to the Plymouth Duster (known in Mexico as the "Valiant Duster"), with side stripes and the Super Bee [[decal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dodge valiant duster 1975 el coqueto|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujQwoGNNBy4|work=YouTube |accessdate=16 December 2012|author=pabloaselDTB|date=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Dodge differentiated the Super Bee from the Duster, by using the grille from the American Dodge Demon. The model's body was modified on one further occasion, in 1972, and, by 1973, the front of the Dodge Dart became the standard design for the entire A Body line-up; the Duster, Super Bee, Valiant, and Dart all consisted of the same front grille, with the rear tail lights constituting the only difference between the Super Bee and the Valiant. However, in 1976, the final year for the A Body cars, the front grille of the Plymouth model became the standard design.

The Valiant Super Bee was equipped with the 318 V8 engine, with 270&amp;nbsp;hp, from 1970 to 1974; from 1975 to 1976, it contained the 360 V8 engine, with 300&amp;nbsp;hp—these engines had more power in Mexico than in the US, as Mexican [[Environmental law|anti-pollution laws]] were less strict in comparison to the US. Over the years, these models only received minor changes, such as new grilles, rear panels, and tail lights. The first generation was produced from 1970 to 1976; during the fall of 1975, Chrysler introduced the new F Body cars: the Dodge Aspen and Plymouth Volare (as 1976 models), while the Aspen R/T and Volare Road Runner were released as the sports versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Plymouth Volare, Dodge Aspen, and Chrysler LeBaron|url= http://www.allpar.com/model/aspen.html |work=Allpar |first=Ed |last=Hennessy |accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrysler de México continued to use old model names after they were dropped in the U.S. marketplace. The Dodge Aspen and Plymouth Volare, were sold in Mexico as the Dodge Dart and the Valiant Volare, and the sports version was named the Valiant Super Bee. The Mexican Dodge Dart consisted of the front of the US Plymouth Volare and the rear of the Dodge Aspen, while the Mexican Valiant Volare and the Dodge Super Bee consisted of the front of the Dodge Aspen and the rear of the US Plymouth Volare.

The Super Bee was equipped with the 360 V8 engine and 300&amp;nbsp;hp, the three-speed Torque Flite [[automatic transmission]] (or the [[Four-velocity|four-speed]] manual transmission), sports wide wheels, front [[spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]], and a rear spoiler-style Trans Am with the Super Bee spelling (with an optional blind in the rear window). The federal [[highway patrol]] used Super Bee as a [[Police car|squad car]]. For the 1980-model year, the Super Bee received a new front with rectangular [[headlamp]]s.

For the 1981-model year, the Dodge Diplomat was introduced in Mexico, under the name of Dodge Dart (replacing the Dodge Aspen), and was considered a [[Luxury vehicle|luxury car]]. A new sports version of the 1981 Dodge Dart replaced the Valiant Super Bee and is now called the Dodge Magnum—the version consisted of the 360 V8 engine and 270&amp;nbsp;hp, with variations in transmissions: The three-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] and the four-speed manual.

A new 2007 Super Bee model was introduced at the 2006 [[North American International Auto Show]]. This model is based on the [[Dodge Charger (LX)#SRT-8|Dodge Charger SRT-8]] and its exterior consists of special "Detonator Yellow" paint, a "Flat Black" hood and fender "[[decal]]s". The production version consisted of a hood decal, rather than an entirely black hood, and the "hockey stick" stripe on the side was changed from solid black to a dashed black stripe positioned at the bottom of the exterior. The wheels are fully polished and do not contain the silver painted areas of the "stock" SRT8 Charger. The interior is completely black, with yellow accent stitching on the seats and shift knob; this is unlike the "two-tone" interior of the standard SRT8 Charger which consists of red stitching (this is the only model that contains such an interior, as the Charger interior changed in 2008). The appearance of the shifter "bezel" and center console resemble that of carbon fibre, and the Super Bee logo appears in the instrument cluster during "power up", instead of the SRT logo.

It is a limited edition car, with only 1000 built for model year 2007, with build dates as early as August 2006. Each car is built in Brampton Assembly Plant, then shipped to Windsor to have decals applied and unique number plaque applied to the passenger side of the dash.  Number sequence on dash, does not necessarily follow build order, as multiple "Bees" were shipped to Windsor by car carrier and order was not retained. It uses the same {{convert|425|bhp|kW PS|abbr=on}} [[HEMI]] 6.1 Liter engine as the SRT8 versions of the Dodge Charger, Dodge Magnum, Dodge Challenger and Chrysler 300C.

===2008===
For the 2008 model year, the Super Bee was only made in "B5 Blue Pearl Coat" (sometimes listed as "Surf Blue Pearl"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dodge.com/en/2008/charger/gallery/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dodge.com/shared/2008/charger/gallery/main/ext_charger_sb_phtgal_11.jpg{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;), reminiscent of the blue used by Chrysler vehicles in the 1960s and 1970s. Instead of fully polished SRT8 Charger wheels, the "pockets" are painted black on the ALCOA rims. Blue accent stitching inside replaces the yellow found on the seats and steering wheel, but the Charger's interior was changed for 2008, so the dash and console are different than the 2007 version interior.This year also Introduced Touch Screen Navigation and In Dash DVD player. Again, it was based on the SRT-8 model and used the 6.1L engine, and had a limited production run of 1000.

===2009===
For the 2009 model year, the Super Bee was only made in "Hemi Orange Pearl Coat",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dodge.com/en/2009/charger/&lt;/ref&gt; and was based on the SRT-8 model.  The Super Bee used the 6.1L engine, and had a limited production run of only 425.  This year also introduced touch screen navigation and in dash DVD player with hardrive. ALCOA rims were standard this year only.

===2012-2014===
In 2011, the Super Bee SRT-8 returned as a 2012 model on the redesigned Dodge Charger with the 392 HEMI engine (6.4L) in "Stinger Yellow" and "Pitch Black" colors, with additional colors being added for 2013 and 2014. This version of the Super Bee returned to the name's roots as a "budget" muscle car, devoid of most luxury items yet maintaining high performance in the form of a less expensive SRT model.&lt;ref name="Allpar-2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=New special editions from SRT and Dodge|url= http://www.allpar.com/news/index.php/2011/11/new-special-editions-from-srt-anddodge |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=13 June 2012|first=Bill |last=Cawthon |date=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dodge 400''' was a [[mid-size car]] built by [[Dodge]].  It was similar to the [[Chrysler LeBaron]] of the same era.  The 400 was introduced for the 1982 model year but renamed and merged into the [[Dodge 600]] lineup just two years later. An improved version of Chrysler's [[Chrysler K platform|K-cars]], it was called the Super K platform.&lt;ref name=GLevy&gt;{{cite magazine | magazine = [[Autoweek]] | last = Levy | first = George D. | ref = AW3142 | page = 10 | date = 1981-10-19 | title = The 'Super' Ks | issn = 0192-9674 | volume = 31 | number = 42 | publisher = Keith E. Crain }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
While heavily dependent on the K-car, the suspension geometry was revised with [[computer-aided design]] (CAD), one of Chrysler's first forays into this area.&lt;ref name=GLevy/&gt; Aside from the suspension modifications, the interior was plusher and the front and rear designs were different. To provide higher comfort than in the regular K-cars, particular care was paid to sound proofing, with a redesigned firewall and additional isolating material throughout.&lt;ref name=GLevy/&gt;

Aside from the stacked-slat grille being different from that of the LeBaron, the 400 was somewhat less ornate overall. Faux louvres on the front fenders were unique to the 400.&lt;ref name=GLevy2&gt;[[#AW3142|Levy]], p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model years==
===1982===
The 400 was intended to be a more upmarket version of the [[Dodge Aries|Aries]] and a corporate twin of the downsized LeBaron. It was originally only available as a two-door [[coupé]].&lt;ref name=GLevy/&gt; In the spring of 1982 two additional bodystyles appeared: a convertible and a four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]. The 400's suspension, while soft, was somewhat firmer than that of its LeBaron sister.

This was Dodge's first convertible since the 1971 [[Dodge Challenger|Challenger]] and the first domestically-manufactured convertible since 1976, when Cadillac had phased out the Eldorado convertible.

The 400 was available in two trim levels: base and LS.&lt;ref name=GLevy/&gt; Engine choices were limited to a 2.2&amp;nbsp;L [[inline-four engine]] or an optional [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]]-sourced [[Mitsubishi Astron engine#4G54|2.6&amp;nbsp;L "Silent Shaft" four-cylinder]]; this was only available coupled to an automatic. The convertible came with the Mitsubishi-sourced engine as standard. Outputs were {{convert|84|and|92|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} respectively.&lt;ref name=GLevy/&gt;

===1983===
There were no major changes made for 1983 other than the LS trim being omitted from the lineup. During 1983, the 400 sedan was replaced by the [[Dodge 600]]. The coupes and convertibles were rebadged as [[Dodge 600]] from 1984.

The '''Dodge Power Wagon''' is a [[four wheel drive]] [[medium duty truck]] that was produced in various model series from 1945 to 1980 by [[Dodge]], then as a nameplate for the [[Dodge Ram]] from 2005 to 2013, and, most recently ‘13-present, as an individual model marketed by [[Ram Trucks]]. It was developed as the '''WDX''' truck, and until about 1960 it was internally known by its engineering code '''T137''' – a name still used for the original series by enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.t137.com/about.htm About T137 — t137.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The original civilian version, commonly called the "flat fender" Power Wagon or FFPW, was mechanically based on Dodge's [[Dodge WC series|3/4-ton WC series]] of [[World War II]] military trucks. The Power Wagon was the first mass-produced 4x4 medium duty truck, and represents  a significant predecessor to the many modern four wheel drive trucks in use today. Updated variants continued in production until 1964.

Following [[Chrysler Corporation]] policy of [[badge engineering]] to provide a greater number of sales outlets overseas, Power Wagons were also marketed around the world under the [[Fargo Trucks|Fargo]] and [[De Soto (automobile)|De Soto]] badges. {{fact|date=February 2016}}

==History==
[[File:GLM Dodge WC-52 from Muzeum Pożarnictwa w Alwerni during "Straż pożarna wczoraj i dziś" exhibition at Galeria Krakowska in Kraków 1.jpg|thumb|280px|The Power Wagon was developed from the WW II [[Dodge WC series]]. Shown WC-52 became a fire truck in 1959 ([[Kraków|Kraków, Poland]]).]]
The civilian Power Wagon continued the lineage of limited production Dodge 4WD trucks from the 1930s, that proved basic four wheel drive design concepts, primarily for the military. Mechanically derived from Dodge's 1942–1945 [[Dodge WC series|3/4-ton WC series]] military trucks, the Power Wagon was introduced in 1946 as the first civilian production 4x4 truck. During its development phase, it was initially named the WDX General Purpose Truck, a name still used on some of the preliminary materials handed out by Dodge, before sales began in March 1946. The 'W' was a continuation of the 1941–1947 model year series, followed by a 'D' instead of a 'C', because the civilian truck was a 1-ton rating instead of the Army's {{frac|3|4}}-ton, and the 'X' was added to indicate four-wheel drive, as opposed to all previous civilian two-wheel driven models.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fourwheeler.com/features/1609-the-1947-dodge-wdx-power-wagon-that-does-everything/ The 1947 Dodge WDX Power Wagon That Does Everything – FourWheeler.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe the truck was renamed "Power Wagon" after a contemporaneous trucking magazine with that title.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ewarbirds.org/vehicles/1941dodgewc3.html 1941 Dodge WC-3 – Estrella WarBirds Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20190605150341/https://forums.aaca.org/topic/210257-my-1934-dodge-4x4-15-ton/ "The Graham Legacy: Graham-Paige To 1932" by M Keller. – Antique Automobile Club of America (archived)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meant to compete with military-based Ford/[[Marmon-Herrington]] and [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] trucks, it had an enclosed all-weather civilian cab and a purpose-designed 8-foot cargo box. It had a 126&amp;nbsp;inch (3,200&amp;nbsp;mm) up to a 147" wheelbase chassis and featured the 230 cubic-inch [[Flathead engine|flathead]] [[Straight-six engine|inline-six engine]], a 4-speed [[manual transmission]], a two-speed 1.96-1 ratio low range [[transfer case]] for part time 4-wheel drive with a [[power take off]] (PTO) which would send power front or rear for operating auxiliary equipment, and 9.00/16-8 ply tires on 16×6.50&amp;nbsp;inch 5-stud split ring steel rims. In 1961 the 230 was replaced with the 251 cubic-inch flat head six.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dodgepowerwagon.com/main/changes.php&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1963, a new 225 cubic-inch slant six replaced the 251 cubic-inch six used in 1961 &amp; 1962 W100 &amp; W200 Power Wagon Trucks. The Power Wagon W300 continued to use the 251 cubic-inch L-6 engine. The new 225 cubic-inch engine (the 225-2) was able to power the med. duty trucks due to improvements including; roller timing chains, bi-metal connecting rod bearings, stellite-faced exhaust valves, roto caps on exhaust valves and polyacrylic valve stem seals.

The nominal one-ton rated Power Wagon's [[gross vehicle weight rating]] (GVWR) was 8,700 pounds. Its maximum payload was 3,000 pounds.  A big-block 383 [[V8 engine]] became an option starting in 1967. From 1961 to 1971 the body was called the "Sweptline," then transitioned to a more modern body image from 1972 through 1980 with varied grilles and paint schemes.  In 1975 the 4-wheel drive became full-time with a 2-speed transfer case; this was changed back to part-time 4-wheel drive in 1980 due to the [[1979 energy crisis|energy crisis]].  A huge boost in sales followed the 1974 release of the extended "Club Cab," popular with families and camper hauling. The 4-door [[Crew cab#Crew cab|Crew Cab]] was far less common and is quite desirable to collectors for restoration.  Utility and function was unmatched by few competing models, as the towing, payload, and snow plowing capacity of the Power Wagon equipped with "[[Dana 60]]" 8-lug axles was very popular with municipal and regional road crews.

The Power Wagon was sold through the 1980 [[model year]]. A number of engineering and styling improvements were made over the years as the truck grew in size and weight, but the basic package remained generally constant throughout its life and underwent one last major body change in 1972.

===W100 and W200===
The first light-duty civilian Power Wagons came out in 1957 with the introduction of the W100 and W200 pickups and panel trucks, Town Wagon (with rear side windows) and Town Panel without rear side windows (beginning in 1957 {{fraction|1|2}}-ton 2WDs were D100s and 4WDs were W100s). These trucks featured conventional cabs and front sheet metal and the cargo boxes used on the 2WD models. Their 4WD mechanical components—axles, transfer cases and transmissions—were sourced from outside manufacturers. Chrysler Corporation owned the [[New Process]] Gear Company (competitors generally used Spicer ([[Dana Holding Corporation|Dana]]) transfer cases and [[Borg-Warner]] or in-house transmissions).&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.townwagon.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===W300===
A one-ton W300 light-duty/civilian type Power Wagon was released in 1958.

===W500 and W600===
The two-ton W500 Power Wagon (only a chassis cab was built) was introduced in 1956 as the C3-HW, and lasted through the 1971 model year. This was replaced in 1972 with the W600 (also cab and chassis only), which was produced until 1977, when all Dodge medium-duty models were discontinued. To compensate for the loss of the medium-duty W600 a new W400 chassis cab was introduced in 1977.

===Willock Chassis Swivel===
From about 1952 through 1958 an option known as the [[Willock Chassis Swivel]] was available.  With this option the frame was split into two pieces at the point where the bed of the truck met the rear of the cab.  A longitudinal swivel system allowed these two pieces to rotate with respect to each other, with the result that almost without regard to the terrain all four wheels would always be on the ground.  Somewhere between 50 and 100 examples were built.  While Willock is no longer in business the chassis swivel is still manufactured by third-party vendors and can be incorporated into existing vehicles.{{cn|date=September 2014}}

==Replacement by Dodge Ram==
The Power Wagon nameplate was discontinued in 1981 with the introduction of the [[Dodge Ram]], with the four-wheel-drive models being sold under the "Power Ram" nameplate through 1993.  1989 to 1993 models saw the addition of an optional 6-cylinder [[Cummins]] [[Turbo-diesel engine]].

==2005–present==

For 2005, Dodge resurrected the Power Wagon name on a version of the Dodge Ram 2500.  It was a special off-road version of the Ram 2500 with a 5.7L ''[[Chrysler Hemi engine#5.7|Hemi]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] as the only engine option.  As of 2014, the only engine available is the 6.4L Hemi. Interior configurations remain similar to standard produam. As of 2010, the Power Wagon is only available as a Crew Cab Short Bed model.  Special features of the Power Wagon include:

*Electronically controlled [[locking differentials]] (front and rear)
*Electronically disconnecting front [[sway bar]]
*Integrated 12,000&amp;nbsp;lb electric Warn [[winch]]
*17 inch diameter [[Alcoa]] [[Forging|forged]] wheels 
*Large 33 inch diameter [[BF Goodrich]] All Terrain T/A 285/70R17 tires.  Replaced by Goodyear Duratracs beginning with the 2014 model year.
*[[Bilstein Shock Absorbers|Bilstein]] Monotube Gas Charged Shocks&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dieselpowermag.com/features/dodge/0807dp_2007_dodge_ram_2500_power_wagon/viewall.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Extensive skidplating:  front stabilizer bar, transfer case, fuel tank, special skid plate crossmembers welded to the frame with open bars bolted to them across the midsection.
* 1.4" factory lift in front, 1.0" in rear (0.4" front and rear due to larger tires).  Softer rate springs.
* Strengthened [[torque converter]]
* 4.56:1 axle ratios (4.10 as of the 2014 model)
* Revised clutch fan
* Strengthened steering gear
* Low range 4x4 throttle mapping changed.

Upgraded suspension and larger tires naturally give the truck a taller ride height. Clearance lights and tow hooks are standard equipment.  Fender flares are standard equipment as well.  The fender flares assist with tire coverage due to the Power Wagon's wider tires.

===Powertrain===
6.4 L Hemi V8 (410 hp / 429 lbs.ft of torque) for 2014 to current model year

5.7 L Hemi V8 (383 hp / 400 lbs.ft of torque) for 2010 - 2013 model years

5.7 L Hemi V8 (345 hp / 375 lbs.ft of torque) for 2005 - 2009 model years

====Transmission====
A six speed G56 manual transmission was standard, with an automatic transmission optional. As of 2010 the manual transmission is no longer an option.  2012 models have the [[Chrysler RFE transmission#65RFE and 66RFE|66RFE]] 6 speed automatic transmission, instead of the [[Chrysler RFE transmission#45RFE and 545RFE|545RFE]] 5 speed automatic in the previous models. As of 2019 a 8HP75-LCA 8 speed automatic from ZF is standard.

====Transfer case====
The [[transfer case]] was a [[New Venture Gear|New Venture 271]] and had a 2.72:1 low range gear ratio.  A transfer case skid plate was and is standard equipment.  A [[Transfer case#M.S.O.F.|manual shift-on-the-fly]] transfer case is the only available, the [[Transfer case#M.S.O.F.|electronic shift on-the-fly]] has never been an option.  As of the 2012 model year, the transfer case has changed to a Borg-Warner 44-47 manual shift-on-the fly.  Low range is now 2.64:1.

====Axles====
The axles are manufactured by [[American Axle|American Axle &amp; Manufacturing, Inc.]]  The front is an [[Saginaw 9.5-inch axle#AAM 9.25|AAM 9.25]] and the rear is a hybrid [[10.5" Corporate 14 Bolt Differential#10.5 AAM|AAM 10.5]] with the larger axle shafts from the AAM 11.5.  Despite the fact the axles have locking differentials, the rear axle is also a [[Limited slip differential#Geared LSD|helical-type limited slip differential]] when unlocked.  The axles are only available with a 4.56:1 gear ratio.  Non Power Wagon 2500 Ram trucks only have 3.42:1, 3.73:1, or 4.10:1 gear ratios.  2010 models (along with other Ram trucks) received larger [[universal joint]]s.

2012 Weight ratings:
* [[Gross vehicle weight rating|GVWR]] - 8510&amp;nbsp;lbs
* [[Gross combined weight rating|GCWR]] - 17,000&amp;nbsp;lbs
* [[Gross axle weight rating|GAWR]] (front) - 4500&amp;nbsp;lbs
* GAWR (rear) - 6200&amp;nbsp;lbs
* Max payload - 1880&amp;nbsp;lbs
* Max towing - 10,250&amp;nbsp;lbs
* [[Curb weight]] - 6800&amp;nbsp;lbs

===2013 updates===
The New Venture Gear transfer case is replaced by a [[BorgWarner|Borg-Warner]] unit.  Interior updated ala 1500 Rams.

===2014 updates===
The RAM Power Wagon will have a 6.4 ''[[Chrysler Hemi engine#5.7|Hemi]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] as the standard engine; the 5.7 Hemi V8 goes away.  The 6.4 has 410 horsepower and is also available in standard Rams.  The transmission and transfer case remain unchanged (Borg Warner 44-47).  The axle gears change from 4.56:1 gear ratios to 4:10 gear ratios.  The rear axle is now a [[10.5" Corporate 14 Bolt Differential#11.5 AAM|11.5 AAM]] axle (with selectable locker).  The rear suspension now has a 5-link [[coil spring]] arrangement instead of [[leaf spring]]s.  The front suspension has been changed to a radius arm arrangement (3-link) instead of the 5-link used since 2005.  Tires are now Goodyear Duratracs.

The '''Dodge Lancer''' is an [[automobile]] which was built by [[Dodge]]. Initially introduced as a [[hardtop]] version of the [[full-size car|full-sized]] [[1955 Dodge]], the original version was produced until 1959. In 1961, Dodge revived the Lancer nameplate on the [[compact car|compact]] [[Chrysler A platform]], but this only remained in production for two model years before it was replaced by the [[Dodge Dart]]. For 1985, Dodge used the Lancer nameplate on a car based on the [[mid-size car|mid-size]]d [[Chrysler H platform]], and this model remained in production until it was replaced by the [[Dodge Spirit]] in 1989.

==1955–1959 Coronet Lancer, Royal Lancer and Custom Royal Lancer==
[[File:1956 Dodge Custom Royal Lancer.JPG|thumb|1956 Dodge Custom Royal Lancer]]
Dodge used the Lancer name from 1955 to 1959 to designate the two- and four-door [[hardtop]] (no B-pillar) models in the full-sized [[Dodge Coronet|Coronet]], Royal, and Custom Royal lines. The Custom Royal Lancer was a hardtop only and top-of-the-line model for Dodge in 1959. There were 6,278 two-door and 5,019 four-door hardtops made in 1959. A total of 11,397 Custom Royal Lancers were made.

The Custom Royal Lancer featured a big-block V8 engine, the {{convert|361|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} producing {{convert|305|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. A D-500 option was available, which included a {{convert|383|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine with a single Carter four-barrel carburetor rated at {{convert|320|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, as well as a Super D-500 version with dual four-barrel carburetors producing {{convert|340|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.

The Custom Royal Lancer also featured a padded dashboard and steering wheel, Lancer emblems on the fenders, steering wheel, hubcaps, foot-operated windshield wipers, dual radio antennas, deluxe side trim, and thick chrome eyebrows. Optional equipment included power windows and brakes, air conditioning, and [[swivel seat]]s. The Lancer designation was dropped for 1960.

For the 1961 [[model year]], Dodge applied the Lancer nameplate to its higher-priced, upmarket [[badge engineering|badge-engineered]] clone of Chrysler's very popular [[Plymouth Valiant|Valiant]] compact. The model was introduced when [[Chrysler]] officially assigned the [[Plymouth Valiant|Valiant]] to the [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] division for 1961, leaving Dodge dealers without a compact to sell. All the same body variants available on the Valiant were also available on the Lancer: two- and four-door sedans, two-door hardtop and four-door wagons. At the end of 1962, it was renamed the [[Dodge Dart#Third generation (1963–1966)|Dodge Dart]].

In a survey of owners in the March, 1961 issue of [[Popular Mechanics]], 71.2% of owners liked that handling, but 12.3% thought that the workmanship was bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i98DAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=8 February 2020 |work=Popular Mechanics |date=March 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Styling &amp; trim===
[[File:1961 Dodge Lancer 770 Station Wagon (2).jpg|thumb|left|1961 Dodge Lancer 770 Station Wagon]]
[[File:1962 Dodge Lancer 170 2-Door Sedan (rear).JPG|thumb|left|1962 Dodge Lancer 170 2-Door Sedan]]
[[File:1962 Dodge Lancer GT 2-Door Hardtop.JPG|thumb|left|1962 Dodge Lancer GT 2-Door Hardtop]]
The Lancer wheelbase and body shell were identical to those of the Valiant, but interior and exterior trim were more upscale for the Lancer. Lancers featured round [[Automotive lighting|taillights]] and a full-width grille, instead of the Valiant's cat's-eye taillights and central grille. For 1961, trim levels were the basic "170" and the premium "770". In 1961, the two-door hardtop was marketed only as the "Lancer 770 2-Door Hardtop".&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures.com"/&gt; For 1962, the hardtop model was marketed as the "GT 2-Door Hardtop" and carried premium trim. Two-tone paint was available and instead of the front bench seat, there were two bucket seats. Also for the 1962 model, "Lancer GT" medallions were mounted on the doors' interior trim panels below the vent window and on the sides of the front fenders just aft of the [[headlamp]]s. "GT" emblems were placed on the hood, the deck lid and on the vinyl dash pad. The headlamp bezels and the grille's horizontal slats were blacked-out. The GT also lacked certain ornamentation found on the 170s and 770s such as the "Lancer" door scripts, the slanted chrome hash marks on the lower quarter panel, and the hook-ended [[stainless steel]] door-to-fender spears.

===Powertrains===
The Lancer used the [[Chrysler Slant 6 engine|slant-6]] engine. The base engine was the {{convert|170|cuin|l|1|abbr=on|adj=on}} unit, rated at {{convert|101|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The optional power package consisted of the larger {{convert|225|cuin|l|1|abbr=on|adj=on}} engine, rated at {{convert|145|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. After the start of the 1961 model year, a [[die casting|die-cast]] [[aluminum]] version of the 225 engine block was made available. The aluminum 225 weighed {{convert|45|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} less than the iron 170 and {{convert|80|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} less than the iron 225. Any of the available engines could be equipped at the dealer with Chrysler's [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine#Hyper Pak|Hyper Pak]] parts kit for a significant power upgrade: the 170 Hyper Pak's published output was {{convert|148|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while the 225 Hyper Pak's was {{convert|196|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The Hyper-Pak shaved more than four seconds off the 0 to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} time versus the standard 225, and was over a second quicker and seven miles per hour faster in the quarter mile.&lt;ref name = Morris&gt;{{cite book|last = Morris |first = Charles R. |title = Factory Lightweights: Detroit's Drag Racing Specials of the '60s |publisher = CarTech |year = 2007 |page = 17 |isbn = 978-1-932494-44-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the Hyper Pak, a 225 Lancer could go from 0 to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 8.6 seconds and turn in a standing quarter mile time of 16.4 seconds.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite book|last = Young |first = Tony |title = Mighty Mopars 1960–1974 |publisher = Motorbooks International |year = 1984 |page = 25 |isbn = 978-0-87938-124-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1962 cars had the engine and transmission moved for a flatter front floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1962_Dodge/1962_Dodge_Dart-Lancer_Brochure/1962%20Dodge%20Dart%20%20amp%20%20Lancer-10.html |title=Directory Index: Dodge/1962_Dodge/1962_Dodge_Dart-Lancer_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transmission options were a Chrysler-built A903 three-speed manual with the shifter on the floor in 1961 and on the steering column in 1962, or a pushbutton-operated A904 [[Torqueflite]] three-speed automatic.

===Drag strip &amp; sales competition===
In the 1962 [[NHRA]] Winternatonals, Wayne Weihe took home the win in the C/FX (Factory Experimental) class with his Hyper-Pak-equipped Lancer, clocking a 15.67 E.T.&lt;ref name= Morris/&gt; Although the bigger Dodges were beginning to appear at drag strips around the country, the "Golden Lancer" of Dode Martin and Jim Nelson was just about the fastest compact on the strips in 1962. Stuffed into the engine compartment was a {{convert|413|cuin|L||sp=us|abbr=in}} [[Chrysler RB engine#413|Chrysler RB V8]] engine modified by the Chrysler engineers' "Ramchargers" racing team. The Golden Lancer raced successfully in A/FX class and could do the quarter mile in 12.68 seconds at {{Convert|113|mph|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Young/&gt;

Lancer sales did not meet expectations{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} and sold about half as well as the Valiant. As a late part of the total redesign of Dodge's compact car for 1963, the Lancer name was discontinued. Dodge compacts for 1963 through 1976 were named [[Dodge Dart|Dart]], a name that had previously been assigned to a larger car produced by Dodge from 1960 to 1962.

===South African market===
In [[South Africa]], a [[right hand drive]] version of the Lancer was sold from 1961 through 1963, badged as the '''DeSoto Rebel''' not long after the [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] name was discontinued in the U.S. All Rebels were equipped with the {{convert|170|cuin|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler Slant 6 engine|Slant 6]] engine, and most were equipped with the three-speed manual transmission. As with the Australian [[Chrysler Valiant#R Series|RV1 and SV1]] Valiants, the Rebel used the instrument cluster from the U.S. 1961 [[Plymouth Valiant]]. White reflectors were mounted to the front bumper, in compliance with South African vehicle equipment regulations. The Rebel name was re-introduced by Chrysler South Africa in 1967 as the economy-priced "[[Chrysler Valiant|Valiant]] Rebel".

}}

The Dodge Lancer was re-introduced in 1985 as a mid-sized 5-door [[hatchback]]. It was a rebadged version of the more expensive [[Chrysler LeBaron|Chrysler LeBaron GTS]] and was based on the [[Chrysler H platform]], a stretched version of the [[Chrysler K platform]]. The Lancer eventually slotted between the [[Dodge Aries|Aries]] and the [[Dodge 600|600]].  All Lancers were built in [[Sterling Heights, Michigan|Sterling Heights]], [[Michigan]]. Production ended on April 7, 1989, replaced by the [[Dodge Spirit|Spirit]].

===Lancer Shelby===

The 1988 to 1989 "Lancer Shelby" was a factory appearance and handling package including upgraded [[sway bar]]s, shorter springs, and quicker steering along with an assortment of comfort and convenience features including leather seats, power locks, windows, seats and mirrors, a tilt steering wheel and a two-position cup holder.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} It was inspired by the 1987 [[Shelby Lancer]], which was built by [[Carroll Shelby#Shelby Dodges and Dodge Shelbys|Shelby Automobiles]] in Whittier, California. Chrysler took over production starting with the 1988 model year, building them in the same Sterling Heights plant as regular Lancers.

The [[intercooled]] [[Chrysler K engine#2.2 Turbo II|Turbo II]] engine with the [[manual transmission]] provided {{convert|175|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The [[automatic transmission|automatic]] variant was equipped with the {{convert|146|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler K engine#2.2 Turbo I|Turbo I]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}. Although it was not planned as a limited edition, only 279 Lancer Shelbys were produced in 1988 and 208 in 1989{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}.

===European market===
In April 1988, Chrysler started offering some models on the European market. One of them was the "Chrysler GTS", a rebadged version of the Dodge Lancer ES. Due to [[ECE Regulations|European vehicle regulations]], the exterior appearance was slightly different. The rear [[Automotive lighting#Turn signal colour|turn signals]] were amber rather than red, the front [[Automotive lighting#Sidemarker lights and reflectors|sidemarkers]] and the [[Automotive lighting#Centre High Mount Stop Lamp|centre high mount stop lamp]] (CHMSL) were blanked off, small round [[Automotive lighting#Side turn signals|repeaters]] were installed into the front fenders and the [[Wing mirror|sideview mirrors]] were of spring-hinged rather than rigid design. The engine options included the naturally aspirated {{convert|2.2|l|cuin|0||abbr=on|adj=on}} Four, and a turbocharged version of the same engine. From 1989 on, the {{convert|2.5|l|cuin|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} Four became available with or without a turbocharger. The 2.2 engine was dropped, except for the Turbo II version that was standard equipment on the Chrysler GTS Shelby, the European sibling of the [[Dodge Lancer#Lancer Shelby|Dodge Lancer Shelby]]. A five-speed manual gearbox was standard, with a three-speed automatic transmission as an extra cost option. The GTS Shelby came only with the manual transmission.

The Chrysler GTS had few buyers in Europe; the competition was too hard. Even the comparatively low prices could not help, and sales figures were very low. By the end of 1989, the GTS was replaced by the [[Chrysler Saratoga#1989–1995|Saratoga]].

The '''Dodge 600''' is a [[mid-size car]] that was built by [[Dodge]]. It was introduced in 1982, as a 1983 model, based on the [[Chrysler E platform]] and was discontinued after the 1988 model year. It was [[Chrysler]]'s answer to the [[GM A platform (FWD)|GM A-body]], whereas the [[Chrysler M platform|M-body]] [[Dodge Diplomat]] would compete with [[full-size car]]s. It replaced the [[Dodge 400|400]]. (Dodge 600 coupes and convertibles were, essentially, rebadged 400s.) Like the preceding 400, it was positioned between the [[Dodge Aries|Aries]] and [[Dodge Diplomat|Diplomat]].

==Debut==
The 600 was intended to be Dodge's answer to the European sedans of the day. Its numerical name and rear-end styling was designed to evoke thoughts of [[Mercedes-Benz]] models, however it fell more in line with North American contemporaries such as the [[Chevrolet Celebrity]], [[Pontiac 6000]] and the [[Ford Fairmont]] (the 600 actually resembled the [[Dodge Mirada]] more than any [[Europe]]an car). It debuted as a four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]], available in two trims: Base and ES ("Euro Sport"). Power was provided by Chrysler's 2.2&amp;nbsp;L 4-cylinder engine, with the Mitsubishi-built 2.6&amp;nbsp;L [[Inline-four engine|4-cylinder]] available as an option.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Sales of the 600 nearly doubled in its second year. This was in large part due to the addition of the former [[Dodge 400|400's]] coupe and convertible body styles to the 600's range (which continued to stay on the [[Chrysler K platform|K platform]]).  Like most midrange-to-upscale K-car derivatives, digital dashboards and the [[Electronic Voice Alert]] were options.

==ES Turbo==
Mid-way into 1984 Dodge introduced a sporty new "ES Turbo" package for convertibles. It featured Chrysler's new 2.2&amp;nbsp;L {{convert|142|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Turbocharged engine (which also became an option on sedans and coupes) and a special sport-tuned "ES" suspension. The interior came with standard leather seats, digital dashboard, and four-spoke steering wheel (redesigned in 1985). Visual exterior cues differentiate ES models from base convertibles by way of blacked-out trim (replacing much of the chrome), 15-inch "pizza" style aluminum wheels, "ES" decklid badges, Turbo fender badges, and functioning dual hood vents.

Sales of the ES Turbo were initially slow, with only 1786 copies being sold for the 1984 model year. Output increased to 5621 for 1985, then eased to 4759 for 1986, after which the model was discontinued along with all 600 convertibles. Base price for the 1986 ES Turbo convertible was $14,856.

==Midlife changes==
Several changes were made to the 600 in 1985. The 600 [[Sedan (car)|sedan]] was moved to a longer wheelbase and the former base and ES trims were dropped, replaced by a new SE trim. This was due in part to the new [[Dodge Lancer#1980s|Lancer]], which would have competed directly with the 600 (the 5-speed [[manual transmission]] was no longer offered as well, in an attempt to keep competition between the [[Dodge Lancer#1980s|Lancer]] and 600 to a minimum). The [[coupe]] and [[convertible (car)|convertible]] remained relatively unchanged except for minor trim and interior changes. The only significant advancement was the replacement of the 2.2&amp;nbsp;L engine's two-barrel Holley electronic feedback [[carburetor]] by an electronic throttle-body [[fuel injection]] system.

The sedan's base trim returned in 1986, while all 600s were given new, restyled front and rear fascias (the front in particular adopted the now familiar "crosshair" grille, dropping the [[Dodge Mirada|Mirada]]-inspired horizontal slats). The 2.6&amp;nbsp;L engine was replaced by a modified [[Chrysler K engine#2.5|2.5 L]] version of the Chrysler 2.2&amp;nbsp;L.

==End of production==
The phase out of the 600 started in 1987 with the coupe and convertible versions being discontinued in that year. Production of the sedan ended in 1988. The 600 was replaced by the 1988 [[Dodge Dynasty]] (badged as a [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] in Canada, whereas the Canadian successor is the [[Dodge Spirit]]).

There were negotiations to build the car in China after production ended. [[Hongqi (marque)|Hongqi]] imported a couple of 600s and applied a new rear end and Hongqi badging, intending to sell them as the Hongqi CA750F in China. However, Volkswagen's long-term outlook convinced the Chinese otherwise and Hongqi chose to build the [[Audi 100]] instead, albeit fitted with a locally built version of Chrysler's 2.2-liter inline-four.

The '''Dodge Spirit''' is a mid-size 5- or 6-passenger sedan that was introduced in January 1989 as a replacement for the similarly sized [[Dodge 600]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Chrysler Corporation Master Technician Service Conference book |chapter=New Model Service Highlights '89 |page=4 |quote=Spirit and Acclaim are the new midsize sedans, replacing 600 and Caravelle.| publisher=Chrysler Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spirit was [[Dodge]]'s version of the [[Chrysler A platform|Chrysler AA platform]], a stretched variation of the [[Chrysler K platform]]. It was assembled at [[Newark Assembly]] in [[Newark, Delaware]], [[Toluca Car Assembly]] in [[Toluca]], [[Mexico]], as well as [[Valencia]], [[Venezuela]],   and shared its basic design with the 1990 to 1994 [[Chrysler LeBaron]] sedan, the 1989 to 1995 [[Plymouth Acclaim]], and the export-only 1989 to 1995 [[Chrysler Saratoga#1989–1995|Chrysler Saratoga]].

The Spirit has also been described as a replacement for the smaller [[Dodge Aries|Aries]] and the hatchback [[Dodge Lancer#1980s|Lancer]], though the [[Dodge Shadow|Shadow]] launched in 1986 is closer than the Spirit in most dimensions to the Aries and Lancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of Chrysler 1924-1990 |first=John |last=Lee |year=1990 |publisher= Krause Publications |isbn=978-0-87341-142-4 |page=338 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Aaron |last=Gold |first2=Michael |last2=Swern |title=Kronology: History of the K-car |url= http://www.allpar.com/eek/k/kron.html |accessdate=22 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1990-1995 Dodge Spirit: Full Review |publisher=Consumer Guide |url=http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1990-to-1995-dodge-spirit-6.htm |date=13 November 2010 |accessdate=22 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203113329/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1990-to-1995-dodge-spirit-6.htm |archivedate=3 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 60,000 Dodge Spirits were sold in its first year{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}, enough that Aries production was stopped mid-season. Spirit production ended on December 9, 1994, along with the [[Plymouth Acclaim]] and it was marketed through 1995. The "[[Cab forward#Road vehicles|cab-forward]]" [[Dodge Stratus|Stratus]] was introduced as a replacement.

== Design ==
The Spirit could accommodate six people with an optional front split-bench seat. It had a large trunk, a solid-beam rear axle, and a [[MacPherson strut]] front suspension. The Spirit differed from the other A-bodies primarily in the grille and [[automotive lighting|rear lamp]] styling, and in the availability of a sportier, higher-performing R/T version.

The Spirit is dimensionally comparable to its contemporaneous [[Ford Tempo]], and was also compared with the [[Ford Taurus]], [[Honda Accord]], and [[Toyota Camry]] by Consumer Reports{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}. The Spirit sold well; with higher consumer acceptance than the [[Dodge Stratus|Stratus]] that replaced it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Changes through the years==
[[File:Dodge Spirit RT.jpg|thumb|right|1992 Dodge Spirit R/T]]
[[File:Dodge Spirit .jpg|thumb|right|1993–1995 Dodge Spirit]]
* 1991 - Antilock four-wheel disk brake system was added as a new option.
* 1992 - A 3-speed automatic transmission became available with the V6 engine.
* 1993 - A facelift included a body-color grille with the Dodge crossbars theme and new full-width [[automotive lighting|taillamps]] that despite their amber lower sections, did not include amber rear [[Automotive lighting#Turn signal colour|turn signals]]. Only two trim levels went on sale: Highline and ES.  The Chrysler corporate pentastar emblem was replaced with the brand's new RAM emblem. Stainless steel exhaust system and tinted glass became standard on all Spirits.
* 1994 - A motorized passenger's side [[seat belt]] was added to [[United States|U.S.]]-market Spirits to comply with [[FMVSS|Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208]]'s requirement for passive restraints. These motorized belts do not comply with [[Canada]]'s safety standards; Canadian-market Spirits continued to use a manual passenger seatbelt, and 1994–1995 Spirits therefore cannot legally be permanently imported across the US/Canada border in either direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riv.ca/english/html/how_to_import.html |title=Canadian vehicle importation regulations |publisher=Riv.ca |date=|accessdate=22 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/import/FMVSS/#SN101 |title=US vehicle importation regulations|publisher=Nhtsa.dot.gov |date=December 1998 |accessdate=22 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1995 - The 2.5&amp;nbsp;L engine received a slightly revised cylinder head, and both the 4-speed A604 [[automatic transmission]] and [[anti-lock brakes]] were dropped from the option list. Otherwise, the Spirit remained mostly unchanged, much as it had throughout its six-year run.

==Trims==
* 1989–95: Base
* 1989–91: LE
* 1989–93: ES
* 1991–92: R/T

The Spirit ES and R/T featured ''Eurocast'' (also called ''Snowflake'') alloy wheels through 1991. For 1992, the ''Turbo Blade'' wheel was introduced.&lt;ref name=Wheel101&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dempseybowling.com/shelby/wheel101.htm |title=A primer for Shelby/Dodge FWD wheels |publisher=Dempseybowling.com |date=4 July 2001 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110709011936/http://www.dempseybowling.com/shelby/wheel101.htm |archivedate=9 July 2011 |accessdate=22 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the alloy wheels were color-keyed to the vehicle body:

*White body with white painted wheels (ES, R/T)
*Black, silver, or dark red body with clear-coated wheels (ES only)
*Bright Red body with bright red painted wheel inserts (R/T only, 1991)

Starting in 1993, the Spirit was offered with a ''Gold'' package similar to that offered on the 1993-94 [[Plymouth Acclaim]] and [[Dodge Caravan]]/[[Plymouth Voyager]] minivans. This included goldtone-trimmed alloy wheels and gold pinstripes. The Gold package was available with both 4- and 6-cylinder models, with certain body colors.

==Engines==
The base engine for Spirit and Spirit LE models was a {{convert|2.5|L|cuin|abbr=on}} [[Fuel injection#Throttle body injection|TBI]] [[Chrysler K engine|4-cylinder engine]] producing {{convert|100|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. Optional on all models except the Spirit R/T was a {{convert|141|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, [[Mitsubishi 6G7 engine#6G72|{{convert|3.0|L|cuin|abbr=on}} L V6]] made by [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]]. Also available in 1989 through 1992—and standard equipment on the Spirit ES—was a {{convert|150|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} [[turbocharged]] version of the 2.5&amp;nbsp;L engine. In 1993, 1994, and 1995, a [[flexible fuel vehicle|flexible-fuel]] Spirit was offered, powered by a {{convert|107|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} [[MPFI|multipoint fuel injected]] version of the 2.5&amp;nbsp;L engine specially modified to run on fuel containing up to 85% [[methanol]]. The R/T version came with a powerful {{convert|135|cuin|L|1|disp=flip|abbr=on}} [[DOHC]] turbo III with cylinder head engineered and made by [[Lotus (car)|Lotus]]. This engine was rated at {{convert|224|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|217|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}.

==Transmissions==
Several five-speed [[manual transmission]]s were available with the naturally aspirated and turbocharged 4-cylinder engines, but relatively few Spirits were equipped with manual transmissions. All the Spirit R/Ts came with the A-568 heavy-duty 5-speed manual transmission. From 1989 to 1991, all V6 Spirits came with the electronic four-speed [[ultradrive|A604]] overdrive automatic, which became optional equipment in 1992 and remained optional until 1995. The three-speed [[TorqueFlite#A413|Torqueflite]] automatic was the most popular installation on 4-cylinder Spirits, and was also standard equipment with the V6 engine from 1992 through 1995. A 5-speed manual was offered with the V6 engine in the smaller [[Dodge Shadow|Shadow]], but this combination was not available in the Spirit.

==R/T==

In 1991, Chrysler introduced the '''Spirit R/T''', featuring a version of the 2.2&amp;nbsp;L engine with a [[multi-valve|16-valve]] [[DOHC]] head designed by [[Lotus (car)|Lotus]], who won a design competition against Maserati and Hans Hermann. Fed by a [[Garrett AiResearch|Garrett]] [[intercooled]] [[turbocharger]], the ''[[Chrysler K engine#2.2 Turbo III|Turbo III]]'' engine produced {{convert|224|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|217|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}. The R/T also featured unique interior and exterior trims. The only transmission was a heavy-duty A568 5-speed [[manual transmission]] built by Chrysler's New Process Gear division, with a gearset supplied by [[Getrag]]. Heavy-duty vented four wheel disc brakes were standard equipment, with optional [[anti-lock brakes]]. Color-keyed 15-inch alloy wheels were standard, with P205/60R15 tires.

At the time, the R/T was advertised as "the fastest sedan made in America", and one of the quickest performance sedans under $40,000, with Chrysler placing its performance above the [[BMW M5]]. It could reach {{convert|60|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5.8&amp;nbsp;seconds, according to ''[[Car and Driver]]'', making it one of the quickest [[front wheel drive]] cars ever offered in the American market. It was chosen as ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's "Domestic Sport Sedan of the Year", beating the [[Ford Taurus SHO]] for 1991 and 1992.

All R/Ts were built in Mexico. A total of 1,208 were sold in the U.S. in 1991 &amp;mdash; 774 in red and 434 in white. An additional 191 were sold in the U.S. in 1992 &amp;mdash; 92 red, 68 white, and 31 silver. The only discernible changes for 1992 were a lower first gear ratio for reduced [[Turbocharger#Lag|turbo lag]], woodgrain dashboard trim as used on the [[Chrysler LeBaron]] sedan, blacked out upper and lower grille inserts, clear rather than amber lenses for the front parking and turn signal lights, and a [[speedometer]] calibrated to {{convert|150|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} rather than {{convert|120|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.

==Mexican and South American markets==

Spirits were marketed in [[Cars in Mexico|Mexico]]. They were badged as Chryslers rather than Dodges, since the Dodge brand at the time was used only on trucks. The Spirit was introduced in the Mexican market for 1990, one year after its début in the U.S. and Canada. The 1990-1991 Mexican versions were equipped with the U.S. market Plymouth Acclaim tail lights. The initial 1990-model Spirits used a version of the 2.5&amp;nbsp;L engine operating on [[Gasoline#Lead|leaded gasoline]], equipped with a [[carburetor]], a tubular exhaust [[Exhaust manifold|header]], and electronic control of ignition timing.&lt;ref name="mexpirit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://u225.torque.net/cars/mexpirit.html |title=1992 Chrysler Spirit (built in Mexico) |publisher=U225.torque.net |date= |accessdate=2011-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This induction and ignition system used technology and components very similar to those employed in Chrysler's U.S.-market [[Lean burn#Chrysler Lean Burn computer|Lean Burn]] emission control systems of the late-1970s.

For the 1991 [[model year]], Mexico enacted new-vehicle [[Automobile emissions control|emission]] regulations similar to those in the U.S. and Canada. The carbureted leaded-fuel engine was too dirty to comply with the new regulations, so a fully integrated engine management system with [[fuel injection]] was added to the Spirit. This was not the [[Fuel injection#Throttle body injection|TBI]] system used in the U.S., Canada, and [[Europe]]. Rather, the Mexican-market Spirits came with a more advanced [[MPFI]] setup.&lt;ref name="mexpirit"/&gt; The MPFI 2.5 improved performance and driveability, as well as achieved cleaner emissions than its TBI counterpart, but was not used in the U.S., Canadian, or rest-of-world export markets except on turbocharged and FFV models. The Chrysler Spirit with MPFI 2.5&amp;nbsp;L engine was sold in Mexico from 1991 through 1995, and was exported to [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]] from 1993 through 1995. It was employed by the [[Argentine]] police in [[Buenos Aires]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} [[File:ChryslerSpiritPFA.jpg|thumb|Chrysler Spirit, police car in Argentina]]

Chrysler de Mexico also sold two versions of the Spirit R/T. The base R/T, sold from 1991 through 1995, used a Mexico-only {{convert|168|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} intercooled Turbo II version of the 8-valve [[SOHC]] 2.5&amp;nbsp;L engine and the 3-speed [[Torqueflite#A413|A413]] automatic transmission. These R/Ts were used by Mexican [[police]] departments.

The top-line R/T. called "R/T DOHC", available from 1992 through 1993, came with the same 2.2&amp;nbsp;L 16-valve [[DOHC]] engine that was used in the American-market in the 1991 to 1992 R/T with a 5-speed manual transmission. More options and higher equipment levels were available in Mexico, including leather upholstery, sunroof, and 16-inch alloy wheels, none of which was offered on the R/T in America. In addition, Mexican-market R/Ts could be ordered in a variety of different colors, not just the red, white, and silver offered in the U.S. All Mexican-market Spirit R/Ts were badged as Chryslers. A variant of the R/T family, the [[Chrysler Phantom R/T]], was a special-order Mexico-only premium version of the [[Chrysler LeBaron|LeBaron]] coupe equipped with the 2.2&amp;nbsp;L 16-valve DOHC engine and the ''Getrag'' 5-speed manual transmission.

The '''Dodge La Femme''' is a [[full-size]]d [[automobile]] that was produced by [[Dodge]] between 1955 and 1956. The automobile was specifically designed for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January |title=Dodge's LaFemme Is First Automobile With A Gender |journal=Popular Mechanics |volume=104 |issue=1 |date=July 1955 |page=133 |accessdate=28 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The La Femme's reason for becoming a car was stemmed from Chrysler's marketing department's observation that more and more women were taking an interest in automobiles during the 1950s, and that women’s opinions on which color car to buy was becoming part of the decision making process for couples buying an automobile.  The La Femme was an attempt to gain a foothold in the women's automobile market.

The La Femme concept was based upon two Chrysler show cars from the 1954 season.  Named '''Le Comte''', and '''La Comtesse''', each was built from a [[Chrysler Newport]] hardtop body, and each was given a clear plastic roof over the entire passenger compartment. While the Le Comte was designed using masculine colors, the La Comtesse was painted "Dusty Rose" and "Pigeon Grey" in order to convey femininity.  Favorable responses encouraged Chrysler to pursue the La Comtesse concept.

== 1955 ==
Dodge received the project and renamed the concept the '''La Femme''', which began as a 1955 [[Dodge Lancer|Dodge Custom Royal Lancer]] "spring special" hardtop two-door coupe, painted "Sapphire White" and "Heather Rose".  From there, the exterior received special gold-colored "La Femme" scripts that replaced the standard "Custom Royal Lancer" scripts on the cars front fenders.

The interior of the car also received attention and features.  1955 La Femme interiors were upholstered in a special [[tapestry]] material featuring pink rosebuds on a pale silver-pink background and pale pink vinyl trim. The La Femme came with a keystone-shaped, pink calfskin purse that coordinated with the interior of the car. The purse could be stowed in a compartment in the back of the passenger seat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flory, Jr.|first=J. "Kelly"|title=American Cars, 1946-1959 Every Model Every Year|year=2008|publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-3229-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its gold-plated medallion faced outward.  This [[brushed-metal]] medallion was large enough to have the owner's name engraved on it.

Each purse was outfitted with a coordinated set of accessories inside, which included a face-powder compact, lipstick case, cigarette case, comb, cigarette lighter and change purse, all made of either faux-tortoiseshell plastic and gold-tone metal, or pink calfskin and gold-tone metal, and all were designed and made by “Evans”, a maker of women's fine garments and accessories in Chicago.

On the back of the drivers seat was a compartment that contained a raincoat, rain bonnet and umbrella,&lt;ref name="Ahrens"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ahrens|first1=Ronald|title=Dodge La Femme: Rhapsody in Pink|url=http://www.jeanknowscars.com/car-life/style/dodge-la-femme/|website=www.jeanknowscars.com|accessdate=19 April 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506045338/http://www.jeanknowscars.com/car-life/style/dodge-la-femme/|archivedate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; all made from a vinyl patterned to match the rosebud interior fabric.  Marketing brochures stated that the car was made ''"By Special Appointment to Her Majesty... the American Woman."''

== 1956 ==
For 1956, the La Femme returned, with no less fanfare; letters to dealers from Dodge’s marketing department called the La Femme a "stunning success".  For 1956, Dodge replaced the Heather Rose and Sapphire White scheme with a Misty Orchid and Regal Orchid color scheme. The interior of the car in 1956 did not take its cue from the 1955 model, and instead featured "La Femme"-only seat patterns, headliner, interior paint and carpet.  The fabrics used have proven difficult to reproduce. The seat coverings were made of a heavy white cloth with random, organic-seeming patterns of short lavender and purple loops, in a manner similar to loop-pile carpeting. The headliner cloth was heavy white fabric, with many tiny random splashes of gold paint. The carpeting was loop pile with several shades of lavender and purple.  The boxes behind the seats were changed for 1956 to accommodate the rain coat, rain cap and umbrella provided with the model. Both boxes were identical this year, because there was no need to accommodate a purse, which was only offered with the 1955 La Femme.

== Legacy ==
Dodge dropped the La Femme for 1957 and did not revisit the concept.  Because the La Femme was an option package ($143), its total production was never broken out from Dodge's production numbers, although research suggests fewer than 2,500 were made over the two-year period.  At least 40 known examples exist of the 1955 version and over 20 for the 1956 version, including at least 3 verifiable [[Chrysler B engine|Dodge D-500 engine]] optioned 1956 La Femme.{{Citation needed|reason=Reference the production and still "existing" figures|date=October 2019}}

Many theories exist concerning the low sales of the La Femme trim package. No evidence of magazine, television, radio, or other La Femme advertisements have been found since 1986. Given the large number of Dodge dealerships in the U.S. at the time, few of them received a demonstration La Femme for their showroom. Entitled “By Special Appointment to Her Majesty... the American Woman" dealer three-fold single-sheet pamphlets promoted the car as "in mood and manner" for a "discriminating. modern woman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kelly |first=Erin |title=You Won't Believe The "Woman's Car" Dodge Made In 1955 |url= https://allthatsinteresting.com/dodge-la-femme |website=All That's Interesting |accessdate=6 October 2019 |date=1 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Howell |first=Justina |title=The Pink Car for Women in the 1950s |url= https://www.thevintagenews.com/2019/03/31/dodge-la-femme/ |website=The Vintage News |accessdate=6 October 2019 |date=31 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other trim-special models such as the [[Chrysler 300 letter series]], [[Plymouth Fury]], and [[DeSoto Adventurer]] were widely promoted.

The '''Dodge Omni''' and '''Plymouth Horizon''' are [[subcompact]] cars that were produced by [[Chrysler]] from 1977 to 1990.&lt;ref name=TAM85&gt;{{cite book |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |editor= Mastrostefano, Raffaele |publisher=Editoriale Domus |ref=TAM85 |year=1985 |page=249 |language=Italian |location=Milano |isbn=88-7212-012-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Omni and Horizon were reengineered variants of the European [[Chrysler Horizon]] and became the first front-wheel-drive economy cars to be built in the US.&lt;ref name="AllparOmniHorizon"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon |url= https://www.allpar.com/omni/omni.html |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=16 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marketed for eleven years with very few changes, around 2,500,000 Omnis and Horizons were built with the Plymouth badged versions more popular than the Dodge branded models.&lt;ref name="AllparOmniHorizon"/&gt;

These were the first of many front-wheel drive Chrysler products to follow, including the [[Plymouth Reliant|Dodge Aries/Plymouth Reliant]] and the initial [[Chrysler minivans]].

==History==
{{see also|Simca-Talbot Horizon}}
The Dodge Omni and the Plymouth Horizon were [[front-wheel drive]], five-door hatchbacks, introduced by the [[Dodge]] and [[Plymouth automobile|Plymouth]] divisions of [[Chrysler]] in [[North America]] in January 1978. The Omni and Horizon were the first front-wheel drive cars produced by Chrysler, and among the first American front-wheel drive cars to sell in large numbers (previous front-wheel drive American cars such as the [[Cord (automobile)|Cord 810]], [[Cadillac Eldorado]], and [[Oldsmobile Toronado]] were low-volume luxury cars).

[[File:Simca Chrysler Horizon GLS 1979.jpg|left|thumb|Chrysler Horizon]]
The Omni and Horizon were developed in parallel with the [[Simca Horizon|Horizon]], a [[subcompact]] car designed by [[Simca]], the [[France|French]] division of [[Chrysler Europe]], and built on the then-new [[Chrysler L platform|L platform]]. This was Chrysler's first and last attempt at a 'world car'. The Simca Horizon survived in various guises under the successor Talbot name until 1987.

Born largely out of the need to replace the aging [[Simca 1100]], the Horizon was essentially a shortened version of the larger [[Chrysler/Simca Alpine|Alpine]], giving the vehicle an unusually wide track for its length. The Horizon, or ''Project C2'' as it was known inside Simca during development, was intended to be a "world car" (designed for consumers on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]), but, in execution, the European and [[North America]]n versions of the vehicle actually turned out to have very little in common.

When Chrysler exited the European car market (and sold assets to [[Peugeot]], which subsequently sold the same car in Europe as the [[Talbot Horizon]]) in 1978, Chrysler retained the North American rights to the car, and began production at [[Belvidere, Illinois|Belvidere]].

[[File:Plymouth-Horizon-1.jpg|thumb|right|Plymouth Horizon]]

Chrysler had previously avoided building a subcompact car, preferring to use [[captive import|branded imports]] like the [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]]-made [[Dodge Colt]] instead. Presented as a significant domestic development, the models were initially priced starting at US$2,500. The Dodge Omni was ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Car of the Year]] for 1978, and the related Talbot Horizon was voted [[European Car of the Year]] in 1979.

The Omni and Horizon appeared at a critical time for Chrysler, when the company was on the brink of bankruptcy and sought government support to survive. In 1978, Chrysler had beaten out Ford and General Motors to the market with a domestically-produced front-wheel drive car to challenge the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1|VW Rabbit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.autos.ca/motoring-memories/motoring-memories-dodge-omniplymouth-horizon-1978-1990/|first=Bill |last=Vance |title=Motoring Memories: Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon, 1978-1990 |publisher=autos canada |date=28 April 2006 |accessdate=12 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the L-bodies miscarried at first, since 1978 was a year of strong sales for larger cars and demand for compacts and subcompacts noticeably shrank. These initial poor sales of the cars contributed to Chrysler's financial woes at the time, but when the company requested federal assistance, the Omni was an important piece of evidence that they were attempting to compete with imports and build small, fuel-efficient cars and might be worth saving. For the three years leading up to the introduction of [[Chrysler K platform|Chrysler's K-cars]], the Omni/Horizon was Chrysler's best selling model line.&lt;ref name=RT82&gt;{{cite journal | ref = 81bg | journal = Road &amp; Track's Road Test Annual &amp; Buyer's Guide 1981 | issue = January–February 1981 | title = 1981 Buyer's Guide | editor-first = Tony | editor-last = Hogg | page = 93 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Omni and Horizon had few interchangeable parts with their European siblings. Aside from the heavier-looking American body panels and bumpers, the [[Overhead valve|OHV]] Simca engines were replaced with unique 1.7&amp;nbsp;L SOHC engines sourced from [[Volkswagen]], while [[MacPherson strut]] front suspension took the place of the [[torsion bar]] arrangement found in the European Horizon. The Volkswagen engine used an enlarged Chrysler-designed [[cylinder head]] and [[intake manifold]] and produced {{convert|75|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|90|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. Originally, only the [[California Air Resources Board|CARB]]-certified version with an air pump and {{convert|70|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} had been available.&lt;ref name=RTbg79&gt;{{citation | ref = RT79 | title = An inside job on the imports | work = Road &amp; Track's Road Test Annual &amp; Buyer's Guide 1979 | date = January–February 1979 | publisher = CBS Publications | location = Greenwich, CT | page = 166 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 power climbed to {{convert|77|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while by 1980 it dropped to {{convert|68|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|83|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque in all fifty states.&lt;ref name=RT79p93&gt;''[[#RT79|R&amp;T Buyer's Guide 1979]]'', p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RT82/&gt;

The climate controls were mounted to the left of the steering wheel rather than in the center stack like in most vehicles, meaning only the driver could adjust the interior temperature. Other Chrysler Corporation products (including the [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Dodge Charger]] and [[Chrysler Cordoba]]), as well as vehicles from other manufacturers came with instrument panels that placed the climate controls in this general location during the 1970s.

Shortly after their introduction, ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' tested the Omni and reported that it lost control in hard maneuvering. As front-wheel-drive cars were still considered a new idea in Detroit, the allegation received extensive mainstream coverage, including a piece in ''[[Time Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,916240,00.html |title=Storm over Omni-Horizon |date=26 June 1978 |journal=Time |accessdate=12 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other auto magazines reported no problems and said the test did not approximate real-world driving conditions.&lt;ref name=RT79p93/&gt; Chrysler made modifications that included a steering damper and a lighter-weight steering wheel.

A special, partially equipped, model with extra high gas mileage also appeared, called the "Miser".&lt;ref name=RT82/&gt; Chrysler's 2.2&amp;nbsp;L [[Chrysler K engine|K-car engine]] appeared for the 1981 model year as an upmarket option to the Volkswagen engine, mated to a new four-speed manual with an overdrive fourth.&lt;ref name=RT82/&gt; It produced {{convert|84|hp|kW|abbr=on}} at first, rising to {{convert|93|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and finally {{convert|96|hp|kW|abbr=on}} by the end of production. The Volkswagen 1.7 was replaced by a [[Simca 1100 engine|Simca]] 1.6&amp;nbsp;L [[Inline-four engine|inline-four]] unit in 1983. This engine produced {{convert|62|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|86|lbft|N.m|abbr=on}}, and was only available with a [[manual transmission]]. The Omni/Horizon received a facelift for the 1984 model year.&lt;ref name=TAM85/&gt;

In 1985, Chrysler entered an agreement with [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]] (AMC) to produce [[Chrysler M platform]] rear-wheel drive cars, as well as Omnis and Horizons, in AMC's [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] plant, because AMC could produce the cars for less money. The 2.2&amp;nbsp;L Chrysler [[Inline-four engine|inline-four cylinder]] was the only available engine from 1987 onwards. By this point, the L-bodies were consolidated into a single-trim "America" line in the interest of improved quality control and reduced costs. Despite the P-body Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance effectively superseding the Omni/Horizon in 1987, the cars were kept in production for another three years since their tooling had been amortized and each one sold turned a profit.

Chrysler invested in a number of significant changes that ended up being used for only one year; the cars gained larger exterior rear-view mirrors (borrowed from the departed [[Chrysler M platform|M-body]] sedans), a driver's side airbag and a mildly redesigned instrument panel, complete with HVAC controls moved to the center. The Omni and the Horizon ended production in 1990, and were replaced by the [[Dodge Shadow]]/[[Plymouth Sundance]], which were both introduced for 1987. It outlived the European version by three years; [[Peugeot]] had bought [[Chrysler Europe|Chrysler's European division]] in 1978 and rebadged the Horizon (along with the rest of the British Chrysler and French Simca range) as [[Talbot]]s, with production lasting until 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootes-chrysler.co.uk/car-development/dev-horizon.html |title=Development of the Chrysler - Talbot - Simca Horizon |publisher=Rootes-chrysler.co.uk |date= |accessdate=12 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And, the Dodge Omni is a super lit car fam.

==Variants==
Several variants of the platform appeared later, including a three-door hatchback known as the [[Dodge 024]]/[[Plymouth TC3]], and briefly a small car-like truck under the [[Dodge Rampage]]/[[Plymouth Scamp]] name.

The 024 and TC3 were marketed as sporty cars, although the {{convert|77|-|94|hp|kW|abbr=on}} four-cylinder engines were not powerful and the coupés weighed more than the hatchbacks.&lt;ref name=RT79p93/&gt; The TC3 was renamed the [[Plymouth Turismo]], and the 024 the [[Dodge Charger (L-body)|Dodge Charger]] in 1983. The last 1,000 Dodge Chargers were modified by [[Carroll Shelby]] into [[Shelby GLHS]]s.

==Omni GLH==
[[File:Dodge Omni GLH 91 race car.jpg|thumb|right|1984-1985 Dodge Omni GLH]]
The ultimate Dodge Omni was the modified '''Omni GLH'''. The original name, "Coyote", was rejected, and Carroll Shelby's choice, the initials GLH, which stood for "Goes Like Hell", were taken instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://editorial.autos.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=434398&amp;topart=sports|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207210250/http://editorial.autos.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=434398&amp;topart=sports|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-12-07|title=Cool Cars We Miss|author=Griffey, Evan|publisher=MSN|year=2007|accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DZiRmOf3e5cC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq=Dodge+Omni+GLH+Goes+Like+Hell |page=196 |title=Dodge and Plymouth Muscle Car 1964-2000 |first=Peter C. |last=Sessler |publisher=Motorbooks |year=2001 |isbn=9780760308011 |accessdate=2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1984 model year was the first year of the GLH, which carried over most of the modifications that had been made the previous year to the [[Dodge Charger (L-body)|Shelby Charger]]. 1985 was the debut of the GLH-T model with the [[Chrysler K engine#2.2 Turbo I|Turbo I (K)]] engine option. This engine, rated at 146hp both years, at low boost (7.2&amp;nbsp;PSi) coupled with the car's very low weight (as low as {{convert|2200|lb|kg|abbr=on}}), earned this car its name. The car carried over into 1986 unchanged aside from the addition of a hatch-mounted third tail light, and production was then stopped.
[[File:'86 Shelby GLHS (Orange Julep '09).jpg|thumb|right|1986 Shelby GLHS]]
The final 500 GLH-T cars (all black) were sold to Shelby, who used them as the basis for the 1986 [[Shelby GLHS]] ("Goes Like Hell Some more").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AG_qCEWfMFsC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;dq=Dodge+Omni+GLH+Goes+Like+Hell |page=209 |title=The Complete Book of Shelby Automobiles |first=Colin |last=Comer T. |publisher=Motorbooks |year=2009 |isbn=9780760335789 |accessdate=2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cars were modified by Carroll Shelby in California and sold as Shelbys. With {{convert|175|hp|kW|0}} and {{convert|175|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque, the Shelby GLHS featured a modified 2.2 L engine with a Turbo II setup, which included a two piece blow-through intake (the GLH-T was a draw-through turbo design), a Shelby ECU, turbo boost raised to a conservative 12 psi, a T2 turbocharger compressor cover, and a front-mounted intercooler. The short block stayed the same between the GLH-T and GLHS. Further modifications included 205/50R15 Eagle GT Gatorback tires mounted on Shelby Centurian wheels, Koni adjustable struts and shocks, and stiffer springs. Different decals were also part of the package; silver pinstripes down the ground effects along with "Shelby" decals replaced the standard red GLH-T decals. A "Shelby" decal was added to the windshield and a large "GLHS" decal was placed on the driver side rear sail panel.  All GLHS cars came with a numbered dashboard plaque, Mobil 1 valve cover plaque, Momo shift knob and Shelby leather-wrapped steering wheel. A black-yellow overlay sticker was placed at the bottom of the speedometer to read to 135&amp;nbsp;mph.

The '''Coronet''' is an [[automobile]] that was marketed by [[Dodge]] as a [[full-size car]] in the 1950s, initially the division's highest trim line but&lt;ref&gt;https://www.allpar.com/cars/dodge/coronet.html&lt;/ref&gt;, starting in 1955, the lowest [[Trim levels|trim line]]. From the 1965 to 1975 [[model year]]s the name was on [[Mid-size car|intermediate-sized]] models. A ''[[coronet]]'' is a small [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] consisting of ornaments fixed on a metal ring.

===1949===
The Dodge Coronet was introduced with the division's first postwar body styles. Lower trim lines were the [[Dodge Wayfarer|Wayfarer]] and Meadowbrook, with the Wayfarer being built on a shorter 115&amp;nbsp;inch wheelbase.&lt;ref name=Godshall77&gt;{{cite journal |ref=AQ181 |journal=Automobile Quarterly |volume=XVIII |issue=1 |year=1980 |title=Wayward Wayfarer: The story of a Dodge |first=Jeffrey I. |last=Godshall |issn=0005-1438 |page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only engine for Dodge was a {{convert|230|cuin|cc|adj=on}} flat-head [[Straight-six engine|straight six cylinder]] engine with a single barrel [[Zenith Carburettor Company (British)|Stromberg carburetor]], producing {{convert|103|hp|0|abbr=on}} (gross). The stock Dodge Coronet was a smooth running car, and the six-cylinder engine could power the car to {{convert|90|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}+ . A limited production model was a four-door, eight-passenger limousine, an extended version of the stock Dodge Coronet.&lt;ref name=Godshall77/&gt; One of the most notable features of the first-generation Coronet was a three-speed, fluid-driven transmission that was operated by a foot pedal on the floor. It required no shifter. It had full instrumentation and 37 inches of head room both front and rear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1949_Dodge/1949_Dodge_D29-D30_Manual/1949%20Dodge%20D29%20%20amp%20%20D30%20Manual-07.html |title=1949 Dodge D29 D30 manual |page=4 |website=Old Car Brochures.com |date= |accessdate=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1949_Dodge/1949%20Dodge-2/image2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950===
[[File:1950 Dodge Coronet.jpg|thumb|left|1950 Dodge Coronet]]
Dodge received a facelift for 1950 but like the 1949 models were still divided into Wayfarer, Meadowbrook and Coronet lines. The 1950 models can be identified easily by the new grille design which featured 3 heavy horizontal bars. The upper and lower bars formed a stylish oblong shape. Within this oblong grille was a thick center bar with parking lights on each end and a large chrome plaque in the center bearing the Dodge crest. The 8-passenger sedan's length was 216.8 inches.&lt;ref name="Flory, Jr. 2008"/&gt;

===1951–1952===

[[File:1952 Dodge (35539748906).jpg|thumb|left|1952 Dodge Coronet Club Coupe]]
Dodge received yet another facelift in 1951 but this time the cars remained virtually unchanged for two model years. Busy manufacturing military vehicles for use in Korea, they chose not to dedicate valuable resources to completely redesign civilian vehicles. Still divided into Wayfarer, Meadowbrook and Coronet lines through 1952, by 1953 the Wayfarer line had been discontinued. The grille of the 1951 model was similar in shape to the 1950 grille, but with the elimination of the thick vertical center bar and the addition of six vents running horizontally between the top and center bars, a whole new look was achieved. The Coronet Diplomat was Dodge's first hardtop-convertible, featuring a pillarless steel roof styled after the contemporary Chrysler Newport. The speedometer was now circular, and the other four gauges were rectangles.&lt;ref name="Flory, Jr. 2008"/&gt; For 1952 the Coronet had a painted lower grille louver.

}}

===1953===
For 1953, the Coronet was totally redesigned.&lt;ref name="Flory, Jr. 2008"/&gt; It gained an optional {{convert|241|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} "Red Ram"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1954_Dodge/1954_Dodge_Brochure/1954%20Dodge-12.html |title=1954 Dodge brochure |page=12 |website=Old Car Brochures.com |date= |accessdate=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chrysler Hemi engine|Hemi]] Engine and set over 100 land speed records at the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.allpar.com/cars/dodge/coronet.html&lt;/ref&gt; The windshield finally became one-piece.&lt;ref name="Flory, Jr. 2008"/&gt; Electric windshield wipers were standard, while the radio cost $83.&lt;ref name="Flory, Jr. 2008"/&gt;

===1954===
The [[Dodge Royal]] line was added above the Coronet in 1954. Dodge was putting more luxury into all of its models which included the [[Dodge Meadowbrook|Meadowbrook]], Coronet and new Royal lines. Still, styling changes for 1954 were modest. The chrome molding on the hood lip was wider than on the 1953 models and a large chrome upright in the center of the grille replaced the five vertical dividers used previously. It still came with full instrumentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1954_Dodge/1954_Dodge_Owners_Manual/1954%20Dodge%20Owners%20Manual-06-07.html |title=1954 Dodge Owners Manual |website=Old Car Brochures.com |date= |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
1954 saw Chrysler's first fully automatic transmission, two-speed [[PowerFlite]], offered as an extra-cost option on all Dodges.

==Third generation (1955–1956)==
:''See also [[1955 Dodge]]''
[[File:1956 Dodge Coronet D63 V8 four-door sedan, front left (Hershey 2019).jpg|thumb|1956 Dodge Coronet 4-door sedan]] 
[[File:Dodge Coronet 1955.jpg|thumb|1956 Dodge Coronet coupe]]
The 1955 Coronet dropped to the lower end of the Dodge vehicle lineup, with the Wayfarer and Meadowbrook names no longer used and the [[Dodge Custom Royal|Custom Royal]] added above the [[Dodge Royal|Royal]], [[Dodge Lancer|Lancer]], and [[Dodge La Femme|La Femme]]. Bodies were restyled with help from newly hired [[Virgil Exner]] to be lower, wider, and longer than the lumpy prewar style, which in turn generated a healthy boost in sales over 1954. Power came from either a {{convert|230|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler Flathead engine]] [[straight-6]], now producing {{convert|123|hp|abbr=on}} 
Two V8 engines were offered: {{convert|270|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Polyspheric]] (poly or semi-hemi) heads producing {{convert|175|hp|abbr=on}} and a {{convert|315|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} (the "[[Chrysler Hemi Engine|Hemi]]")

Power windows were new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1955_Dodge/1955_Dodge_Brochure/1955%20Dodge-06.html |title=1955 Dodge brochure |website=Old Car Brochures.com |date= |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wheelbase was 120 inches. They were 212.1 inches long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1955_Dodge/1955_Dodge_Brochure/1955%20Dodge-07.html |title=1955 Dodge brochure |page=7 |website=Old Car Brochures.com |date= |accessdate=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of trim lines were available:
*2- or 4-door [[station wagon]] — The Coronet wagon used the '''Suburban''' name and had the V8 or six
*[[hardtop]] [[coupé]] — The V8 [[Dodge Lancer|Coronet Lancer]]
*2- or 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] — V8 or Six
*2-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] — V8 or Six
*4-door, eight-passenger limousine

1956 (:''See also [[Plymouth Fury]]'') was the last year of this body style before the change in 1957, the only differences offered in 1956 from the previous year were trim packages and the new [[1955 Dodge#D-500|Dodge D-500]]. The D-500 was the first Dodge factory high performance made in honor of the (D-500-1) "Super Stock" model with the only external clues being discreet crossed checkered flags and "500" lettering on its hood and lower rear deck it was also available for order from the dealer on Coronet models, including station wagons and two-door sedans. The standard D-500 trim included a {{convert|315|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with hemispherical heads (unlike other Dodge V8s ( [[List of Chrysler engines]]) which used [[Polyspheric]] heads), a unique [[camshaft]], valve lifters, pushrods, [[carburetor]], ignition, and pistons. With a compression ratio of 9.25:1, four-barrel Carter WCFB carburetor, and dual-point distribution, peak horsepower was {{convert|260|bhp|abbr=on}} while torque was a solid {{convert|330|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}}. The D-500 also received an upgraded suspension with stiff front coil springs; heavy duty Oriflow shock absorbers, with the same valving specified for Dodge police cars, were mounted in the springs. Similar units were used in the rear. Overall height of the D-500 was {{convert|1.5|in|mm}} lower than its standard Dodge counterpart. The D-500 came standard with 15x5.5&amp;nbsp;inch wheels with 7.60x15 inch tubeless tires. New for safety were safety door locks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1956_Dodge/1956_Dodge_Full_Line_Folder/1956%20Dodge%20Full%20Line%20Folder-07.html |title=1956 Dodge full line folder |website=Old Car Brochures.com |date= |accessdate=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The D-500-1 (the first 500 made required by NASCAR, was intended for NASCAR competition. The D-500-1 had an even stiffer suspension than the D-500. Under the hood, the engine received larger valves (about 18% larger), a full-race camshaft, and a double log intake [[manifold]] that used two four-barrel Carter WCFB carburetors and a shaved deck for 8.25:1 compression. This all added up to {{convert|285|bhp|abbr=on}}. It was the fastest car that year from the factory.

==Fourth generation (1957–1959)==

[[File:1958 Dodge Coronet (14364512010).jpg|thumb|1958 Dodge Coronet sedan]]
[[File:Dodge Coronet.jpg|thumb|1959 Dodge Coronet coupe]]
The 1957 model year debuted a new D-501, which replaced the D-500 from the year before as the top Coronet. The D-501 received Chrysler's proven {{convert|354|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Hemi V8, which were actually left over engines from the 1956 Chrysler 300B production. Camshafts from the 1957 Chrysler 392 cid engines were installed in the 354 V8s. A pair of Carter four barrel carburetors fed the 10.0:1 compression ratio to produce {{convert|340|bhp|abbr=on}}. Other changes included the addition of the Torsion-Aire Ride (torsion bar) front suspension&lt;ref name="Flory, Jr. 2008"/&gt; and a heavy duty suspension with heavy duty shock absorbers and a heavy duty leaf sprung rear. A 3.73:1 rear axle was standard with the three-speed manual transmission, but [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] cars received a 3.18:1 rear axle. There were 13 optional rear axles available, ranging from 2.92:1 through 6.17:1. The D-501 received 7.60x15 tires on 15x8 inch wheels. Brakes were {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} diameter drums. Only 101 D-501s were produced. A padded dash was optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1957_Dodge/1957_Dodge_Brochure/1957%20Dodge-08-09.html |title=1957 Dodge brochure |website=Old Car Brochures.com |date= |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the September 1957 issue of [[Popular Mechanics]], owners of both the Coronet six-cylinder and eight-cylinder were surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Popular Mechanics |date=September 1957 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DeEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=Dodge+coronet&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwici9vW-8LgAhVs3IMKHTeZDLcQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Dodge%20coronet&amp;f=false |accessdate=17 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people (37.6% of I6 owners and 34.8% of V8 owners) complained that there were too many water leaks. When PM tested a V8 Coronet for water resistance, water got into the engine and pooled in "two spark plug wells" which had to be siphoned out before the engine could run with all cylinders again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Popular Mechanics |date=September 1957 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DeEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=Dodge+coronet&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwici9vW-8LgAhVs3IMKHTeZDLcQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Dodge%20coronet&amp;f=false |accessdate=17 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many did like the exterior styling and the ride comfort. 0-60mph on 90 octane gasoline was 12.3 seconds.

The 1958 and 1959 Coronet, Royal, and Custom Royal used a [[DeSoto Fireflite]] chassis but had less ornate trim. Power came from the {{convert|230|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler Flathead engine|"Getaway" L-head]] [[straight-6]] or the {{convert|325|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler FirePower engine#326|"Red Ram"]] V8. In 1959 a Silver Challenger model was also offered on the Coronet line. This was a six-cylinder or V-8 model available only in silver paint and only on a two-door body. It came with many extra features at no cost, such as wall-to-wall deep pile carpeting, premium white wall tires and wheel covers, luxury fabrics and upgraded interior and electric windshield wipers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/files/1959_0603_dodge.jpg |title=1959 Dodge |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=March 23, 2011}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall length was inctreased to 217.4 inches.&lt;ref name="Flory, Jr. 2008"/&gt;

The Dodge Custom Royal was also assembled by [[Chrysler Australia]] from early 1958 to 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Great ideas in motion: Chrysler's Australian history 1946–1981 |first=Gavin |last=Farmer |location=Bridgewater, South Australia |publisher=Ilinga Books |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-98052-291-4 |page=74 &amp; 412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Dodge Coronet was the only known example of the [[JATO Rocket Car]] legend. To publicize Dodge's 'total contact' front dual-leading shoe drum brakes a [[JATO]] unit was fitted to a 1958 Coronet and driven at speed across the [[El Mirage Lake|El Mirage dry lake]]. This TV advertisement was broadcast during Dodge-sponsored [[Lawrence Welk Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|ZGEjFh-GCUo|title=Dodge presents The Lawrence Welk Show}}, segment begins at 30:00&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coronet reappeared for the 1965 model year as the intermediate sized B-body using a 117-inch wheelbase, continuing what had been the [[Dodge Polara]], which was once again full-size. For 1965, Dodge sold slightly over 209,000 units, making the Coronet the most popular model sold by Dodge that year. Trim levels initially were base Coronet including a Deluxe version, Coronet 440 and Coronet 500.

The base Coronet and Deluxe were available as two-door sedans, four-door sedans and station wagons. For 1965 only, Dodge also sold only 101 units of a modified wheelbase version of the base Coronet two-door sedan and 440 hardtop used for NHRA drag racing. The model known as A990 came with a racing version of the 426 Hemi engine. The car A990 was stripped of all features and included lightweight base bucket seats from Dodge's [[Dodge A100|A100 truck/van]] line of vehicles. These altered wheelbase vehicles eventually became popularly known as "[[Funny car|funny cars]]" due to their unique wheel spacing. The front and rear axles were moved forward significantly from the stock location, putting the front wheels directly behind the front fender, and the rear wheels almost under where the rear seat would normally go; this alteration transferred weight to the rear tires, increasing traction on launch. From the popular term "funny cars" was born [[Funny Car|an entire genre of racing vehicles]], which exists to this day (albeit in much transformed form).  Front seat belts and padded dash were standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dusan |last=Ristic-Petrovic |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/new/171110/1965%20Dodge%20Full%20Line/1965%20Dodge%20Full%20Line-13.html |title=1965 Dodge full line |page=13 |website=Old Car Brochures.com |date= |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The middle of the Coronet line-up was the 440 and was available as a two-door hardtop, convertible or station wagon. The 440 designation did not indicate engine displacement as commonly assumed (both then and now, which helped sales to an extent). The nomenclature was a carryover theme from the [[Dodge Polara#1962–1964|1963–64 Polara]] series.
The top of the Coronet line-up was the Coronet 500 and was available only as a two-door hardtop or convertible in 1965. Slightly over 33,300 units were sold in 1965 and included as standard, a V8 engine (273 cubic inches), exterior trim and badging, bucket seats, padded dash and chrome floor console. Coronets were manufactured at Chrysler's Los Angeles assembly plant and at Lynch Road assembly plant in Detroit and ST. Louis plant in Missouri. Engines offered for 1965 included the base 225 Slant-Six, 273, 318 (Polyhead), 361 (the last year for this big block engine was 1966), 383 and 426 in multiple HP choices ( the 383 came in a special version rated at 330 HP). Sales brochures list the 413 (its last year offered) as available, but no records exist of this engine, commonly used in [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperials]], being installed in Coronets for 1965.&lt;ref&gt;''Collectible Automobile'', April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A tachometer was optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1966_Dodge/1966_Dodge_Brochure/1966%20Dodge-15.html |title=1966 Dodge brochure |website=Old Car Brochures.com |date= |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 a four-door Coronet 500 was added, called the Coronet 500 SE (Special Edition). It had special "SE" logos on the C-pillars and on the seat back.&lt;ref name=originalmuscle&gt;{{cite book |title=Original Dodge and Plymouth B-Body Muscle 1966-1970 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SUfwxG5O-uAC&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |first=Jim |last=Schild |isbn=978-0-76031-860-7 |publisher=MotorBooks International |year=2004 |page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; There would be no Coronet 500 wagon until 1968. Coronet received a redesign in 1966, and a facelift in 1967. Trim levels initially were base Coronet, Coronet 440 and Coronet 500. In 1966, the Coronet Deluxe was introduced, fitting between the base Coronet and the Coronet 440. The Coronet R/T was introduced in 1967.

The Coronet R/T was available as a two-door hardtop or convertible. Standard engine was Chrysler's largest, the 440-cid V-8, it was tweaked to 375&amp;nbsp;bhp and christened the Magnum. The only engine option was the 426-cid Hemi, now in its second year in "Street" trim and again rated at 425&amp;nbsp;bhp. It added $908. Transmission choices were Mopar's excellent heavy-duty three-speed TorqueFlite automatic or a four-speed manual.

When the 426ci Hemi was made available to the general public for the 1966 model year, it could be ordered in any Coronet model or trim level. No Hemi-powered Coronet wagons have been verified, but a few Coronet Deluxe four-door sedans are known to exist. A total of just 136 Coronet 500 Street Hemis were built for 1966.&lt;ref&gt;''Hot Rod'', 7/90, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1967, Chrysler decided that the Hemi should be available only in their badged muscle cars: the Dodge Charger and Coronet R/T and the Plymouth Belvedere GTX. The top engine option for the rest of the Coronet line was supposed to be the 383-ci, 4-barrel V8. Despite this, some Hemi-powered 1967 Coronet Deluxe two-door sedans were produced. There is also one Hemi-powered 1967 Coronet 440 two-door hardtop known{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, and One Hemi-powered 1967 Coronet 500 two-door hardtop known, which is not among the 55 WO23 Super Stock cars produced for Dodge drag racers.

===1968–1970===
The Coronet and similar [[Plymouth Belvedere]] received complete redesigns in 1968, as did the [[Dodge Charger]], which shared the B-body platform. There was a mild facelift in 1970. Trim levels initially included the base Coronet, Coronet Deluxe, Coronet 440, Coronet 500 and Coronet [[R/T]]. The Coronet Super Bee was introduced in early 1968 as a companion to the [[Plymouth Road Runner]]. In keeping with Dodge's position as a step above Plymouth, the Super Bee shared the Charger's Rallye instrument cluster and the Coronet 440's rear finish panel.

As in 1967, the 440ci RB V8 was only available in the Coronet R/T in 1968. The 426ci Hemi V8 was supposed to be limited to the R/T and Super Bee, but two 1968 Coronet 440s are known to have been built with this engine.

In mid-1969, the A12 package was introduced on the Super Bee. It included a {{convert|390|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version of the 440 with three 2bbl Holley carburetors on an aluminum intake manifold, a black fiberglass lift-off hood secured with metal pins, heavy-duty suspension and 15" steel wheels with no hubcaps or wheel covers. The hood had an integrated forward-facing scoop which sealed to the air cleaner assembly and bore a decal on each side with the words "SIX PACK" in red letters, "Six Pack" being the name used for the 6-bbl induction setup when installed on a Dodge (Plymouth went with "440 6bbl" on the A12 Road Runners). The A12 Super Bee could be had with most Super Bee options, with the exception of air conditioning and tire-wheel packages. The A12 option was a 1969-only package, but the 440 6bbl returned in 1970 as an optional engine on both the Super Bee and the Coronet R/T.

The base Coronet and Deluxe were available as 2-door coupes, 4-door sedans or station wagons. The base Coronet was dropped in 1969, leaving the Deluxe as the lowest trim level through 1970. The Coronet 440 convertible was dropped for 1968, but a 2-door coupe was added along with the 2-door hardtop, 4-door sedan and station wagon. This would remain the lineup through 1970. Coronet 500 retained its 2-door hardtop, convertible and 4-door sedan through 1970. A Coronet 500 station wagon made its debut in 1968, continuing through 1970. [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|Simulated woodgrain]] trim was standard on the Coronet 500 wagon.

The Coronet R/T 2-door hardtop and convertible continued through 1970.

The Super Bee was only available as a 2-door coupe or 2-door hardtop. Chrysler did display a convertible with Super Bee stripes at car shows in 1968, but never offered it as a production model. Some enthusiasts have created "phantom" Super Bee convertibles by adding the appropriate trim and stripes to Coronet 500 convertibles.

The [[Dodge Super Bee]] was a limited production muscle car from Dodge division produced from 1968–1971. The original Super Bee was based on the Dodge Coronet, a 2-door model only and was produced from 1968–1970. It was Dodge’s low-priced muscle car, the equivalent to Plymouth Road Runner, and was priced at $3,027. Available with Hemi engine, this option increased the price by 33% so only 125 models were sold with this engine option. The Super Bee included a heavy-duty suspension, an optional Mopar A-833 four-speed [[manual transmission]], with high performance tires, and a stripe (with the bee logo) wrapped around the tail. The name "Super Bee" was derived from the "B" Body designation given Chrysler's midsized cars which included the Coronet.

A “six-pack” (three two-barrel carburetors) version of the 440 engine was added to the list mid-year. This engine was between the standard engine and the Hemi as a $463 option. The 1969 model year gave customers several engines to choose from, the base 383&amp;nbsp;hp (high performance), 440 six pack, and the 426 Hemi [[V8 engine|V8]]. The 440 Magnum (4bbl) was not available as an option, it was reserved for the Coronet R/T.

In 1970, the Super Bee was given a different front end look that consisted of a dual ovaled grill that was referred to as “bumble bee wings”. Despite the new looks, the engines, as well as the “ramcharger” hood (that carried over from 1969 model), sales plummeted for the 1970 model. In 1970, Dodge also produced four Super Bee convertibles; the whereabouts of the four cars are unknown.

The new Coronet was a twin of the four-door Plymouth Satellite and featured more flowing styling. It was offered only as a sedan and wagon, the related and also restyled [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Dodge Charger]] covering the coupe market. Slight alterations of the front grille, headlights, and taillights followed in 1972. Sales of the Coronet were fairly low from this point onwards, with around 80–90,000 produced each year through 1973 (compared with 196,242 as recently as 1968), due both to the fuel crisis and to a proliferation of Dodge and Plymouth models, and the growing effect of overlap with the other Chrysler Corporation brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allpar.com/cars/dodge/coronet.html |title=Dodge Coronet cars |work=Allpar.com |accessdate=February 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the usual changes in grille, lights, and interior, Dodge introduced its "TorsionQuiet" system of additional silencers and rubber vibration insulators, providing a much smoother ride and a quieter interior.
[[File:Dodge Coronet Custom Sedan 1974 (14551262156).jpg|thumb|left|1974 Dodge Coronet Custom sedan]]
The front and rear fascias were redesigned, most notably the rear bumper, which met the 1974 DOT requirements. The sedan bodystyle would be the basis of the later Coronets (and its twin, the [[Plymouth Fury]]) until the 1978 model year.

===1975===
In 1975, the cars received a refreshening with the body appearing squarer and after a four model year absence since the close of the 1970 model year, the Dodge Coronet 2-door model returned for just the 1975 model year only, it also would share a lot in common with the [[Dodge Charger]] Sport 2-door model, which would appear for just the following model year only. The front fascia was redesigned with two round dual beam headlights, which was shared with its then-concurrent [[Plymouth Fury]] counterpart.

===1976===
1976 was the final model year for the Dodge Coronet, at least so far as the name Coronet went, also its body style choices were relegated to just only two four-door models, the four-door wagon and the four-door sedan. The former Dodge Coronet 2-door model, which appeared for just the previous model year only was replaced by the [[Dodge Charger]] Sport 2-door model, which, itself, appeared for only one model year. During the next model year (1977), the mid-size Dodge Coronet would be renamed [[Dodge Monaco|Monaco]], which would be given stacked rectangular headlights and other minor cosmetic changes, that would provide a prompt sales boost, also, during that same model year, the full-size Dodge Monaco would be renamed Dodge Royal Monaco, which would appear for just one model year only and after that, both Dodge and Plymouth (which would include Dodge Royal Monaco's entire Plymouth Gran Fury counterpart line up as well) would discontinue all production of any more full-size models. During the following model year (1978), the mid-size Dodge Monaco (which would include its entire Plymouth Fury counterpart line up as well) would make its final appearance (for all during the remainder of the 1970s).

}}The '''Dodge Monaco''' is an automobile that was marketed by the [[Dodge]] division of [[Chrysler Corporation]]. Introduced as the flagship of the Dodge product line, the Monaco was introduced for 1965 to replace the Custom 880, later superseding the Polara model line. During its production, the Monaco was offered in multiple body configurations, including two-door and four-door hardtop sedans, four-door sedans, two-door convertibles, and station wagons.

From 1965 to 1977, three generations of the Monaco were produced with the full-size [[Chrysler C platform]]. For 1977 and 1978, Dodge shifted the Monaco to the intermediate [[Chrysler B platform]], effectively [[Downsize (automobile)|downsizing]] the model line. For 1979, the model line was redesigned and renamed the [[Dodge St. Regis]].

After a 12-year hiatus, the full-size Monaco was revived for 1990 as the flagship Dodge sedan, replacing the Diplomat. A rebadged version of the [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]]-developed [[Eagle Premier]], the Monaco was replaced by the [[Dodge Intrepid]] for 1993.

===1965===
On introduction on September 25, 1964, for the 1965 model year, the Dodge Monaco was intended to compete with the [[Pontiac Grand Prix]] in what came to be known as the [[Personal luxury car|personal luxury]] market, but ended up filling in for Dodge in the full-size, luxury line instead.&lt;ref&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975, Revised 4th Edition, page 350.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1965 Monaco was based on the [[Dodge Custom 880|Custom 880]] two-door hardtop body. The Monaco received special badging, different taillight and grille treatment, and a sportier interior with a full-length center console, as well as a {{convert|383|cuin|L|abbr=on}} {{convert|325|hp|abbr=on}} V8 engine as standard equipment. Larger, more powerful engines were also available as options. The Monaco competed with the Ford LTD, a top-of-the-line model in the Galaxie 500 series, the Caprice package for the Impala Sport Sedan, as well as the 1966 Plymouth VIP model for its Fury series and the [[AMC Ambassador|Ambassador]] DPL offered by [[American Motors]]. These models provided competition for mid-priced sedans like Chrysler, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Mercury.

In Canada, a version of the [[Plymouth Fury#1962%E2%80%931964|Plymouth Sport Fury]] was marketed as the Dodge Monaco.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} It was available in hardtop coupe or convertible body styles. The Canadian Monacos were equipped with Plymouth [[dashboards]] in 1965 and 1966.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} Unlike the U.S. Monaco versions, the Canadian Monaco were available with a {{convert|318|cuin|L|abbr=on}} V8 or the [[Chrysler Slant 6 engine|slant six]].

===1966===
For 1966, in the U.S., the Monaco replaced the Custom 880 series and the former Monaco became the Monaco 500. The basic Monaco was available in hardtop coupe, four-door (pillarless) hardtop sedan, conventional four-door (pillared) [[Sedan (car)|sedan]], and four-door [[station wagon]] bodystyles. In the U.S., the Monaco 500 was available only as a [[hardtop]] [[coupe]]. Although there was no convertible in the 1966 U.S. Monaco range, there was in the 1966 Canadian Monaco lineup. The Canadian Dodge hung onto the "Monaco" name for the Sport Fury equivalent and Polara 880 for the Fury III competitor.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===1967===
For 1967, all full-sized Dodges, the Monaco included, received a significant facelift with all-new exterior sheet metal.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} Chief designer [[Elwood Engel]]'s work featured generally flat body planes with sharp-edged accent lines. The hardtop coupes got a new semi-fastback roofline with a reverse-slanted trailing edge on the rear quarter window.

In Canada, the Monaco name was applied for 1967 to all of the premium full-sized Dodge cars, replacing the [[Dodge Custom 880|Polara 880]] at the top of the Dodge line. Taking the Monaco's place as a premium full-size model was the Monaco 500, which was available only as a two-door hardtop and convertible.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===1968===
Changes were minimal for 1968. The Monaco 500 was dropped at the end of the 1968 model year in the United States and at the end of the 1970 model year in Canada.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;gallery widths="200px" heights="150px"&gt;

===1969===
[[File:1969_Dodge_Monaco_500_HT,_blue.jpg|left|thumb|1969 Monaco 500 2-door Hardtop, equipped with the optional Super-Lite projector road lamp.]]
For the 1969 model year, the wheelbase of the Monaco was increased from 121 inches to 122 inches, and the length was increased to about 220 inches. Returning for 1969 was the "500" option, which in the U.S. market gave the Monaco front bucket seats and a center armrest. In Canada, the Monaco 500 was a separate series that used the side trim of the Polara 500 sold in the U.S. Canadians could also buy a Monaco convertible; U.S. Dodge full-size convertible shoppers had only the lower-end Polara and Polara 500 to choose from.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

All full-sized Dodge cars including the Monaco adopted Chrysler Corporation's new "fuselage" styling, in which the upper and lower body are melded into a uniformly curved unit. Curved side glass adds to the effect, as does the deletion of the "shoulder" along the rear. The look starts in the front of the car, with a nearly straight-across bumper—demanded by a Chrysler executive after a Congressional committee attacked him over the seeming inability of car bumpers to protect cars from extensive damage in low-speed collisions{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}—and a five-segment eggcrate grille that surrounds the headlamps. When the cars failed to spark buyers' interest, Dodge executives demanded a change.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} By the summer of 1969, the division released new chrome trim for the front fender caps and leading edge of the hood as an option, which gives the appearance of a then-fashionable loop bumper without the tooling expense.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} At the rear, Dodge's signature delta-shaped taillamps were presented in a new form that required the top of the bumper to slope downward toward each end.

The standard-equipment engine on the 1969 Monaco is Chrysler's {{convert|245|hp|adj=on}} [[Chrysler B engine#383|B-block {{convert|383|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] V8 engine with a two-barrel 2245 Holley [[carburetor]]. Buyers could order the 383 with a four-barrel carburetor that increased power to {{convert|330|hp|abbr=on}}, or they could opt for the {{convert|375|hp|adj=on}} {{convert|440|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Magnum RB-block engine. Wagon buyers choosing the 440 got a {{convert|350|hp}} version.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The 1969 Monaco offered, as a $50 option,{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} the first modern [[Headlight#Projector (polyellipsoidal) lamps|polyellipsoidal (projector) automotive road lamp]]. Called "Super-Lite" and mounted in the driver's side of the grille, this auxiliary headlamp was produced in a joint venture between [[Chrysler Corporation]] and [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]]. It uses an 85 watt halogen bulb and was intended as a mid-beam, to extend the reach of the low beams during turnpike travel when low beams alone were inadequate but high beams would produce excessive glare to oncoming drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dastern.torque.net/lampics/1969DodgeSuperLite.pdf|title=Chrysler/Sylvania Super-Lite turnpike beam|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vLUmAzlF?url=http://dastern.torque.net/lampics/1969DodgeSuperLite.pdf|archivedate=2010-12-29|url-status=dead}}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(8.60&amp;nbsp;MB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Available models for 1969 included a two-door hardtop coupe, four-door hardtop sedan, four-door pillared sedan, and four-door station wagons with six- or nine-passenger capacity. A new Brougham option package included a vinyl roof on sedans and hardtops and a split-bench front seat with a reclining mechanism on the passenger side (except on the two-door hardtops). Monaco wagons received woodgrained vinyl trim along their sides and across the dual-action (side- and bottom-hinged) tailgate.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Sales of the Polara and Monaco were down by nearly 20,000 cars compared with 1968, with the Monaco line accounting for 38,566 of the 127,252 full-size cars made by Dodge for the year.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===1970===
[[File:1970 Dodge Monaco 500 4 doors.jpg|thumb|left|1970 Dodge Monaco 500 4 doors]]
The 1970 models got completely new front and rear styling that included expensive-to-make{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} loop bumpers front and rear. In the front, the new bumper enclosed a new diecast grille and the headlamps. At the rear, the double-loop bumper enclosed the taillamps. [[Automotive lighting|Reversing lamps]] were moved up into the endcaps that terminated the quarter panels, in slotted body-color housings. The designers chose to emphasize the length of the hood this year, which meant that the redesigned front end grew by three inches. However, the new rear end was four inches (102&amp;nbsp;mm) shorter. {{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Improvements to the suspension were promoted as the new "Torsion-Quiet" system, which used strategically placed rubber isolators to reduce road noise and vibrations. The rear wheel track was broadened by nearly three inches as Dodge installed the rear axle that had been used only on Wagons on all 1970 Monaco models.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The Brougham and 500 option packages continued, as did the availability of the Super-Lite, but the 440 Magnum V8 was dropped. The {{convert|350|hp}} version 440, available only in wagons for 1969, became the new top engine for all Monacos. Despite all of the changes, which cost Chrysler a rather large sum of money,{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} Monaco (and Polara) sales declined with 24,692 Monacos built for the model year.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}


===1971===
[[File:71_Dodge_Monaco_station_wagon,_rear_right_(G._Gjerdingen).jpg|thumb|left|1971 Dodge Monaco Station Wagon, rear view showing the new woodgrain trim application]]
The 1971 Monaco received a facelift featuring a new grille within the bumper that had been used the previous year, and other minor styling changes that were focused mainly at the rear. The Super-Lite was no longer available because of a lack of consumer interest and challenges to its legality in some states.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} A new single-loop rear bumper and larger taillamps were installed.

The 500 option package was deleted although a stereo cassette player-recorder with microphone was new on the option list. Bucket seats remained available despite the loss of the 500 package, and the Brougham package was also still available for $220, despite the addition of a separate Polara Brougham series.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

All engines had their [[compression ratio]] reduced so they could all run satisfactorily on regular-grade gasoline. The two-barrel 383 versions still has the same power rating {{convert|245|hp|abbr=on}}, the four-barrel 383 dropped to {{convert|290|hp|abbr=on}}, and the 440 dropped to {{convert|320|hp|abbr=on}}.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Monaco station wagons, which in 1969 and 1970 had worn their woodgrain trim on the lower bodysides, got completely new woodgrain up high on the sides, even around the windows. The new vinyl decals were translucent, allowing some of the paint color to show through.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Despite the power losses and mild styling change, sales slightly rose. About 900 more Monacos were built for 1971 (approximately 25,544 — an exact number is not known){{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}.

===1972===
[[File:Mopar National img 0031 (34980479182).jpg|thumb|left|1972 Dodge Monaco 2-Door Hardtop]]
For the 1972 model year, the full-sized Dodges finally got the all-new sheetmetal that had originally been planned for 1971.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Setting off the new look for the Monaco was a new front end with [[hidden headlamps]] set above a completely new bumper-grille assembly. The sides of the car lost their previous plump appearance in favor of a new, lean look with a new feature line that started on the front fenders and ran back through the doors, kicking up ahead of the rear wheels. Sedan and hardtop rooflines were new and more formal-looking. At the rear, there was yet another new loop bumper and full-width taillamp which, like the rest of the car, looked much more expensive and impressive.{{according to whom|according to anyone that has seen one date=August 2014|date=June 2016}} Station wagons received a new rear appearance with "stacked" vertical taillamps.

The Monaco got a smaller standard V8 for 1972. The {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler LA engine|LA-block]] V8 engine, which had been introduced in 1971 as an option on Polaras, developed {{convert|210|hp}}, now measured as [[Horsepower#Society of Automotive Engineers/SAE International|net instead of gross]]. Still the 400 was a new created V8 B engine {{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} B-block V8. The 440 remained available, but it now produced {{convert|275|hp}} (net). 1972 sales nearly matched 1969 levels, with 37,013 built for the model year.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}
{{-}}
===1973===
For its last year in the fuselage body, the Monaco continued with its 1972 styling, except for another new rear bumper with redesigned taillamps, along with a new decklid and rear-quarter endcaps. Large black rubber guards were added to the bumpers to comply with new Federal [[Bumper (automobile)#United States|five-mile-per-hour impact standards]]. Hardtop and sedan models gained about {{convert|6.5|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} due mostly to the bumper guards.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Inside, new fire-retardant materials in virtually every visible part of the interior meant added safety.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} Under the hood, all three available engines gained reliability with the addition of Chrysler's new electronic ignition system as standard equipment, which extended [[spark plug]] life and virtually eliminated periodic ignition system maintenance.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Despite the cars' improvements, sales dropped again to 29,396.

1973 proved to be the Monaco's final year as Dodge's top-of-the-line full-size car. After 14 years, the Polara name was dropped and, for 1974, all big Dodges carried the Monaco name.

===South Africa===
In July 1969, Chrysler South Africa introduced a rebadged locally built version of the Dodge Monaco as the '''Chrysler 383'''. This badge remained in use for about four years, being dropped in early 1973. This was the first time that they had used the "Chrysler" badge on a locally built product in ten years. It was also one of the biggest cars built there, and had the biggest engine as well.&lt;ref name="mm9692"&gt;{{cite journal|date=September 1969|editor-last=Emslie|editor-first=Robin|title=New Cars: Chrysler 383|journal=Motoring Mirror|location=Cape Town, South Africa|publisher=Motorpress|volume=7|page=29|ref=mm969|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 383&amp;nbsp;ci V8 offered {{convert|290|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, and the fully equipped car featured power windows and a standard vinyl roof.&lt;ref name="mm9692" /&gt;{{clear}}

===1974===
[[File:1974_Dodge_Monaco_Brougham_2-dr_Hardtop,_rear_right.jpg|left|thumb|1974 Dodge Monaco Brougham two-door hardtop]]
The full-size C-body 1974 Dodge Monaco was completely redesigned for the 1974 model year with an all-new unibody platform and all-new sheet metal. However, within days of their introduction, the [[1973 oil crisis]] began. Chrysler was excoriated in the media for bringing out huge new cars, and sales suffered accordingly. Many in the automotive press also criticized the car's new design as being too derivative of what they thought resembled a 3-year-old [[Buick]] or [[Oldsmobile]] full-size car.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} The Dodge Polara and Polara Custom models were discontinued after the 1973 model year. The Monaco and Monaco Custom replaced them respectively. The previous Monaco was renamed Monaco Brougham. The Brougham name had was used on a luxury option package from 1969 to 1973. The hidden headlamps of the previous models were replaced by fixed headlamps on all Monacos. The standard engine on all Monacos was a {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} with a 2-barrel carburetor—engine options included a {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} with a 4-barrel carburetor, a {{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} with a 2- or 4-barrel carburetor, and a {{convert|440|cuin|L|1|||abbr=on}} with a 4-barrel carburetor.

===1975===
For the 1975 model year, changes to the base Monaco were minimal. However, the Monaco Custom was renamed the Royal Monaco, and the Monaco Brougham became the Royal Monaco Brougham. These newly named models featured hidden headlamps. 1975 was the last model year in which the four-door hardtop was available. Some models, depending on equipment and the state they were sold in, received [[catalytic converters]] to comply with increasingly strict [[vehicle emissions control]] regulations. After the start of the 1975 model year, a limited-production option for Royal Monaco Brougham coupes was introduced: the Diplomat package featured a [[Landau (automobile)|landau]] vinyl roof with opera windows and a wide steel roof band. It was available in only three colors—Cold Metallic, Silver Cloud Metallic and Maroon Metallic. The standard engine on the Monaco and the Royal Monaco was a {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} with a 2-barrel carburetor while Royal Monaco Broughams and wagons received a {{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} with a 4-barrel carburetor. Engine options for the Monaco and the Royal Monaco were a {{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} with a 2- or 4-barrel carburetor and all Monacos could be upgraded to a {{convert|440|cuin|L|1|||abbr=on}} with a 4-barrel carburetor.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Flory, American Cars, 1973 to 1980&lt;/ref&gt; The car weighed over two tons with a top speed of 127&amp;nbsp;mph.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===1976===
At the start of the 1976 model year, exterior changes on the full-size C-body 1976 Dodge Monaco were very minimal, though all models (including police packages) now had the former high-series front panel with hidden headlights. Chrysler's new [[Lean burn#Chrysler Electronic Lean Burn|Lean Burn]] system was introduced in order to reduce exhaust emissions (only on the 400 cubic inch engine). The four-door hardtop, which had been part of the Dodge Monaco line up during the previous ten model years (from 1966 to 1968, from 1969 to 1973 and from 1974 to 1975) ever since the Dodge Monaco made its debut from eleven model years earlier (1965), had been discontinued during the end of the previous model year (1975), which relegated the choice of body styles only to just three offerings, the four-door wagon, four-door sedan, two-door hardtop for the 1976 model year. A {{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} with a 2-barrel carburetor and 150 bhp became standard on the base Monaco and the Royal Monaco Broughams and wagons were downgraded to a {{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} with a 2-barrel carburetor, but the Royal Monaco continued with 1975's {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} with a 2-barrel carburetor. The {{convert|440|cuin|L|1|||abbr=on}} with a 4-barrel carburetor could still be ordered.

===1977 (Royal Monaco)===
[[File:'77 Dodge Royal Monaco (Orange Julep '12).JPG|thumb|1977 Dodge Royal Monaco 4-door sedan]]
For the 1977 model year, the Monaco was effectively split into two model lines, with the Royal Monaco retaining the full-size C-platform alongside the Chrysler New Yorker, with the standard Monaco replacing the Coronet B-platform intermediate. Offered in standard and Brougham trims, the Royal Monaco was produced as a two-door hardtop sedan, four-door sedan, and five-door station wagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1977_Dodge/1977_Dodge_Monaco_Brochure/1977%20Dodge%20Monaco-16.html|title=Directory Index: Dodge/1977_Dodge/1977_Dodge_Monaco_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time, the 318 cubic-inch V8 was used as the standard engine. Outside of California, the 360 V8 (with a 2-barrel carburetor) and the 400 V8 remained available; the 440 V8 was offered as an option.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1977_Dodge/1977_Dodge_Monaco_Brochure/1977%20Dodge%20Monaco-13.html|title=Directory Index: Dodge/1977_Dodge/1977_Dodge_Monaco_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2019-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 3-speed automatic was the only transmission available.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Royal Monaco was retired for 1978, as Chrysler offered the C-platform only through its namesake division.

=== 1977 ===
The 1977 model year brought changes to the Dodge Monaco line up as a lingering result of the 1973–1974 [[energy crisis]], especially as Chrysler decided to move the Dodge Monaco, in name form only, from the full-size [[Chrysler C platform|C platform]]-body to the mid-size [[Chrysler B platform|B platform]]-body line up for the 1977 model year. The entire 1977 Dodge Monaco line up received  a make-over. The previous model year's full-size C-body Dodge Monaco (from 1976) became, just for one year only, the full-size C-body 1977 Dodge Royal Monaco until its discontinuation from all production during the end of the 1977 model year.  The mid-size B-body 1977 Dodge Monaco four-door wagon and four-door sedan replaced the previous model year's [[Dodge Coronet#Seventh generation (1975%E2%80%931976)|Coronet]] four-door wagon and four-door sedan. The 1977 Dodge Monaco Brougham four-door sedan replaced the previous model year's Coronet Brougham four-door sedan. The 1977 Dodge Monaco Crestwood four-door wagon replaced the previous model year's Coronet Crestwood four-door wagon. However, the 1977 Dodge Monaco, for all marketing practices, were little-changed from the 1976 Coronet. The 1977 models received a revised front end design with stacked rectangular [[Headlamp|headlamps]].

=== 1978 ===
For the 1978 model year, the mid-size B-body 1978 Dodge Monaco was unchanged from the previous model year. It became Dodge's largest car during the 1978 model year. The Dodge Monaco was discontinued at the end of the 1978 model year. The B-Body cars continued in the form of the Dodge Charger until 1979.

=== Replacement ===
For 1979, the Dodge Monaco was replaced by the [[Dodge St. Regis]], using the [[Chrysler R platform]] (a small revision of the B platform). While smaller than the 1977 Royal Monaco, the St. Regis remained the largest four-door sedan produced by an American automaker. Struggling to compete against the all-new designs of General Motors and Ford, sales of the St. Regis were heavily supported by fleets, largely including law enforcement vehicles. After 1981, the St. Regis was discontinued in favor of the Diplomat, becoming the longest-wheelbase Chrysler sedan produced until 2005.

=== Background and development ===
In August 1987, Chrysler completed its acquisition of [[American Motors]] (AMC)  Along with its ownership of the [[Jeep]] model line Eagle AWD cars and Renault Alliance and Encore, AMC was also sought after for ability to develop and engineer cars quicker (and at lower cost) than other American auto manufacturers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.allpar.com/model/premier.html |title=Eagle Premier - The Accidental Dodge |website=www.allpar.com |access-date=2019-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  AMC was already building Dodge Diplomats, Plymouth Gran Fury and Chrysler Fifth Avenues under contract to Chrysler beginning in 1986.  Chrysler also was in bad need of production capacity and AMC had large amounts of capacity in its new Bramalea facility, Toledo Ohio and Kenosha Wisconsin production plants.

At the time of the sale, AMC was nearing the release of the [[Eagle Premier|Premier]], a collaboration between AMC and Renault to develop a full-size car for North American markets, serving as the largest AMC-marketed sedan since the 1978 Matador. A full model line was planned for release, including a sedan, station wagon, and a two-door coupe (named the Allure).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Derived from the [[Renault 25]] (the flagship Renault model line in Europe), the Premier adopted the suspension design of the [[Eagle Medallion|Renault/Eagle Medallion]] (a [[Renault 21]] modified for North America).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zOMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=Premier+suspension+Renault+Medallion |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=October 1987 |title=Engineering the New Cars - AMC/Renault |pages=138-139 |volume=164 |issue=10 |accessdate=2019-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; , the exterior was styled by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] with the interior designed by AMC designer [[Richard A. Teague]] (in one of his final designs).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Premier was available with a 2.5&amp;nbsp;L inline-4 by AMC (shared with Jeep) or a 3.0&amp;nbsp;L V6 (By PRV plc).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Eagle Premier was launched for the 1988 model year, with production beginning in September 1987. all production examples were badged as Eagles (though designated with AMC VINs). The Premier was the flagship of the Eagle model line, slotted above the Medallion and the Eagle Sport Wagon for 1988.

As part of the purchase agreement, Chrysler was contractually obligated to use 260,000 of the [[PRV V6]] engines.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://autopolis.wordpress.com/2012/11/04/1990-1992-dodge-monaco-between-a-rock-and-a-hard-sell/ |title=1990-1992 Dodge Monaco: Between a Rock and a Hard Sell |date=2012-11-04|website=Autopolis |access-date=2019-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Eagle sold less than 90,000 Premiers in its first two years of production&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, Chrysler sought to more quickly fulfill its obligation to Renault by marketing a rebadged version of the Premier under the Dodge brand.

=== Model overview ===
For the 1990 model year, the Dodge Monaco nameplate was reintroduced (after a 12-year hiatus), serving as a direct replacement for the long-running Dodge Diplomat. Slotted above the slightly smaller Dodge Dynasty, the Monaco was a rebadged version of the Eagle Premier, sold in standard LE and deluxe ES trims.

The Dodge Monaco and Eagle Premier were assembled by the [[Bramalea Assembly]] in [[Brampton|Brampton, Ontario]] (opened by AMC in 1986). Although produced in Canada, [[Chrysler Canada]] did not sell the model line; following the discontinuation of the Diplomat, the largest Dodge sedan sold in Canada was the [[Dodge Spirit|Spirit]], with the Dynasty marketed as a Chrysler. For 1993, the [[Dodge Intrepid]] replaced the Monaco and the Dynasty, with the Eagle Vision replacing the Premier. 

==== Chassis ====
The Dodge Monaco and Eagle Premier are built on the front-wheel drive [[Chrysler B platform]], renamed following the acquisition of AMC from Renault. Originally codenamed X-58, the chassis was the final vehicle platform of AMC and the only front-wheel drive chassis ever produced by the automaker. Sharing only its letter designation with the 1962-1979 Chrysler intermediate architecture, the B platform is derived from the [[Renault 25]], sharing the rear torsion-bar suspension design of the [[Renault 21]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Dodge Monaco was fitted with four-wheel disc brakes (introduced to the Premier for 1990&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;), with [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] (ABS) becoming added in 1991&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. The [[Dodge Viper (SR I)|first-generation Dodge Viper]] shares its rear disc brakes with the Dodge Monaco/Eagle Premier (''without'' ABS).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Engineered by former Renault product engineer [[Francois Castaing]], the B platform adopted a [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout#Longitudinally mounted front-engine and front-wheel drive|longitudinal engine configuration]], allowing for better engine access and more stable handling.

To increase compatibility with other Chrysler vehicles (and to increase reliability&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;), the B platform shifted from Renault to Chrysler electrical components for 1990.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===== Powertrain =====
The Dodge Monaco was powered by the Renault-produced 3.0L "Douvrin" [[V6 PRV engine|PRV V6]], paired with a ZF-produced 4-speed automatic transmission&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Body ====
For 1990, the Eagle Premier underwent a minor revision (leading to the deletion of the ''Design Giugiaro'' badges&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;). The Dodge Monaco shared its entire body with the Premier, differing in turn signal lenses (amber instead of clear), trunklid design (gray trim between the taillamps), and the adoption of the Dodge "crosshair" grille.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In contrast to the Dynasty, the Monaco was a five-passenger vehicle with front bucket seats and a console-mounted shifter.

For 1991, the Monaco replaced chrome trim on all models with black or body-color trim. To streamline production, air conditioning and automatic climate control became standard.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''[[Dodge Omni 024]]''' was a modified version of the popular [[Dodge Omni]] made from 1979 to 1982. Analogous to the VW Scirocco, this car was a lower, sportier three-door hatchback coupé version of the Chrysler/Simca Horizon, using the five-door hatchback's floor pan and chassis as a basis. The cars were designed in-house at the prompting of [[Lee Iacocca]].&lt;ref name=AllPar&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.allpar.com/omni/turismo.html | last = Nicalek | first = Bryan T. | title = Charger, Turismo, 024, and TC3: Omni/Horizon Coupes | work = Allpar }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It used the same chassis and engine options as the Omni but had unique bodywork and front end styling. The base engine was a 1.7&amp;nbsp;L [[Volkswagen]] inline four producing {{convert|70|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, with a 2.2&amp;nbsp;L, {{convert|84|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Chrysler inline four as an option beginning in 1981.&lt;ref name=RT82&gt;{{cite journal | ref = 81bg | journal = Road &amp; Track's Road Test Annual &amp; Buyer's Guide 1981 | issue = January-February 1981 | title = 1981 Buyer's Guide | editor-first = Tony | editor-last = Hogg | page = 93 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By then, the smaller engine only produced {{convert|63|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. For the first year, the car had a folding back seat and the wheels were painted in the exterior color. The car's looks promised more performance than the engine could deliver, and the car was not as practical as the Omni. Both the Omni and Horizon prefixes were dropped for 1981, making them the "024" and "TC3", respectively.&lt;ref name=Lee1&gt;[[#SCC|Lee]], pp. 320, 434.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dodge Omni 024 rear.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of 1979-1980 Dodge Omni 024]]
The 024 did not sell well and was renamed as the [[Dodge Charger (L-body)|Dodge Charger]] for the 1983 [[model year]], a name which had been gradually introduced as part of a special "Charger 2.2" package beginning in 1981.&lt;ref name=Lee1/&gt; The 024 had also been produced as the  '''Plymouth Horizon TC3'''. It, too, was renamed in the 1983 model year: to the [[Plymouth Turismo]]. The "Turismo" label had already been used on a sport package beginning in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SCC|Lee]], p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its last year, the 024 and TC3 served as a base for the [[Dodge Rampage]] and [[Dodge Rampage|Plymouth Scamp]] pick-up trucks using the same chassis, powertrain and body parts from the doors forward. 

In 1980 the Plymouth Horizon TC3 also became available with the Turismo sport package. For the Dodge Omni 024 this was called the [[DeTomaso]] package, with De Tomaso designed trim and wheels but the standard drivetrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.geocities.com/aaronkarpi/1978.htm | work = My Cars | last = Karpi | first = Aaron | title = The Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060910235826/http://www.geocities.com/aaronkarpi/1978.htm | archivedate = September 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1,333 De Tomaso 024's were built in 1980, followed by 619 more in 1981. The 1981 De Tomasos were only available with the new 2.2 litre engine.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SCC|Lee]], pp. 317, 320.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1980, in cooperation with Chrysler partner [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]], the '''Chrysler Omni 024''' was briefly sold in Japan. It was available for two years at Mitsubishi dealerships and it complied with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]]. It didn't sell well, with only 1491 finding Japanese buyers.

Following the Caliber [[Concept car|concept]] which debuted at the 2005 [[Geneva Motor Show]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.motortrend.com/auto_shows/112_05_geneva_dodge_calaliber_photos/index.html |title=Dodge Caliber Photo Gallery - 2005 Geneva Motor Show |journal=Motor Trend |date=February 2005 |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Pre-production car|pre-production]] version debuted on at the 2006 [[North American International Auto Show]], with market launch in  March 2006.

The Caliber was manufactured at the [[Belvidere Assembly]] ([[Illinois]]) plant, and across its six-year model run, just over 400,000 were produced.

==Marketing==
The Caliber was one of Dodge's first modern offerings in Europe and in [[Asia]]n markets such as Japan and Singapore, as it established new distribution channels there. It was also introduced in [[People's Republic of China|China]] in 2008 as Dodge's second modern vehicle offering in that market. Dodge vehicles were last officially sold in China during the World War II era. The introduction of the Caliber had marked the return of the Dodge brand to Australia since the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motoring.com.au/dodge-aims-to-grab-australia-by-the-horns-564/ Dodge aims to grab Australia by the horns, www.motoring.com.au, 10 February 10 2006] Retrieved 13 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The Caliber in Japan joined the [[Chrysler PT Cruiser]] in 2007, as the PT Cruiser was offered since 2000, but as with previous Chrysler products sold in Japan, the width dimension exceeded Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]], and Japanese consumers were liable for annual taxes for driving a larger car which affected sales. As Chrysler products were considered large to the Japanese market, Chrysler offered products that offered spacious interiors with four doors and one piece liftgates to broaden their appeal to the Japanese as a compromise for paying the [[Road tax#Japan|annual tax]] for large vehicles.

The marketing plan for the first year of the Caliber's production included 20% of the budget for online marketing, print ads, and TV commercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://jalopnik.com/162972/its-an-exclusive-marketing-blitz-advance-copies-of-four-commercials-for-the-dodge-caliber?tag=carsadspromotions |title=It's An Exclusive Marketing Blitz! Advance Copies Of Four Commercials For The Dodge Caliber! |first=Jay |last=Wert |date=25 March 2006 |work=jalopnik |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The Dodge Caliber offered a [[continuously variable transmission]] (called ''CVT2'' by Dodge) sourced from [[Jatco]] (a [[Nissan]] subsidiary), the second [[DaimlerChrysler]] model to employ this technology after the [[Mercedes-Benz A-Class#W168|Mercedes-Benz A-Class]]. It uses a [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]] 1.8-2.4&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Chrysler World engine|World]]'' gasoline engine, designed jointly by Chrysler, Mitsubishi, and Hyundai.

The car features an optional electronically controlled [[all-wheel drive]] system with variable torque at speeds of {{convert|25|to|65|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} for optimal handling.

The Caliber uses a heavily modified [[Mitsubishi GS platform|GS platform]], co-designed with [[Mitsubishi Motors]]. The modified GS platform is now called the JS platform by Chrysler for mid-size cars and PM/MK for compact cars. It shares a portion of the platform with the [[Mitsubishi Lancer]], but is most similar to the [[Jeep Compass]] and [[Jeep Patriot]]. The Caliber wheels have a 5-hole [[Wheel sizing#Bolt pattern|pattern]] with a 114.3&amp;nbsp;mm bolt circle.

===Safety===
The [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS) gave the Caliber an overall ''Good'' score in frontal crash testing. The Dodge Caliber was standard with side curtain airbags, but torso side airbags were optional. The IIHS had scored the Caliber ''Marginal'' overall in their side impact test. However, that Caliber was not equipped with the optional torso side airbag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/dodge/caliber/2007?print-view |title=IIHS-HLDI: Dodge Caliber |publisher=Insurance Institute for Highway Safety |date= |accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Models===
Three models were available at the Caliber's launch, with a fourth available in mid-2006.

The base '''SE''' model features [[front-wheel drive]] and a 1.8&amp;nbsp;L {{convert|148|hp|kW|lk=in|abbr=on}} ''[[Chrysler World engine|World]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] attached to a [[Magna International|Magna]] Drivetrain T355 5-speed [[manual transmission]]. A 2.0&amp;nbsp;L {{convert|158|hp|kW|abbr=on}} version of the engine paired with the CVT2 transmission was available as an option.

The standard configuration for the SE lacks air conditioning, power windows, door locks, or mirrors. The grille surround is body-colored, while that of all other models is chromed. Canadian SXT and R/T models feature body color grilles instead of chrome grilles. The Caliber SE doesn't have a [[tachometer]] or assist handles, {{convert|15|in|cm|abbr=on}} steel wheels with wheel covers are standard. Some options were not available on the SE.

For 2011, this model was named Express, reverting to SE for 2012. For 2012, the [[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]] transmission option was dropped only for the SE, leaving the five-speed [[manual transmission]] as the only available transmission option for the SE. The CVT continued to be offered in the SXT and SXT Plus models for 2012.

The '''SXT''' has the same engine choices as the SE but many more features are available as standard. Air conditioning is standard equipment at this level, including the Chill Zone beverage cooler inside the front lower glove compartment. The gauge cluster gains a tachometer and an (optional) trip computer. The driver's seat adds height adjustment, the passenger seat folds flat for load-carrying, and the rear seats recline. Power windows, locks, mirrors, and remote keyless entry are included. The grille is chromed and {{convert|17|in|cm|abbr=on}} steel wheels are standard, with {{convert|17|in|cm|abbr=on}} aluminum wheels as an option. The cargo area light includes a removable and rechargeable flashlight while the front dome light incorporates two reading lamps. In Europe this version was also commercialized equipped with a VW-built 2.0 liter turbodiesel engine.

[[File:2007 Dodge Caliber hatchback -- NHTSA 02 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Dodge Caliber]]

Some [[Dodge]] publications mention a '''SXT Sport Wagon''' model, while others (e.g. the Dodge website) list a SXT "E" package with identical features. This consists of {{convert|17|in|cm|abbr=on}} aluminum wheels, color-keyed cloth seat inserts, color-matched instrument panel trim, along with fog lamps.

The UK SXT Sport model has {{convert|18|in|cm|abbr=on}} alloy wheels, color-keyed cloth seats and instrument panel, and a 9-speaker audio system as standard; early [[United Kingdom|UK]] models did not have the chrome grille. The UK SXT Sport was available with a Volkswagen 2.0&amp;nbsp;L diesel engine mated to a six-speed manual transmission.

For 2011, the Heat, Uptown, and Mainstreet were three available trim levels of the Caliber, reverting to SXT and SXT Plus in 2012.

The '''R/T''' model has a 2.4&amp;nbsp;L {{convert|172|hp|kW|abbr=on}} version of the World engine, equipped with the CVT2 transmission, and programmed with an 'AutoStick' feature giving six simulated fixed ratios in a clutchless manual mode in addition to the standard CVT 'Drive' mode. [[All-wheel-drive]] was an option on the R/T model until 2009, but with automatic transmission only. Eighteen-inch aluminum wheels were standard, while chromed versions were optional. At launch, the CVT2 with all-wheel drive was the only powertrain combination available for the R/T. A front-wheel drive variant with the T355 5-speed manual transmission commenced production in late summer 2006. [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] was standard, and the suspension and steering systems were tuned for performance.

Externally, the R/T is distinguishable by body-color/chrome door handles (replacing black on other models), a chrome [[side molding]], chromed exhaust tip, and front fog lights as standard, as well as R/T badging.

Internally, the car came standard with color-keyed fabric seat inserts, while leather seats were an option as on the SXT. Color-keyed instrument panel trim was also standard, as well as a leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls and speed control, and a cargo area cover (all options on the SXT).

The R/T model was discontinued in 2010.

[[File:Dodge Caliber SRT4.JPG|thumb|right|Dodge Caliber SRT4]]
{{See also|Street and Racing Technology}}

The '''SRT4''' model that was introduced at the [[Chicago Auto Show]] in February 2006, was a replacement for the original [[Dodge Neon|Neon]]-based [[Dodge SRT-4|SRT-4]] produced by Chrysler's [[Street and Racing Technology]] group.

The SRT4 hatchback competed with the [[Volkswagen GTI]] and the [[Mazdaspeed3]]. It featured a 2.4&amp;nbsp;L DOHC 16V turbocharged I4 with dual variable valve timing (DVVT). The engine produces {{convert|285|hp|kW|abbr=on}} at 6,400&amp;nbsp;rpm, and {{convert|265|lb.ft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque at 5,600&amp;nbsp;rpm using the TD04HL4S-20 turbo. Edmunds.com tested a Caliber SRT4 on a chassis dynamometer and obtained {{convert|281|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|261|lb.ft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque at the wheels. Edmunds called the manufacturer's rating conservative; putting more power to the road than cars costing twice as much. This engine is mated to a [[Getrag]] six-speed manual transmission, and uses a front-wheel drive drivetrain. The Caliber SRT4 uses a MacPherson strut front suspension, and a multilink rear suspension. The SRT4 came with large {{convert|13.4|in|cm|abbr=on}} vented front disc brakes (from the Dodge Charger Police Pack version) with dual-piston calipers and {{convert|11.9|in|cm|abbr=on}} rear single-piston disc brakes. It also featured four-wheel ABS, with electronic assistance. The wheels are {{convert|19|in|cm|abbr=on}}, five-spoke, SRT-stamped, painted aluminum and equipped with Goodyear RSA 225/45R19 tires. Package options included polished aluminum wheels, Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar tires, SIRIUS satellite radio with Kicker SRT livin' loud audio, EVIC with performance pages, security alarm, and optional paint colors.

The SRT4 model of the Caliber was available through 2009.

==Updates==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2017}}

===2009===
For the 2009 model, the Caliber underwent a minor revamp. The plain plastic black-colored door handles available on base models were replaced by painted car-colored handles previously available only on R/T. In addition, the trunk lid was reduced in weight and simplified in opening. In the interior, all panels were made black instead of grey. The "DODGE" badge that was on top of the [[Ram Trucks|Ram]] logo at the middle was shifted to the left, while "CALIBER" badge was moved to the right from the left, both equal in font size. The car model title, previously indicated on the right, was moved to the bottom right corner of the gate lid.

===2010===
The 2010 model year was unveiled at the 2009 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]], featuring a refreshed interior design composed of metallic outlines and parts of glass to suppress the abundance of plastic materials on previous models, as well as the addition of an 8-way power drivers seat, heated mirrors, and an automatic climate control system previously available only on R/T. The dashboard also features the relocation of the glove box due to many customer complaints, which now occupies the spot over the radio panel and comprises a "push-open" lock instead of the previous "squeeze-and-lift" opening mechanism.

The 1.8&amp;nbsp;L engine was dropped from the SE and SXT models, and the SRT-4 model is discontinued. European market models receive a new 2.2&amp;nbsp;L [[diesel engine]] with {{convert|163|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|236|lb·ft|N.m|adj=on}} of torque that provides a combined city and highway fuel efficiency of {{convert|40.6|mpgus}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.autoblog.com/2009/09/01/2010-dodge-caliber-gets-new-interior-europe-gets-new-diesel/ |last=Abuelsamid |first=Sam |title=2010 Dodge Caliber gets new interior, Europe gets new diesel |publisher=autoblog |date=1 September 2009 |accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For United States market only, the models were promptly renamed and rebranded, with SE becoming "Main Street", SXT — "Heat" and R/T — "Rush". Two more models were launched in 2010: a luxury all-included variant "Uptown" and a base variant "Express" in which the black plastic handles returned. "Express" was the only model not to feature the automatic climate control as an option, the "Main Street" featured speed control, anti-lock brake system and electronic stability control, which were previously unavailable as options for SE. All models except "Express" featured 17-inch wheels.

===2011===
The 2011 model brought six new paint schemes, standard stability control except on Express models, Sirius traffic when equipped with a navigation system, 18-inch chrome-clad wheels available on Uptown models (17" painted are standard), updated steering except on Express models, and new shocks and a thicker rear anti-roll bar on Rush and Heat models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2011-dodge-caliber-gets-revised-suspension-equipment-shuffled-car-news |last=Holmes |first=Jake |title=2011 Dodge Caliber Gets Revised Suspension, Equipment Shuffled |journal=Car and Driver |date=September 2010 |accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Caliber and the [[Dodge Nitro|Nitro]] were the only two cars in the Dodge vehicle line-up to still feature the Ram logo on both fascia, rear and the steering wheel. The Dodge Nitro also featured driver and passenger's floor mats. The logo was removed from the mats in Calibers with the 2009 model.

===2012===
For the 2012 model year, the models were renamed back to SE, SXT, and SXT Plus. The Plus version includes all the SXT items and 18-inch aluminum wheels with performance tires, as well as a 6-way power adjustable driver seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dodge.com/en/2012/caliber/sxt_plus/ |title=What's Included |publisher=dodge.com |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130525040610/http://www.dodge.com/en/2012/caliber/sxt_plus/ |archivedate=25 May 2013 |accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SXT Plus was not sold in Canada.

==Discontinuation==
The 2010 Caliber was the last model sold in Europe. The 2011 model ended production on November 23, 2011, in United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.leftlanenews.com/dodge-caliber-production-to-cease-in-november.html |first=Andrew |last=Ganz |title=Dodge Caliber production to cease in November |publisher=Leftlanenews.com |date=24 August 2011 |accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the remainder being sold as the 2012 [[model year]] Caliber in both U.S. and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fleet.chrysler.com/v7fleet/StaticFiles/files/BuyerGuides/Dodge_Caliber_Buyer_Guide.pdf |title=2012 Dodge Caliber |publisher=Chrysler Group |accessdate=19 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913043511/https://www.fleet.chrysler.com/v7fleet/StaticFiles/files/BuyerGuides/Dodge_Caliber_Buyer_Guide.pdf |archivedate=13 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A successor called the [[Dodge Dart (2013)|Dart]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.autoblog.nl/dodge-dart-is-de-amerikaanse-alfa-giulietta#comment-2828034 |title=Dodge Dart is de Amerikaanse Alfa Giulietta |publisher=Autoblog.nl |language=Dutch |date=6 December 2011 |accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the [[Alfa Romeo Giulietta (2010)|Alfa Romeo Giulietta]]'s platform, went on sale in June 2012 for the 2013 model-year as the compact vehicle in Dodge's lineup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-dodge-dart-20111207,0,5064676.story |title=Chrysler revives Dodge Dart in bid for youth market |first=Jerry |last=Hirsch |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=6 December 2012 |accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dodge Nitro''' is a [[compact SUV]] that was produced by [[Dodge]] from the 2007 to the 2012 model year. The Nitro shared its [[Automobile platform|platform]] with the second generation [[Jeep Liberty]]. It was assembled at the [[Toledo North Assembly Plant#Toledo North|Toledo North Assembly Plant]] in [[Toledo, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=automag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automobilemag.com/new_car_previews/2007/0604_2007_dodge_nitro/index.html |title=New Car Previews: 2007 Dodge Nitro |work=[[Automobile Magazine]]|accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jeep]] facility is part of an automobile complex which includes the [[Toledo South Assembly Plant]], home to the [[Jeep Wrangler]] since the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/auto_news/112_news051129_dodgenitro/index.html|title=Chrysler Announces Plans to Build 2007 Dodge Nitro|work=Motor Trend |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Dodge Nitro 2.8 CRD rear.jpg|thumb|left|Rear]]
[[File:07 Dodge Nitro SXT.jpg|thumb|left|Base specification Dodge Nitro, note the black bumper and lack of fog lights]]
The Nitro made its debut in February 2005 at the [[Chicago Auto Show]], as a concept car featuring an aluminum themed interior design. Aluminum-trimmed vents behind the front fenders, and other aluminum trim around the door handles and rear hatch, were routinely displayed as the center stack and shifter also included a finish in satin silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automobilemag.com/future_cars/2007/0502_dodge_nitro/index.html |title=Future Cars: Dodge Nitro Concept |work=Automobile Magazine |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nitro became Dodge's first [[compact SUV]] model since the [[Dodge Raider|Raider]] was discontinued in 1990. It also became the first modern Dodge branded automobile to be sold in [[Europe]] since its introduction in early 2007. In the U.S., the Nitro went into production in August 2006 and went on sale in September of the same year as a 2007 model. All Nitros were available with [[rear-wheel drive]], and part-time [[four-wheel drive]] was available as an option. The Nitro was Dodge's SUV until the 2009 model year, when the larger, car-based [[Dodge Journey]] [[crossover SUV]] priced below it, arrived in showrooms. Compared to its shared platform with the Jeep Liberty, the Nitro is longer, lower, and wider. The extra length is split between the rear seat and the cargo area.&lt;ref name="automag" /&gt;

The Nitro originally came equipped with an SUV class-leading {{convert|5000|lb|kg|adj=on}} towing capacity. Safety features such as electronic roll mitigation, traction control, and side curtain airbags, as well as a functional sliding cargo floor called ''Load 'N Go'' were also offered as standard equipment. Similar to a system offered on the [[Saab 9-5]] [[station wagon]], the floor can be extended through the rear hatch by 18&amp;nbsp;in (457&amp;nbsp;mm) to ease loading. Another attribute of the SUV, is its aggressive [[hot rod]] styling; complete with a bulged muscular appearance and pronounced fenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060206/FREE/60203008/1024/LATESTNEWS|title=Dodge targets young families with Nitro SUV|work=AutoWeek |accessdate=2006-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model years==
For its initial debut in 2007, two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive drivetrains were offered, along with a choice of a 3.7&amp;nbsp;L or 4.0&amp;nbsp;L V6 engines. The model designations were the SXT, SLT, and R/T. There were three types of upholstery made available; basic cloth, stain-repellant cloth, and perforated leather. Standard safety features included; front and rear side airbags, side curtain airbags, an electronic stability program with traction control and brake assist, electronic roll mitigation and a tire-pressure monitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/SUVs/dodge/nitro.html|title=2007 Dodge Nitro SUV|work=Allpar|accessdate=2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/buy/2007-Dodge-Nitro/overview/ |title=2007 Dodge Nitro |publisher=Autoblog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] version was sold exclusively in [[Europe]].

During 2008, the Nitro came in both a 4x2 and a 4x4 versions with each offering two trims: SXT and SLT. Both trims came with a standard 210-hp 3.7&amp;nbsp;L V6 engine. The SXT trim included a standard six-speed manual transmission with an optional four-speed automatic. The SLT trim came with a standard four-speed automatic, but the optional R/T package increased the level of  equipment with a 260-hp 4.0&amp;nbsp;L [[V6 engine]] mated to a five-speed [[automatic transmission]]. The Nitro's SXT trim included standard  power mirrors, windows and door locks with remote keyless entry, satellite radio, air conditioning, and seating for five. The SXT and R/T added alloy wheels, power driver's seat, stain repellent cloth, the ''Load 'N Go'' retractable cargo floor, cruise control, and an overhead console with a trip computer, compass, and exterior temperature display. Standard safety features included; front airbags, side curtain airbags, traction and stability control with roll-over mitigation, brake assist, and a tire-pressure monitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/buy/2008-Dodge-Nitro/overview/ |title=2008 Dodge Nitro |publisher=Autoblog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the Nitro was offered in both a 4x2 and a 4x4 versions with two trims levels: SE and SLT. Both came with a standard 210-hp 3.7&amp;nbsp;L V6 engine mated to a four-speed automatic transmission. The SXT with its six-speed [[manual transmission]] had been replaced by the SE trim that featured the automatic transmission. The SLT trim offered the optional R/T package which was made available with a 260-hp 4.0&amp;nbsp;L V6 engine mated to a five-speed automatic transmission. The Nitro's SE trim standards included power mirrors, windows and door locks with remote keyless entry, satellite radio, air conditioning, and seating for five. The SLT and R/T added alloy wheels, power driver's seat, stain repellent cloth, the ''Load 'N Go'' retractable cargo floor, cruise control and an overhead console with a trip computer, compass, and exterior temperature display. Standard safety features included; front airbags, side curtain airbags, traction and stability control with roll-over mitigation, brake assist, and a tire-pressure monitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/buy/2009-Dodge-Nitro/overview/ |title=2009 Dodge Nitro |publisher=Autoblog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2010 model year, three new model designations became available: Heat, Detonator, and Shock trim levels in either 4x2 or 4x4 versions. The Heat trim was equipped with a 210-hp 3.7&amp;nbsp;L V6 engine mated to a four-speed automatic transmission. The Detonator and Shock trims included a 260-hp V6 engine mated to automatic transmission. The Heat trim level had power mirrors, windows and door locks with remote keyless entry, satellite radio, and air conditioning. The Detonator added a rear-park assist, remote start system, power driver's seat, cruise control, an overhead console with a trip computer, compass, and exterior temperature display. The Shock trim added heated front seats, leather trim interior, and a power sunroof. Among standard safety features were: front airbags, side curtain airbags, active head restraints, traction and stability control with roll-over mitigation, brake assist, and a tire-pressure monitor. The ''Load 'N Go'' sliding trunk floor feature was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmunds.com/dodge/nitro/2010/review.html 2010 Dodge Nitro Review]. ''Edmunds.com''. Retrieved 2010-08-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/buy/2010-Dodge-Nitro/overview/ |title=2010 Dodge Nitro |publisher=Autoblog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 model year continued the previous models in 4x2 or 4x4 versions with the same engines and transmissions. New for 2011 was the Heat 4.0 lifestyle package. The Heat 4.0 came standard with a five-speed [[automatic transmission]], Uconnect Phone, and an upgraded eight-speaker sound system. Also, select models came with upgraded interiors with new cloth and leather with premium colored stitching. Detonator and Shock were branded with Dodge Brand’s signature racing stripes. Additionally, all models became available with nine exterior colors, including Bright White Clear Coat, Blackberry Pearl Coat, Toxic Orange Pearl Coat, and Redline Two Coat Pearl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.topspeed.com/cars/dodge/2011-dodge-nitro-ar96662.html |title=2011 Dodge Nitro |publisher=Top Speed.com |accessdate=2013-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final Nitro came off the assembly line on December 16, 2011.

==Australia==
In Australia, versions could be had only as the 3.7&amp;nbsp;L V6 in SXT trim with automatic transmission. No manual option was offered, but diesels were on sale until 2010 MY.

==Discontinuation==
Despite its flashy debut, the Nitro sales did not bode well for the company starting 2009, although for 2010 the situation had slightly ameliorated. The decision was therefore taken not to continue its production into 2012, with the assembly effectively ending on December 16, 2011. Chrysler sold 2011 model year Dodge Nitros as a 2012 model year for the Mexican market only (120 units).  Dodge's official websites for the United States &amp; Canada list no 2012 retail Nitros. The final Nitro came off the assembly line on December 16, 2011, with a total of 275,510 units built since its introduction.

==Controversy==
In early 2007, a TV advertisement in the Netherlands for the Nitro with the tag line: ''"charged with adrenaline"'', showed a dog getting electrocuted after touching the SUV's front wheel. The ad gained a substantial amount of negative attention and was quickly pulled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wert |first=Ray |url=http://jalopnik.com/cars/ad-watch/dodge-nitro-kills-dog-makes-us-cry-a-little-280059.php |title=Dodge Nitro Kills Dog, Makes Us Cry A Little - Ads/Promotions |publisher=Jalopnik.com |date=2007-07-19 |accessdate=2009-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1894731_1894734_1894724,00.html |title=Marketing Mess - Top 10 Chrysler Moments |magazine=Time |date=2009-04-27 |accessdate=2009-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bluesmobile''' is a 1974 [[Dodge Monaco]] sedan that was prominently featured in the 1980 Universal Pictures film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]''. The car is described as a decommissioned [[Mount Prospect, Illinois|Mount Prospect]] [[police car]], purchased by [[The Blues Brothers (film)|Elwood Blues]] at an auction after he had traded a previous car (a [[Cadillac Sixty Special#1965.E2.80.931970|1968 Cadillac Sixty Special]]) for a [[microphone]]. The Bluesmobile is equipped with a "440 Magnum" engine and squad car package, an option offered by Dodge for the Monaco in 1974. It bears an Illinois license plate reading "BDR 529", a tribute to the Black Diamond Riders [[Outlaw motorcycle club|motorcycle club]] of [[Toronto]], Canada.&lt;ref name="Lavigne1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yves Lavigne|title=Hell's Angels: "Three Can Keep a Secret If Two Are Dead"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_gvnXf65BMC&amp;pg=PA155|year=1989|publisher=Carol Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8184-0514-3|pages=155–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan Aykroyd]], co-writer of the film, stated that he chose the 440 Dodge Monaco because he considered it to be the hottest car used by police during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=diecast&gt;{{cite news|title=In Search of the Bluesmobile|publisher=DieCast Magazine|date=Summer 2008 |page=98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I_oDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In describing the car to his brother [[Jake Blues]], Elwood says, "It's got a cop motor, a [[Chrysler RB engine#440|440-cubic-inch plant]].  It's got cop tires, cop [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], cop [[shock absorber|shocks]]. It's a model made before [[catalytic converter]]s so it'll run good on [[gasoline#Lead|regular gas]]."  The Bluesmobile has the ability to perform seemingly impossible stunts, such as jumping over an open [[drawbridge]], flipping backwards in midair and even "flying" for very brief periods of time. However, its [[cigarette lighter receptacle|cigarette lighter]] does not work; when Jake discovers this early in the film, he throws it out the window.

== '' Blues Brothers: Private (book)'' - 1968 Cadillac Fleetwood ==
According to ''[[Blues Brothers: Private]]'', published in 1980 and written by [[Judith Jacklin]] and [[Tino Insana]] to add substance to The Blues Brothers universe, the first Bluesmobile was a 1968 [[Cadillac Sixty Special#1965–1970|Cadillac Fleetwood Sixty Special]] license number SP2 153.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacklin|first1=Judith|last2=Insana|first2=Tino|title=Blues Brothers: Private|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons|isbn=9780399504761|oclc=6917803|edition=1st|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Blues Brothers (film)'' - 1974 Dodge Monaco==
In ''The Blues Brothers''  opening scene, Elwood arrives at [[Joliet Prison]] in the 1974 Dodge Monaco to pick up the newly-released Jake. When Jake asks about their previous Bluesmobile, Elwood tells him he traded it for a microphone. Elwood explains the Dodge Monaco is a decommissioned Mount Prospect police car, and after proving its worthiness by jumping it over the [[95th Street (Chicago)|95th St. Bridge]] in Chicago, Jake approves it as their new Bluesmobile.&lt;ref name="APS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Modin|first1=Flash|title=The Physics of the Blues Brothers|url=http://physicsbuzz.physicscentral.com/2010/06/physics-of-blues-brothers.html|website=Physics Buzz|publisher=American Physical Society|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cars used in the film production===
The film used 13 different cars to depict the Bluesmobile, all of which were former police cars purchased from the [[California Highway Patrol]], and were mocked up to look like former [[Mount Prospect, Illinois]] patrol cars.&lt;ref name="Gelbert2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Doug Gelbert|title=Film and Television Locations: A State-by-state Guidebook to Moviemaking Sites, Excluding Los Angeles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qYRZAAAAMAAJ|date=1 January 2002|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-1293-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some were formatted for speed, and others in jumps or high-performance maneuvers, depending on the scene. One was designed simply to fall apart upon its arrival at the Cook County Building. A mechanic took several months to rig the car for that scene. Over 60 old police cars were purchased for the film's chase scenes, and the production kept a 24-hour body shop open to perform repairs as needed.&lt;ref name="Chicago Sun-Times2"&gt;{{cite web | title=Chicago Sun-Times | work=Incredible stunt driving: "That was all real" | url=http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-bbcarchase23.html  | accessdate=December 16, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050728125722/http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-bbcarchase23.html |archivedate = July 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the film's release, it set a world record for the most cars destroyed in one film; it held this distinction until 1998, when it was surpassed by its own [[Blues Brothers 2000|sequel]].&lt;ref name="Chicago Sun-Times2"/&gt;

===Roof mounted loudspeaker===

According to Dan Aykroyd, the horn-shaped loudspeaker atop the Bluesmobile was actually a duplicate of a massive [[Cold War]]-era [[air raid siren]] installed in the schoolyard at "Our Lady of Annunciation" where Aykroyd attended elementary school while growing up in [[Ottawa]], Canada.&lt;ref name="Paul"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paul|first1=Adam|title=Dan Aykroyd marks 35 years since The Blues Brothers|url=http://www.stlawrencefilm.com/news/2015/10/22/dan-aykroyd-marks-35-years-since-the-blues-brothers|website=stlawrencefilm.com|publisher=ST. LAWRENCE INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The siren was manufactured by a Canadian company called CLM Industries, and Aykroyd specifically requested the same CLM model be used in the movie to portray the loudspeaker the characters affixed to the top of the Bluesmobile and used as a [[PA system]].&lt;ref name="SoSide"&gt;{{cite web|title=What Link Do Our Old Air Raid Sirens Have with the Blues Brothers?|url=https://southsidestory.ca/2016/06/what-do-our-old-air-raid-sirens-have-in-common-with-the-blues-brothers/|website=southsidestory.ca|publisher=South Side Story|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chase scenes===
The Blues Brothers use the Bluesmobile to evade pursuers in a number of high-speed chases throughout the film, culminating in a police pursuit / race to Chicago after the band's performance north of the city. Even though the car throws a rod during this pursuit, they are still able to outrun both the police and a group of [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazis]] in a pair of [[Ford]] station wagons. After they crash through the [[Richard J. Daley Center]] and arrive at the [[Chicago City Hall|Cook County Building]] to pay the property taxes on the orphanage where they grew up, the car falls to pieces on the sidewalk.

Director [[John Landis]] has claimed that the portion of the final chase sequence beneath the elevated train tracks, which briefly showed a reading of {{convert|118|mph|km/h}} on the car's speedometer, was actually filmed at that speed, a testament to the Monaco's police car heritage. He has also stated that he re-shot some of the scenes with pedestrians on the sidewalks, so viewers could see that the film had not been sped up to create the effect of speed.&lt;ref name="BB"&gt;{{cite web|title=THE BLUES BROTHERS MOVIE CHICAGO PREMIER 6/16/80, 35 YEARS AGO|url=http://bluesbrothersofficialsite.com/n-11726-the-blues-brothers-movie-chicago-premier-6-16-80-35-years-ago.html|publisher=Blues Brothers Approved Ventures LLC.|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vehicle's model is never referred to in the original film by Elwood, who purchased the car, or the various police officers and dispatch operators coordinating the manhunt. It is only referred to as a "1974 Dodge sedan" over the CB, and as "that shitbox Dodge" by one of the state troopers pursuing Jake and Elwood throughout the film.

In the extended version of the film, Elwood is seen parking the Bluesmobile in an electric [[electrical substation|substation]] that was used to power [[Chicago 'L'|Chicago's elevated trains]].&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Blues Brothers: Collector's Edition|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/12/14/blues-brothers-collectors-edition-the|website=ign.com|publisher=IGN|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the documentary "Stories Behind the Making of the Blues Brothers", Dan Aykroyd suggested that the scene was intended to show the Bluesmobile was getting "power" from the substation, which would help explain how it was able to do impressive stunts. In the original theatrical release, director [[John Landis]] had cut that scene to shorten the length of the film. According to Landis, there was no need to explain the car's powers. To him, it was simply "a magic car" and of course, they were on a mission from God. A power station was visible in the background of the film's poster.&lt;ref name="BPBS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chiarella|first1=Chris|title=The Blues Brothers Blu-ray Review|url=http://www.bigpicturebigsound.com/The-Blues-Brothers-Blu-ray.shtml|website=Big Picture, Big Sound|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Bluesmobile" was also given to another former police car, a 1990 [[Ford LTD Crown Victoria]], used in the 1998 sequel, ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]''. In the film, Elwood purchases the car from Malvern Gasperon's yard in Chicago for $500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henriksson|first1=Joakim|last2=Henriksson|first2=Madeleine|title=Bluesmobiles in the movies The 1990 Ford Crown Victoria|url=http://bluesmobile.info/inthemovies/1990CrownVic/page1/page1.html|website=Bluesmobile.info|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car was equipped with a 190&amp;nbsp;hp 351 cubic inch engine, 4-speed automatic transmission and full optional Police Package including front [[bullbar]], canine cage insert, and [[Appleton spotlight]]s.&lt;ref name="CRO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cars from Movies – The Blues Brothers' Bluesmobile |url=https://www.coolridesonline.net/news-blog/cars-from-movies-the-blues-brothers-bluesmobile/|website=Cool Rides Online|publisher=Gold Eagle Co.|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Livery#Modern usage|Livery]] is a classic "Black &amp; White" paint theme common to many American police departments; in this case, very similar to the [[California Highway Patrol]]'s [[Police dog|K-9 unit]], with "safety and service" motto on the fenders.

===Chase and crash scenes===

''Blues Brothers 2000'' sought to outdo the original by including a number of outrageous stunts. The new Bluesmobile was depicted as having abilities such as functioning like a submarine in deep Mississippi water, having radio-control capabilities, and jumping about 300 feet over a road construction site. The new film claimed the world record for the highest number of cars destroyed at 104, beating the record set by ''The Blues Brothers''.&lt;ref name="CRO" /&gt; In the film's major crash scene, 63 cars were destroyed. While filming another scene, stuntman Bob Minor suffered serious head injuries and a crew member required a leg amputation after a car rolled on to him.&lt;ref name="Tel"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hawkes|first1=Rebecca|title=The greatest movie car stunts of all time, and the stories behind them|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/20/film-car-chases-and-stunts-7-true-stories/|website=The Telegraph|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ry"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kadel|first1=Jessica|title=9 of the Biggest Car Crashes In Films|url=https://www.rybrook.co.uk/magazine/news/9-of-the-biggest-car-crashes-in-films-visualised/|website=Rybrook Driver's Life Magazine|publisher=Rybrook Holdings Ltd|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Renault(dodge)50series.png|thumb|right|Renault Dodge 50 "B56" (5600kg) with crew-cab and box body, formerly of British Gas, seen here working for [[Aid Convoy]] on a humanitarian project to the former [[Yugoslavia]].]]

The '''Dodge 50 Series''', later known as the '''Renault 50 Series''' were light commercial vehicles produced in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] by [[Chrysler Europe]] and later [[Renault Véhicules Industriels]] between 1979 and 1993.

The 50 series included a wide range of chassis and body configurations, including two distinctly different cab designs, and spanned the {{convert|3500|-|7500|kg|lb|abbr=on}} revenue weight range. Various engines were offered, including the [[Perkins Engines|Perkins]] Phaser and [[Perkins 4.236|4.236]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.dodge50.co.uk/dodge50/fuelindex.htm | title = Index for 4.236 Perkins Engine Fuel system | publisher = Dodge50.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there was also a [[four-wheel-drive]] version, the [[RB44]], built by Reynolds Boughton (now known as [[Boughton Engineering]]). 

==Versions==
Bodybuilding companies converted many into various configurations from tipper trucks to buses. Many were built as "chassis cabs" to have box bodies fitted; these were widely used by utility companies in the UK. They often came fitted with compressors and generators. Gradually this kind of vehicle fell out of favour, partly due to reliability issues relating to combining plant equipment with the vehicle drivetrain. The vehicle is otherwise toughly built. The utility companies today favour smaller vans with towed generators. The four-wheel-drive version saw some use with the [[British army]] since it was one of very few British-built trucks of the class, and it could carry considerably more stores and equipment than even the largest [[Land Rover]] models.

Chrysler received financial assistance from the [[British Government]] which was desperate to support the ailing [[British motor industry]]. However, having inherited various struggling car and commercial vehicle marques (and factories) from the [[Rootes Group]], notably the commercial marques [[Commer]] and [[Karrier]], in addition to various French concerns, Chrysler Europe struggled to return a profit. In 1978, Chrysler pulled out of their European operations altogether, selling them to [[Peugeot]]. The cars and small vans became known as [[Talbot]]s.

==Peugeot takeover==
[[File:British Army Renault 50 series.jpg|thumb|left|4x4 Reynolds Boughton RB44 of the British Army]]
However, Peugeot had little interest in commercial vehicles and the factory for the heavier models was run in partnership with Renault Véhicules Industriels, who sought a UK production site for engines for their existing Renault-branded models. They continued to manufacture the 50 Series, along with the small Dodge (formerly [[Commer]]) Spacevan, and the large [[Dodge 100 "Commando"|Dodge 100 / Commando 2 Series]] of {{convert|7500|-|23000|kg|lb|abbr=on}} trucks. The transition to Renault branding was slightly muddied by some vehicles bearing both a Dodge name and a Renault-diamond badge.

===Renault 50===
By 1987, the 50 Series had been updated and was badged as the Renault 50 Series or Desoto 50 Series in Bermuda; the UK incarnation of the Dodge marque ceased to be used for new vehicles. (Chrysler maintained an entirely separate [[Dodge]] brand in the U.S., and in 2006 began re-introducing Dodge car models from the USA into the UK market.) Renault continued to manufacture the 50 Series until 1993, but it was never a great sales success, even being forced to compete with other Renault products, in the form of the [[Renault Master|Master]] van, which Renault favoured in its export markets.

In 1994, Renault — keen to clear the factory for large-scale engine production — sold the production tooling to a Chinese manufacturer. The 50 series is still being produced in China under a different name.

The '''A100''' is a range of [[United States|American]] [[compact van]]s and [[truck]]s manufactured and marketed from 1964 to 1970 by [[Chrysler Corporation]] under the [[Dodge]] marque in the United States and the [[Fargo Trucks|Fargo]] marque in Canada.

The A100 competed with the [[Ford Econoline]] and [[Chevrolet Van]] and Chevy Corvair Greenbrier, as well as the [[Volkswagen Type 2]]. The range included a [[pickup truck]] and [[van]], both with a "[[forward control]]" design. Placing the driver on top of the front axle with the engine near the front wheels is called a "[[cab over]]" vehicle. The nose was flat, with the engine placed between the driver and passenger, who sat above the front axle. The [[Monocoque|unibody]] vehicles used a short, {{convert|90|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase. An '''A108''' was also available from 1967 to 1970, with a longer {{convert|108|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase. The A108 was popular with camper conversion companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/trucks/a-trucks.html |title=Dodge A-trucks |publisher=allpar |date= |accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A substantially modified, [[Chrysler Hemi engine#Hemi design reintroduced|Hemi]]-powered A100 wheelstanding exhibition pickup called the [[Dodge Little Red Wagon|"Little Red Wagon"]] driven by Bill "Maverick" Golden was a popular drag strip attraction from the 1960s to the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/littleredwagon.html |title=Little Red Wagon |publisher=allpar |date= |accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dodge A100 was featured in the American television series ''[[That '70s Show]]'' episode "Red's Last Day", as [[Michael Kelso]]'s new van.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_66725-Dodge-A-100-1965.html|title=1965 Dodge A-100 in 'That '70s Show, 1998-2006'|publisher=[[Internet Movie Cars Database]]|accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also appeared in the movie ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' as the character [[List of Cars characters|Dusty Rust-eze]], in the remake of ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'', as well as the comedy ''[[Stealing Harvard]]''.  An A100 appeared in many different colors in the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' TV series. More often than not, it was the preferred getaway vehicle of each episode's villain.

The [[Dodge Little Red Wagon]] was a famous exhibition drag racing truck introduced in 1965 based on the A100 pickup.

The [[Dodge Custom 880|880]] now took the Polara's former place in the lineup.

The '''1955 [[Dodge]]''' lineup, consisting of the entry-level [[Dodge Coronet|Coronet]], [[Dodge Royal|Royal]], and ornate [[Dodge Custom Royal|Custom Royal]], was a major departure for the company.  Driven almost out of business in 1953 and 1954, the [[Chrysler Corporation]] was revived with a $250 million loan from [[Prudential Financial|Prudential]] and new models designed by [[Virgil Exner]].  The Dodge lineup was positioned as the mainstream line in Chrysler's hierarchy, between [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] and [[Plymouth automobile|Plymouth]].

==Overview==

The 1955 Dodge was all-new with a 120&amp;nbsp;in (3048&amp;nbsp;mm) wheelbase and 212.1&amp;nbsp;in (5387&amp;nbsp;mm) overall length, longer than the 1954 cars.  They shared their basic mechanicals with the [[DeSoto Custom]], but had distinct styling.  These cars lasted through the 1956 [[model year]] before being replaced by an all-new [[1957 Dodge|1957]].

There were six body styles and four trim levels for 1955:

|}

==Coronet==

The '''Coronet''' (and '''Suburban''' [[station wagon]]) was the base model.  This was the only line to feature the 230&amp;nbsp;in³ (3.8&amp;nbsp;L) ''[[Chrysler Flathead engine|Getaway]]'' [[Straight-6|I6]] as well as the 270&amp;nbsp;in³ (4.4&amp;nbsp;L) ''[[Chrysler A engine|Red Ram]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]].  Coronets were available in all body styles except the convertible.  Sedans feature "Coronet" badges on the fenders, while the station wagons are called "Suburban".  Although the hardtop coupe was officially named "Lancer", it wore only "Coronet" badges.  [[Turn signal]]s were standard on the Royal and Custom Royal models but optional on the base Coronet.

==Royal==

The '''Royal''' (and '''Sierra''' wagon) were the next step up.  Featuring only the V8 engine, the Royal also lacked the 2-door sedan and wagon models available in the Coronet line.  Early hardtop coupes lack the "Lancer" script, although they were officially Lancers, but later models wore "Royal Lancer" badges.

==Custom Royal==
[[File:1955 Dodge Custom Royal Lancer (27471520606).jpg|thumb|left|1955 Custom Royal Lancer hardtop coupe]]
The flagship model was the '''Custom Royal'''.  All hardtop coupe and Custom Royal-only convertible models were called "Custom Royal Lancer". The Custom line featured unique chrome tailfins (although early model year cars went without this trim), special tail light surrounds, and an upscale interior.  Backup lights were standard on the Custom line but optional on all others. The Custom Royal also featured the hemi 270 CID Super Red Ram engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1955_Dodge/1955_Dodge_Brochure/1955%20Dodge-07.html |title=Directory Index: Dodge/1955_Dodge/1955_Dodge_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==La Femme==
: ''See also [[Dodge La Femme]]''

The '''La Femme''' was a special package oriented towards women, who made up an increasing share of Dodge buyers.  It came in Heather Rose and Sapphire White colors and included a cape, boots, umbrella, and shoulder bag that matched the floral tapestry-like fabrics.  Changes to the car include built-in compartments in the seatbacks to hold these accessories.

==Technical specifications==
[[File:1955 Plodge (5794607621).jpg|thumb|Canadian-built 1955 [[Dodge Mayfair]], a [[Plymouth Belvedere]] with a Dodge front end]]
Power came from either a {{convert|230|cid|L|0|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler Flathead engine|flathead]] [[straight-6 engine|straight six]] or one of two {{convert|270|cid|L|0|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8s]].  The regular [[Chrysler A engine|Red Ram]] V8 was standard on the Royal and optional on the Coronet.  A [[Hemi engine|hemi]] V8 (the [[Chrysler FirePower engine#Dodge|Super Red Ram]]) was standard on the Custom Royal.  A rare Power Pack was optional, consisting of a four-barrel [[Carter Carburetor|Carter]] [[carburetor]] and dual exhausts good for {{convert|193|hp|kW PS|lk=on|abbr=on}} with the Hemi engine.

Two transmissions were offered: a three-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] with optional [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] and Chrysler's two-speed [[PowerFlite]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]. The PowerFlite was controlled by a dash-mounted lever, though this was changed to a push-button setup for 1956.

The cars used a special [[coil spring]]/[[kingpin (mechanics)|kingpin]] suspension in front and regular [[leaf spring]]s and a [[live axle]] at the rear.  Power steering was optional.  A six-volt electrical system was updated to 12 volts in 1956.

==1956==
The 1956 '''D-500''' was a high-performance model derived from the standard 1956 Dodge but differing in many ways.  It included a heavy duty suspension and other chassis upgrades from the [[Chrysler New Yorker|New Yorker]] and [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]] lines, upgraded brakes, and a high-performance 315&amp;nbsp;in³ (5.2&amp;nbsp;L) [[Chrysler FirePower engine#Dodge|Hemi-head]] [[V8 engine|V8]].  A four-barrel Carter carburetor pushed output to 260&amp;nbsp;hp (194&amp;nbsp;kW) and 330&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (447&amp;nbsp;N·m).  The 3-speed [[manual transmission]] was standard, with the PowerFlite 2-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] as an option.  A rare [[NASCAR]]-specific option was the D-500-1(Dash-1), which upped power to 285&amp;nbsp;hp (213&amp;nbsp;kW).  The D-500 originally used only the Coronet 2-door sedan and Royal Lancer hardtop and convertible bodies.

The '''Dodge St. Regis''' is an [[automobile]] that was marketed by the [[Dodge]] division of the [[Chrysler Corporation]].  The first example of [[Downsize (automobile)|downsizing]] of the full-size Dodge sedan line, the St. Regis replaced the Monaco after its 13-year model run.  Deriving its name from a 1950s Chrysler trim package, the St. Regis was the largest Dodge sedan, slotted above the mid-size Diplomat and Aspen.  In contrast to its predecessor and the smaller Diplomat, the St. Regis was offered solely as a four-door sedan.      

Marketed across a single generation from 1979 to 1981, the St. Regis is among the shortest-produced Dodge sedans; the next full-size Dodge sedan was the 1990 Dodge Monaco (derived from the [[Eagle Premier]]), with Dodge not producing a rear-wheel drive sedan until the [[Dodge Charger (LX/LD)|2006 Dodge Charger]].    

The Dodge St. Regis was assembled alongside the Chrysler Newport, Chrysler New Yorker, and Plymouth Gran Fury by Chrysler at its [[Lynch Road Assembly]] facility in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], becoming the final production vehicles produced at the facility; 64,502 examples were produced in total.'''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;'''

== Design overview ==
[[File:80 Dodge St.Regis (6038143486).jpg|thumb|left|1980 Dodge St.Regis]]
[[File:80 Dodge St.Regis Instrument Panel (6356203509).jpg|thumb|left|Interior]]The Dodge St. Regis was based on the rear wheel drive [[Chrysler R platform|Chrysler R-body]] platform.  As a less-costly alternative of downsizing the C-body platform (redesigned for 1974), the R-body was an update of the B-body platform (redesigned in 1971, first dating to 1962).   Used by a wide variety of Chrysler intermediates, the B-body chassis underpinned model lines ranging from the Dodge Coronet and Plymouth Belvedere to the Dodge Charger and Chrysler Cordoba.  

In comparison to its 1977 Dodge Royal Monaco predecessor, the Dodge St. Regis shed 5.5 inches in length, 2.7 inches in width, 3 inches in wheelbase, and nearly 900 pounds of curb weight (dependent on powertrain).  The 400 and 440 big-block V8s were discontinued, with the St. Regis continuing the use of the 225 inline-6 and the 318 and 360 V8s.  All three engines were paired to a three-speed automatic.

The "St. Regis" name first saw use as an uplevel trim package on the 1956 [[Chrysler New Yorker|New Yorker]] [[hardtop]] [[Coupé|coupe]], and again on the 1974–78 [[Chrysler New Yorker Brougham]] [[coupe]].  Offered only as a four-door [[notchback]] [[sedan (car)|sedan]], the St. Regis was styled with frameless door glass (although the rear quarter glass was fixed).  To distinguish it from its [[Plymouth Gran Fury]], [[Chrysler Newport]], and [[Chrysler New Yorker]] counterparts, the front fascia adapted transparent retractable headlamp covers (introduced on the 1978 [[Dodge Magnum]]).

==Market timing==
The Chrysler R-body cars (like their 1974–78 predecessors) arrived at precisely the wrong time, as a second [[1979 energy crisis|gasoline crisis]] hit the U.S. in 1979.  While shifting to an intermediate chassis allowed the St. Regis a smaller exterior footprint over the Monaco, it remained far larger than its Ford LTD and Chevrolet Caprice competitors.  In contrast to the clean-sheet Ford and GM designs, the dire financial situation of Chrysler relegated the company to retool an existing chassis.  

Coinciding with the fuel crisis, high interest rates and the uncertain future of the company forced Chrysler into a high proportion of fleet sales for its full-size sedans, with nearly 30% of St. Regis production dedicated for police/law enforcement use.{{Cn|date=December 2019}}  Initially, Chrysler withdrew Plymouth from the full-size segment (making the Volare the largest Plymouth for 1979); for 1980, a Plymouth version of the R-body was introduced, nearly exclusively for fleet sales.  

== Discontinuation ==
The Chrysler R platform was dropped during the middle of the 1981 model year, with the Dodge St. Regis ending its product run (as did the Chrysler Newport).  For 1982, the mid-size Diplomat was marketed as the largest Dodge sedan; while nearly 16 inches shorter, the model line served as the primary vehicle for Chrysler law enforcement sales through the 1980s.   

For 1990, the Dodge brand re-entered the full-size segment with a front-wheel drive Dodge Monaco, a counterpart of the Eagle Premier (both derived from the [[Renault 25]]).  For 1993, Dodge introduced its first full size front-wheel drive car developed by Chrysler, the [[Dodge Intrepid]].  While closer in exterior size to the Diplomat, the Intrepid nearly matches the St. Regis in interior room.

==Use in law enforcement==
{{Original research section|section=|date=February 2019}}
Following its introduction, the Dodge St. Regis saw use as a [[police car]] in the United States.  Outside of California, a 195-hp 360 V8 engine was available as part of the A38 Police Package; the option package was popular by law enforcement of the time.  In California, the St. Regis was fitted with a 190 hp four-bbl 360 V8.  For 1980, the 360 was replaced by a 155 hp 318 V8 4-bbl with California emissions to comply with state emissions regulations.  The change in powertrain was unpopular, as officers found the top speed of the vehicle was reduced to below 100 mph when fitted with a lightbar (or 65 mph on a grade).  

Coinciding with efforts to expedite the retirement of the St. Regis from patrol service, in 1982 the [[California Highway Patrol|CHP]] adopted the '[[Ford Mustang SSP|Ford Mustang Severe Service Package]]' that was a [[Police car|police pursuit vehicle (PPV)]].

==Television and collectors==
The St. Regis also served as a workhorse on police-based television series in the 1980s, most prominently on ''[[Sledge Hammer!]]'' and ''[[T.J. Hooker]]''.

Although the St. Regis does not hold much collector value today, fans of Chrysler products sometimes search [[Wreck yard|junkyards]] for the cars' [[disc brakes]] as an upgrade for earlier cars such as the [[Dodge Dart]] and [[Plymouth Barracuda]]. With the small number built, and the high percentage that were destroyed in film and TV work in the 1980s, very few St. Regis survive today.

The '''Dodge Dart''' is a line of automobiles marketed by [[Dodge]] from the 1959 to 1976 model years in North America, with production extended to later years in various other markets.

The Dart name originally appeared on a 1956 Chrysler [[show car]] featuring a streamlined body designed by the Italian coachbuilder [[Carrozzeria Ghia]] that was later modified and renamed the Dart Diablo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schreiber |first=Ronnie |title=Chrysler Dart Diablo Concept, an Italian-American Beauty |url= https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2015/11/chrysler-dart-diablo-concept-italian-american-beauty/ |website=The Truth About Cars |accessdate=24 October 2019 |date=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production Dart was introduced as a lower-priced, [[full-size]] Dodge in 1960 and 1961, became a [[mid-size car]] for 1962, and then was a [[compact car|compact]] from 1963 to 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carstyling.ru/cars.1956_Chrysler_Dart.html |title=1956 Chrysler Dart |publisher=Carstyling.ru |date=2001-06-01 |accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://classiccars.about.com/b/2008/05/22/the-1957-chrysler-diablo-is-going-on-the-block.htm |title=1957 Chrysler Diablo |publisher=Classiccars.about.com |date=2008-05-22 |accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dart nameplate was resurrected for a [[Dodge Dart (PF)|Fiat-derived compact car]] that was introduced in 2012.

=== 1960 ===
The first Dodge Darts were introduced for the 1960 model year. They were [[Downsize (automobile)|downsized]] large cars developed to replace the [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] in the standard, low-priced car segment for the Dodge dealer network. Dodge dealers had been selling Plymouths since 1930, but divisional restructuring took the Plymouth brand away from the Dodge dealer network. Project planners proposed the name Dart, only to have Chrysler executives demand an expensive research program which produced the name Zipp. This was promptly rejected in favor of Dart.&lt;ref name="Witzenburg"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Witzenburg |first=Gary |title=The Name Game |journal=Motor Trend |date=April 1984|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the cancellation of Chrysler's upper level [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] brand, upper level Dodge products were pushed upmarket, while using Plymouth products with more features for lower-level Dodge products.

The Dart sedans and coupes were based on the unibody Plymouth [[Automobile platform|platform]] with a {{convert|118|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase, shorter than the standard-size Dodge line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1960_Dodge/1960_Dodge_Dart_Brochure/1960%20Dodge%20Dart%20Brochure-04.html |title=1960 Dodge Dart Brochure|page=4 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Dart station wagons used the same {{convert|122|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase as the upmarket [[Dodge Polara|Polara]] wagons. The Dart line was offered in three trim levels: the basic Seneca, mid-range Pioneer, and premium Phoenix. The new Dart came standard with a new engine, the {{convert|225|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler Slant 6 engine|slant-six]]. The {{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} (standard equipment on certain Phoenix and Pioneer body styles) and {{convert|361|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]]s were optional with two-barrel or four-barrel [[carburetor]]s, and with single or dual exhaust. The Dodge {{convert|383|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 was added in 1961.&lt;ref name=Dodge_Story&gt;{{cite book|last=McPherson|first=Thomas A.|title=The Dodge Story|publisher=Motorbooks |year=1992|isbn=978-0-87938-697-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brakes were 11-inch drums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1960_Dodge/1960_Dodge_Dart_Brochure/1960%20Dodge%20Dart%20Brochure-05.html |title=1960 Dodge Dart Brochure |page=5 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sales of the new Dart were greater than those of the full-size [[Dodge Matador]] and [[Dodge Polara]], which also created an in-house competitor for Plymouth.&lt;ref name=Dodge_Story/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newhouse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foundationpc.com/ |title=Joseph David Newhouse's Dodge Dart compendium |publisher=Foundationpc.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title='64 Dodge Dart: Road test of the new MoPar compact |journal=Motor Trend |date=December 1963 |page=30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising from 1960 and 1961 compared the Dart to the "C" car ([[Chevrolet]]), the "F" car ([[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]) and the "P" car (Plymouth). After the economic downturn of 1958-59, Dodge production for 1960 rebounded to a 367,804 cars, the division's highest total to date and good for sixth place behind Chevrolet, Ford, Plymouth, Rambler, and Pontiac. Chrysler officials were somewhat less comforted at how 87% of Dodge's volume consisted of the low-profit Dart line, compared to the upmarket Matador and Polara, of which only 41,000 were sold for the 1960 model year.

As the Dart's sales climbed, Plymouth's sales dropped. Chrysler executives did little to stop the infighting between the divisions. Dart sales were so strong in 1960 that production of the medium-priced model lines were reduced. The full-size, mid-priced Matador was discontinued after the 1960 model year as buyers selected the slightly smaller but better-appointed and less expensive Dart Phoenix. The premium Polara remained in the medium-price segment in 1961.&lt;ref name=Dodge_Story/&gt;

=== 1961 ===
For the 1961 model year, the Dart continued as the smallest full-size Dodge. It retained the {{convert|118|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase, and was restyled to emulate the larger Polara. The same three trim levels were available: the premium Phoenix, mid-range Pioneer, and base Seneca. Once again, wagons shared the Polara's 122 in/310&amp;nbsp;cm wheelbase; they also shared the Polara's unique side-mounted taillights.

Engine choices included the {{convert|225|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} slant-six, and the {{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|361|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8s were also available in various configurations. Phoenix convertibles were equipped with V8 engines. Beginning mid-year, some Darts ordered with the 225 engine were equipped with the die-cast aluminum block. Darts in all series were equipped as standard with three-speed, column-shifted [[manual transmission]]s. Chrysler's pushbutton-shifted [[TorqueFlite]] automatic was available at extra cost. The [[alternator (auto)|alternator]], introduced as standard equipment in 1960 on the [[Plymouth Valiant|Valiant]], replaced the previous DC generator on all 1961 Chrysler products. Canadian-built 1961 Darts were identical to U.S. models on the outside, but the interior trim, controls, and displays were those used on the U.S. Plymouth.&lt;ref name=Dodge_Story/&gt;

[[File:1961 Dodge Seneca rear.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view, showing small, low-mounted taillights]]
[[File:Dodge Phoenix 1961.JPG|thumb|The [[Dodge RD4 Phoenix]] was an Australian-assembled variant of the 1961 Dodge Dart Phoenix.]]

[[Virgil Exner]]'s 1961 styling with its reverse fins, rear fender scalloping (the taillights were widely referred to as "ingrown toenails") and concave grille was highly unpopular with consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Slant-6 ''News'', ASIN B00192J1O4&lt;/ref&gt; The low position and small size of the Dart's [[Automotive lighting|tail lights]], just above the corners of the bumper, was also criticized and drivers of following cars complained that they could not see them. The wraparound taillights projected light sideward, not rearward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Flory |first=J. Kelly |title=American Cars, 1960–1972: Every Model, Year by Year|publisher=McFarland |year=2004 |page=100 |isbn=978-0-7864-1273-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-year, Dodge made auxiliary taillights available at extra cost through its dealer network. However, these large round lights were mounted near the inboard side of the reverse fins, and aggravated the already awkward styling.&lt;ref&gt;1961 Chrysler Corporation Passenger Car Parts Catalogue, PLC 8-55&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1961 automobile market was generally an off year for automobile sales, and Dodge production went down to 269,367 units, of which 142,708 were Darts.&lt;ref name="Flory, pp.37 &amp; 102"&gt;Flory, pp.37 &amp; 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Among all the Darts sold, almost half (66,100) were the Seneca line, down from 111,600 in 1960.&lt;ref name="Flory, pp.37 &amp; 102"/&gt; Combined sales of Dart and Polara were lower than Plymouth's sales for 1961. Dodge ranked ninth in sales in the American market in 1961, down from sixth place in 1960. Sales of the compact [[Dodge Lancer]] were 74,773 units compared to its Plymouth twin, the Valiant, which sold 143,078 units for the same year.&lt;ref name=Dodge_Story/&gt; The 1961 model year saw Dodge's total production drop below the slow selling 1959 model year and almost the disastrous [[recession]] year of 1958 when Dodge faced the consequences of the poor reputation of its 1957 models.&lt;ref name=Dodge_Story/&gt;

}}

For 1962 the Seneca, Pioneer, and Phoenix trim levels were dropped; trim levels became Dart, Dart 330, and Dart 440. The Polara 500, offered in 2-door hardtop, 4-door hardtop, and convertible styles, was dimensionally identical but not officially a Dart by dint of its "Polara 500" badging. The Polara 500 was not built or sold in Canada, and the Dart models were the same as in the U.S. except that the base model was badged ''Dart 220''.&lt;ref&gt;1962 Dodge "New Lean Breed" Canadian brochure&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dart and Polara were downsized as part of Chrysler's hasty effort to compete with what company leaders thought would be downsized large cars from Chevrolet—in fact they had overheard talk not of the big Chevrolets but of the compact [[Chevrolet Nova|Chevy II Nova]], a basic front-engine compact to compete more directly than the [[Chevrolet Corvair|Corvair]] with the [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]], [[Rambler American]], and [[Plymouth Valiant]]. Chevrolet's [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]] and Ford's [[Ford Galaxie|Galaxie]] both remained sized in accord with the prevailing norms of full-size cars.

The redesigned Dart was perceived more as an intermediate, like the [[Rambler Classic]] or the [[Ford Fairlane (North America)|Ford Fairlane]]. When Dodge dealers voiced their displeasure at having no true full-size car to offer, Chrysler quickly created the [[Dodge Custom 880]] in January 1962 by putting the 1961 Dodge Polara front end assembly on a version of the 1962 [[Chrysler Newport]] body.&lt;ref name=Dodge_Story/&gt;

The 1962 Dart, like the Plymouth, was on a new lightweight [[Monocoque|unibody]] [[Chrysler B platform|"B" platform]], featuring Chrysler's well-received "Torsion-Aire" torsion bar front suspension and asymmetric rear leaf springs. The rigidity gained through the nearly pure unibody platform combined with the suspension's low unsprung weight and near-ideal geometry provided sound handling, braking, and acceleration; the latter especially with the mid-year {{convert|415|hp|kW|abbr=on}} "Ramcharger" {{convert|413|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 which was aimed primarily at sanctioned drag racing, where it quickly broke performance records.

The Dart's new B-body chassis platform was quite long-lived; while 1962 was the only year for a B-body model named "Dart", the B platform remained in use with only very slight modification and a few new letter designations through to the 1981 [[Chrysler R platform|R-body]] cars.

For 1963, Dodge made a last-minute decision to drop the [[Dodge Lancer|Lancer]] name in favor of ''Dart'' for Dodge's newly designed "senior compact", a marketing term referring to the wheelbase having grown to {{convert|111|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} from the Lancer's {{convert|106.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. This longer wheelbase used the same A-body suspension of the Valiant and defunct Lancer, and would underpin all Darts from 1963 to 1976 except the 1963–1966 station wagons which used the Valiant's ({{convert|106|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase) and the 1971–1976 Demon/Sport which used the [[Plymouth Duster]]'s {{convert|108|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase. The longer wheelbase gave more rear seat legroom than the previous Lancer or the contemporaneous Valiant. The Dart was available as a 2- or 4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]], a 2-door hardtop coupe, a [[station wagon]], and a convertible. Three trim levels were offered: the low-spec ''170'', the high-spec ''270'', and the premium ''GT'', which was available only as a 2-door hardtop or convertible. The 1963 Dart has a turning diameter of {{convert|38.9|ft|m|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1963_Dodge/1963_Dodge_Dart_Brochure/1963%20Dodge%20Dart-10.html |title=1963 Dodge Dart Brochure |page=10 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dart was an instant market success, with 1963 sales up sharply compared to those of the 1962 Lancer. The Dart remained extremely popular through the end of the Dart's production run in 1976 in comparison to the [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]] and the [[Chevrolet Nova]].&lt;ref name=Dodge_Story/&gt;

[[File:Dodge Dart 4-Door Sedan 1966.jpg|thumb|left|1966 Dart sedan]]

Initial engine offerings were two sizes of the slant-six: a {{convert|170|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}, {{convert|101|hp|kW|abbr=on}} version was fitted as standard equipment, and a {{convert|225|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}, {{convert|145|hp|kW|abbr=on}} version was available for less than $50 extra. The aluminum engine block for the 225 was discontinued early in the 1963 model year. After the start of the 1964 model year, an all-new, compact, lightweight {{convert|273|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler LA engine|LA V8]] producing {{convert|180|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} with a 2-barrel carburetor was introduced as the top engine option. 1964 was the last year for pushbutton control of the optional [[Torqueflite]] automatic transmission, so 1963 and 1964 models were the only compact Darts so equipped.&lt;ref name=Dodge_Story/&gt; Standard axle ratios in 1964 were 2.93:1 with automatic transmission and 225 engine, or 3.23:1 with manual transmission and 225 engine, or with 170 engine and either transmission. A 3.55:1 ratio was optional.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1964"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1964_Dodge/1964_Dodge_Dart_Brochure/1964%20Dodge%20Dart-10-11.html |title=1964 Dodge Dart Brochure |pages=10–11 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; New features included stronger door locks and a refined automatic choke.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1964"/&gt;

In 1965, the 2-barrel 273 remained available, but a new performance version of the 273 engine was released with a 4-barrel carburetor, 10.5:1 compression, a more aggressive camshaft with solid tappets, and other upgrades which increased output to {{convert|235|bhp|kW|abbr=on}}. At the same time, the Dodge Dart Charger was offered. The Dart Chargers were yellow Dart GT hardtops with black interiors, Commando 273 engines, premium mechanical and trim specifications, and special "Charger" badging. They were the first Dodge models to bear the "Charger" name. The following year the larger [[Chrysler B platform|B-body]] [[Dodge Charger]] was introduced, and the "Charger" name was thenceforth associated with Dart models only in the "Charger 225" marketing name for the optional larger 6-cylinder engine.

Other new options for 1965 included upgraded suspension components and larger {{convert|14|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheels and tires. Factory-installed air conditioning became available after the start of the 1965 model year, as well as [[disc brake]]s, which required the {{convert|14|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheels to clear the calipers. Front seat belts became standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/new/171110/1965%20Dodge%20Full%20Line/1965%20Dodge%20Full%20Line-03.html |title=1965 Dodge Full Line |page=3 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Engines ===
The {{convert|170|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Slant-6 engine remained standard equipment, though its power rating rose from {{convert|101|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} to {{convert|115|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} for 1967, owing to the installation of the 225 engine's larger carburetor and the revised camshaft the bigger engine had received in 1965. For North American domestic-market vehicles, the base 170 engine was replaced for 1970 with a stronger new {{convert|198|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} version of the slant-6. This new base engine was also less costly to make, for unlike the previous 170 engine, the 198 used the same block as the 225. The smaller displacement was achieved with a new crankshaft ({{convert|3.64|in|mm|abbr=on}} stroke vs. the {{convert|4.125|in|mm|abbr=on}} stroke of the 225 crank) and connecting rods ({{convert|7.006|in|mm|abbr=on}} long vs. the {{convert|6.67|in|mm|abbr=on}} rods in the 225).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weertman |first=William L. |title=Chrysler Engines, 1922-1998 |publisher=SAE International |isbn=978-0-7680-1642-0 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the 225 remained an upgrade option. The 2-barrel {{convert|273|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} small-block V8 was supplanted on the option list in 1968 by a {{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} 2-barrel engine. The 318 was rated at {{convert|230|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} versus the 2-barrel carbureted 273's {{convert|180|bhp|kW|abbr=on}}. At the same time the 4-barrel carbureted 273 {{convert|235|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} was replaced on the options list by the {{convert|275|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} 4-barrel carbureted {{convert|340|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} available only in the 1968–1972 Swinger and the hottest Dart, the performance-oriented GTS models. The Dart GTS came standard with the {{convert|340|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8. A {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{convert|383|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} big-block was optional.

=== 1967 ===
The Dart and its sister model—the Plymouth Valiant—were substantially redesigned for the 1967 model year. In addition to new styling, the cars received revised steering systems, wider front track and frame rail spacing, and redesigned [[Crossmember|K-members]] capable of accepting larger engines. The Dart would keep this basic form, with [[Facelift (automotive)|facelifts]] consisting of revised front and rear end styling and interior trim, until the end of A-body production in 1976 for North America and 1981 for South America.

The restyled Dart for 1967 featured a rear window with compound inverse curves. This created a unique appearance at the rear of the [[Greenhouse (automotive)|greenhouse]], but tended to collect snow and created thick [[pillar (car)|C-pillars]] that looked formal but created blindspots for drivers. Curved side glass was used for the first time on a Chrysler compact. Up front, there was a new dual-plane front end contour: the center section of the grille, bumper and leading edge of the hood were recessed from the front plane of the car. The single headlamps were placed forward of the recessed center section, defining the front plane. Park/turn lamps were set into the grille, in the corners formed by the transition area between the recessed and forward sections. This same front end treatment, with minor cosmetic changes to the grille and the park/turn lamps relocated to the front bumper, was also used by Chrysler Australia for their 1967 VE-model Valiant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Tony|title= The Valiant Book|publisher=Marque Publishing |year=1987|isbn=0-947079-00-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the new design, changes were made to the Dart lineup, beginning with the elimination of its station wagons and the base model's "170" designation. The only body styles were the 2- and 4-door sedans, the hardtop, and the convertible. The base 170 model was now badged simply as "Dart". The 270 and GT versions carried on unchanged for the most part. In late 1967, the GTS model debuted but was built in limited quantities due to its lateness in the model year; the 1968 GTS would be, arguably, improved by fitting the new high-output {{convert|340|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]] as standard equipment.&lt;ref name=Dodge_Story/&gt;

The 1967 Dart, along with all other 1967 Chrysler products, got a new dual-circuit brake hydraulic system to ensure loss of pressure in the front brakes would not prevent the rear brakes from working, and vice versa. The system also incorporated a brake system fault [[Tell-tale (automotive)|telltale]] on the dashboard.&lt;ref name="Dual"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.imperialclub.com/Repair/Lit/Master/232/cover.htm |title=Dual Hydraulic Brake System: Chrysler Corporation Master Technician Service Conference reference book 67-3 |year=1967 |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other changes to comply with new federal safety laws included collapsible steering columns, additional padding on the dashboard and sunvisors. Shoulder belt anchors were also provided for front outboard occupants.

The 1967 redesign removed all traces of the older Virgil Exner styling that proved less popular by the early 1960s.  The newer body was trimmer and proved extremely popular, causing sales of the Dart to surpass compacts from Ford and GM.

=== 1968 ===
[[File:'68 Dodge Dart GTS (Les chauds vendredis '10).jpg|thumb|left|1968 Dart GTS convertible]]
Changes for 1968 were relatively subtle. The park and turn lights in the [[Grille (car)|grille]] were moved slightly inboard and made round. [[Automotive lighting|Side marker lights]] were added to the front fenders and rear [[quarter panel]]s, to comply with newly introduced [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108]]. Shoulder harnesses (separate, this year and until 1973, from the lap belts) and non-glare [[Paint sheen|matte]] finish on the [[windshield wiper]] arms were also part of the 1968 federally mandated safety package. Chrysler's "Clean Air Package" [[Vehicle emissions control|emission control system]] became standard equipment on cars sold in all 50 states.&lt;ref name=eng68&gt;''Engineering Features for 1968'', Chrysler Corporation, September 1967&lt;/ref&gt; The steering linkage was revised again, as were the windshield and rear window gaskets and trim-lock strips, leaving the 1967 pieces as one-year-only items. The standard [[rear axle]] ratio was dropped from 2.93 to 2.76 with all standard-performance engines and [[automatic transmission]]. Part-throttle downshift functionality was added as a refinement to the [[TorqueFlite]] automatic transmission in 6-cylinder cars, to retain acceptable city performance with the taller rear axle ratio.&lt;ref name=eng68/&gt;

==== Hemi Dart ====

A limited option for 1968 only, code L023,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = '68 Hurst HEMI Dart L023: Is This The World's Fastest Muscle Car? - Street Legal TV|url = http://www.streetlegaltv.com/news/68-hurst-hemi-dart-l023-is-this-the-worlds-fastest-muscle-car/|website = Street Legal TV|access-date = 2016-01-29|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Hurst-reworked Hemi Darts used the 426 Hemi engine. These special models (only 80 were made) were created strictly for [[drag racing]], and included a non-warranty disclaimer. On February 20, 1968, corporate headquarters in [[Highland Park, Michigan]], sent out a press release to Dodge [[Car dealerships in North America|dealerships across the country]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 1968 Dodge Hemi Dart Lightweight Sold New at Grand-Spaulding Dodge {{!}} Mecum Auctions|url = https://www.mecum.com/lot-detail/SC0513-153374/10111/1968-Dodge-Hemi-Dart-Lightweight/3-Speed/|website = Mecum Auctions|access-date = 2016-01-31|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a promotional pitch purposed at selling drag-ready, Hemi-powered Darts. The press release stated that Dodge wanted to make a factory built and ready drag racer out of the 68 Dart GTS [[hardtop]] for competition in class B [[Super Stock (drag racing)]]. Engineers stated the new Hemi Dart would reach speeds of {{convert|130|mph|0|abbr=on}} in less than 11 seconds and [[Dragstrip|{{convert|1/4|mi|m|0|abbr=on}}]] times in the 10-11 second range, although times have been reported as low as the 9-10 second range.

To keep weight low, a [[fiberglass]] hood and fenders were used. The hood featured a functional intake scoop and four hood pins for full lift-off removal of the hood. Lightweight acid-dipped steel doors with thin side window glass were used. As the doors lacked a window mechanism, a strap was attached to the bottom of the glass on the interior door-panel. To keep glass up, the strap latched to the inside of the door. The interior included only two [[bucket seat]]s from a Dodge van. [[Center console (automobile)|The center console]], heater, sound deadeners, side-view mirrors, [[Vehicle audio|radio]], [[carpeting]], and even [[armrest]]s were omitted to save weight.

The engine was a race-spec [[Chrysler Hemi engine|Hemi {{convert|426|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]]. These motors had a [[compression ratio]] of 10.25:1 [[piston]]s, [[Bore (engine)|bore]] x [[Stroke (engine)|stroke]] {{convert|4+1/4|x|3+3/4|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} fed through a 2X4-barrel [[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] [[carburetor]]s atop a lightweight crossram aluminum [[intake manifold]] rated at {{convert|425|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} @ 5,000 rpm and a maximum torque of {{convert|490|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 4,000 rpm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myclassicgarage.com/knowledge-base/1968-Dodge-Dart|title=1968 Dodge Dart|website=myclassicgarage.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1968/629285/dodge_dart_gts_2-door_hardtop_426_hemi_v-8_4-speed.html|title=1968 Dodge Dart GTS 2-Door Hardtop 426 Hemi V-8 4-speed|website=automobile-catalog..com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A high-performance [[Mopar]] [[Automotive battery|battery]] was moved to the [[Trunk (car)|trunk]] to free up room and improve [[weight distribution]].

Darts could be ordered wither either a four-speed manual or three-speed automatic transmissions. [[Manual transmission]] equipped cars, code [[List of Chrysler transmissions#Manual|A-833]], featured a [[Dana 44|Dana 931/44]] built heavy duty axle with a 4.88 [[Gear train|gear ratio]], heavy duty [[clutch]], steel bellhousing, and special torque [[Shaft (mechanical engineering)|shaft]] and pivots. Manual transmissions were modified by removing [[Synchronizer (automotive)|synchronizers]] which lowered the chances of missed [[Gear shift|shifts]]. A [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] floor mounted [[Gear stick|shifter]] came standard.

The automatic transmissions were the then new Chrysler built [[TorqueFlite#A727 (36RH/37RH)|727 TorqueFlite]] three speed with 831/44 inch large stem pinion center section with a 4.86 gear set, and a 2,600rpm high speed [[torque converter]]. They were also modified with a floor mounted Hurst shifter for manual shifting.

Other features include heavy duty rear [[Shock absorber|shocks]], heavy duty [[radiator]] with seven blade fan to keep it cool, deep [[Groove (engineering)|groove]] pulleys, a high capacity [[Oil pump (internal combustion engine)|oil pump]], solid-[[Hydraulic tappet|lifter]] cam, and a roller timing chain to reduce stretch and provide more reliable performance. A transistorized dual points breaker distributor coupled with a [[Prestolite Electric|Prestolite]] ignition and solid core wires was also used.

The cars weighed approximately {{convert|3000|lb|0|abbr=on}}. The cars were designed to meet [[Street-legal vehicle|street legal]] requirements, but due to the modifications, the cars came with disclaimers that they were not for street use, but rather "supervised acceleration trials",  or drag racing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 1968 Dodge Dart GTS - 426 Dodge Hemi Engine - Mopar Muscle Magazine|url = http://www.hotrod.com/cars/featured/mopp-0306-1968-dodge-dart-gts/|website = Hot Rod|date = 2003-06-01|access-date = 2016-01-29|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1969 ===
[[File:'69 Dodge Dart Coupe (Les chauds vendredis '11).JPG|thumb|right|1969 Dart Swinger]]
The 2-door sedan was dropped at the end of 1968 and replaced with the Swinger 2-door hardtop for 1969. Also added was the Swinger 340. The entire 1969 Dart range received trim updates including another minor revision of the grille, and a return to rectangular park/turn lights. The 1968 round side marker lights were replaced with rectangular reflectors. Head restraints were optional equipment until January 1, 1969, when their installation became mandatory under federal law. The 6-cylinder models received a carburetor anti-ice system borrowed from Canadian-market Chrysler 6-cylinder engines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Petersen|title=The Petersen automotive troubleshooting &amp; repair manual|publisher=Grosset &amp; Dunlap|year=1975|isbn=978-0-448-11946-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the drum brake automatic adjusters were revised for more consistent operation.&lt;ref&gt;''Engineering Highlights for 1969'', Chrysler Corporation, September 1968&lt;/ref&gt; At the top of the Dart performance range for 1969, there was limited availability of the [[Chrysler RB engine|440 V8]] in the Dart GTS model.

=== 1970 ===
[[File:Swinger.JPG|thumb|right|1970 Dart Swinger]]
The Dart was refreshed for 1970 with front and rear changes designed to bring the car closer to the design themes found in Dodge’s full-size vehicles through grille and contour changes. In the rear, the Dart’s new rectangular tail lights were set into a wedge-shaped rear bumper design continuing the angled trailing edge of the new deck lid and quarter panels. The revised rear styling did not change the 14.1 cubic ft trunk space of the 1969 model. 14-inch wheels became standard equipment, and the {{convert|170|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} slant-6 was replaced by a larger {{convert|198|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} version for improved base-model performance and greater manufacturing economy—the 198 used the same block as the 225, while the 170 had used a different block. Changes to the fuel system improved drivability, economy and emission control. Part-throttle downshift was added to the 8-cylinder automatic transmissions. In compliance with [[FMVSS 108]], side marker lights and reflectors were installed at all four corners. 1970 Darts for the US and Canadian markets were built in Canada at the Windsor, Ontario or Los Angeles, California assembly plant. All 1970 Darts got the federally mandated steering column and ignition lock.

The "Swinger" name was applied to all the Dart two-door hardtops except in the high-line custom series.  A number of other changes were made to the Dart line to avoid internal competition with Dodge's new [[Dodge Challenger|Challenger]]: the Dart convertible was discontinued along with the optional {{convert|383|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, leaving the {{convert|275|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} 340 4-barrel V8 as the top Dart engine.&lt;ref name=Dodge_Story/&gt; The performance model in the Dart line for 1970 was the Swinger 340 2-door hardtop. The 1970 Swinger 340 came with functional hood scoops with 340 emblems. Standard equipment included front disc brakes (only on the Swinger),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1970_Dodge/1970_Dodge_Dart_Brochure/1970%20Dodge%20Dart-11.html |title=1970 Dodge Dart Brochure |page=11 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; heavy duty "Rallye" suspension, a 3.23:1 rear axle ratio, fiberglass-belted bias-ply tires mounted to 14" × 5½" steel wheels, and a bumble bee stripe. Optional equipment included an upgrade over the standard bench seat with all-vinyl bucket seats, with which a center console could be ordered. A performance hood upgrade with scoops was painted flat black with hood tie-down pins. Mechanical options included power-assisted brakes and steering. Rallye wheels and wire wheel covers were also optional, as was a 6000&amp;nbsp;rpm tachometer and a vinyl roof covering in black or white.

=== 1971 ===
[[File:71DartSedan.jpg|thumb|right|1971 Dart sedan with aftermarket fender mirrors]]
The 1970 Dart's dual taillamps were given over to the [[Badge engineering|badge-engineered]] [[Plymouth Valiant#1967–73|Plymouth Valiant Scamp]], while the 1971 Dart received new smaller quad taillamps that would be used through 1973. The Custom 2-door hardtop coupe became the Swinger, and the standard Swinger became the Swinger Special. Dodge gained a version of Plymouth's popular Valiant-based fastback [[Plymouth Duster|Duster]] and was to be named the ''Beaver'',&lt;ref&gt;''Young'', p.150&lt;/ref&gt; but when Chrysler's marketing department learned that "beaver" was [[List of CB slang|CB slang]] for [[vagina]],&lt;ref name=Witzenburg/&gt; the vehicle was renamed the "Dart Demon".

As was the case with previous Dodge rebadges of Plymouth Valiants, such as the 1961–1962 [[Dodge Lancer|Lancer]], sales of the Demon lagged behind those of the Duster. With optional hood scoops and blackout hood treatment, the car was advertised a performance car. The Demon's Dart-type front fender wheel lips and Duster-type rear wheel fender lips reveal the car was essentially a Duster with Dart front sheetmetal and other minor styling changes. A new audio option became available for 1971: Chrysler's cassette-recorder. Unlike the 8-track tapes, the cassette player was relatively compact, and it was mounted on the console or on its own floor-mount casing. This unit offered an available microphone in which one could record their own dictation.

The Swinger 340, Dart's performance model, was replaced by the Demon 340 with optional hood scoops and blackout hood treatment. In 1971, Chrysler abandoned their longstanding corporate practice of installing left-hand-threaded wheel studs on the left side of the vehicle; all-wheel studs on the Dart thenceforth used conventional right-hand threads.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Corporation: ''Engineering Highlights for 1971''.

[[File:Dodge Demon 340 (Orange Julep).jpg|thumb|1972 Demon 340]]
Changes for 1972 included a revised grille without the central divider of the 1970 and 1971 items, new surface-mounted [[automotive lighting|sidemarker lights]] rather than the previous flush-mount units, the instrument cluster was now shared with the Valiant and featured a large, rectangular speedometer and several, small, round gauges; the AM/FM-radio option returned. The Demon had new fender-mounted metal "Demon" badges without the small devil character on the 1971 decals. The "Demon" decal on the rear of the car was replaced by ''Dodge'' and ''Dart'' emblems on the lower right edge of the deck lid. Some Demons with the side and rear panel tape stripes retained the tape devil character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Statham |first=Steve |title=Dodge Dart and Plymouth Duster |publisher=Motorbooks |year= 2000 |page=72 |isbn=978-0-7603-0760-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Year One 1966-74 Dodge/Plymouth A/C catalog 2007'' p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; A new, optional, single, hood scoop replaced 1971's dual scoops, and was coupled with a hood-paint blackout that had been standard on the 1971 high-trim/high-value Demon Sizzler model. Cars equipped with the optional rally wheels now came with newly-restyled center caps, finished in a light-argent (silver) paint. Demon production was substantially less than Duster's; this is reflected in higher collector car values for the Demon, especially V8 models.

=== 1973 ===
[[File:73Dart F34.jpg|thumb|1973 Dart Custom]]
[[File:73Dart R34.jpg|thumb|right|1973 Dart Custom]]
The 1973 model year Darts received new front styling with revised fenders, grille, header panel, and hood. Massive front bumpers were installed to comply with new federal regulations, as well as side-impact guard beams in the doors and new emission control devices. New single-piston disc brakes replaced the more complex 4-piston units offered from 1965 to 1972.

Chrysler's new electronic ignition system was standard equipment on all engines, and starter motors were revised for faster engine cranking. The K-frame was modified to accommodate a new spool-type engine mount that limited engine roll to 3°. The upper ball joints were upgraded to the larger B-body units. Along with these chassis changes, the wheel bolt pattern on Darts with disc brakes was enlarged from {{convert|4|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} to the {{convert|4.5|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} pattern common to the larger B- and [[Chrysler C platform|C-body]] Chrysler-built passenger cars. Darts with 4-wheel drum brakes continued with the smaller bolt pattern. The standard rear axle was still the 7¼" unit, but the heavy-duty option was now an 8¼" item rather than the previous 8¾" rear axle. Standard rear axle ratios were 2.76:1 with automatic transmission and 3.23:1 with manual, though other ratios were available. Vent wings were deleted from the Swinger but not from the 4-door sedans. A new "Quiet Car" package was available, consisting of extra sound insulation, premium exhaust hangers and an exhaust resonator.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Corporation: ''Engineering Highlights for 1973'', August 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

The Demon fastback was renamed "Dart Sport" in response to [[Evangelicalism|Christian]] groups' complaints about the 'Demon' name and devil-with-pitchfork logo.&lt;ref name=Dodge_Story/&gt; 
The high-performance model thus became Dart Sport 340, and 1973 saw styling changes to go along with the name change. The Dart Sport received the same new front end as the other Darts, and its [[Automotive lighting|taillights]] were changed to two lights per side, each with a chrome trim ring. These would remain unchanged through the 1976 model year.

=== 1974 ===
In 1974, the US federal {{convert|5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} [[Bumper (automobile)|bumper]] impact standards were expanded to cover rear bumpers as well as front ones, and as a result the Swinger and Dart sedan's rear bumpers grew much more massive. Taillights larger than the previous year's items were set above the rear bumper, rather than within it. Shoulder and lap belts were finally combined in all Chrysler products into a retractable, inertia-sensitive, single-buckle design Chrysler called "Unibelt", replacing the difficult-to-use separate lap and shoulder belts that had been installed through 1973.

The [[1973 oil crisis|Arab oil embargo]] of 1973, increased sales of smaller cars in the U.S. Dodge introduced the Dart SE (Special Edition) in mid-1974 as a four-door sedan and two-door hardtop. The SE included velour high back bucket seats with folding armrest, carpeted door panels, woodgrain instrument panel and deluxe wheel covers along with a TorqueFlite automatic transmission as standard equipment. The SE came equipped with the "Quiet Car" package introduced in 1973. The air conditioning system available on all Darts had increased capacity, quicker cooldown and lower minimum temperatures.&lt;ref name=DartAdds/&gt; An evaporator pressure regulator valve, long used on larger Chrysler products, varied the compressor's capacity without cycling the clutch.

The Dart Sport 340 was replaced by the Dart Sport 360 245 Bhp. as the {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine replaced the {{convert|340|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine discontinued after 1973.

=== 1975 ===
[[File:Dodge-Dart-Swinger.jpg|thumb|right|1975 Swinger]]
The 1975 models were virtually identical to the 1974s, except for a new grille and that California and some high-altitude models were equipped with [[catalytic converter]]s and so required unleaded gasoline. All 1975 models were required to pass a [[roof crush]] test and to meet this stringent requirement, additional reinforcements were added to all Dart 2-door hardtops.&lt;ref name=DartAdds&gt;Chrysler Corporation: 'Dart adds to the reputation in era of the compact car'&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy gauge steel in the windshield pillar area had been incorporated into the windshield, pillar and roof design. Darts were also equipped with an improved energy absorbing steering column which used multiple slots in the column jacket to replace prior used convoluted mesh design. At impact, force applied to the steering wheel curled the column jacket back over a [[mandrel]] mounted on the floor. Federal Motor Safety Standards briefly required that the front seat belts include a starter interlock system that prevented the engine from starting unless the front seat outboard occupant and the driver fastened their belts.&lt;ref name=DartAdds/&gt;

The 198 slant-six engine was discontinued and the 225 became standard equipment on all models. As in 1974, the 360 V8 was limited to the Dart Sport 360 model. A 4-speed manual transmission was offered with the [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine|6-cylinder]] engine for the first time in the North American market since 1965, and with a new 30% [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] 4th gear ratio.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Corporation: ''1976 Passenger Car Engineering Features'', August 1975&lt;/ref&gt; It was Chrysler's first application of overdrive since 1959.&lt;ref name=Overdrive&gt;Chrysler Corporation:'Overdrive-4, Manual Transmission Improves Compact Car Economy'&lt;/ref&gt; The final drive ratio in fourth gear was 2.36:1 on the slant-six cars equipped with 3.23:1 rear axle, and 2.15:1 on the V8s equipped with 2.94:1 rear axle. The result was less engine noise and wear and greater fuel economy.&lt;ref name=Overdrive/&gt;

Also for 1975, heaters had 14% more heating capacity than in the previous year's models.&lt;ref name= DartAdds/&gt; The added capacity was the result of adding a third speed to the blower system, which provided 20% greater air flow at maximum setting.&lt;ref name=DartAdds/&gt; The electrically heated backglass defogger grid timer cycle was doubled to 10&amp;nbsp;minutes. Additionally, sound insulation was improved.&lt;ref name=DartAdds/&gt;

=== 1976 ===
[[File:1976 Dodge Swinger gold 2D-hardtop va-r.jpg|thumb|1976 Swinger Special]]
[[File:Dodge-Dart-sedan-2.jpg|thumb|right|1976 Dart 4-door sedan]]

1976 was the Dart's final year in the North-American market. The [[rear-view mirror]] was mounted on the windshield rather than from the roof. Front disc brakes became standard equipment on 1 January 1976 in accord with more stringent U.S. federal brake-performance requirements, a new 2-spoke steering wheel debuted and a new foot-operated parking brake replaced the under-dash T-handle used since the Dart's 1963 introduction as a compact car. The grille's parking lamps were cast in [[amber (color)|amber]], whereas the previous years had clear lenses with amber-colored bulbs.

The Dart Sport 360 was dropped as a separate model in 1976, but the {{convert|360|CID|L|abbr=on}} four-barrel, dual exhaust (without catalytic converters) V8 was a $376 option (except in California) for the $3,370 Dart Sport V8 models with automatic transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Statham|first=Steve|title=Dodge Dart and Plymouth Duster|publisher=MotorBooks/MBI Publishing|year= 2000|page=124|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Jz-ItcylfasC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=1976+360+Dart+Sport&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=1976%20360%20Dart%20Sport&amp;f=false|isbn= 978-0-7603-0760-1|accessdate=2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Car &amp; Driver'' magazine tested the Dart Sport 360 in the April 1976 issue, pitting it against the Chevrolet Corvette and Pontiac Trans Am, and found its top speed of {{convert|121.6|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} to be second to the Corvette's {{convert|124.5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mueller|first=Mike|title=Corvette, 1968–1982|publisher=MotorBooks/MBI Publishing|year=2000|page=105|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BrPjl25HbucC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=1976+360+Dart+Sport&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=1976%20360%20Dart%20Sport&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-7603-0418-1|accessdate=2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== A38 Police Package ====
In 1976, the Dart was offered with a police package, with production code A38. The A38 Dart had high-specification components and systems throughout, including a heavy-duty suspension with a rear sway bar, stronger leaf springs and firmer shock absorbers, larger brakes with semi-metallic front disc pads, maximum engine cooling, and high-capacity alternator and battery. The engines were Chrysler's 225 slant-six, 318 V8, and {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler LA engine|LA]] V8 (220 H.P., with non-catalyst in 49-state models and a true dual exhaust; California models had a single exhaust with the catalytic converter) with an A727 [[TorqueFlite]] transmission. Police-specific equipment such as a calibrated speedometer ("certified" 120&amp;nbsp;mph), high-intensity dome light and wiring harness for a rooftop light bar were standard equipment and an A-pillar spotlight and push bars were optional. Production volume was low, with most A38 Darts going to the [[Los Angeles Police Department|Los Angeles]] and [[Ventura, California|Ventura]] police departments in [[southern California]]. For the most part, police agencies preferred the larger intermediate [[Dodge Coronet]] or full-size [[Dodge Monaco]].

=== Dart Sport packages ===

==== Convertriple and Hang Ten ====
For 1973 and 1974, the "Convertriple" option on the Dart Sport included a fold-down rear seat/security panel offering {{convert|6|ft|5|in|m|abbr=on}} of lengthwise space, and a manually operated metal [[sunroof]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Statham|first=Steve|title=Dodge Dart and Plymouth Duster |publisher=MotorBooks/MBI Publishing |year=2000|page=104|url= https://books.google.com/?id=Jz-ItcylfasC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=Dodge+Convertriple#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-7603-0760-1|accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was advertised as "three cars in one": an economy compact, a convertible alternative because of the sunroof, and a roomy station wagon alternative because of the fold down rear seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aVUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=Convertriple+Dodge+Dart |pages=18–19 |title=Dodge Invents the Convertriple (1973 advertisement) |journal=Life |date=6 October 1972 |volume=73 |issue=14 |accessdate=25 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Jd4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=Convertriple+Dodge+Dart |pages=20–21 |title=Try a little boss car from Chrysler Corporation ... and style a while (1974 advertisement) |journal=Ebony |date=June 1974 |volume=29 |issue=8 |accessdate=25 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:'75 Dodge Dart Hang 10 (Orange Julep).jpg|thumb|right|1975 Hang 10]]

The Convertriple was the basis for the 1975 "Hang 10" option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WbMqAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=75+Dart+line+again+includes+four+optional+packages+Convertriple,+Hang+Ten |page=78 |title=Cordoba joins intermediate ranks |journal=Automotive News |year=1974 |accessdate=25 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was aimed at [[Surfing|surfers]] in an attempt by Dodge marketers to better determine consumer preferences in a declining performance market.&lt;ref&gt;''Young'', p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hang ten]] is a surfing expression for balancing at the end of a surfboard with ten toes over the nose of the board while riding the wave. Available only in eggshell white exterior with a factory-installed sunroof, the car's fold-down rear seat permitted the loading of a surfboard through the trunk. The Hang 10 option continued the surfing theme with various colored stripe material accenting the white vinyl seats and door panels.&lt;ref name="hangten"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PgKWIzm0bbMC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=Hang+Ten+Dodge+Dart |page=96 |title=Dodge Dart &amp; Plymouth Duster |first=Steve |last=Statham |publisher=MBI Publishing |year=2000 |isbn= 9780760307601 |accessdate=25 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Orange [[Shag (fabric)|shag]] carpet covered the back of the fold-down rear seat while the dash and center console had orange accents.&lt;ref name="hangten"/&gt; Red and blue exterior stripes started at the quarter panels with a wave-riding surfer graphic. A surfboard design ran down the center of the hood. Between the taillights, the stripe pattern fattened into surfboard-shaped letters that spelled out "Hang 10".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.moparmusclemagazine.com/featuredvehicles/a_body/mopp_1011_1975_dodge_dart_sport_hang_10/viewall.html |title=1975 Dodge Dart Sport Hang 10 - Cowabunga |date=November 2010 |journal=Mopar Muscle |first=Kevin |last=DiOssi |accessdate=25 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Caravan Tan ====
In mid-1974, Dodge introduced the "Caravan Tan" trim package. Features for this Dart Sport included a desert-hued vinyl bench seat with multi-colored striped inserts and white piping, and gold-colored instrument panel, dash board and carpeting. Exterior color choices were dark moonstone, Sienna, gold metallic, dark gold metallic, golden fawn and white.

==== Spirit of '76 ====
In a tie-in with the [[United States Bicentennial]], a "Spirit of '76" edition of the Dart Sport featured white paint with prominent red and blue bodyside striping meant to evoke the image of the American flag.

==== Dart Lite ====
In response to increased interest in fuel economy, Dodge offered the "Dart Lite" fuel economy package which weighed at least {{convert|150|lb|kg|abbr=on}} less than the ordinary Dart Sport.&lt;ref name=DartLite&gt;Chrysler Corporation: 'New Dart Lite competes for compact economy crown. For release: Friday, October 3, 1975'&lt;/ref&gt; The 225 slant-six was the only available engine, equipped with an aluminum intake manifold for the first time since 1960 and a specially calibrated [[carburetor]] and distributor. Bumper reinforcement brackets were aluminum instead of steel, while the hood and trunk lid bracing and inner panels were also aluminum. The slant-six engine block had already been modified for reduced weight in 1975; in the middle of 1976 production its crankshaft was changed from forged steel to lighter cast iron. The high-flow exhaust system included a dual-biscuit [[catalytic converter]], a 2¼" headpipe, and the muffler used on V8 models. The Dart Lite was equipped with a 2.94:1 rear axle rather than the customary 3.21:1 ratio when the car was ordered with a three- or four-speed manual transmission. The A833OD overdrive 4-speed manual transmission housing was made of aluminum. Like all other Darts, the Dart Lites with automatic transmission came with a 2.76:1 rear axle as standard equipment.&lt;ref name=DartLite/&gt; The Dart Lite with manual transmission was rated by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] at 36&amp;nbsp;mpg (6.5&amp;nbsp;l/100km) in highway driving. The Plymouth version was the Feather Duster.

== Taxi ==
Darts were offered to the [[taxicab]] industry for their whole production run from 1963 to 1976. While specifications varied by year, interior upgrades generally included heavy-duty front and rear black rubber floor mats, heavy-duty seat cushion springs with full foam back and air-foam seats, black all-vinyl trim with heavy canvas-backed vinyl seat covers, interior door pull assist straps or handles, and a door-ajar warning light for the driver. Mechanically, Dart taxicabs were generally equipped with heavy-duty brakes, tires, shock absorbers, front torsion bars and rear leaf springs, a high-output alternator, an increased-capacity cooling system and extra-lean carburetor calibration for greater economy. In 1976, the Chrome Yellow taxi package was available only with a 225 slant-six engine producing {{convert|95|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|170|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}; transmission was the (rare) A-727-RG (raised-deck motor, which was the slant-six series) with California emissions, {{convert|90|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|165|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. Options included a radio suppression package and a Fuel Pacer System. Many—if not all—of them had a body color paint sales code of "999", meaning special order paint.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Corporation: ''1976 Dodge Taxi Sales Brochure''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Racing and competition ==

=== D-Dart ===
Dodge offered a performance version of the Dart GT in 1966. Known as the D-Dart for competitive use in NHRA's D/stock class, the 273 V8 was modified to produce {{convert|275|bhp|kW|abbr=on}}. Most of the power came from a larger carburetor and a more radical camshaft. The bulletin sent to the dealers from Chrysler also mentions an {{convert|8.75|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} rear axle with 4.89:1 final drive ratio.

=== SCCA competition ===
In 1966, the [[SCCA]] introduced the new [[Trans-American Sedan Championship]] that allowed competition among Dodge Darts, Plymouth Barracudas, Chevrolet Corvairs, Ford Mustangs, and other "production touring cars" with a maximum wheelbase of {{convert|116|in|mm|1|abbr=on}}. The cars competed in two classes, over 2 liters and under 2 liters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1966 Trans-Am Box Scores |url=http://www.trans-amseries.com/results/1966.pdf |publisher=[[Sports Car Club of America]] |accessdate=22 February 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717085342/http://www.trans-amseries.com/results/1966.pdf |archivedate=17 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Few modifications were allowed; bumpers, rear seats, and floor mats could be removed, mufflers could be replaced with straight pipes, and different wheels could be used so long as the stock rim diameter and width were maintained.&lt;ref name="66T/A"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.autohobbydigest.com/66ta.html |title= Chrysler and the 1966 Trans-Am Season |publisher=autohobbydigest.com |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090527060307/http://www.autohobbydigest.com/66ta.html |archivedate=2009-05-27 |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any engine component available over the dealer parts counter was sanctioned for use.&lt;ref name="66T/A"/&gt; [[Bob Tullius]]' race team, called "Group 44," used Dart 270 model coupes and GT coupes with 273-4bbl engines and were sponsored by [[Quaker State]]. The team won the 24-hour endurance race at [[Marlboro Motor Raceway]] in car No.4 driven by Tullius and Tony Adamowicz, who would also go on to win at [[Riverside International Raceway]].&lt;ref name="66T/A"/&gt; Dodge pulled sponsorship of the Darts after one season.

=== Super stock ===
Although racers like Dick Landy and Don Garlits had modified Darts in the mid-1960s to run in the National Hot Rod Association - NHRA funny car class using the 426 Hemi, super stock class racing of the Dart was almost non-existent due to the small V-8s available. In 1968, Dodge contracted [[Hurst Performance]] to build a limited number of Darts powered by the {{convert|440|cuin|l|1|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[Chrysler RB engine|RB big-block]] and {{convert|426|cuin|l|1|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[Chrysler Hemi engine|Hemi]]-powered Darts to compete in the SS/B class as the LO23 "Hurst Hemi Dart". According to Chrysler staff engineer Larry Shepard, the majority of these Darts were Hemi powered, although a small pilot run of fifty 440-powered Darts were also built in 1968.&lt;ref name="Mighty Mopars p. 51-2"&gt;Young, pp. 51-52.&lt;/ref&gt; "In 1969," said Shepard, "we built over 600 440-powered Darts-basically the same as the 383 GTS, except for the engine."&lt;ref name="Mighty Mopars p. 51-2"/&gt;

== Foreign markets ==
[[File:DeSoto Diplomat 1961.jpg|thumb|South African 1961 DeSoto Diplomat]]

[[Right- and left-hand traffic|Right-hand drive]] 1960, 1961, and 1962 Darts were exported to [[Commonwealth of Nations|commonwealth]] countries such as Australia, South Africa, Singapore, and badged as the [[Dodge Phoenix]]. In South Africa, a [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]]-branded version of the car called the [[DeSoto Diplomat|Diplomat]] was sold from 1960 to 1962, as well. Once the "Dart" name was moved to Dodge's compact car for 1963, the Phoenix was no longer Dart-related; each year thereafter through 1971, the "Phoenix" name was applied to the RHD version of a Dodge or Plymouth [[Chrysler B platform|B-body]] or [[Chrysler C platform|C-body]] for Commonwealth export.

Production of A-body Darts continued in Brazil, where they were also sold as Chargers, through 1981&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.valiant.org/brazil.html |title=A-bodies in Brazil |publisher=Valiant.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Colombia through 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foundationpc.com/colombia.html |title=Dodge Darts in Colombia |publisher=Foundationpc.com |date=1999-06-22 |accessdate=2010-09-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027131238/http://foundationpc.com/colombia.html |archivedate=2010-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dart-based A-body cars with various names including Valiant, [[Dodge Polara#In Argentina|Coronado and Polara]] were produced in Argentina through 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Denardo |first=Javier |url= http://www.allpar.com/world/argentina.html |title=Argentinian Mopars at Allpar |publisher=Allpar.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brazilian A-body cars used the {{convert|111|in|mm|adj=mid|wheelbase|-1}} bodystyle from 1970 and were always equipped with the 318 cubic inch V8, set up to run on the lower-octane fuel used in Latin America at the time.&lt;ref name="Lamm84"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lamm |first=Michael | title=Old cars never die ... they show up in foreign lands |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=November 1976 |volume=146 |issue=5 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ouIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=84 |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally a three-speed manual was standard, with an optional Torqueflite automatic, and later a four-speed manual was also available. The equipment levels in Brazil were: de Luxo, SE, Gran sedan, and Gran coupe, with the sporty Charger R/T coupé at the top.

The last true A-body Dart was built in the summer of 1981 in Brazil. This car is virtually identical to the U.S. market's 1976 Swinger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/cars/dodge/last-dart.html |title=The Last Dart: 1981 Brazilian Dodge Dart Coupé de Luxo |publisher=Allpar.com |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|3700|Dodge 3700}} Spain ===

From 1965 to 1970 a Spanish version of the Dodge Dart based on the original from the United States was manufactured in the [[Barreiros (manufacturer)|Barreiros]] Villaverde factory in [[Madrid]]. In March 1971 a new version, using the same 111 in (2,819&amp;nbsp;mm) wheelbase but with different sheet metal, the Dodge 3700 was produced until 1977 when the Spanish automotive taxation system was changed.&lt;ref name="Dodge 3700 "&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pruebas.pieldetoro.net/web/pruebas/ver.php?ID=14 |title=Dodge 3700 GT |publisher=Piel de toro.net |language=Spanish |accessdate=2012-01-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129053723/http://www.pruebas.pieldetoro.net/web/pruebas/ver.php?ID=14 |archive-date=2014-11-29 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3700 actually received the sheet metal from the Argentinian Dart, with certain modifications for the Spanish market.&lt;ref name="salon73"&gt;{{cite magazine |editor-last=Hersant |editor-first=Jacques |date=September 1973 |title=Le Salon de l'Auto 1973: Toutes les Voitures du Monde |issue=14 &amp; 15 |page=168 |publisher=l'Auto Journal |location=Paris |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rear wheel openings were larger and round, the grille and all lights were different, as was the instrumentation.

[[File:003607 - Barreiros-Dodge.JPG|thumb|right|Barreiros diesel-engined Dart]]
The Dart and the 3700 were the biggest national production car available in Spain during all production years. It was an expensive luxury car with very low [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] by Spanish standards. Nonetheless, it was considered an economic car for its size in those few markets to which it was exported.&lt;ref name="AR74"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Teste 1973/Essais 1973 |trans-title=Tests 1973 |journal=Automobil Revue '74 |editor1-last=Braunschweig |editor1-first=Robert |language=German, French |publisher=Hallwag AG |pages=114–115 |location=Berne, Switzerland |volume=69 |date=March 14, 1974 |isbn=978-3-444-10516-6 |display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Switzerland, for instance, it was priced exactly the same as a V8-engined American-built four-door Dodge Dart Custom and had only slightly less power, but was taxed considerably less.&lt;ref&gt;''Automobil Revue '74'', Price List Switzerland 1974, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish Dodges never met sales goals and was an expensive failure for the Barreiros concern. The break-even point was 5,000 cars per year, a goal which was only surpassed once, in 1966. The Barreiros brothers were forced to sell off the company which was reorganized as Chrysler España, S.A.&lt;ref name="Piel 3700"/&gt;

The Dodge Dart GL was a luxury model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foro.pieldetoro.net/web/pruebas/ver.php?ID=15 |title=Dodge Dart GL |language=Spanish |publisher=Foro.pieldetoro.net |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061016195350/http://www.foro.pieldetoro.net/web/pruebas/ver.php?ID=15 |archivedate=2006-10-16 |accessdate=2012-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the GT was the sporty version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.foro.pieldetoro.net/web/pruebas/ver.php?ID=16 |title=Dodge Dart GT |language=Spanish |publisher=Foro.pieldetoro.net |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090421041628/http://www.foro.pieldetoro.net/web/pruebas/ver.php?ID=16 |archivedate=2009-04-21 |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The base version has a three-speed manual transmission, while the GT came with either a four-speed manual or a three-speed automatic - this was the same unit as the one mounted in the [[Chrysler 180|Chrysler 2&amp;nbsp;L]].&lt;ref name="salon73"/&gt;

The gasoline Darts had the biggest engine ever mounted into a mass-produced car in Spain, the {{convert|225|cuin|l|1|abbr=on|adj=on}} Chrysler slant-six engine. The "3700" number is a reference to the 3.7 litres of displacement. No other six-cylinder engine car has been produced as much in Spain.

A [[Diesel engine|diesel]] Dart (named "Barreiros diesel") was also produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.foro.pieldetoro.net/web/pruebas/ver.php?ID=17 |title=Diesel Dart |language=Spanish |publisher=Foro.pieldetoro.net |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090422092842/http://www.foro.pieldetoro.net/web/pruebas/ver.php?ID=17 |archivedate=2009-04-22 |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These models, mainly intended for taxi use, were very basic and very slow. They have 7-inch round [[headlamp]]s rather than the large oblong units on fancier Spanish Darts, and use the round [[Automotive lighting|taillights]] from the first generation [[Simca 1000]].&lt;ref name=Grandes/&gt; The engine was the Barreiros C65, a {{convert|2007|cc|CID|1|abbr=on}} inline-four with {{convert|65|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&amp;nbsp;rpm. Top speed was claimed to be {{convert|124|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Grandes/&gt;

There was also a [[station wagon]] version, as well as variants (diplomatic motorcade cars, [[ambulance]]s, [[hearse]]s, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foundationpc.com/spanish.html |title=Spanish Dodge Darts |publisher=Foundationpc.com |accessdate=2010-09-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101027083902/http://foundationpc.com/spanish.html |archivedate=2010-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production of Spanish Dodges stopped in 1977. [[Peugeot]] bought the Villaverde factory, as Chrysler was [[Divestment|divesting]] their European operations in Spain, France, and the United Kingdom.

Spanish Dodges were popular with [[Spain under Franco|members of the Spanish government]] during the 1960s and 1970s. Admiral [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] was killed on 20 December 1973 while traveling in his Dodge 3700 GT.&lt;ref name="Dodge 3700 "/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.foundationpc.com/stories/bomb.html |title=The Dodge Dart a bomb could not kill |publisher=Foundationpc.com |accessdate=2010-09-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120220065009/http://www.foundationpc.com/stories/bomb.html |archivedate=2012-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 June 1975, Fernando Herrero Tejedor, the Minister Secretary General of the [[Movimiento Nacional]] and the politician mentoring [[Adolfo Suárez]], died in a car accident while travelling in his official Dodge 3700 in the municipality of [[Adanero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Adolfo Suárez: el hombre clave de la transición |first=Carlos |last=Abella |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6QxpAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Fernando+Herrero+Tejedor+Dodge+Dart |publisher=Espasa |year=2006 |page=48 |language=Spanish |isbn= 978-84-670-2027-4 |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTSnqO6z4es&amp;context=C3b167daUDOEgsToPDskK6katVlCIoF7sOZl3DOudR YouTube extract from this miniseries where Spanish Dodge appear as official state car of the 1970s in Spain.] (in Spanish). Accessed 3 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
[[File:Dodge Dart K wagon mexico.jpg|thumb|Mexican market Dodge Dart ([[Chrysler K platform|K-body]])]]
The Dart name (rather than Aspen) was applied to Dodge-branded F-body cars in Mexico, corresponding to the Mexican Chrysler-branded F-body cars badged as Valiant Volare (without the "é" in the "Volare" nameplate). The F-body was withdrawn from production worldwide after 1980, but in Mexico the [[Chrysler M platform|M-body]] was badged as a Dodge Dart for 1981 and 1982 using the front header panel and hood from the discontinued 1980 Volare/Aspen, the [[Chrysler K platform|K-body]] was sold as a Dodge Dart K (and as a Valiant Volare K) from 1982 to 1989, and the [[Chrysler E platform|E-body]] was sold as the Dodge Dart Europa, officially badged as the Dodge Dart E, from 1986 to 1989. It was a downscale (lower price, cheaper trim) version of the American Dodge 600 4-door sedan. It replaced the Dart K 4-door sedan. Dart K 2-door and wagon models were sold alongside the Dart E until 1988 and the old SOHC I-4 2.2&amp;nbsp;L engine was replaced by the new 2.5&amp;nbsp;L I-4 for the 1987 season.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler de México Brochures (1981–89)&lt;/ref&gt; These were the last new cars in the world to bear the Dodge Dart name until its [[Dodge Dart (2013)|revival in 2013]]. The Dart name was dropped when Chrysler de México introduced the [[Chrysler Spirit|Spirit]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler de Mexico: brochures (1982–88)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epilogue ==
The Dodge Dart was sold alongside its replacement for part of the 1976 model year before it was discontinued in the U.S. and Canadian markets. Over its original 13-year production run, the Dart earned a good reputation. "The Dart was one of the most successful compact cars ever introduced in the American automobile marketplace," according to R.D. McLaughlin, then vice president of Chrysler's Automotive sales division, "It enjoys a strong owner loyalty and is a car that has established a reputation for reliability and value...these are [some] reasons why we will continue to market the Dart while introducing the new compact Aspen."&lt;ref name="DartLite"/&gt;

The A-body Dart was replaced by the [[Chrysler F platform|F-body]] [[Dodge Aspen]] in late spring of 1976. The compact car segment was expanded with the [[Dodge Omni|Omni]] for Dodge to compete in a rapidly changing automobile market. These were replaced by the smaller front-wheel-drive [[Dodge Aries|Aries]], as well as several [[captive import]] models. Dodge's economy car segment was then filled by the [[Dodge Shadow|Shadow]] and the [[Dodge Spirit|Spirit]] (unrelated to the [[AMC Spirit]]), which themselves were replaced by the [[Chrysler Neon|Neon]]. After 35 years, the [[Dodge Dart (PF)]] was resurrected for the 2013 model year as a nameplate in the domestic market to replace the [[Dodge Caliber|Caliber]] as Dodge's compact passenger car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/06/dodge-dart-a-familiar-name-returns-from-an-unlikely-place/ |first=Paul |last=Stenquist |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Dodge Dart: A Familiar Name Returns From an Unlikely Place |date=2011-12-06 |accessdate=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DODGE TRUCK TRACTOR UNIT.JPG|thumb|Dodge 100]] The '''Dodge 100 "Commando"''' models also known as '''Dodge Commando 100 Series''' are {{convert|7.5|-|28|ST|t|abbr=on}} trucks built by [[Dodge]] in England, primarily in the 1970s and 1980s. A previous [[Dodge 100 "Kew"|Dodge 100]], known informally as the "parrot-nose" or "Kew Dodge", was produced in the 1950s at a factory in [[Kew]], [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;http://rustytrucks.tripod.com/id15.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development==
Originally developed by [[Commer]], the range was first built as a concept in 1965-66, to replace the Commer VC and VE range with {{convert|8|-|24|ST|t|abbr=on}} [[gross vehicle weight]] (GVW). As [[Chrysler Europe]] acquired a controlling interest in Commer's owner, the [[Rootes Group]], the truck design and name were changed to complement the [[Dodge 500]] trucks.

===Drivetrains===
The Dodge 100 was intended to use a Rootes [[diesel engine]], but noise regulations ruled out the reliable but noisy Rootes units. In the end, naturally aspirated and [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] four- and six-cylinder [[Perkins Engines|Perkins]] diesel engines (locally made in the UK) were used for lighter weights, with the [[Mercedes-Benz OM352 engine|Mercedes-Benz OM352]] offered as a premium engine (due largely to the reputation of Mercedes in Europe, where Perkins was relatively unknown). Also, Valmet 611 CS diesels were installed for some limited market areas. Four-, five-, and six-speed synchromesh manual transmissions from Rootes were used, while rear axles are a mixture of Rootes Groups' own hypoid design and [[Eaton Corporation]]'s single- and two-speed axles. The chassis use a special alloy for greater strength and lighter weight.

Final capacity ranges from {{convert|7.5|-|16|ST|t|abbr=on}} GVW for full vehicles and 24/28 tons GCW for tractors.

===Renault===
[[File:Dodge.100.jpg|thumb|Dodge-Renault 100 Mk 2 with double badging]] The 100 Series was in production for around 15 years in most areas of the world (though not in the United States, due to the costs that would have been involved in meeting local regulations). It was sold as a Commer, Dodge, [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]], [[Fargo Trucks|Fargo]] and [[Renault Trucks|Renault]]. A "Mark 2" version has an upgraded engine other minor refinements. Eventually the Dodge 100 was eliminated by Renault, which had acquired the former Rootes Group truck operations after the car operations were purchased by [[Peugeot]], though a Renault version of the Dodge 100 was built for a time; by 1987, it was being marketed as simply the "Renault Commando". Renault later switched production at the former Rootes factory to Renault's own bus and truck engines.

[[File:Dodge K Type 1968 Rougham Airfield, Wings, Wheels and Steam Country Fair.jpg|thumb|1968 Dodge K, originally sold as the "500"]]
The '''Dodge 500''' was a heavy duty truck introduced in 1964 and built in the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Dodge]]. It replaced Dodge UK's earlier [[Dodge 300|300 series]] cab over trucks.

==History and development==
Popular in Britain, and also used in some export markets, the Dodge 500 was also sometimes badged as a [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] or [[Fargo Trucks|Fargo]]. The trucks were sold as a cab and chassis and the operators arranged for the purchase of the bodies or trailers. Later this range came to be known as the '''"K"-series'''.

The 500 Series was developed in the early 1960s, with styling by [[Ghia]] and engineering by [[Rootes Group]] in [[Kew]], [[England]]. The suspension used leaf springs in front and rear with optional rear auxiliary springs. The truck was [[Diesel engine|diesel]] powered, with forward control and a tilt cab; it was launched in December 1964. Customers obtained the trucks in primer and painted them.  The cabs were noted for their styling, roominess and comfort, visibility of the road, and engine placement with minimal intrusion into the cab.

Payload capacities ranged up to {{convert|11|ST|t|abbr=on}} for two-axle units, up to {{convert|16|ST|t|abbr=on}} for three-axle units, or a gross combined vehicle weight of up to {{convert|67000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} for the tractors. Those desiring lighter capacity trucks were directed to the [[Dodge 100]].

With the help of the supplier, a special high tensile steel alloy was developed to lighten the frame. Tubular and channel section cross members were bolted to the frame side-members. Spring hanger brackets were also bolted to the frame, utilizing the cross members where possible. [[Cummins UK|Cummins]] and [[Perkins Engines|Perkins]] diesel engines were used.

Buyers had a choice of a Cummins diesel — V6 or V8 — producing {{convert|130|-|170|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and 248-328&amp;nbsp;pound-feet of [[torque]], or a locally made Perkins diesel with {{convert|120|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|260|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. These were known to be reliable powerplants. An existing time-tested manual transmission was used.

The '''Dodge M37''' {{frac|3|4}}-ton [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] truck [[List of U.S. military vehicles by supply catalog designation#G700 to G799|(G741)]] was [[Dodge|Dodge's]] follow-up to their successful [[Dodge WC series|WC Series]] from [[World War II]]. Introduced in 1951, it was used extensively by the [[United States]] armed forces during the [[Korean war]]. In the 1970s, they were replaced by the [[commercial off the shelf]] based {{frac|1|1|4}}-ton trucks [[Kaiser Jeep M715|Kaiser M715]] (late 1960s), and [[Commercial Utility Cargo Vehicle#Dodge M8XX Series|Dodge's M880/M890]] series (1970s).

== History ==
Six prototypes of the vehicle were produced in early-to-mid 1950 based on the [[Dodge WC series|WC series Dodge]] vehicles used in World War II, with the first pre-production pilot vehicle rolling off the assembly line on 14 December 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dodgem37.com/ |title=1953 M37 Dodge Restoration |author=creinemann |accessdate=16 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320131741/http://dodgem37.com/ |archive-date=20 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the components on the M37 are similar or identical to the World War II vehicle and many deficiencies of the previous series were corrected in the M37. Notably, a conventional pickup truck style bed replaced the platform on the World War II vehicle, simplifying production. There was significant drivetrain and powerplant commonality with the WDX series civilian [[Dodge Power Wagon|Power Wagons]]. Outside of the fenders, there were sheet metal differences between all the vehicles.

Production of the M37 began in earnest in January 1951, with approximately 11,000 vehicles made by the end of that year. By mid-1954 63,000 of the vehicles had been produced. In 1958 a number of modifications to the design resulted in the new vehicles being designated as M37B1. From mid-1958 until the end of production 47,600 M37B1 vehicles were produced. Approximately 4,500 Canadian M37CDNs were also produced between 1951 and 1955. These vehicles continued in service worldwide in the Israeli and Greek militaries.

In total, between 1951 and 1968, some 115,000 Dodge M37s were produced. From 1968 onwards, the U.S. military replaced them with the M-715 family of vehicles, which saw service in the [[Vietnam War]]. Although these were higher (1{{1/4}} or five-quarter ton) rated, they were militarized "[[commercial off-the-shelf]]" (or 'COTS') trucks – and the [[Kaiser Jeep M715]]s were considered underpowered and fragile, compared to the purpose-built Dodge M37 tactical trucks they were built to replace.&lt;ref name=OD_M715&gt;[http://ftp.olive-drab.com/od_mvg_www_kaiser.php M-715 Kaiser 5/4 Jeep – Olive-Drab]&lt;/ref&gt; Starting 1976, the U.S. military went back to Dodges, when the M715s were replaced by the [[Commercial Utility Cargo Vehicle#Dodge M8XX Series|Dodge M880 series]], again a {{frac|1|1|4}}-ton militarized COTS truck.&lt;br&gt;
It was common in the 1970 and 1980s to encounter these vehicles in government auctions. Many of the vehicles were transferred to civilian agencies and some are still in use today in rural areas. They were out of significant military service by the late 1970s, replaced by the [[M715]] and [[M880]] series.

== Specifications ==
=== Engine ===
The powerplant was identical to the World War II era WC vehicles line, as was most of the drivetrain. The [[straight-six]] cylinder engine was derived from a 1930s era passenger vehicle engine that was widely produced. This was in line with a long-standing military procurement strategy that attempted to use commercially produced vehicle variants in military service.

Many deficiencies with aging design became apparent in the 1960s, including a tendency of the connecting rods to fail at high rpms due to the long cylinder stroke of the engine. As the average speed of the vehicles in the military increased, these engine failures became commonplace due to the low gear ratio of the vehicle, which was originally designed as a multipurpose vehicle capable of transporting heavy loads of ammunition.

== Replacement program ==
During the late 1960s a competition was initiated by the Army, which requested the leading U.S. automotive companies to submit proposals as a replacement for the M37. Several prototype vehicles passed through the preliminary examination, eventually leading the military to accept General Motors [[XM705]] 1{{frac|1|4}}-ton Truck and derivative [[XM737]] Ambulance, which were supposed to replace the M37, instead of the militarized [[Commercial off-the-shelf|COTS]] M715 series of trucks. However, Congress cut funds for the program, and the XM705 never reached the assembly line.

The '''Dodge Stratus''' is a [[mid-size car|mid-size]] car that was introduced by [[Dodge]] in February 1995, and was based on the 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] [[Chrysler JA platform]]. The Stratus, [[Plymouth Breeze]], and [[Chrysler Cirrus]] were all on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 1996 and 1997. It received critical acclaim at launch, but ratings fell over time. An updated version of the Stratus was introduced for 2001, with the Cirrus being renamed as the [[Chrysler Sebring]], and a [[coupé]] model was also added to the range. However, production ended in early 2006 at the Sterling Heights Assembly Plant, which had built 1,308,123 Stratus and Sebrings since 2000.&lt;ref name='gone'&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.autoblog.com/2006/05/21/stratus-and-sebring-gone-for-good/ |title=Stratus and Sebring gone for good |work=Autoblog |date=May 21, 2006 |accessdate=August 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dodge Avenger]] replaced the Stratus nameplate in early 2007 for the 2008 [[model year]].

After the discontinuation of the Stratus sedan in 2006, the assembly line and tooling were sold to the Russian concern, [[GAZ]], which manufactured 9,000 examples of a very slightly modified Stratus from 2008 through 2010 called the [[Volga Siber]].

The Dodge Stratus was the middle entry of the JA platform (with the Cirrus being the higher-end model and the Breeze being the lower-end model). Introduced in 1995, the Stratus had two models, the '''base''' (later renamed '''SE''' in 2000), which came standard with the 2.0&amp;nbsp;L straight-4 and had the SOHC 2.4&amp;nbsp;L as optional, and the '''ES''', which came standard with the a 2.0&amp;nbsp;L from 1995–1997, and had a DOHC 2.4&amp;nbsp;L and a 2.5&amp;nbsp;L V6 as optional. In 1998 the DOHC 2.4&amp;nbsp;L was standard and the 2.5&amp;nbsp;L V6 was optional on the ES, and from 1999–2000, the 2.5&amp;nbsp;L V6 was the only engine on the ES model.

The Stratus directly replaced the high-volume [[Dodge Spirit|Spirit]] and [[Dodge Dynasty|Dynasty]] ([[United States]] only) to favorable reviews, but lower sales.  It was often compared to other small mid-sizes such as the [[Chevrolet Malibu]], and judged roomier than the 1995 [[Ford Contour]] by many magazines such as Consumer Reports.

The Stratus, Cirrus, and Breeze had many parts that were interchangeable between each model. The exteriors of these three cars were very similar, with the front fascia, rear bumper, taillights, and wheels being the main differences. The interiors had little variation between the three models; being almost identical, save for the name on the steering wheel, and a few available options. The fascias of each JA car corresponds with each brand's minivan offering, sharing headlights and grill designs. 

All three variants of the platform were available with most of the same standard features and available options, such as the following: a four-speed [[automatic transmission]] and an optional semi-automatic dubbed "[[Autostick]]" (not available on the [[Plymouth Breeze]]), [[anti-lock brakes]], four wheel independent suspension (double wishbone in the front with a multilink rear), tilt [[steering wheel]], [[cruise control]], [[power window]]s, [[power door lock]]s, power driver's seat, leather seats (Cirrus only), power antenna, a six CD changer, sunroof, remote keyless entry, anti-theft system, etc. A five-speed manual was available with the 2.0&amp;nbsp;L. The 2.4&amp;nbsp;L was not offered in a manual because of its high torque and difficult drivability issues, mainly due to wheel spinning.

In 2000, the Stratus was available for its last year of sales in [[Canada]], with the [[Chrysler Sebring]] taking over as the company's only lower mid-size sedan - [[Dodge]] did not sell the equivalent version in Canada.

A [[turbocharged]] version of the Stratus was sold in [[Mexico]], with the 2.4&amp;nbsp;L [[DOHC]] 4-cylinder engine and a 4-speed [[automatic transmission]] with AutoStick. This engine produced {{convert|168|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 5200 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] and {{convert|216|lb·ft|N·m}} of torque at 2200 rpm. All 2.4L turbo engines were only for the Mexican market.

The Stratus was sold in Europe, with the 2.0&amp;nbsp;[[Liter|L]] and the V6, as the Chrysler Stratus (the [[Dodge]] name was not used in [[Europe]], except for [[commercial vehicle]]s). Its styling was similar to that of Chrysler's Cirrus (which featured chrome accent moldings along the doors and bumpers), with the exception of the rear taillights, which were the same as Dodge's Stratus, and a Dodge grille, which differed from that of the Chrysler Cirrus and Plymouth Breeze. The Chrysler Stratus competed in the [[Swedish Touring Car Championship]]; the Dodge branded model also competed in [[North American Touring Car Championship]] as one of few truly professional outfits to contest the short-lived championship, with [[David Donohue]] winning the 1997 season using the Stratus.

For [[Brazil]], the Stratus was marketed as the Chrysler Stratus, the equivalent [[Chrysler Cirrus]] being unavailable. It had the same engines as the North American version but a higher [[ground clearance]] for the road conditions there.

In Argentina, it was marketed as '''Chrysler Stratus''', and it was raced in the category "Superturismo Sudamericano" (Copa de las Naciones), driven by [[Ernesto Bessone]] and Pablo Peon.

In 2000, the Stratus became the last of the surviving Cloud Cars, with the Cirrus renamed as the Sebring,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/chrysler-sebring-lxi-road-test |title=Chrysler Sebring LXi Road Test |publisher=Car and Driver |date=December 2000 |accessdate=January 14, 2015 |first=Larry |last=Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Breeze discontinued (along with the Plymouth brand).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://consumerguide.com/used/1996-00-plymouth-breeze/ |title=1996–2000 Plymouth Breeze |publisher=Consumer Guide Auto |accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This generation of the Dodge Stratus was not sold in [[Canada]], although 1999 was the last year for Dodge Stratus sales in Canada. 2002 models dropped the "DODGE" badges from the doors.

[[File:2002 Dodge Stratus rear.jpg|thumb|left|2002 Dodge Stratus sedan]]
The Stratus and Sebring [[sedan (car)|sedan]]s for the second generation used a revised version of the Chrysler JA platform named [[Chrysler JA platform#JR|JR]]. The coupé models with the same names were entirely different cars; they were actually based on the [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]].

During this time, sales declined as its ratings from consumer and auto magazines fell below average among mid-size cars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/comparisons/03q1/2003_dodge_stratus_vs._honda_accord_hyundai_sonata_kia_optima_and_six_more_mid-size_sedans-comparison_tests | title = 2003 Dodge Stratus vs. Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata, Kia Optima, and Six More Mid-Size Sedans - Comparison Tests | first = Barry | last = Winfield | journal = Car and Driver | date = February 2003 | accessdate = 2010-07-23 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100731074726/http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/comparisons/03q1/2003_dodge_stratus_vs._honda_accord_hyundai_sonata_kia_optima_and_six_more_mid-size_sedans-comparison_tests | archivedate = 2010-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the sedan market had shifted and pushed the larger Intrepid and later [[Dodge Charger (LX)|Charger]] to record sales. 2004 brought styling revisions, which did not reverse this trend. The Stratus was discontinued in May 2006&lt;ref name='gone'/&gt; (the Sebring name was continued).

In [[Mexico]], the Stratus R/T came in a turbocharged version. The Stratus R/T's turbocharged 2.4 L engine went through some improvements in 2001, when power was increased to {{Convert|215|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. This improved engine would later be used in the U.S. in the [[Dodge SRT-4]] and [[Chrysler PT Cruiser|PT Cruiser GT]]. Stratus R/T engines built from March 2004 and later generated {{Convert|225|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5200 rpm and {{convert|235|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of [[torque]] at 4200 rpm. Stratus R/T models with the turbocharged engine could be recognized by a rear badge saying "Turbo".

===Stratus coupé===
[[File:2001 Dodge Stratus SE coupe -- NHTSA 02.jpg|thumb|left|2001 Dodge Stratus SE coupé]]
For 2001, Dodge introduced the '''Stratus''' coupé, replacing the discontinued [[Dodge Avenger#Dodge Avenger coupé .281995.E2.80.932000.29|Avenger]]. This model along with the [[Chrysler Sebring#Coupé|Chrysler Sebring coupé]] was built at the former [[Diamond Star Motors]] plant by [[Mitsubishi Motors North America|Mitsubishi]], using the [[Chrysler D platform#ST-22|ST-22 platform]]. Like its Chrysler counterpart, the coupé models shared very little other than the name and a few exterior styling cues with sedan and convertible models. The Stratus coupé was restyled for the 2003 model year. The coupé was discontinued after 2005, one year before the sedan. The next midsize Dodge, the [[Dodge Avenger#Dodge Avenger sedan (2007–2014)|Avenger]], did not include a coupé version.

==Safety==
The first generation Dodge Stratus received a "Poor" rating in the IIHS frontal crash test. It was actually a Chrysler Cirrus that was tested, but the results also apply to the Stratus, and also the Plymouth Breeze. The second generation Stratus and its twin, the Chrysler Sebring, received an overall "Acceptable" rating in the IIHS frontal test due to a possible injury to the right leg. On the side test, the Stratus receives a "Poor" rating without optional side airbags due to a serious neck injury, a weak side structure, possible rib fractures, and high forces on the shoulder and pelvis. Its seats and head restraints earn an overall "Acceptable" rating from the IIHS.

==Licensed production in Russia==
{{Main|Volga Siber}}
The license and production facilities for the second generation Dodge Stratus and [[Chrysler Sebring]] sedans were sold in April 2006 to Russian billionaire [[Oleg Deripaska]], owner of the [[GAZ]] company in [[Nizhny Novgorod]], which builds the [[Volga (automobile)|Volga]] automobile. The models were built by GAZ in Russia from late 2007 through 2010 as the [[Volga Siber]] at a price of approximately US$151 million (€ 124 million). The production facilities are planned to build up to 65,000 cars of both models yearly. Four-cylinder engines were to be purchased from Chrysler and made in Mexico.

The '''Dodge Meadowbrook''' is a [[full-size car]] that was produced by [[Dodge]] in the United States from 1949 to 1954.

==History==
The Dodge Meadowbrook was produced by Dodge and offered as the midline trim level from February 1949 until 1952, above the [[Dodge Wayfarer|Wayfarer]] and beneath the [[Dodge Coronet|Coronet]]. The Meadowbrook was largely identical to the Coronet, excepting trim and equipment differences.&lt;ref name="chrysler"&gt;{{Cite book | ref = SCC | title = Standard Catalog of Chrysler, 1924-1990 | first = John | last = Lee | publisher = Krause Publications, Inc. | location = Iola, WI | page = 266 | date = 1990 | isbn = 0-87341-142-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 the Wayfarer was cancelled and the Meadowbrook became the lowest-priced Dodge in the United States; export markets (including Canada) continued to receive the Plymouth-based [[Dodge Kingsway]].

===1949===
In its first year the four-door only Meadowbrook made up 30% of Dodge's sales (about 90,000 units), and came with "Safe-Guard Hydraulic Brakes" which included two cylinders per front brake. Dodge also advertised a new "cradled" ride, which was supposedly softer than all the others makers cars. The single-barrel inline-six produced {{convert|103|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="flory2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Flory Jr.|first=J. "Kelly"|title=American Cars, 1946-1959 Every Model Every Year|year=2008|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers|isbn=978-0-7864-3229-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950===
For 1950, the six-cylinder was baptized the "Get-Away" engine. After the late introduction of the 1949s, the 1950 Dodges appeared a little earlier, on 4 January 1950.&lt;ref name=Lee267&gt;[[#SCC|Lee]], p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; The 1950 Meadowbrook has a wide, {{Convert|42.7|ft|m|abbr=on}} turning circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/auta_details1.php |title=1991 BMW 850i Automatic |publisher=Automobile-catalog.com |accessdate=2011-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106213704/http://www.automobile-catalog.com/auta_details1.php |archive-date=2012-01-06 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/make/dodge/full-size_dodge_2gen/full-size_dodge_2gen_meadowbrook_4-door_sedan/1950.html |title=1950 Dodge (U.S.) Meadowbrook 4-Door Sedan performance data, specs &amp; photo |publisher=Automobile-catalog.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four-door sedan bodywork remained the only option.&lt;ref name=Lee267/&gt;

===1951===
The 1951 Meadowbrook received a thorough change, with all-new front skin. Bumpers were also new, as was the dashboard, and the windshield was enlarged.&lt;ref name=Lee268&gt;[[#SCC|Lee]], p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; The engine remained unchanged, as it would until 1954.

===1952===
In 1952, the Meadowbrook made up 32.50% of Dodge's sales (circa 84,000). With Chrysler being entirely focussed on the [[Korean War]] effort, the 1952s received almost no changes - modifications being limited to details such as a red reflector dot beneath the taillights and lightly redesigned hubcaps.&lt;ref name=Lee268/&gt; The 1952s were introduced on 10 November 1951.&lt;ref name=Lee269&gt;[[#SCC|Lee]], p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953===
The 1953 Dodges arrived on 23 October 1952, and featured a revised bodywork based on the 1952s. The doors (now with pull-handles) opened wider, the rear window was a one-piece, and the taillights were oval units. Naturally the grille and chrome applications were altered.&lt;ref name=Lee269/&gt; The "Meadowbrook Special" series was added to replace the Wayfarer at the lower end of Dodge's lineup.&lt;ref name=Lee263&gt;[[#SCC|Lee]], p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; A two-door model and a station wagon were also added.&lt;ref&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalogue of American Cars 1946-1975, revised 4th Edition, 2002, page 332&lt;/ref&gt; The two- and four-door sedans were both offered in both Meadowbrook and Special trim levels, but the Special did not suit the buoyant US car market and by April 1953 it had already been discontinued. Instead, sales of the new V8-engined Coronet were very strong. The austere Special, intended for travelling salesmen and the like, received no chrome side trim and plain rubber trim around the windows. The interior was equally bare.&lt;ref name=Lee269/&gt;

The two-door Suburban wagon, offered for 1953 only, sat on a shorter {{convert|114|in|mm|-1|abbr=on}} wheelbase than the sedans.&lt;ref name=Lee269/&gt;

===1954===
[[File:1954 Dodge Meadowbrook Sedan.jpg|thumb|1954 Dodge Meadowbrook, four-door sedan]]
1954 was the last year of the Meadowbrook,&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; and it had a new Powerflite [[Automatic transmission|automatic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1954_Dodge/1954_Dodge_Brochure/1954%20Dodge-03-04.html |title=Directory Index: Dodge/1954_Dodge/1954_Dodge_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offered as a four-door or two-door sedan (called Club Coupé), it was now also available with the optional new [[Chrysler Hemi engine#Dodge|"Red Ram" Hemi V8]] engine.&lt;ref name=Lee269/&gt; Of {{convert|241.3|cid|L|1|abbr=on}}, it produces {{convert|140|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the Meadowbrook, ten horsepower less than in the more senior Dodges due to a lower compression ratio. Thanks to a modest compression increase, the "230" six increased its power output to {{convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Lee270&gt;[[#SCC|Lee]], p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; Buyers still flocked to the more prestigious Coronet and [[Dodge Royal|Royal]] lines, and only 15,444 were built.&lt;ref name=Lee269/&gt;

The [[Dodge]] lineup was refreshed for the 1958 model year, continuing the three-line scheme of the [[1955 Dodge]]s with the entry-level [[Dodge Coronet|Coronet]], [[Dodge Royal|Royal]], and ornate [[Dodge Custom Royal|Custom Royal]]. The Regal Lancer was added as a new Top of the line model in spring.

==Overview==

The 1958 Dodges shared their basic mechanicals with the De Soto, but featured special styling.  The Coronet lasted through the 1959 [[model year]]s.

==Coronet==

The '''Coronet''' was the base model.  This was the only line to feature the 230&amp;nbsp;in³ (3.8&amp;nbsp;L) ''[[Chrysler Flathead engine|Getaway]]'' [[Straight-6|I6]] with 123&amp;nbsp;hp (92&amp;nbsp;kW), but the 325&amp;nbsp;in³ (5.3&amp;nbsp;L) ''[[Chrysler A engine|Red Ram (2bbl) / Super Red Ram (4bbl)]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] was an option.  Coronets may typically be identified by a script mounted at the trailing edge of the belt-line stainless steel trim strip and a plain "up-sweep" molding of the rear fin trim, where both Royal and Custom Royal had a "dipping" element to the up-sweep trim.  Fin cap inserts were painted with a horizontally ribbed pattern.  Body styles offered were club sedan, sedan, two-door hardtop (Lancer), four-door hardtop (Lancer), and two-door convertible (Lancer).  Lancers were further identified by a lance and shield emblem on each fin.

==Royal==

The '''Royal''' were the next step up.  They used only the V8 engine.  Identifying exterior characteristics include Royal script at the trailing edge of the belt-line molding, a pronounced "check-mark" at the rear up-sweep of the fin, chrome Dodge block letters on the front of the hood, chrome Dodge script on the passenger side of the trunk, and hood ornaments as standard equipment.  Fin cap inserts were anodized with a horizontally ribbed pattern.  Body styles offered were sedan, two-door hardtop (Lancer), and four-door hardtop (Lancer).  Lancers were further identified by a lance and shield emblem on each fin.

==Custom Royal==

The flagship model was the '''Custom Royal'''.  It came with the 350&amp;nbsp;in³ (5.7&amp;nbsp;L) [[Chrysler FirePower engine#Dodge|Ram Fire]] V8 with a standard two-barrel carburetor, but the optional four-barrel carburetor delivered 300&amp;nbsp;hp (224&amp;nbsp;kW).  A feature of the Custom Royal was its bumper-mounted exhaust ports which were only available on the Royal and Coronet models as part of the D-500 options.  Identifying exterior characteristics include Custom Royal script at the trailing edge of the belt-line molding, the pronounced check-mark, gold anodized Dodge block letters on the hood, and gold anodized Dodge script on the passenger side of the trunk.  Fin cap inserts were anodized and had a unique rectangular pattern.  All Custom Royals included a stainless molding above the bumper, on the flat edge below the trunk opening.  Body styles offered were sedan, two-door hardtop (Lancer), four-door hardtop (Lancer), and two-door convertible (Lancer).  Lancers were further identified by a lance and shield emblem on each fin.

==Spring Specials==
To combat the recession of 1958, the Chrysler Corporation developed a program of spring specials to present a mid-year trim change on most of its makes.  The factory-produced spring specials for Dodge included a new wide, full-length belt line molding, grille emblem, fin end-caps, and a wide license plate escutcheon.  The Chrysler Corporation also shipped out all of these trim items individually to dealers so the dealers could "freshen up" the cars sitting on their lots.  Dealer-installed spring specials often include some elements of the factory spring special trim, but not always all.  New exterior colors introduced for spring were Poppy Red, Frosted Turquoise, and Paris Rose.  

Unrelated to spring specials, Dodge changed the headlight trim midway through the production run.  Later cars have a wide lower edge to the headlight trim while early cars have a thin lower edge.

==Regal Lancer==

Trying to boost sales, the '''Regal Lancer''' model was added in February and only available as a two-door hardtop with special colors, exterior trim and interior. Four color combinations where available: bronze with white trim, bronze with black trim, black with bronze trim, and white with bronze trim. It featured special nameplates at the front of the side spear trim and heavy eyebrow trim. Inside, Regal Lancers got their own interior with unique trim and door panels featuring molded armrests. A bronze instrument panel with textured aluminum inserts was a Regal Lancer exclusive. The standard engine offered for Regal Lancers was the 350 cubic inch displacement "Ram Fire" [[V8 engine|V8]]. Optional engine choices were the 361 cubic inch displacement '''D-500''' and '''Super D-500''' iterations. Only 1,163 were produced.

==Suburban==

The Suburban was Dodge's two-door station wagon in 1958.  All station wagons came standard with the 350 Ram Fire engine.

==Sierra==

The entry level four-door station wagon in 1958 was the Sierra.  Sierras came in either the six-passenger seat configuration or the nine-passenger "Spectator" seat configuration.  From the exterior the nine-passenger configuration can be easily identified by the spare tire panel behind the rear wheel opening and the rubber step-spots on the rear bumper.

==Custom Sierra==

Custom Sierra wagons were the top-of-the-line station wagon offering for Dodge.  As with Sierras, they were available as either six-passenger or Spectators.

==D-500==

The D-500 engine option was available across all models and all body styles including station wagons and the Regal Lancer.  The D-500 family of engines includes a four-barrel option, a dual four-barrel (Super D-500), and a Bendix electronic fuel injection system for the Super D-500.  The Bendix E.F.I. system proved to be troublesome and what few examples were built were recalled to be fitted with the normally aspirated dual four-barrel carburetor system.  On passenger cars, the D-500 emblem was located on the driver side of the trunk.  On station wagons, the D-500 emblem was located below the tail gate latch.  The 1958 D-500 emblem was unique to that year.  All D-500s came with bumper mounted exhaust ports.   

==Paint and Trim Schemes==

Apart from the spring specials, Dodge offered a variety of paint and trim schemes for 1958.  Solid color cars were standard.  Two-tone options were: 1) the basic two-tone which had a roof color and a body color, 2) a "deluxe" two-tone, which had the roof, fins, and trunk as one color and the body as another; and 3) a "saddle" two-tone, which had the roof and all of the body below the belt-line trim as one color and the body above the belt-line trim as another; and 4) Regal two-tone, exclusive to the Regal Lancer two-door hardtop.  The monotone, basic, and deluxe two-tones all used the "short" belt-line trim with model script behind the trailing edge.  The saddle two-tone used the 1957 full-length belt-line trim and placed the model script below the front fender belt-line trim.  The Regal Lancer had paint and trim unique to that model.

The '''Dodge Magnum''' is a nameplate used by several [[Dodge]] vehicles, at different times and on various markets. The name was first applied to a large [[Chrysler B platform]]-based 2-door coupe marketed from 1978 to 1979 sold in the United States&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler brochures: Chrysler de México 1981-88&lt;/ref&gt; and Canada. From the 2005 to the 2008 model years, the nameplate was revived for a [[station wagon]] on the [[rear-wheel drive]] [[Chrysler LX platform]], produced in Canada and sold on the American and Canadian market.

In Brazil, the Magnum was a top of the line version of the local [[Dodge Dart]], produced from 1979 to 1981.

In Mexico, the Dodge Magnum was a sporty rear-wheel drive two-door car based on Chrysler's [[M-body]] (American [[Dodge Diplomat]]/[[Plymouth Gran Fury]]). From 1983 to 1988 Dodge marketed a sporty two-door [[Chrysler K platform|K-car]] as the "Magnum", with an available turbocharger engine from 1984 on.

The Magnum was introduced for 1978 to supplement the [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Dodge Charger]]. It was sold in two forms, the "XE" and the "GT" and was the last vehicle to use the long running [[Chrysler B platform]]. The appearance was somewhat of a rounded off Charger, and was in response to getting a car that would be eligible for [[NASCAR]] that would be more aerodynamic, something that the 1975–1978 Charger was not. Styling features included four rectangular headlights behind retractable clear covers, with narrow [[opera window]]s, and an optional T-bar or power sunroof. The Magnum was well-featured with power steering, brakes and seats; the suspension included Chrysler's standard adjustable, longitudinal torsion bars, lower trailing links, and front and rear anti-sway bars. The base engine was the {{convert|318|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with [[Lean-burn#Chrysler Electronic Lean-Burn|Lean-Burn]], while two and four-barrel carbureted {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8s were optional; weight was nearly {{convert|3900|lb|abbr=on}}. During the start of the 1979 model year, the 400 V8 engine was dropped from the options list as Chrysler stopped producing big-block V8 engines in production cars during the end of 1978 model year. A performance model, the "GT" had been available with the {{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 during the previous model year (1978) and the "E58" police interceptor (360 V8-195 HP) engine was available during the 1979 model year along with HD suspension, special axle, special "GT" badging and a "turned metal" dash applique. Technology was advanced for the time with an onboard spark control computer from inception, electronic ignition, and a lockup torque converter. During the end of the 1979 model year, the mid-size B-body Dodge Magnum (along with its mid-size B-body based Chrysler Cordoba counterpart) was discontinued, as was with just the Magnum name itself, in favor of what would become a smaller, all newly designed, M-body platform based [[Dodge Mirada|Mirada]] coupe (which also would be shared along with what would become its M-body platform based Chrysler Cordoba coupe counterpart as well) all during the next four model years (1980–1983). Only 3,704 1979 Dodge Magnum coupes included a T-Top.

===NASCAR===
The mid-size B-body 1978–1979 Dodge Magnum coupe in the United States and Canada was an addition to [[Chrysler]]'s line up that allowed [[Richard Petty]] to continue racing with a [[Mopar]]. For the 1978 [[NASCAR]] season, the 1974 Charger that Chrysler teams had continued to use was no longer eligible for competition. Chrysler worked on several car designs to smooth out the current 1975 bodied Charger into something that would be reasonably aerodynamic for the big racetracks and the Magnum design was settled on in the summer of 1977 for use in the 1978 racing season. While not as aerodynamic as the 1974 Charger body, the shape of the Magnum showed promise, and the "Petty Enterprises" built test cars reached {{convert|190|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} on test runs. At first it seemed that out on the tracks the cars ran well with Petty almost winning his Daytona 125 (finishing second), and leading over 30 laps of the Daytona 500 until a blown front tire caused him to wreck. However, the lack of factory development support of the small-block Chrysler 360 V8 as a race engine was becoming more of a problem, and in high speed racing traffic the Magnum did not handle well. Petty was particularly harsh in his criticism of the car - before the season he declared, "The Magnum is undriveable at 190 MPH."

By the latter half of the 1978 season, Petty and [[Neil Bonnett]] (the two top Mopar teams) gave up on the car's inconsistent performance and switched to [[Chevrolet]]s and [[Oldsmobile]]s, leaving independent drivers [[Buddy Arrington]] (who bought a few of Petty's Magnums, along with some parts), [[Frank Warren (NASCAR driver)|Frank Warren]], and Country singer [[Marty Robbins]] to soldier on without any substantial factory support (Chrysler did provide sheet metal and some engine parts to teams driving Magnums). From August 1978, two to five independent teams showed up with Magnums in NASCAR races, until January 1981, when NASCAR switched to smaller bodied cars. The Magnum never enjoyed the racing heritage of its predecessors, but it was not without its own achievements. Petty scored 7 top five finishes in his 17 races with the car, and Bonnett won three poles and scored 5 top five finishes with his. Petty recognized the Magnum with a commemorative decal, depicting his famous number 43 emblazoned on a Magnum for his 1992 Fan Appreciation Tour. Though Petty never won a race in a Magnum, his son, [[Kyle Petty]] drove one of his father's year-old Dodge Magnums in his first race (1979 Daytona ARCA 200), and won. Kyle raced in five NASCAR races using the left-over Magnums in 1979, but wrecked them beyond reasonable repair by the 1980 Daytona 125. As of December 2012, only two NASCAR Magnums still existed; one (an ex-Petty car) resides in the Talladega NASCAR museum, and the other; ([[Marty Robbins]]' 1978 Magnum No. 42) has been restored and is owned by a private party in southern California.

In the old Simca Factory in São Bernardo do Campo, São Paulo, Brazil, the [[Dodge Dart]] was produced from 1969 until 1981 (more than 92,000 cars were sold). They were built with minor changes from the original model, starting in 1969, and were all largely based on the 1968 Dart GT (and GTS). For its last three years of production, a two-door upper trim level version of the Dart was sold as the ''Magnum'', featuring the 318 in³ [[V8 engine|V8]] engine used in all Dodge coupe and sedan models in Brazil.  A unique fiberglass front fascia that included four headlights to give it a more modern look was used, while the rear end was very similar to the American Dart 1975 (the Dart model from the same year having been identical to the Swinger from USA). The Magnum (top of the line) was sold as a separate model from the Dart (bottom line), despite being technically almost identical to the Dart.

The Dodge was very well received in Brazil. Today one can find car clubs with many Dodge coupes in good condition. The coupe and sedan models in Brazil were (all variations from the Dart 1968 model): Dart [1969–1981] (as a 2-door coupe from 1970 until 1981 or as a four-door sedan from 1969 until 1981), sporting but lower priced Dart SE, better equipped Dart DeLuxo (two or four doors), Gran Coupe (more luxurious yet than the Dart DeLuxo, with two doors only), Gran Sedan (above the Dart DeLuxo model, with four doors only), Charger R/T [1971–1980] (coupe bodywork only, from 1971 to 1980 it was the top model in sport segment), LeBaron (replacing the 'Gran Sedan' with four-door sedan body, from 1979 to 1981) and Magnum (substitute for the 'Gran Coupe', Brazil's top model in the luxurius segment from 1979 to 1981).

===First generation===
In 1980, the F-body cars were discontinued in Mexico, as well in the U.S, so the compact cars Dodge Dart (using the front of the Volaré and the rear of the Aspen), Valiant Volaré (using the front of the Aspen and the rear of the Volaré), and sporty [[Dodge Super Bee#Mexican Valiant Super Bee|Super Bee]], were dropped for this year.

In 1979, Chrysler de México introduced the Chrysler LeBaron based on the M-body platform, and two years later it introduced the Dodge Diplomat as the Dodge Dart. These were very similar to the American Plymouth Gran Fury in appearance and trim, but had Chrysler's Rallye wheels instead of deluxe wheel covers. Chrysler de México used a small platform and the Magnum name, equipping it with 360 CID (5.9L) V8 engine (rated at {{convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, with a [[Carter Carburetor|Carter]] [[ThermoQuad carburetor|ThermoQuad]] four barrel (four-choke) carburetor), Mopar oil cooler, a 3-speed [[TorqueFlite#A727 (36RH/37RH)|A727 automatic transmission]] ([[List of Chrysler transmissions#Manual|A833]] 4-speed [[Transmission (mechanics)|manual]] optional), heavy-duty suspension, power brakes, stabilizer bars in the front and rear and a [[Dana Holding Corporation|Dana]] 44 differential with positive pass and [[Limited-slip differential|posi-traction]]. All the windows and windshield chromed metals were painted flat black; only the bumpers and the grille were chromed. Both the front fascia and the front fenders wore= "Magnum" lettering, with a 5.9L decal on the fenders as well. The Mexican Dodge Magnum was offered only for the 1981–1982 model years.

}}

The K-car based Mexican Dodge Magnum was a sporty 2-door compact, based on the Dodge Aries coupe body (with blackout 1982–1985 Dodge 400 grille in 1983–1985 and a blackout 1986–1988 Plymouth Caravelle grille in 1986-1988) offered from 1983 to 1988 with available turbocharger ("TurboChrysler" engine) from 1984 on. Four engines were offered for the Mexican Dodge Magnum K, a SOHC I-4 2.2L (K-Trans-4, 1983–86), a turbocharged SOHC I-4 2.2L (1984–86) and two other 2.5L SOHC I-4s, with and without turbocharger (1987–88). When it was introduced, the Mexican Dodge Magnum 400 Turbo was advertised as "Mexico's fastest car" in the TV commercials of the time, and it surely was in 1985, when the "Fox" (1979–84) 5.0L Mexican Ford Mustang was dropped from the catalog of Ford Mexico. The Mexican front-wheel drive Magnum was officially called "Dodge Magnum 400" between 1983 and 1984, as it was a sporty Mexican variation of the American Dodge 400 of the early eighties (without the vinyl roof of the US version and with high output 2.2L engine (available turbocharger from 1984 on), heavy-duty suspension, sporty wheels, tires, dash, steering wheel, console, shifter and seats). In 1984, the Mexican Magnum 400 Turbo was the closest thing to an American Dodge Daytona Turbo south of the border. For 1985, the "400" suffix was dropped. For the 1987 season, the turbocharger received an intercooler and the power from the turbo engine changed from 140 to {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The K-car based Magnum was replaced by the Mexican Chrysler Shadow GTS for the 1989 model year.

The Magnum name was revived in 2004 for the 2005 model year, as a [[station wagon]] based on the [[Chrysler LX platform]]. The new Magnum was a [[badge engineering|badge engineered]] station wagon version of the [[Chrysler 300]] manufactured at the same plant in [[Brampton, Ontario]], Canada. The Magnum had four engine options; the ''SE'' features the 190&amp;nbsp;[[horsepower|hp]] [[Chrysler LH engine#2.7|2.72&amp;nbsp;L LH V6]], the ''SXT'' had the {{convert|250|hp|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler SOHC V6 engine#3.5|3.5&amp;nbsp;L V6]], and the ''RT'' had the new 340&amp;nbsp;hp 5.7&amp;nbsp;L [[Chrysler Hemi engine#5.7|Hemi]] [[V8 engine|V8]]. The SRT-8 has a 425&amp;nbsp;hp 6.1 [[Liter|L]] Hemi engine. [[All-wheel drive]] became an option in 2005 on SXT and RT models. The SRT8, AWD SXT, and the RT use a [[Mercedes-Benz]]-derived 5-speed [[automatic transmission]], while all other models use a four-speed automatic.
The Magnum was built at the [[Brampton Assembly|Brampton Assembly Plant]], near [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, from 2004 to the end of model year 2008.&lt;ref name="chrysler_job_cuts"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071101/ap_on_bi_ge/chrysler_job_cuts |title=Chrysler to cut up to 12,000 jobs |accessdate=November 1, 2007 |publisher=Yahoo News |year=2007 |author=Dee-Ann Durbin (AP) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103060124/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071101/ap_on_bi_ge/chrysler_job_cuts |archivedate=November 3, 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A high performance '''SRT-8''' version debuted at the 2005 [[Los Angeles Auto Show]]. The SRT-8 was based on a concept car that was displayed at the 2003 Los Angeles Auto Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dodge Magnum SRT-8|url=http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/1567/Dodge-Magnum-SRT-8.html|work=www.ultimatecarpage.com|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It went on sale in 2005 as a 2006 model. Like the [[Chrysler 300C|300C]] SRT-8, it featured the new {{convert|370|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[Chrysler Hemi engine#6.1|Hemi engine]], which produces 425&amp;nbsp;hp (317&amp;nbsp;kW). 20-inch wheels, firmer suspension, bigger brakes (Brembo), new lower-body treatment, and a revised front and rear-fascia completes the transformation. The SRT-8 was named '''Best New Modern Muscle Car''' in the 2006 [[Canadian Car of the Year]] contest.

===Europe and Australia===
In Europe and Australia, the Magnum was sold as the [[Chrysler 300#Station wagon|Chrysler 300 Touring]]. It was essentially the same as the U.S.-market Magnum, but with the Chrysler 300C's front end and interior, and right-hand-drive for Australia and the U.K. The 300C Touring added an available 3.0 L CRD Turbo Diesel version. The 300C Touring was assembled in Austria.

===2008 changes===
[[File:2008 Dodge Magnum SRT-8 DC.JPG|thumb|right|2008 Dodge Magnum SRT-8]]For the 2008 model year, the Magnum received a facelift as well as an updated interior in line with that of the Dodge Charger. The front fascia sported new aggressively squared off headlights and a smaller rectangular grille more reminiscent of the Charger. The SRT-8 variant gained a new hood scoop. A new bright red paint scheme was introduced. The new changes brought the car closer to its Charger platform mate, away from the [[Chrysler 300]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automobilemag.com/auto_shows/2007_detroit/0701_2008_dodge_magnum/ |title=Automobile Magazine: 2008 Dodge Magnum |publisher=Automobilemag.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancellation===
On November 1, 2007, Chrysler announced that, as part of its restructuring plans, the Dodge Magnum would be one of four models discontinued after the 2008 model year. In Chrysler's words: "The Magnum, along with the PT Cruiser convertible, the Crossfire, and the Pacifica were not earning their keep". Production ended on March 28, 2008. The Dodge Magnum (along with the short-wheelbase Dodge Caravan) has been replaced by the [[Dodge Journey]].&lt;ref name="chrysler_job_cuts"/&gt;

[[File:1998 Dodge Avenger.jpg|thumb|left|1998 Dodge Avenger coupe]]

Introduced as a two-door coupe in North America, the Dodge Avenger was built from 1994 to 2000 in a similar size and price class as the [[Dodge Daytona]], which was discontinued in 1993. The Avenger, along with the similar [[Chrysler Sebring]] coupe, was built by [[Diamond Star Motors]] (DSM), a [[joint venture]] between [[Chrysler Corporation]] and [[Mitsubishi Motors]], on a version of the [[Mitsubishi Galant]] platform (which also spawned the similar [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]]). Chrysler sold its equity stake to Mitsubishi in 1993, and Diamond-Star Motors was renamed to Mitsubishi Motors Manufacturing America (MMMA) on July 1, 1995. Avengers and Sebring coupes built from 1994 to 1996 both have DSM markings in their engine compartments.

The Avenger was built on a {{convert|103.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase and used either a 2.0&amp;nbsp;L [[inline-four engine]] (the Chrysler 420A) or a Mitsubishi-designed [[Mitsubishi 6G7x engine#6G73|2.5 L V6]]. The four-cylinder was coupled to either a five-speed [[manual transmission]], shared with the [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]] and [[Eagle Talon]], or a four-speed automatic. The [[V6 engine]] was only available with the A604 automatic transmission.&lt;ref name="allpar"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/model/sebring.html |title=Chrysler Sebring and Dodge Avenger coupes: Mitsubishi Mopars |first=David |last=Debertin |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Avengers featured a fully independent double wishbone suspension and variable speed rack and pinion steering.

===Changes===
[[Anti-lock braking system]] was used in all ES models to 1999. In 1997, the front fascia, trunklid, and rear bumper were changed; 16-inch wheels were standard, and the license plate was moved from the decklid to the rear bumper. In 2000, the V6 and automatic transmission combination was made standard on all Avengers, and ABS was made an "option" for ES models. The four-cylinder engine was dropped for 2000.

===Trims===
*1995–2000 - "Highline" base model (V6 among other options made standard in 2000)
*1995–2000 - ''ES''

From 1997, a "Sport Appearance Package" was made available on Base model. This package included 16" wheels, a deck lid spoiler, along with other standard and optional features.

Never a high selling vehicle, in 2000 the Avenger was discontinued and replaced by the [[Dodge Stratus]] coupe for 2001. This model was also made at the former Diamond Star plant by Mitsubishi, using the Eclipse platform and architecture, though the Stratus sedan was engineered and built by Chrysler.

The Dodge Avenger nameplate was reused in February 2007 as a 2008 model year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Dodge costs less than outgoing model |publisher=Autoweek |first=Bradford |last=Wernle |url= http://autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070117/FREE/70116004/1528/vents |date=January 17, 2007 |accessdate=July 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; sedan to replace the [[Dodge Stratus]], whose coupe version had replaced the original Avenger in 2001. According to some reports, the Avenger, along with the redesigned [[Chrysler Sebring]], shares a [[DaimlerChrysler]]/[[Mitsubishi Motors]] platform called JS which used the Mitsubishi GS as a starting point. The base engine in the '''SE''' and '''SXT''' trim levels was the 2.4&amp;nbsp;L [[Global Engine Manufacturing Alliance|GEMA]] I4 naturally aspirated "World Engine", a joint venture between [[DaimlerChrysler]], [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]], and [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]]. Additional engines included an optional 2.7&amp;nbsp;L V6 in the '''SXT''' and a standard 3.5&amp;nbsp;L V6 in the '''R/T''' trim level. In addition to the 2.4&amp;nbsp;L "World Engine" and the V6s, export vehicles were offered with the 2.0&amp;nbsp;L naturally aspirated "World Engine", as well as a 2.0&amp;nbsp;L turbocharged diesel ([[Unit injector|Pumpe-Düse]]) made by [[Volkswagen]].&lt;ref name="2008-2014allpar"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.allpar.com/cars/dodge/avenger.html |title=2008-2014 Dodge Avenger cars |publisher=AllPar |accessdate=July 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a 2008 model, the Dodge Avenger came to showrooms in February 2007.
[[File:Dodge Avenger rear 20080517.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view]]

Features on the new Avenger include optional heated/cooled cup holders as well as Dodge's new "Chill Zone", a feature that comes standard on all Avenger models, which can store up to four 12-US&amp;nbsp;fl&amp;nbsp;oz cans in the glove box and chill them to 40&amp;nbsp;degrees&amp;nbsp;Fahrenheit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cargurus.com/Cars/Overview-c8193-2008-Avenger.html |title=2008 Dodge Avenger |accessdate=2008-06-29 |work= |publisher=CarGurus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like its [[Dodge Journey]] stablemate, the Avenger's exterior was styled by Chrysler's [[Ryan Nagode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dodge has strong hand in Journey |publisher=The London Free Press |first=Harry |last=Pegg |date=February 8, 2008 |url= http://lfpress.ca/perl-bin/publish.cgi?x=articles&amp;p=224188&amp;s=wheels}}{{dead link|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interior was styled by Ben S. Chang.&lt;ref name="2008-2014allpar"/&gt;

The Avenger replaced the [[Dodge Charger (LX)|Charger]] as Dodge's car in [[NASCAR]] in 2007 for [[Car of Tomorrow]] races. It got its first win with former [[Formula One]] driver [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] in the [[2007 Toyota/Save Mart 350]] at the [[Infineon Raceway]].

The Avenger was officially unveiled at the [[Mondial de l'Automobile|Paris Motor Show]] on September 28, 2006 as a [[concept car]]. It was launched in Europe and was sold in the United Kingdom, filling a gap in the [[Chrysler]] range that was left by the [[Chrysler Neon|Neon's]] demise four years earlier. It was also launched in Australia, although with only the 2.4&amp;nbsp;L engine. The 2007 - 2014 model was sold widely in New Zealand.

In the United Kingdom, it has been discontinued, although sales continued in the Republic of Ireland and in Western Europe until late 2009 following Fiat's takeover of Chrysler Group. This new version continued with SE, SXT trim levels and is not badged the same way as North American or the South American versions. The Avenger competed directly with the [[Chevrolet Malibu]] and [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]], with the 2007 and later [[Chrysler Sebring]] being aimed at the higher priced American cars such as the [[Mercury Milan]], [[Pontiac G6]], and [[Saturn Aura]].

In the US, the Avenger was launched with a 30-second television ad, "Tuned Up," that debuted Sunday, March 4, 2007 during NHL hockey, an ad in which a lab technician discovers he can play "[[Smoke on the Water]]" by [[Deep Purple]] on the Avenger's transmission. Another television spot likened the Avenger to the "superhero" vehicle for the everyman, depicting a driver piloting his Avenger through [[Gotham City|Gotham-like]] streets and alleys, speaking to the MyGig entertainment system in distinctly [[Batman]]-reminiscent tones, to arrive home, pull into a two-car garage and open the rear door to a sleeping child in the rear car-seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 Dodge Avenger Launches Marketing Campaign |publisher=Carbuyersnotebook.com |date=2 March 2007 |url= http://www.carbuyersnotebook.com/archives/2007/03/2008_dodge_aven_2.htm |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081002085058/http://www.carbuyersnotebook.com/archives/2007/03/2008_dodge_aven_2.htm |archivedate=2 October 2008 |accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revisions===
In the 2009 model year, like its [[Dodge Caliber|Caliber]], [[Dodge Charger (LX)|Charger]], [[Dodge Grand Caravan|Grand Caravan]], [[Dodge Journey|Journey]], and [[Dodge Nitro|Nitro]] models, the "AVENGER" badge at the trunklid's left was pushed to the right to make way for "DODGE" at the left.

For 2011, the Avenger received its first major overhaul since its 2008 re-introduction. Exterior changes include slightly revised sheet metal with a new crosshair grille displaying the new Dodge logo on the lower right corner of the grille, a sleeker bumper cut design, and standard LED combination tail lights. Changes to the interior are more noticeable with a completely redesigned dashboard and instrument panel featuring an available 6.5-inch navigation/media center screen. Higher-quality soft-touch plastics for dashboard, door, and trim panels replaces the old materials, which were criticized for their poor fit and finish quality, as well as being unpleasant to the touch. The seats receive better cushioning and higher-grade upholstery. Two-tone interior color combinations will be available.&lt;ref name="motortrend.com"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/sedans/1010_2011_dodge_avenger_look/index.html |title=First Look: 2011 Dodge Avenger |first=Benson |last=Kong |date=October 28, 2010 |publisher=Motor Trend |accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mechanically, the 2011 Avenger came standard with the existing {{convert|173|hp|abbr=on}} 2.4&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Global Engine Manufacturing Alliance|GEMA]]'' I4, although it was now paired with a six-speed automatic, as well as the option of the previous four-speed. Also available was the new 3.6&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Chrysler Pentastar engine|Pentastar]]'' V6, which generates {{convert|283|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|260|lb·ft|N·m}} of torque. The suspension was revised to improve handling and ride quality.&lt;ref name="motortrend.com"/&gt; Trim level designations were replaced by '''Express''', '''Mainstreet''', '''Lux''', and '''Heat''' models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.edmunds.com/dodge/avenger/2011/#overview-pod-anchor |title=Full 2011 Dodge Avenger Review |publisher=Edmunds |accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dodge Avenger was ranked the "Most American Made" sedan by the [[American University]]'s [[Kogod School of Business]] 2013 Made in America Auto Index.&lt;ref name="kogodnow.com/autoindex/"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kogodnow.com/autoindex/#autoindex |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403060112/http://kogodnow.com/autoindex/#autoindex |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-04-03 |title=New Auto Index Redefines "American Made" Cars |publisher=Kogod School of Business, The American University |date=May 2013 |accessdate=7 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dodge Avenger also has an overall rating of 6.7.&lt;ref name="usnews.rankingsandreviews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/Dodge_Avenger/ |title=2014 Dodge Avenger Review |publisher=US News &amp; World Report |accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety===
The 2008 to 2013 Avenger, also sold as the Chrysler Sebring from 2008 to 2010, and the Chrysler 200 from 2011 to 2013, receives an overall "Good" rating with no significant injuries. In the small overlap test, also conducted by the IIHS, the car received an overall "Acceptable" rating, due to marginal dummy kinematics and slight intrusion into the passenger compartment. In the side test, the Avenger earns a "Good" rating, however, rib fractures would be possible for the driver. In the roof strength evaluation, it earns a "Good" rating, as well as its head restraints and seats. The Avenger earned the "Top Safety Pick" award in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, and earned the "Top Safety Pick+" award for 2013.

===Discontinuation===
The discontinuation of the Dodge Avenger was announced by the automaker in early 2014, along with the end of the Chrysler 200 convertible model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Noah |last=Joseph |url= http://www.autoblog.com/2014/02/23/chrysler-200-convertible-dodge-avenger-cancelled-report/ |title=Chrysler killing off 200 Convertible, Dodge Avenger |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=23 February 2014 |accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final 2014 model year Avengers were produced during first quarter 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.carscoops.com/2014/02/2015-chrysler-200-wont-get-convertible.html |title=2015 Chrysler 200 Won't Get Convertible Model; Dodge Avenger Will Be Axed as Well |first=Dan |last=Mihalascu |publisher=Carscoops.com |date=24 February 2014 |accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motorsport==
The first-generation Dodge Avenger body style was widely used in the [[National Hot Rod Association]], but came to the most prominence being driven by Darrell Alderman and [[Scott Geoffrion]], during their run from 1994–2000, as the ''Dodge Boys''. The car was also used for the [[IROC XIX|1994]] and [[IROC XX|1995]] incarnations of the [[International Race of Champions]].  Avenger sheet metal was also used on race cars by several [[Automobile Racing Club of America|ARCA]] race teams from 1995 to 2000.

The second-generation Dodge Avenger was used in the [[2007 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2007 NASCAR Nextel Cup Season]] as the [[Car of Tomorrow]] model from Dodge. In 2008, the Dodge CoT was changed back to the Charger.

The '''Dodge Kingsway''' is an automobile built by [[Dodge]] for export markets. The Kingsway name was adopted for the 1940 models. Before that, the export models based on Plymouth models had no unique model names.

Kingsways were rebadged [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] vehicles, although they were often equipped with [[Dodge]] bumpers and trim.&lt;ref name=Godshall77&gt;{{cite journal | ref = AQ181 | journal = [[Automobile Quarterly]] | volume = XVIII | number = 1, first quarter 1980 | date = 1980 | title = Wayward Wayfarer: The story of a Dodge | first = Jeffrey I. | last = Godshall | location = Princeton, NJ | issn = 0005-1438 | page = 77 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were supposed to help overseas Dodge dealers to sell cars in a lower price class. The first export models were made in 1935, and they continued through the 1959 model year,&lt;ref name=allparworld&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.allpar.com/world/plymouth.html | title = A Plymouth By Any Other Name: Branding Exported Chryslers, 1932-1972 | work = Allpar.com | first1 = Mike | last1 = Sealey | first2 = Bill | last2 = Watson | first3 = Jim | last3 = Benjaminson | accessdate = 2015-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with many different body styles and variations depending on the market they were intended for and which Plymouth models were available at the time. They were built in either [[Detroit, Michigan]], or in [[Windsor, Ontario]], Canada.

==Versions==
The Kingsway was the lowest-priced [[Plymouth Deluxe]] model in 1949-52 ({{convert|111|in|mm|-1|abbr=on|disp=or}} wheelbase&lt;ref name=Godshall77/&gt;), 1954-58 (based on [[Plymouth Plaza]] series) and 1959 ([[Plymouth Savoy]]). The Kingsway DeLuxe was based on the Plymouth DeLuxe (1946–50, {{convert|118+1/2|in|mm|0|abbr=on|disp=comma}} wheelbase&lt;ref name=Godshall77/&gt;), Cambridge (1951–53), Savoy (1954–58) and Belvedere (1959). The top line Kingsway Custom was Dodge's version of the Plymouth Special DeLuxe (1946–50), Cranbrook (1951–53), Belvedere (1954–58) and Fury (1959). For 1959 only, the Kingsway offered a model based on the Sport Fury, the Kingsway Lancer.

With the introduction of the Dodge Dart for 1960, the Kingsway line was dropped.

==Introduction==
The first use of the Kingsway name was in Canada for the 1940 model year (model D14), basically Dodge's rebadged version of the [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]]. The base model came with one taillamp, one sunvisor and one windshield wiper - all on the driver's side. The body was Plymouth with Dodge nameplates, hood ornament and a grille that fit the Plymouth front end. Body styles were business coupe, 2-door and 4-door sedans.&lt;ref name="chrysler"&gt;{{Cite book | ref = SCchr | title = Standard Catalog of Chrysler, 1924-1990 | first = John | last = Lee | publisher = Krause Publications, Inc. | location = Iola, WI | page = 260 | date = 1990 | isbn = 0-87341-142-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kingsway name continued for the 1941 model year, on model D20. It was now available in two versions, base and Special. The Special was about $25 more than the base model. Body styles offered were the same as in 1940 with the addition of a 5-passenger coupe with fold-up (auxiliary) seats in the rear compartment.

For the 1942 model year, the Kingsway name was replaced by the DeLuxe, the same name as used on the base model Plymouth series. The DeLuxe was also the lowest priced Dodge for Canada from 1946 to 1950, although other export markets continued to use the Kingsway moniker.&lt;ref name=Godshall77/&gt;

Chrysler of Canada reintroduced the Kingsway name to the Canadian market for the 1951 model year, as the Canadian Dodge rebadged version of the Plymouth Concord, and replaced the DeLuxe name used on 111" wheelbase models in 1949-50.

The 1951 Kingsway offered a 2-door business coupe, 2-door fastback sedan, 2-door Suburban wagon and a 2-door Savoy wagon.  The Savoy used interior and exterior trim similar to that used on higher priced models. The business coupe was dropped for the 1952 model year.  As with the Plymouth Concord, the Canadian Dodge Kingsway was dropped for 1953.

The Kingsway, along with the [[Plymouth Savoy]], were also assembled in [[India]] by [[Premier Automobiles]] until the late 1950s.

The '''Dodge Durango''' is a [[mid-size]] [[sport utility vehicle]] (SUV) produced by [[Dodge]]. The first two generations were very similar in that both were based on the [[Dodge Dakota]], both featured a [[body-on-frame]] construction and both were produced at the [[Newark Assembly]] Plant in [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]], Delaware.

The third-generation Durango is built on the same [[car platform|platform]] as the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]], features [[unibody]] construction, and has been assembled at the [[Jefferson North Assembly]] Plant in [[Detroit]], Michigan, since mid-2010.

The Durango was marketed as a sturdy truck-based SUV designed to hold up to seven passengers and tow up to {{cvt|7,500|lb|kg}} when properly equipped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmunds.com/reviews/list/top10/102426/article.html "Top 10 Vehicles for Towing" Edmunds.com], retrieved on 2010-02-08. {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090831070459/http://www.edmunds.com/reviews/list/top10/102426/article.html |date=August 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Durango shared a front end, instrument panel, and front seats with the Dakota pickup on which it was based. Original designs of the eight-passenger Durango featured a rear-facing third row similar to many older [[station wagons]]. To make room for a more practical forward-facing third row, Dodge shortened the length of the front doors and raised the roof two inches (5&amp;nbsp;cm) beyond the front seats, allowing for [[stadium seating]]. The Durango's roof rack was designed to mask the appearance of the raised roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.allpar.com/model/durango-trucks/interior.html |title= Developing the 1997-2003 Dodge Durango interior |work= Allpar.com |accessdate= 2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4.7&amp;nbsp;L [[Chrysler PowerTech engine#4.7|Magnum]] [[V8 engine|V8]] replaced the 5.2&amp;nbsp;L [[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 5.2|Magnum]] V8 engine for 2000; however, the 5.2 was still available in the early 2000 models. In that same year, a special [[All-wheel drive|AWD]] performance version called the R/T was released with a 5.9&amp;nbsp;L [[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 5.9|Magnum]] V8. In 1999 and 2000, a limited-edition Shelby S.P.360 version was offered that featured a supercharged version of the 5.9&amp;nbsp;L [[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 5.9|Magnum]] V8 engine. Output is {{cvt|360|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=}} and {{convert|412|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque. Exterior modifications include unique wheels, tires, suspension, and bumpers. It came standard with Viper blue paint with two racing stripes down the center of the truck. It had a [[0 to 60 mph]] (97 km/h) time of 7.1 seconds. The top speed was {{cvt|142|mph|km/h}}.

===Model year changes===
[[File:2001 Dodge Durango Sport -- NHTSA 02.jpg|thumb|left|Dodge Durango Sport]]
For 1999, the Durango was made available with [[two-wheel drive]]. A 3.9&amp;nbsp;L [[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 3.9L|Magnum]] V6 engine was available, but few were sold. Minor changes were made for the second year, two new paint colors and notable options available including {{convert|6|x|9|in|mm |adj=on}} heated rear view mirrors and steering wheel-mounted radio controls. Leather seats became standard on SLT&amp;nbsp;Plus models, and body-color wheel flares became standard on SLT Plus and four-wheel drive models.

The 2000 model year included a new 4.7&amp;nbsp;L [[Chrysler PowerTech engine#4.7|Magnum]] V8 engine, which replaced the reliable 5.2&amp;nbsp;L [[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 5.2|Magnum]] V8, as the standard engine for four-wheel drive models. The 3.9&amp;nbsp;L [[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 3.9L|Magnum]] V6 engine was no longer available, leaving only V8s for the rest of the production run. The high-performance Durango R/T came equipped with a performance-tuned 5.9&amp;nbsp;L [[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 5.9|Magnum]] V8 and all-wheel drive.

For 2001, Dodge focused on interior upgrades as Durango's interior trim panels, dash-mounted controls, instrument panel, overhead console, and steering wheel were all redesigned. The [[transfer case]] selector on 4X4 models changed from a manual lever on the console to a switch on the dash. The instrument cluster was updated, and an electronic vehicle information center was incorporated into the overhead console. For improved rear passenger comfort, a dual-zone climate-control system was added as standard equipment. Sound systems were improved on all models and now came standard with six speakers. Other minor changes include: door panels, revised seats, aluminium wheels, and minor changes to trim options.

In 2002, the new SXT version of the Durango was offered as the entry-level trim package. Optional side curtain airbags were added for safety. The 2003 Durango featured minor mechanical changes, most notable was the addition of four-wheel [[disc brake]]s.

In 1999, the following models: 4WD 5.2L V8, 4WD 5.9L V8 hold the best crash test results in this Durango year and manufacturing, with it holding a 6.8 out of 10 total rating.

The second-generation Durango was first shown as a concept dubbed Dodge Durango R/T concept at the 2003 [[Detroit Auto Show]]. It debuted shortly before the companion Dakota. Like the Dakota, it has much in common with the large [[Dodge Ram]] pickup, including a fully boxed frame. It is {{convert|7|in|mm|abbr=on}} longer, {{convert|2|in|mm|abbr=on}} wider, and {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}} taller than the previous model. It also offered a third-row bench with three seats, giving it an eight-seat capacity. The design took its styling primarily from the [[Dodge Powerbox]] concept, which was itself based on the 1999 Dodge Power Wagon concept, and the 2003-2004 Durango R/T concept.

Debuting for 2004 was a new coil-spring rear suspension for the solid rear axle. A [[Watt's linkage#Vehicle suspension|Watt's linkage]] system is fitted to the rear axle, centering the axle and reducing rear-end skate over rough surfaces, and allowing a lower and wider cargo floor.

{{redirect-distinguish|Chrysler Aspen|Dodge Aspen}}
[[File:Chrysler 012.jpg|thumb|right|2007–2009 Chrysler Aspen]]

The Chrysler Aspen is a luxury SUV from [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]]. Launched for the 2007 model-year, the Aspen was based on the Dodge Durango SUV.

The Aspen was the first truck-based SUV commercialized under the Chrysler brand, although the [[Chrysler PT Cruiser|PT Cruiser]] was the first truck-based Chrysler brand vehicle as classified under [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]]'s (CAFE) regulation. With this introduction, as of 2007, all American automobile brands had an SUV in their range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.redsofts.com/articles/read/329/59178/Chrysler_Aspen_Boasting_the_Chrysler_Design.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081011083213/http://www.redsofts.com/articles/read/329/59178/Chrysler_Aspen_Boasting_the_Chrysler_Design.html |url-status= dead |archive-date= October 11, 2008 |title=Chrysler Aspen Boasting the Chrysler Design |accessdate=April 27, 2008 |first=Jenny |last=McLane |year=2005 |quote=As per the Chrysler Aspen’s introduction, all American automobile brands have a SUV under their wings. }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2012}} The truck was unveiled at the 2005 [[North American International Auto Show]].

The 2007 Chrysler Aspen appears in the 2006 movie ''[[Deck the Halls (2006 film)|Deck the Halls]]''.

Due to slow sales, it was discontinued after the 2009 model year. However, the Dodge Durango Citadel covers the mid-size luxury SUV segment as of 2011.

===Discontinuation===
In October 2008, Chrysler announced that the shutdown of the [[Newark Assembly]] facility, which produced the Durango and the Chrysler Aspen, would be moved up to the end of 2008, thereby ending production of the Aspen and Durango after the 2009 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideline.com/chrysler/aspen/2009/chrysler-kills-durango-and-aspen-hybrids.html |title=Edmunds Insideline: Chrysler Kills Durango and Aspen Hybrids |publisher=Edmunds.com |date=23 October 2008 |accessdate=2 February 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027210744/http://www.insideline.com/chrysler/aspen/2009/chrysler-kills-durango-and-aspen-hybrids.html |archivedate=27 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aZcLz3jeCj3c |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131203000241/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aZcLz3jeCj3c |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2013-12-03 |title=Chrysler to Cut 1,825 Jobs on Early Plant Closure, Output Trim |date=2009-10-23 |first=Mike |last=Ramsey |publisher=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt; Production ceased on December 19, 2008.

=== Overview ===
After announcing the discontinuation of the Durango after the 2009 model year, Dodge released an Internet site and teaser photos of the third-generation Dodge Durango on August 16, 2010. 

The 2011 Dodge Durango entered production on December 14, 2010,&lt;ref name="chrysler1" /&gt; alongside the second-generation [[Dodge Charger (LX)|Charger]] in the 2011 vehicle lineup. It went on sale for general dealership availability in mid-January 2011.

The third-generation Durango is built alongside the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] at the [[Jefferson North Assembly Plant]] in [[Detroit]], Michigan, sharing the assembly line, running gear, powertrains, and chassis parts with the Grand Cherokee. The wheelbase of the Durango is longer than that of the Grand Cherokee. It features three rows of seating compared to the Grand Cherokee's two rows.

=== Powertrain ===
The third-generation Durango features three engines. The base engine is a new 3.6&amp;nbsp;L V6 engine producing {{convert|290|hp|kW PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|260|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,800&amp;nbsp;rpm; 90% of peak torque is available from 1,600 to 6,400&amp;nbsp;rpm. The [[Chrysler Pentastar engine|Pentastar]] [[V6 engine]] is backed by a Mercedes W5A580 five-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]], with Chrysler's controls and the driver-interactive control. The 5.7&amp;nbsp;L Hemi [[Variable valve timing|VVT]] V8 returned with {{convert|360|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|390|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque, which features the 545RFE five-speed automatic. The Hemi V8 also comes with a "fuel-saver" (cylinder deactivation) mode. This feature is primarily used when the vehicle is cruising at constant speeds on level ground.

===Updates===
[[File:'14 Dodge Durango.JPG|right|thumb|Refreshed headlights and grille for 2014]]
[[File:Durango Quebec City.jpg|thumb|The back of a post-facelift Dodge Durango.]]

Dodge unveiled its revised 2014 model Durango at the 2013 [[New York International Auto Show]]. The 2014 Durango was redesigned with sportier-looking lines, an eight-speed automatic transmission, and a new design trim similar to the Rallye, with blackened plastic bumper and outline. The tail lights were reworked to feature a single LED 'Racetrack' tail lamp similar to the Charger and Dart. On the inside, Dodge added a revised steering wheel, instrument cluster, rotary shift knob, and a reconfigurable 7-in (780mm) [[Thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display|thin film transistor]] display first seen on the Dart.

The 2015 Durango received a new package available for the R/T trim, consisting of a Premium Nappa Leather Group option featuring radar red leather seats, {{convert|0.8|in|mm|adj=mid|-lower ride height}}, black headlamp bezels, HID low beams and LED DRL'S, optional R/T embroidery on the seats, a nine-speaker sound system with a subwoofer, a {{convert|360|hp|kW|abbr=on|0}} 5.7&amp;nbsp;L Hemi paired with ZF's eight-speed transmission, and a {{convert|20|in|adj=on}} Granite Crystal wheel finished in black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blog.caranddriver.com/sammy-hagar-is-stoked-dodge-now-offering-radar-red-leather-on-2015-durango-rt/ |title= Sammy Hagar is Stoked: Dodge Now Offering Radar Red Leather on 2015 Durango R/T |first= Davey G. |last=Johnson |work= Car and Driver |date=27 March 2015 |accessdate= 9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2016 the Durango received the new Pentastar Upgrade V6 which adds Stop/Start, Variable Valve Lift and better drivability through a 15% enhanced torque curve and increasing the Variable Valve Timing from 50 degrees to 70 degrees. Other technologies include Cooled EGR and friction reduction. Despite the added tech, the engine weighs 4 lbs less. Power output remains the same at 293HP/260 ft/lbs torque (single exhaust) and 295HP/260 ft/lbs torque (dual exhaust). The Durango also added new packages to their two trims, with the Anodized Platinum package for the Citadel trim and the Brass Monkey package for the Limited trim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fcauthority.com/2016/02/2016-dodge-durango-now-available-with-brass-monkey-anodized-platinum-appearance-packages/ "Dodge Durango Now Available With Brass Monkey, Andonized Platinum Appearance Packages"] from FCA Authority (February 17, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2017, the Dodge Durango Limited trim is discontinued and replaced by the new GT trim and the Base SXT trim level will now be available with three row seating fitting 7 passengers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dodge.com/2017/durango/index.html "Dodge Durango - Seven Seat Charger"]&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2018, All models received the new Uconnect radios and the 3rd Generation ZF 8 speed automatic transmission. The rotary transmission gear shifter has been replaced with a T-grip handle like in the Dodge Charger. The steering wheel has also been changed to a more sporty wheel like found in the Dodge Charger. Other changes include suede insert leather seats and black chrome inserts in the interior on the GT model.

For 2019: The Tow Group IV package gets an integrated trailer brake controller. The Dodge Durango GT trim gets the R/T- and SRT-style grille. A new GT Plus trim is added which adds several amenities to the GT trim, such as heated front and second row seats and steering wheel; 6-way passenger power seat with 4-way lumbar adjustment; two-position memory for the driver's seat, radio, and mirrors; power lift gate; and 150W inverter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dodge.com/compare/detailed-chart.html?modelYearCode=CUD201911 "2019 Dodge Durango - Compare Models"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recalls ===
On August 16, 2012, Chrysler recalled 1,661 2013-model Dodge Durango sport utility vehicles in the United States and Canada because some airbags may not deploy in an accident. The recall affects 1,449 of the seven-passenger versions of the SUVs in the United States and 212 in Canada and other markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/16/us-chrysler-usrecall-idUSBRE87F0IC20120816|title=Chrysler recalls 1,661 Dodge SUVs for airbag issue|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 24, 2015, Chrysler recalled all 2014-2015 Dodge Durangos with the {{convert|8.4|in|adj=on}} touch-screens due to security concerns with the software that controls the vehicle because it could be hacked. The vulnerability was discovered by software engineers Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek and initially posted on ''Wired''. This vulnerability would allow hackers to remotely access and take over a variety of features, including those key parts of driving via a vulnerability in the Uconnect [[In-car entertainment|infotainment system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/07/24/technology/chrysler-hack-recall/|title=Chrysler recalls 1.4 million hackable cars|publisher=CNN Money|accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/fca-responds-to-jeep-cherokee-hack-issues-patch/|title=Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler maker recalls 1.4 million vehicles amid car hacking fears|publisher=Digital Trends|accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 26, 2019, Chrysler issued a recall of 700,000 2011-2013 Durangos and Jeep Grand Cherokees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, because of an electrical failure which can cause the motor refuse to start or stop functioning while it is driving. There are no reports of accidents. The FCA group announced a free revision to both models and replacement of these pieces involved in the problem.&lt;ref&gt;https://automexico.com/industria/jeep-grand-cherokee-y-dodge-durango-son-llamadas-a-revision-aid6038&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dodge Caravan''' (also known as the '''Dodge Grand Caravan''') is a series of minivans produced by [[Chrysler]] since the 1984 model year. Marketed as the [[Dodge]] version of the [[Chrysler minivans]], the Caravan is currently in its fifth generation of production. Introduced alongside the [[Plymouth Voyager]], the Caravan was also sold by Chrysler as the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] until its 2017 replacement by the [[Chrysler Pacifica (minivan)|Chrysler Pacifica]].

Largely marketed in the United States and Canada, the Dodge Caravan was marketed in Europe as the [[Chrysler Voyager]]. From 2009 to 2014, Volkswagen marketed the [[Volkswagen Routan]], a rebadged version of the Dodge Grand Caravan.

Since its November 1983 introduction for the 1984 model year, the Dodge Caravan has been assembled at [[Windsor Assembly]], in [[Windsor, Ontario]], Canada; prior to 2010, [[Saint Louis Assembly]] (in [[Fenton, Missouri]]) was an additional source of production. Since their introduction in late 1983, over 14.6 million Chrysler minivans (including rebadged variants and export versions) have been sold worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motor1.com/news/303790/chrysler-dodge-minivan-35th-anniversary/|title=Chrysler And Dodge Minivans Get 35th Anniversary Editions|last=Gr|first=Chrysler Pacifica Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid Dodge|last2=Caravan|website=Motor1.com|language=en|access-date=2019-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

At the end of 1977, Chrysler commenced development on what would become the [[Chrysler minivans]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.allpar.com/model/m/history.html|title=Creating the Plymouth, Dodge, and Chrysler Minivan: The Caravan/Voyager Development Story|website=www.allpar.com|access-date=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the ability to park within a standard-height garage, designers sought to develop a vehicle with a low floor and car-like [[Noise, vibration, and harshness|NVH]] levels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While front-wheel drive was sought out for the design, rear-wheel drive was still considered an alternative for cost reasons.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Following the move of both Hal Sperlich and [[Lee Iacocca]] from Ford to Chrysler in late 1978, the Chrysler minivan design (codenamed T-115 at the time) adopted front-wheel drive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

While the Dodge Caravan (and Plymouth Voyager) shared no chassis underpinnings with the [[Chrysler K platform|K-cars]], the two model lines retained mechanical commonality, sharing engines and transmissions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Dodge Caravan SE 2.5 Turbo 1989 (15470607321).jpg|thumb|left|Dodge Caravan SE Turbo (Chile)]]

Originally slated for introduction as a 1982 model,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the Dodge Caravan was introduced alongside the Plymouth Voyager in November 1983 for the 1984 model year.

Interior trim, controls, and instrumentation were borrowed from the Chrysler K platform, and coupled with the lower floor enabled by the front-wheel-drive, the Caravan featured car-like ease of entry. There were three trim levels: base, SE, and LE. Notably, the Caravan, along with the [[Plymouth Voyager#First generation (S; 1984–1990)|Plymouth Voyager]], are considered to be the first mass-produced vehicles to have dedicated built in [[cup holder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bonappetit.com/trends/article/the-history-of-the-car-cup-holder|title=The History of the Car Cup Holder|last=Dean|first=Sam|website=Bon Appetit|language=en|access-date=2019-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2013/03/08/when-did-cars-get-cup-holders/|title=When Did Cars Get Cup Holders? - Sociological Images|last=Pages|first=The Society|language=en|access-date=2019-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Base vans came equipped for five passengers in two rows of seating. The LE came with seven passengers standard in three rows of seating. The base van had two bucket seats with attached armrests and open floor space between them in the front, a three-person bench seat in the second row. The seven-passenger came with two bucket seats with attached armrests and open floor space between them in the front, a two-person bench seat in the second row, and a three-person bench seat in the back row. The two bench seats in the rear were independently removable, and the large three-person bench could also be installed in the second row location via a second set of attachment points on the van's floor, ordinarily hidden with snap-in plastic covers. This configuration allowed for conventional five person seating with a sizable cargo area in the rear. The latching mechanisms for the benches were easy to operate though removing and replacing the seats typically required two adults. A front low-back 60/40 split bench, accommodating a third front passenger in the middle, was offered in the SE trim level in 1985 only, allowing for a maximum of eight passengers. This configuration was subsequently dropped. Base model curb weight 2,910&amp;nbsp;lbs.

Safety features consisted of 3-point seat belts for the front two passengers, with simple lap belts for the rear five. Seats on base models and cloth-trimmed SEs had no headrests, which were not mandated due to the van's "light truck" legal status. However, the two front seats were equipped with non-adjustable headrests on the LE model and in conjunction with vinyl upholstery on the SE. Side-impact reinforcements were mandated, and were at all seating positions front and rear. Neither [[airbags]] nor [[anti-lock braking system]]s were available.

Access to the rear rows of seating was by a large passenger-side sliding door enabling easy access in confined situations, e.g., parking. Because only one sliding door was offered, the smaller 2nd row bench seat was shifted to the driver's side of the van, facilitating passenger access to the 3rd row seat. To facilitate variable cargo storage behind the rear seat, the seat could be adjusted forward in two increments, the first of which removed roughly {{convert|6|in|mm}} of legroom from the back row passengers, and the second of which would push the bench all the way to the back of the 2nd row, making the seats unusable. The seat back of the rear bench could also be folded forward, providing a flat cargo shelf. The smaller 2nd row bench was not adjustable, nor foldable; it could only be removed entirely.

Cargo access to the rear was via a hatchback, similar to the one on the K platform station wagons. The hatch was hinged at the top and held open by gas struts.

A long wheelbase variant, marketed as the Grand Caravan, was introduced in May 1987. It allowed more cargo space behind the rear seat.

A cargo version of the Caravan, called the Mini Ram Van, was also introduced for 1984, with a flat floored cargo space four feet tall and with four feet between the wheel wells. The load capacity was {{convert|1700|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=popmen&gt;{{cite magazine | magazine = [[Popular Mechanics]] | last = Witzenburg | first = Gary | date = September 1983 | volume = 160 | number = 3 | issn = 0032-4558 | publisher = Hearst Magazines | page = 162 | title = Detroit '84 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gNQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA162#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was renamed the Caravan C/V for 1989 and was then discontinued after 1995. It was initially available with the short wheelbase; a long-wheelbase variant was introduced alongside the Grand Caravan. Unique to the Caravan C/V was the option of either having the traditional hatch door in the back or the optional swing-out bi-parting doors (with or without windows), similar to those of more traditional cargo vans. These doors were made of fiberglass and required the C/V vans to be "drop shipped", as these doors were custom installed by another vendor.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Also based on the Mini Ram and C/V were aftermarket conversion vans sold through official Chrysler dealers and from the conversion companies themselves.

===Trim levels===
*''Base'' - Included: Vinyl upholstery, 5-passenger seating, warning chimes, cigar lighter, digital clock, manual locks, windows and mirrors, 15 gallon fuel tank, tinted windows, halogen headlamps, an AM/FM stereo with four speakers, vinyl steering wheel, and intermittent wipers.
*''SE'' - Added: Cloth upholstery, reclining front seats, rear assist strap, 20 gallon fuel tank, power liftgate release, tape stripes, and steel rims.
*''LE'' - Added: Cloth-and-vinyl upholstery, front and rear fascia, forward storage console, warning lights for door ajar, storage drawer, washer fluid warning, and so forth, and power mirrors.

===Transmissions===
Both a three-speed TorqueFlite [[automatic transmission]] and a five-speed manual were available with all [[inline-four engine]]s, including the turbocharged 2.5-liter (this was a rare combination). The Plymouth Voyager, which was a rebadged version of the Caravan, was also available with a manual transmission. The Chrysler Town &amp; Country, released in 1990, which was a more luxurious repackaged version of the Caravan, had no manual transmission option. Manual transmissions were not available on V6 models of the passenger Caravan, but were an option on the Mini Ram Van and Caravan C/V's long wheelbase models with a 3.0 L V6{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.

The [[V6 engine|V6]] engines were only offered with the venerable fully hydraulically operated [[TorqueFlite]], until the computer controlled [[Ultradrive]] four-speed automatic became available in 1989. The [[Ultradrive]] offered much better fuel economy and responsiveness, particularly when paired with the inline-four engine. However, it suffered from reliability problems, usually stemming from what is known as "gear hunt" or "shift busyness", resulting in premature wear of the internal clutches. It also required an uncommon type of automatic transmission fluid and is not clearly labeled as such, leading many owners to use the more common [[Dexron|Dexron II]] rather than the specified "Mopar ATF+3", resulting in transmission damage and eventual failure.

The [[Ultradrive]] received numerous design changes in subsequent model years to improve reliability,{{Original research inline|date=February 2015}} and many early model transmissions would eventually be retrofitted or replaced with the updated versions by dealers, under warranty. These efforts were mostly successful, and most first-generation Caravans eventually got an updated transmission.{{Original research inline|date=February 2015}}

===Engines===
For the first three years of production, two engines were offered in the Caravan – both [[inline-four engine]]s with 2-barrel [[carburetors]]. The base [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2 L]] was borrowed from the [[Chrysler K Platform|Chrysler K-cars]], and produced {{convert|96|hp|kW|abbr=on}} horsepower. The higher performance fuel-injected version of the 2.2 L engine later offered in the K-cars was never offered in the Caravan, and the 2-bbl version would remain the base power plant until mid-1987. Alongside the 2.2 L, an optional Mitsubishi [[Astron 2.6|2.6 L]] engine was available, producing {{convert|104|hp|kW|abbr=on}} horsepower.

In mid-1987, the base 2.2 L I4 was replaced with a [[fuel-injected]] [[Chrysler K engine#2.5|2.5 L]] I4, which produced {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while the [[Mitsubishi Astron engine|Mitsubishi ''G54B'']] I4 was replaced with the new [[fuel-injected]] [[Mitsubishi 6G7x engine#6G72|3.0 L Mitsubishi]] [[V6 engine|V6]] producing {{convert|136|hp|kW|abbr=on}} in March of that year.

Shortly thereafter in model year 1989, a more powerful engine became optional, with a turbocharged version of the base 2.5 L producing {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Revisions to the Mitsubishi V6 upped its output to {{convert|142|hp|kW|abbr=on}} that same year, and in 1990 a new {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.3|3.3 L V6]] was added to the option list. The V6 engines became popular as sales of the 2.5 turbo dwindled and it was dropped at the end of the year. In these years, the ES model debuted (short wheelbase only) to highlight the new engines, the turbo 2.5 in particular. The ES was introduced to the long wheelbase Grand Caravan for 1991 and continued throughout 2003, before it was discontinued and replaced with the SXT.

}}The second-generation Dodge Caravan was introduced for the 1991 model year.  Intended as an extensive revision of the 1984-1990 generation, while the chassis underpinnings were carried over (renamed the [[Chrysler minivans (AS)|Chrysler AS platform]]), the only shared body panels were the front doors and sliding door.  Following the introduction of the [[Ford Aerostar]] and [[Chevrolet Lumina APV|General Motors APV]] minivans, designers sought to improve the exterior aerodynamics and handling of the model line.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/1991-voyager.html|title=1991-1995 Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager minivans|website=www.allpar.com|access-date=2020-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anti-lock brakes and all-wheel drive became introduced as option, with a driver-side airbag becoming standard in 1991 (a first in the segment).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The Caravan was again produced in a standard length and as a long-wheelbase Grand Caravan; the Caravan C/V cargo van also made its return.  To further differentiate the Caravan from the Plymouth Voyager, the two model lines received different wheel covers, with chrome trim on the Caravan restricted to the grille and Chrysler Pentastar hood ornament.

The interior underwent a substantial redesign, shedding its design influence from the K-cars, the Caravan received its own dashboard design.  On all but the base-trim Caravan, seven-passenger seating became standard.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  In addition to the two rear bench seats, the second generation introduced the option of middle-row bucket seats; in 1992, Chrysler introduced integrated [[child safety seats]]&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; (a first in the segment).

For the 1994 model year, the Caravan underwent a mid-cycle revision as part of a body upgrade to meet 1998 federal safety standards.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/1994.html|title=1994 minivans: Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager, Chrysler Town &amp; Country|website=www.allpar.com|access-date=2020-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The interior underwent a redesign with new seats and door panels; coinciding with the addition of a passenger-side airbag, the dashboard was redesigned.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;   Following its declining popularity, the woodgrain trim option was discontinued in favor of monochromatic and two-tone exterior designs.

To commemorate the tenth year of production, Dodge offered the "10th Anniversary Edition" option package for 1994.  Available on SE/LE trims of the Caravan and Grand Caravan, the 10th Anniversary Edition was an appearance package, combining a two-tone exterior (a light-gray lower body with selected upper body colors) with a gold front fender badge.

*''Base'' - Included: cloth-and-vinyl upholstery, intermediate bench seat, tinted manual windows, power mirrors, intermittent windshield wipers and rear wiper, glove box, and an AM/FM stereo.
*''SE'' - Added: power liftgate release, reclining front seats and rear bench.

===Engines===
With the exception of the discontinued 150&amp;nbsp;hp  2.5L turbocharged inline-four, the second-generation Caravan carried over its powertrain line from the 1990 Dodge Caravan. Shifting its powertrain commonality from the Dodge Aries to that of the larger Dodge Dynasty, a 2.5-liter inline-four was the standard engine, with a 3.0&amp;nbsp;L V6 and 3.3&amp;nbsp;L V6 as options. In 1994, the Caravan received a 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 (shared with the Chrysler Imperial/Fifth Avenue) as an option.

[[File:Dodge-Caravan.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|1996 Dodge Caravan (no driver-side sliding door)]]
The third-generation Chrysler minivans were available in long- and short– wheelbase models; three- and four-door configurations; and eight different powertrains, including electric and compressed natural gas; on a single, flexible platform.

In development for nearly 5 years from early 1990 (full development from 1991) to December 26, 1994 (final design by Don Renkert was approved on September 23, 1991 and frozen in May 1992),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hyde |first=Charles K. |title=Riding the Roller Coaster: A History of the Chrysler Corporation |year=2003 |publisher=Wayne State University Press |isbn=9780814330913 |page=300 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aQhTq18vi7AC&amp;pg=PA300&amp;lpg=PA300&amp;dq=chrysler+ns+may+1992+november+prototype |accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1996 model was introduced at the 1995 [[North American International Auto Show]] using the [[Chrysler S platform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.org/NLD_docs/DHUM0006.pdf |title=Civil Action File No. 0110133833 |format=PDF |accessdate=May 11, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016062810/http://www.justice.org/NLD_docs/DHUM0006.pdf |archivedate=October 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It included a number of innovations, including a driver's side sliding door (optional initially, to become standard equipment later), a first for Chrysler and a non-compact minivan for the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=DeMuro |first=Doug |title=Why Did It Take Minivans a Decade to Get Dual Sliding Doors? |url= https://www.autotrader.com/car-news/why-did-it-take-minivans-decade-get-dual-sliding-doors-258736 |website=autotrader.com |date=November 2016 |accessdate=28 November 2019}} Note: the [[Honda Odyssey (North America)|Honda Odyssey]] had introduced the first four-door non-[[Compact MPV|compact minivan]] for the United States &amp; Canada in 1994, but the first-generation Odyssey had conventional hinged rear doors.&lt;/ref&gt; With Generation III, Chrysler introduced a seat management system marketed as [[Dodge Caravan#Seating innovation|''Easy Out Roller Seats'']]. A conventional door handle and lock was added to the rear hatch, eliminating the confusing pop-and-lift maneuver which had been required on earlier models.

Base models of the Caravan were offered in most states with either a 2.4 L four-cylinder or the 3.0 L [[6G72|Mitsubishi 6G72]] [[V6 engine]], except in several northeastern states, where the Mitsubishi did not meet emissions standards. In those areas, the 3.3 L engine was offered as the V6 option from 1997 through 2000.

The 1996 Caravan, along with the Plymouth Voyager and the Chrysler Town &amp; Country won the North American Car of the Year award. The Caravan itself won ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Car of the Year]] 1996 and appeared on the [[Car and Driver Ten Best]] for 1996 and 1997. 1999 also saw the addition of a one-year only 15th anniversary "Platinum Edition", to mark Caravan's 15th year of production. This package was offered on various trim levels, and included Platinum Metallic paint, and fender badges. The 2000 model year offered packages which included the "2000+" and "Millennium" package, however these were little more than unique fender badges on vans with popular equipment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

During the 1996 model year, running changes saw the elimination of the plastic intake manifold cover from the 3.8L engine and redesigned interior door panels. Changes for the 1997 model year were minor, adding traction control as an option or standard equipment, depending on trim level, along with the reintroduction of optional all-wheel drive. The Caravan received more minor updates in 1997 for the 1998 model year. These changes came in the form of new colors, new wheels for trims above SE, new interior fabric, optional heated seats and automatic headlights on higher trim levels. In calendar year 1998, the Caravan's HVAC vents on the driver's side and center of the dashboard were updated to have a more conventional design. Later that year, the 1999 Caravan received new front styling on all trims above SE, while the Sport and ES models received even sportier styling. The ES model was the first minivan to receive the "AutoStick" transmission and 17 inch wheels. A [[cargo net]] between the driver and front passenger seats was added. Color keyed door and lift-gate handles were standard across the whole range, in addition to a new keyless entry remote. Base and SE models had options for a spoiler as well as color keyed bumpers and trim (grey or color molded bumpers and trim were standard). The driver's side sliding door became standard. Chrysler had updates of the Plymouth Voyager in 1996 for the 1997 model year and the Chrysler Town &amp; Country in 1997 for the 1998 model year, prior to the 1998–2007 [[DaimlerChrysler]] era; it was the only exterior update of the NS Dodge Caravan.

===Trim levels===
*''Base'' - Included: Cloth upholstery, speed-sensitive wipers, manual locks, 14" steel rims with "Successor" hubcaps, and an AM/FM stereo with four speakers. Package 22T added air conditioning, and cargo net.

==={{Visible anchor|Dodge Caravan EPIC}}===
{{main|Dodge EPIC}}
In 1999, Dodge introduced the Caravan EPIC, a fully electric minivan. The EPIC was powered by 28 12-volt NiMH batteries and was capable of traveling up to {{convert|80|mi|km}} on a single charge. The EPIC was sold as a fleet-only lease vehicle. Production of the EPIC was discontinued in 2001. Only a few hundred of these vehicles were produced and sold. After the leases expired they were returned and crushed. Approximately 10 vans remain in private hands today.

===Crash test results===
The 1996–2000 Dodge Grand Caravan received a "Marginal" rating in the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]'s 40&amp;nbsp;mph offset test. The structural performance and restraints were graded "Acceptable", but the foot injuries were very high.

In the NHTSA crash tests, it received 4 stars for the driver and front passenger in the frontal-impact. In the side-impact test, it received 5 stars for the driver, and 3 stars for the rear occupant, and resulted in a fuel leak that could cause a fire hazard.

===Concepts===
Other plans for this generation included three minivan concepts to be made in the Windsor Assembly, the Dodge Caravan R/T, Voyager XG, and the [[Chrysler Pacifica (1999 concept vehicle)|Chrysler Pacifica 1999 concept]]. The Caravan R/T (originally ESS) was to include the most powerful engine ever for a minivan, rated at {{convert|325|hp|kW}}. It had large air intakes and driving lights in the front bumper, a brushed aluminum instrument panel, racing-style pedals, and black and white rubber flooring. The Voyager XG was more rugged, featured a diesel engine and manual transmission, and included many outdoor amenities, such as a built-in ice pack. The Chrysler Pacifica, based on the Town &amp; Country, was more luxurious, had power leather seats and footrests, overhead bins and lighting, an [[Chrysler LHS|LHS]] grille, and roof-long skylights. The Pacifica actually did come to be in 2004, based on the fifth generation Caravan, except that it became a [[crossover SUV]] rather than a minivan; the nameplate was eventually applied to a minivan in 2016.

[[File:Dodge Grand Caravans - 1..2...3...4... (4691700194) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|2002-2004 Dodge Grand Caravan Sport]]

Unveiled at the 2000 [[North American International Auto Show]] (NAIAS) on Monday, January 10, 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DdJIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PoIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3634,6863785&amp;dq=2001+dodge+caravan&amp;hl=en |title=DaimlerChrysler Debuts minivans |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the redesigned 2001 Dodge Caravan and 2001 Chrysler Town &amp; Country were released for sale in August 2000. The release was part of a promotional tie-in with [[Nabisco]], which unveiled their new "[[Oreo|Mini Oreos]]" inside the van during the unveiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-28159731_ITM |title=Article: New Mini Oreos Debut in New Mini Van |publisher=AccessMyLibrary |date=August 10, 2000 |accessdate=September 26, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530062823/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-28159731_ITM |archivedate=May 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first vans rolled off the line at the [[Windsor Assembly]] Plant on July 24. The fourth generation vans were available in the trim levels; ''SE'', ''Sport'', ''SXT'', ''AWD Sports'', "base" model, ''AWD Choice'', ''eL'', ''C/V'', ''ES'', ''EX'', ''AWD Wagon'', and ''SXT All-Wheel-Drive''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-28075550_ITM |title=Article: The First, All-New 2001 Chrysler Town and Country and 2001 Dodge Caravan...|publisher=AccessMyLibrary |date=July 19, 2000 |accessdate=September 26, 2009}}{{Dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In development from February 1996 to December 1999, the Generation IV minivans were based on the [[Chrysler S platform|Chrysler RS platform]] and featured a larger body frame with modified headlights and taillights. Design work was done by Brandon Faurote from January 1997 and reached production approval in 1998.

In addition to other detailed changes, power sliding doors and a power hatch became available as options. The [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]] 3.0 L V6, which no longer met emissions standards in California and the northeastern U.S., was discontinued, and a more powerful 3.8L engine, based on the 3.3L, became available. All Wheel Drive continued to be offered on high end models. Other innovative available features included remote operated sliding doors and rear hatch, which could be opened and closed at the push of a button, either inside the vehicle, or with the keyless entry fob.

In the 2002 model year, [[DaimlerChrysler]] stopped using the "DODGE" badges on the front doors, like with all Dodge vehicles.

In 2003, the Caravan C/V and Grand Caravan C/V returned after having been discontinued in 1995. The C/V featured the option of deleted side windows (replaced by composite panels), optional rear seats, a cargo floor made of plastic material similar to pickup truck bedliners, rubber flooring in lieu of carpeting and normal hatch at the rear. Minor changes were made to the Grand Caravan ES including many of the features included in Option Group 29S becoming standard, the 17 inch Titan Chrome wheels no longer being an option replaced with standard 16 inch chrome wheels, and the disappearance of the AutoStick Transmission option. This year also saw the appearance of an optional factory-installed rear seat DVD system with single disc player mounted below the HVAC controls.

2004 offered an exclusive one year only "Anniversary Edition" package to mark Caravan's 20th year in production. This package was offered on higher level SXT models, and included chrome wheels, body color moldings, special interior accents and a unique fender badge.

2005 changes to the Caravan included a revised grille, new foglight fascia, and a system of in-floor folding second and third row seats, marketed as [[Dodge Caravan#Stow 'N Go seating|''Stow 'n Go seating'']].

Production of this generation continued in China from 2008, when the Taiwanese [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] production line was relocated there, until late 2010 when the fifth generation Chrysler Voyager was introduced to the Chinese market. The Caravan was subsequently replaced by the [[Dodge Journey|Journey]], although a page for the Caravan still exists on the Dodge China site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dodge.cn/caravan/index.html |title=Home page |publisher=Chrysler China |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese Caravan was produced alongside the Town &amp; Country, now using the Grand Voyager nameplate, by [[Soueast]], and did not share any aesthetic components with the North American Caravan aside from the wheels. Instead, the Chinese Caravan was identical to the Taiwanese Town &amp; Country, aside from the lack of chrome trim on the exterior door panels, and used a modified version of the Town &amp; Country front bumper with a Dodge grille. Chinese vans were equipped with [[Mitsubishi 6G7x engine|Mitsubishi 6G72]] engines, and came in three trim levels: Classic, SXT, and Luxury.

===Trim levels===
*''SE'' - Included: Cloth upholstery, grocery bag hooks, manual air conditioning, tinted windows, manual locks, an AM/FM stereo with cassette player and four speakers (later, a single-CD player replaced the tape deck), and 15" steel rims with "Kinetic" hubcaps. Later standard features were sliding door alert (hazards flash when opening), and 15" steel rims with "Interface" hubcaps.
*''SE Plus (Grand Caravan only)'' - Added: power mirrors, sound insulation, keyless entry, illuminated entry, power front windows and rear vents, 
*''Sport'' - Added: overhead console, rear defroster, sunscreen glass, speed control, power locks, floor mats, tachometer, power heated mirrors, an AM/FM stereo with cassette player and 6 speakers, power windows and 15" "crossfire" hubcaps. Package 25H added dual-zone air conditioning, glove box and ashtray lights, headlamp off delay. Package 25K added an AM/FM stereo with single-CD and cassette players and 6 speakers, power sliding doors and power driver's seat. Later replaced by SXT package.
*''SXT'' - Added (from SE Plus): Three zone air conditioning, power driver's seat, fog lamps, power sliding doors, HomeLink garage door opener, an AM/FM stereo with single-CD/cassette players and 6 speakers, tachometer, and 16" "Ingot" alloy rims.
*''ES'' - Added: three zone air conditioning, trip computer, fog lamps, driver's side power sliding door, garage door opener, an AM/FM stereo with cassette player, in dash 4-disc CD changer, and Infinity sound system, and 16" "europa" alloy rims.

===Engines===
* 2001–2007 2.4 L ''[[Chrysler Neon engine#2.4 and 2.4 Turbo|EDZ]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]], {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}} at 5400 rpm and {{convert|165|lbft|N.m|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm
* 2001–2007 3.3 L ''[[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.3|EGA]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]], {{convert|180|hp|kW|abbr=on}} at 5000 rpm and {{convert|210|lbft|N.m|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm
* 2001–2007 3.8 L ''[[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.8|EGH]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]], {{convert|200|hp|kW|abbr=on}} at 5000 rpm and {{convert|245|lbft|N.m|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm
* 2009–present 3.0 L ''[[Chrysler 3.0 engine#3.0|EG1]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]], {{convert|168|hp|kW|abbr=on}} (China)
In Canada, the 3.3 L V6 was standard on all models.

===IIHS results===
The 2001 model of this version earned a "Poor" rating in the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]'s 40&amp;nbsp;mph offset test. It did protect its occupants reasonably well, and the dummy movement was well controlled, however, a fuel leak occurred. Chrysler corrected this problem starting with the 2002 models, moving it up to an "Acceptable" rating.

The 2006 model year brought optional side curtain airbags and a stronger B-pillar, which was tested by the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]'s side impact crash test. With the side airbags, it got an "Acceptable" rating. For the driver, there is a chance of serious neck injuries, rib fractures and/or internal organ injuries. The rear passengers, however, could leave this accident unharmed, as there is a low risk of significant injury in a crash of this severity for them.

The fifth generation van had debuted at the 2007 [[North American International Auto Show]] with exterior styling by [[Ralph Gilles]]. Beginning with Generation V in model year 2008, Chrysler only made the long wheelbase Grand Caravan. With discontinuation of the short-wheelbase Caravan, Dodge offered the [[Dodge Journey|Journey]] on nearly an identical wheelbase and as a [[crossover (automobile)|crossover]] rather than a [[minivan]]. Although the SWB model, which had accounted for half of all sales in Canada,&lt;ref name="CAdriver"&gt;{{cite web|title=Test Drive: 2008 Dodge Grand Caravan Canada "Value Package" |publisher=Autos Canada |first=Jil |last=McIntosh |date=February 25, 2008 |url= http://www.autos.ca/car-test-drives/test-drive-2008-dodge-grand-caravan-canada-value-package/ |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; cost approximately $2,000 less and offered a four-cylinder engine option with improved fuel economy, Chrysler executives stated the SWB Caravan was discontinued to accommodate new features offered in the Grand Caravan, consistent with the demands of the majority of the minivan market.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news|title = Minivan sales slow, hit by gas prices and image |work=USA Today |first=Dee-Ann |last=Durbin |url= https://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2008-06-06-2536673535_x.htm |date=June 6, 2008 |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new six-speed [[automatic transmission]] became standard with the 3.8 L [[V6 engine|V6]] and the new 4.0 L V6. The four-speed [[automatic transmission]] is standard with the 3.3 L Flex-Fuel V6. This generation of Grand Caravan and its Town &amp; Country counterpart were not available with an all-wheel-drive system. The previously unavailable [[Electronic Stability Control]] was made standard on this generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/esc/esc.aspx |title=Iihs-Hldi |publisher=Iihs.org |accessdate=April 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407160743/http://www.iihs.org/ratings/esc/esc.aspx |archivedate=April 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrysler introduced a seat management system marketed as [[Dodge Caravan#Swivel 'n Go seating|''Swivel'n Go'']] seating, the MyGIG entertainment system (a stereo with built in hard drive for recording, storing, and playing music), second and third row video screens, powered second row windows, standard side curtain airbags, and dashboard-mounted transmission controls. The gear shift lever moved to the instrument panel, the location used by competitors.

The market shifted briefly away from minivans and SUVs with the gasoline price spikes of the earlier part of 2008. This trend began to reverse itself towards the fall of 2008.&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt; In 2009 and 2010 the Dodge Grand Caravan continued to be the top selling minivan in Canada, with over 60% of the market's monthly sales.

''Automotive News'' reported that, from January to October in 2010, Dodge sold about a third of its 2010 Grand Caravans to rental fleets. The relatively high rental fleet sales depressed used vehicles' resale value: as the number of returned ex-rental 2010 Grand Caravan to the market jumped fourfold between July to October, prices of used 2009 and 2010 Dodge minivans dropped by as much as 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20101115/RETAIL04/311159986/1251 |title=High fleet sales rates take toll |newspaper=Automotive News |date=November 15, 2010 |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the 3.8 L and 4.0 L engines were paired with Chrysler's 62TE 6-speed automatic transmission with variable line pressure (VLP) technology (See [[Ultradrive#62TE]]).

In Canada (2008–2010) the 3.3 L was the standard engine across the range, combined with the 4-speed 41TE automatic transmission. The 4.0 L engine and six-speed combination was available as an option on only the top of the range SXT models. In 2011 the six-speed transmission was specified as standard on the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country|Town &amp; Country]].

===Safety===
In the U.S. the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]'s (NHTSA) New Car Assessment Program crash testing, the 2010 Dodge Grand Caravan achieved a five star (top safety) rating in several categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.safercar.gov/portal/site/safercar/ |title=2010 Chrysler minivan US NCAP safety ratings |work=NHTSA www.Safercar.gov |accessdate=June 23, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100522231124/http://www.safercar.gov/portal/site/safercar/ |archivedate=May 22, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 model year===
For 2009, standard Stow 'n Go seats were added that folded flat into the rear area floor to create more cargo room, while the Swivel 'n Go seats turned 180 degrees to face the third row. The available SXT trim now included new technology options. New for 2009 was an optional "sport" suspension system as well as a blind spot warning system and "Cross Path Detection" with sensors to warn of cars or other obstacles when backing out of a parking space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jackson |first1=Bill |title=2009 Dodge Grand Caravan Specs, Price, MPG, &amp; Reviews |url= https://www.cars.com/research/dodge-grand_caravan-2009/ |website=cars.com |accessdate=12 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 model year===
The Chrysler minivans became the only domestic brand minivans as GM and Ford replaced their slow-selling models with three-row crossover SUVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2010 Dodge Grand Caravan Pricing, Reviews &amp; Ratings |url= https://www.kbb.com/dodge/grand-caravan-passenger/2010/ |publisher=Kelly Blue Book |accessdate=12 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes for the 2010 Dodge Grand Caravans included new active head restraints for the driver and front passenger on all models, three-zone manual climate controls for the Grand Caravan SE, and a new 3.16 final drive ratio for models equipped with the 4.0-liter engine.

===2011 model year===
[[File:2011 Dodge Grand Caravan -- 06-24-2011.jpg|thumb|Post-facelift 2011 Dodge Grand Caravan]]

The Grand Caravan underwent a mid-cycle refresh for the 2011 model year, which included major changes in both styling and functionality. The suspension was heavily re-tuned, with both Dodge and Chrysler minivans gaining a larger front sway bar and new rear sway bar, increased rear roll center height, adjusted spring rates, a new steering gear, a revised front static camber setting, and lowered ride height. This improved handling.

All three of the former engine choices were replaced by the new [[Chrysler Pentastar engine|Pentastar]] 3.6-liter V6 with six-speed automatic transmission, now the sole powertrain choice for all models. Interior trim was restyled on both vans, in addition to major exterior revisions highlighted by the new "double-crosshair" grille on the Grand Caravan.

Other changes included extra sound insulation, acoustic glass, new seats, softer-touch surfaces, new [[LED]] ambient lighting and center console, and halogen projector headlamps with LED accents. The Chrysler models were adjusted so that instead of competing against equivalent Dodge trim levels, they were above Dodge in trim and features.&lt;ref name="allpar-2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/m/11-minivans.html|title=2011 Chrysler Town &amp; Country and 2011 Dodge Caravan Minivans|publisher=Allpar|accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 model year===
For 2012, a new, basic style trim called "AVP" was introduced, while some features previously unavailable for "SE" (like touch navigation panel) become available as options (The "SE" now also received a floor console, similar to the one available for "SXT"). The same year, the front logo design was changed gaining the two slanted rectangles in red to match the rest of the Dodge lineup. For 2013, the American Value Package "AVP" trim [[List price|manufacturer's suggested retail price]] (MSRP) was reduced by $1,000 from the year before.

===2013 model year===
The grand Caravan added a class-exclusive feature with optional Blu-Ray DVD player while the base "AVP" model was described by [[Autotrader.com]] editors as having a "shockingly low MSRP" giving buyers "incredible utility" in their vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2013 Dodge Grand Caravan Reviews and Model Information |url= https://www.autotrader.com/dodge/grand-caravan/2013 |publisher=Auto Trader |accessdate=12 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 model year===
[[File:'14 Dodge Grand Caravan (MIAS '14).jpg|thumb|2014 Dodge Grand Caravan 30th Anniversary Edition on display at the [[Montreal Auto Show]], 22 January 2014]]

For the 2014 model year, three new packages are introduced: American Value Package (US; Canada Value Package in Canada), Blacktop package (US only) and the 30th Anniversary Edition. They are all different sets of the SE and SXT trims, and include new luxury features for basically the same price. The Grand Caravan AVP also gained easy-clean floor mats that came with the optional second-row Stow'n Go seats (standard on SE, SXT and R/T).

The "Blacktop package", based on SE and SXT, came equipped with 17-inch polished aluminum wheels with gloss black pockets, a gloss black grille, black headlamp bezels, an all-black interior including headliner, door panels and console, unique black cloth seats and door trim panels with silver accent stitching, a leather-wrapped steering wheel with silver accent stitching and a leather shift knob, choice of 6 body colors (Granite Crystal, Billet Silver, Brilliant Black, Maximum Steel, Redline Red, Bright White). SXT models also include fog lamps.

The "SE 30th Anniversary Edition", based on the SE trim, came equipped with 17-inch satin carbon aluminum wheels, body-color heated exterior mirrors, 30th Anniversary badging on the front fenders, silver accent stitching and piano black accents throughout, black cloth seats, a black leather-wrapped steering wheel, black leather-wrapped shift knob, black headliner and overhead console, bright heating and air conditioning trim bezels, power second- and third-row windows, and 30th Anniversary logo on the key fob

The "SXT 30th Anniversary Edition", based on the SXT trim, was packaged with 17-inch polished aluminum wheels with satin carbon pockets, bright chrome roof rack, bright window trim moldings, fog lamps, automatic headlamps and special 30th Anniversary badging, Black Torino leatherette seats with premium suede inserts and silver accent stitching, power 10-way driver's seat, piano black accent trim bezels, and bright chrome accents throughout.

Both 30th Anniversary Editions included an available special body color, Granite Crystal Pearl Coat, a customized gauge cluster with 30th Anniversary badging, as well as the UConnect Handsfree Group ([[SiriusXM]] Satellite Radio with a one-year subscription, [[Bluetooth]] streaming audio and voice command and an auto-dimming rear view mirror). The vehicles arrived at dealerships at Q3 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://media.chrysler.com/newsrelease.do?id=14744&amp;mid=5 |title=2014 Dodge Grand Caravan Celebrates Its 30th Birthday With Even More Desirable Content and Value |publisher=Chrysler LLC |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/113090462367/dodge-grand-caravan-and-chrysler-town--country-receive |title=Dodge Grand Caravan and Chrysler Town &amp; Country receive 30th Anniversary Editions |publisher=Worldcarfans.com |date=September 3, 2013 |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.caranddriver.com/chrysler-group-celebrates-30-years-of-minivans-with-30th-anniversary-edition-grand-caravan-and-town-country/ |first=Ron |last=Sessions |title=Chrysler Group Celebrates 30 Years of Minivans with 30th Anniversary Edition Grand Caravan and Town &amp; Country |publisher=Blog.caranddriver.com |date=September 1, 2013 |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also new for the 2014 model year, the Grand Caravan R/T gained standard auto headlamps with black bezels and the Security Group featuring remote start and security alarm.

===2015 model year===
The Grand Caravan was not changed for the 2015 model year except for content features added to SE Plus and SXT Plus trims. The SE Plus package included black leather upholstery, power windows for the second row seats, and Chrysler's Uconnect voice command with Bluetooth sound system.

===2016 model year===
The new Chrysler Pacifica was unveiled on January 11, 2016, and getting all the attention, but the Dodge Grand Caravan continued to be marketed as a budget minivan alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2016 Dodge Grand Caravan: New Car Review |url= https://www.autotrader.com/car-reviews/2016-dodge-grand-caravan-new-car-review-254280 |website=autotrader.com |accessdate=12 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017 model year===
A small 2017 model year update yields SE, SE Plus, SXT, and GT models. The 6.5-inch Touchscreen (Radio 430 and 430 NAV) became standard equipment. (Navigation is standard on GT and optional on SXT.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dodge.com/2017/grand-caravan/technology/index.html |title=2017 Dodge Grand Caravan Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FCA unveiled the [[Chrysler Pacifica (RU)|Chrysler Pacifica]], a new crossover minivan for the 2017 model year, at the 2016 [[North American International Auto Show]]. The Pacifica replaced the Chrysler Town &amp; Country, but it was originally stated that the 2016 model of the Dodge Caravan would be produced for one more model year as a lower-cost alternative to the Pacifica, before being discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url =http://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/chrysler/2015/12/05/2017-chrysler-minivan-coming-dodge-not-leaving-yet/76745544/ |title=2017 Chrysler minivan coming; Dodge not leaving yet |last=Priddle |first=Alisa |newspaper=Detroit Free Press |date=December 5, 2015 |accessdate=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2017 Chrysler Pacifica: All-new ‘modern family’ minivan|url= http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/detroit-auto-show/2016/01/11/chrysler-pacifica-new-minivan-todays-modern-family/78613046/ |date=11 January 2016 |newspaper=The Detroit News |first=Michael |last=Wayland |accessdate=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dodge plans to produce '17 minivan |first=Larry P. |last=Vellequette |work=Automotive News |date=June 22, 2015 |url= http://www.autonews.com/article/20150622/OEM04/306229983/dodge-plans-to-produce-17-minivan |accessdate=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autonews-notdiscontinuedyet"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.autonews.com/article/20170116/OEM03/301169998/as-pacifica-ramps-up-grand-caravan-lives-on |title=As Pacifica ramps up, Grand Caravan lives on |work=Automotive News |first=Larry P. |last=Vellequette |date=January 16, 2017 |accessdate=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, FCA CEO [[Sergio Marchionne]] stated that it was not clear if the Caravan would be discontinued, and that they would have to look into offering "some level of affordable access to the Pacifica at the lower end to try and replace the outgoing models" (this would eventually come in the form of the [[Chrysler Voyager#Sixth generation (2020–present)|sixth-generation Voyager]], although it is being produced alongside the Caravan). Despite the introduction of the higher-cost Pacifica model, sales of the Caravan increased by 26% in 2016.&lt;ref name="autonews-notdiscontinuedyet"/&gt; A substantial number of Caravans are sold to low-margin rental fleets.&lt;ref name=Guilford22oct18&gt;{{cite web |last=Guilford |first=Dave |title=In with the new (but keep the old) |url= https://www.autonews.com/article/20181022/OEM01/181029964/in-with-the-new-but-keep-the-old |date=22 October 2018 |accessdate=24 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle continues to be positioned for price-conscious customers and it draws traffic to dealerships when the vehicle is aggressively priced.&lt;ref name=Guilford22oct18/&gt; Additionally, FCA provided various rebates and incentives to assist purchases of the Grand Caravan and other models by customers with [[credit score]]s of less than 620.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sales flatten; Nissan’s big rental bet |url= https://www.kbb.com/car-news/this-week-in-car-buying-sales-flatten-nissans-big-rental-bet/2100004250/ |website=Kelley Blue Book |accessdate=14 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report by an automotive journalist, this strategy helps the Chrysler Pacifica hold its value better while also having a more affordable minivan available.&lt;ref name="Hughes-2017"/&gt; Over 60% of the Dodge Caravan's sales goes to fleet sales and the vehicle was the second best selling vehicle for rental fleet sales.&lt;ref name="Hughes-2017"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hughes |first=Justin |title=Dodge Grand Caravan Continues Through 2019, But Delayed for U.S. |url= https://www.thedrive.com/sheetmetal/11815/utils/Message |website=The Drive |date=23 June 2017 |accessdate=11 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Colias |first=Mike |title=Nissan Makes Unconventional Bet on Rental-Car Market to Boost U.S. Sales |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/nissan-makes-unconventional-bet-on-rental-car-market-to-boost-u-s-sales-1514376000 |accessdate=14 November 2019 |work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard on all 2018 models are advanced multistage driver and front-passenger airbags that include low-risk deployment, a driver's-side inflatable knee blocker, front seat-mounted side airbags, and side-curtains for outboard passengers in all three rows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2018 Dodge /// Durango /// Journey /// Grand Caravan |url= https://www.dodge.com/content/dam/fca-brands/na/dodge/en_us/global/pdf/brochure/18MY-Dodge-People-Mover-eBrochure-FINAL.pdf |website=dodge.com |accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2018, the Grand Caravan was Dodge's best-selling vehicle while the sales of foreign-branded minivans fared worse than the Dodge in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Willems |first=Steph |title=As Plant Preps for Downtime, America’s Grand Caravan Love Appears Unshakeable |url= https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2018/12/as-plant-preps-for-downtime-americas-grand-caravan-love-appears-unshakeable/ |publisher=The Truth About Cars |date=13 December 2018 |accessdate=24 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2019 model year===
The 2019 model year marked the 35th anniversary of the Chrysler minivans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Minivans Celebrate 35th Anniversary with Special Edition Models |url= https://www.fcagroup.com/en-US/media_center/insights/Pages/minivans_special_edition.aspx |website=FCA Group |date=11 February 2019 |accessdate=24 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; A commemorative trim option was available on the SE and SXT models that included a bright grille, 17-inch "tech silver" aluminum wheels, a 35th Anniversary fender badge as well as "piano black" console and instrument panel accents and front floor mats with 35th Anniversary embroidered logo.&lt;ref name="2019FactSheet"&gt;{{cite web |title=2019 Dodge Grand Caravan Fact Sheet |url= https://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=20108&amp;mid= |publisher=Fiat Chrysler Automobiles US |date=1 September 2018 |accessdate=24 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "Blacktop Package" featuring a black grille, headlamp bezels as well as an all-black interior was optional on SE and SXT 35th anniversary edition models.&lt;ref name="2019FactSheet"/&gt;

The minivan market segment decreased in general. Sales of the Grand Caravan models in Canada declined by 9% during the first quarter of 2019, but it was still number 10 among the best-selling vehicles for that period in Canada.&lt;ref name="Driving11apr19"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://driving.ca/toyota/corolla/features/feature-story/canadas-10-best-selling-vehicles-in-2019s-first-quarter |title=Canada's 10 best-selling vehicles in the first quarter of 2019 |publisher=Driving Canada |first=Timothy |last=Cain |date=11 April 2019 |accessdate=11 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most sales went to the rental and on fleet customers.&lt;ref name="Driving11apr19"/&gt; The vehicle has not received major changes, but continues to be produced because "Dodge sold more than 125,000 Grand Caravans last year [2018], while Honda only sold 100,000 of its Odyssey minivans during the same year [2018]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2019 Dodge Grand Caravan Review |url= https://www.autotrader.com/car-reviews/2019-dodge-grand-caravan-review-281474979935181 |website=autotrader.com |accessdate=12 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third shift at Windsor minivan plant ended in October 2019 due to sluggish sales, eliminating 1,500 direct jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Irwin |first=John |title=FCA extends Windsor minivan plant's third shift by 3 weeks for fleet order |url=https://canada.autonews.com/automakers/fca-extends-windsor-minivan-plants-third-shift-3-weeks-fleet-order |website=Automotive News Canada |accessdate=11 July 2019 |date=26 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2020 model year===
Three models are available: SE, SE Plus, and SXT. The Grand Caravan SE Plus model now includes standard second-row Super Stow 'n Go bucket seats, power eight-way driver seat, and an all-black interior with cranberry wine accent stitching on the seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2020 Dodge Grand Caravan Fact Sheet |url= https://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=21106&amp;fIId=20878&amp;mid=257 |publisher=Fiat Chrysler Automobiles US |date=1 September 2019|accessdate=24 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The optional "Blacktop Package" continues for the SE Plus and SXT models.

The Canadian market includes six models starting from an entry-level version and then increasing the standard equipment on each: CVP, SXT, SXT Premium Plus, Crew, Crew Plus, and the GT that includes many convenience features as well as a performance suspension system and a monochromatic exterior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FCA Canada: 2020 Dodge Grand Caravan Fact Sheet |url=https://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=21163&amp;mid= |publisher=FCA Canada |date=1 September 2019 |accessdate=24 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Blacktop Package" trim option is available on SXT models. 

In May 2020, the Grand Caravan will end production, with the [[Chrysler Voyager]] filling its place as FCA's budget minivan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dodge Grand Caravan Production Coming to an End|publisher=Car and Driver|first=Colin|last=Beresford|date=February 28, 2020|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a31156055/dodge-grand-caravan-end-production/|accessdate=February 28, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
{{Main|Chrysler Voyager|l1 = Chrysler/Lancia Voyager}}
[[File:2017-09-01 (244) Bahnhof Ybbs an der Donau.jpg|thumb|Lancia Voyager (Austria)]]
As with preceding generations, Chrysler marketed the Caravan in Europe as the Chrysler Voyager, with the fifth-generation becoming exclusively sold as the long-wheelbase Grand Voyager. From 2007 to June 2011, the model line was sold under the Chrysler brand; following the acquisition of Chrysler by Fiat, the Voyager was rebranded as a Lancia in continental Europe (with the Chrysler Voyager remaining in Ireland and the UK).

The Chrysler/Lancia Voyager was marketed under three trim lines distinct to Europe (Silver, Gold and Platinum). The standard engine was a 2.8L I4 diesel (producing 161&amp;nbsp;hp), with a 3.6L gasoline V6 (producing 279&amp;nbsp;hp);&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://carscoop.blogspot.com/2011/02/new-lancia-grand-voyager-minivan-is.html|title=New Lancia Grand Voyager Minivan is a Rebadged Chrysler, and Yes, this Picture Too Appears to be a Chop|date=February 14, 2011|publisher=Carscoop|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318152943/http://carscoop.blogspot.com/2011/02/new-lancia-grand-voyager-minivan-is.html|archive-date=March 18, 2012|accessdate=May 11, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; both engines were paired to a 6-speed automatic.

Following the 2016 model year, exports of the Voyager were discontinued as Fiat Chrysler reorganized its brands, with Chrysler remaining largely in North America and Lancia sold exclusively in Italy.

===Ram Cargo Van (Ram C/V Tradesman)===
[[File:2012 Ram Cargo Van CV rear.jpg|thumb|2012 Ram Cargo Van]]

For the 2012 model year, the [[Ram Trucks]] division received the Dodge Grand Caravan C/V cargo van, renaming it the Ram Cargo (C/V) Tradesman (reviving the name used by Dodge for its full-size cargo vans during the 1970s). In contrast to its predecessor, the Tradesman was strictly a two-seat vehicle, with solid metal body paneling in place of rear windows and a flat rear load floor.

As the Ram brand increased its use of Fiat-based vehicles, the Tradesman was replaced for 2016 by the ProMaster City,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ramtrucks.com/en/ram_cv/|title=Ram C/V Tradesman Official Site|publisher=Ram Trucks}}&lt;/ref&gt; an American-market version of the [[Fiat Doblò]].

=== Volkswagen Routan ===
{{main|Volkswagen Routan}}
[[File:Volkswagen Routan.jpg|thumb|Volkswagen Routan SE]]After a five-year hiatus, Volkswagen re-entered the minivan segment in North America by introducing the [[Volkswagen Routan]] for the 2009 model year. Replacing the [[Volkswagen Transporter (T4)|Transporter T4]] (1992, 1999-2003 EuroVan) in North America, the Routan was sold in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Targeting approximately 5% of the sales within the minivan segment, Volkswagen entered into a 5-year production agreement with Chrysler.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.automotive.com/news/not-surprising-news-volkswagen-discontinuing-routan-minivan-sales-132653/|title=Not-Surprising News: Volkswagen Discontinuing Routan Minivan Sales|last=Brown|first=Jacob|date=March 29, 2013|work=Automotive.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203104254/http://www.automotive.com/news/not-surprising-news-volkswagen-discontinuing-routan-minivan-sales-132653/|archive-date=February 3, 2014|accessdate=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.automobilemag.com/news/report-volkswagen-routan-minivan-production-ends-191045/|title=Report: Volkswagen Routan Minivan Production Halted Temporarily|last=Holmes|first=Jake|date=December 12, 2012|work=Automobile magazine|accessdate=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Routan was manufactured by Chrysler at its Windsor Assembly facility alongside the Grand Caravan and Town &amp; Country, styled with its model-specific interior trim and front and rear exterior fascias. While sharing powertrains with the Grand Caravan, the Routan was given its own suspension tuning and seating configurations (the last Chrysler-designed minivans with lift-out seats).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120307033949/http://www.allpar.com/reviews/2011/routan.html|title=2011 Volkswagen Routan minivan car review|date=2012-03-07|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the 2011 update of the Chrysler minivans, the Grand Caravan received the stiffer suspension tuning previously used by Volkswagen;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; while receiving the 3.6L V6, the Routan carried over much of its interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/autos/reviews/healey/2011-03-17-2011-Volkswagen-Routan-Test-Drive-Healey.htm|title=Volkswagen's Routan has some smooth hustle|last=Healey|first=James|date=March 18, 2011|work=USAToday|accessdate=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falling far under sales expectations, the final Routans were produced by Chrysler in August 2012; all 2013 sales were from dealer inventory, with 2014 vehicles sold exclusively to fleets.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.autoblog.com/2013/09/25/volkswagen-routan-dead/|title=Volkswagen Routan dead one last time|website=Autoblog|access-date=2019-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.autotrader.com/car-news/2013-vw-routan-canceled-206373 |first=Doug |last=DeMuro |title=2013 VW Routan Canceled |website=Autotrader |date=April 2013 |access-date=24 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally predicting to sell 50,000 units per year, Volkswagen sold 57,683 Routans through its four years of production.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As Volkswagen shifted to SUVs in North America, the Routan minivan was replaced for 2018 by the three-row [[Volkswagen Atlas|Atlas]] (also replacing the [[Volkswagen Touareg|Touareg]] in North America).

==Seating features==
The Caravan has incorporated numerous seating systems for their minivans to enhance interior flexibility.

===Integrated child safety seats===
In 1991, Dodge introduced a second row bench seat integrating two child booster seats on 1992 models. These seats continued as an available option through Generation V until they were discontinued in 2010.

===Easy-Out Roller Seats===
In 1995, Dodge introduced a system of seats to simplify installation, removal, and re-positioning, marketed as ''Easy-Out Roller Seats''. When installed, the seats are latched to floor-mounted strikers. When unlatched, eight rollers lift each seat, allowing it to be rolled fore and aft. Tracks have locator depressions for rollers, to simplify installation. Ergonomic levers at the seat backs release the floor latches single-handedly, without tools, and raise the seats onto the rollers in a single motion. Additionally, seat backs were designed to fold forward. Seat roller tracks are permanently attached to the floor and seat stanchions are aligned, facilitating the longitudinal rolling of the seats. Bench seat stanchions were moved inboard to reduce bending stress in the seat frames, allowing them to be lighter.

When configured as two and three person benches (available through Generation IV), the Easy Out Roller Seats could be unwieldy. Beginning in 2000, second and third row seats became available in a 'quad' configuration – bucket or captain chairs in the second row and a third row three-person 50/50 split "bench" – with each section weighing under {{convert|50|lb|abbr=on}}. The Easy-out system remained in use through Generation V – where certain models featured a two-person bench ''and'' the under-floor compartments from the ''Stow'n Go'' system.

All the [[badge engineering|rebadged nameplate variants]] of the Chrysler minivans use the Easy Out Roller Seats on their second row seating, where not the Stow and Go system.

===Stow 'N Go seating===
In 2004, Dodge introduced a system of second- and third-row seating that folded completely into under-floor compartments. It was marketed as ''Stow 'N Go'' and was available exclusively on long-wheelbase models.

In a development program costing $400 million,&lt;ref name="ameinfo"&gt;{{cite web|title= Chrysler extends leadership in Mideast minivan segment with 'Stow 'n Go' |publisher =Ameinfo.com |url= http://www.ameinfo.com/53687.html |date=February 12, 2005 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130325175844/http://www.ameinfo.com/53687.html |archivedate=March 25, 2013 |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; engineers initially used an [[Erector Set]] to visualize the complex interaction of the design&lt;ref name="pressrel1"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Chrysler Group Brings Minivan Segment's Only Stow 'n Go Seating And Storage System to Market in Just 18 Months |publisher=PRnewswire – Chrysler Group |url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chrysler-group-brings-minivan-segments-only-stow-n-go-seating-and-storage-system-to-market-in-just-18-months-58686772.html |date=January 5, 2004 |accessdate=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and redesigned under-floor components. The system included the spare tire well, fuel tank, exhaust system, parking brake cables, rear climate control lines, and rear suspension&lt;ref name="pressrel1"/&gt; but precluded [[Four-wheel drive|all-wheel drive]] (AWD).

The system, in turn, creates a combined volume of {{convert|12|cuft|L}} of under-floor storage when second-row seats are deployed. With both rows folded, the vans have a flat-load floor and a maximum cargo volume of {{convert|160.7|cuft|L}}.&lt;ref name="ameinfo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="www.media.chrysler.com"&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://www.media.chrysler.com/newsrelease.do?&amp;id=129 |title=Stow 'N Go Seating and Storage System Solidifies Dodge Caravan as the Leader in Minivan Sales and Innovations |publisher=Chrysler Group |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stow 'n Go system received the Popular Science Magazine's "Best of What's New" for 2005 award,&lt;ref name="autointell"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stow 'n Go Minivan Technology Awarded Popular Science Magazine's "Best of What's New" for 2005 |publisher=Autointell.com |url= http://www.autointell.com/News-2004/November-2004/Nov-2004-3/Nov-17-04-p3.htm |date=November 10, 2004 |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was never offered on the [[Volkswagen Routan]], the [[badge engineering|rebadged nameplate variant]] of the Chrysler minivans.

For model year 2011 Chrysler revised the system, rebranding it as "Super Stow 'n Go". New pivoting head restraints with taller seatbacks and a revised folding mechanism (marketed as "single action") improved stowage ease – with the head restraints folding on themselves automatically and the entire seat automatically folding down to a position just over its floor recess.

===Swivel 'n Go seating===
Dodge introduced a seating system in 2007, marketed as ''Swivel 'n Go''. In the seating system, two full size second row [[Swivel seat|seats swivel]] to face the third row. A detachable table can be placed between the second and third row seats. The Swivel 'n Go seating system includes the third row seating from the Stow 'n Go system. The system is offered on the Dodge Grand Caravan and [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]], but not the [[Volkswagen Routan]], a [[badge engineering|rebadged nameplate variant]] of the Chrysler minivans.

These Swivel 'n Go Seats are manufactured by Intier Corp. a division of Magna. The tracks, risers and swivel mechanisms are assembled by Camslide, a division of Intier. The swivel mechanism was designed by and is produced by [[Toyo Seat]] USA Corp.

The system is noted for its high strength.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} The entire load of the seat in the event of a crash is transferred through the swivel mechanism, which is almost twice as strong as the minimum government requirement.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The swivel mechanism includes bumpers that stabilize the seat while in the lock position. When rotated the seat comes off these bumpers to allow easy rotation.

The seat is not meant to be left in an unlocked position or swiveled with the occupant in it, although this will not damage the swivel mechanism.

"Swivel 'n Go" was dropped after the 2010 model year and is no longer an option on 2011 and later Chrysler and Dodge vans. However, the seats can still be installed by modifying the van with a few basic tools and parts{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}. However, it is impossible to install the table.

==Production==
The long-wheelbase Dodge Grand Caravan with ''Stow 'n Go'' seats are built in [[Windsor, Ontario]], Canada at [[Windsor Assembly]] (WAP Plant 3) by members of [[Canadian Auto Workers]] Local 444. Both wheelbase models were also produced in [[Fenton, Missouri]] at [[Saint Louis Assembly]] by members of the [[United Auto Workers]] Local 110 until 31 October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/corporate/factories.html |title=Chrysler factories, offices, and testing grounds, 1925–2010 |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dodge Charger (L-body)''' was a [[subcompact car|subcompact]] 3-door [[hatchback]]/[[fastback]] built by [[Dodge]] from 1983 to 1987, and based on [[Chrysler]]'s [[front-wheel drive]] [[Chrysler L platform|L platform]]. A companion model, the '''Plymouth Turismo''', was also marketed.

==History==
For 1979, Chrysler brought out sporty versions of the [[Chrysler L platform|L-body]] [[Dodge Omni|Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon]] called [[Dodge Omni 024|the Dodge Omni 024 and the Plymouth Horizon TC3]]. The cars shared a {{convert|70|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 1.7&amp;nbsp;L [[Volkswagen]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]] as the only engine under the 024/TC3 name.

In 1981, the Charger nameplate returned as a performance package on the Omni 024. Called the Charger 2.2, it cost $399 extra and came with a hood scoop, quarter-window appliques, special gearing, rear [[spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]], and "Charger 2.2" tape graphics, as well as the new {{convert|84|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 2.2&amp;nbsp;L I4 engine that was designed and built by Chrysler. A total of 7,306 were built.

In 1982, the Dodge Charger returned for a second year as the performance option for the 024. Nothing was changed from 1981 except for a Pentastar emblem on its [[Hood (automobile)|hood]] and the addition of a resonator to the [[exhaust system|exhaust]], since the previous model had no muffler, utilizing the catalytic converter as the sole method of engine noise reduction. Production increased to 15,000.

In 1983, the Volkswagen engine went out of production, so a joint Chrysler/[[Peugeot]] 1.6&amp;nbsp;L engine was used instead. The Omni 024 was renamed the Charger. The '''Plymouth Turismo''' was introduced as a companion entry for 1983, with the TC3 designation now discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;1983 Car Buyer's Guide, Harris Publications Inc., page 90&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carroll Shelby]] developed a sporty version of the Charger later in the year, the Dodge Shelby Charger. 

The transformation continued in 1984, with quad [[headlight]]s now differentiating the Charger from its Omni origins, however the Shelby models continued to use the previous years front nose cap/bumper assembly. The Plymouth Turismo would share the same front end. Apart from the badging, both cars were identical.

For 1985, the Shelby (with its unique front end) and Charger names were shuffled to reflect the addition of a [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] engine. Two new colors were added for 1985 — Black and Garnet Red with silver stripes. Plymouth also got a version of the old Shelby Charger, reviving the [[Plymouth Duster|Duster]] name as the Plymouth Turismo Duster. However, Plymouth would never get a turbocharged version of the Shelby Charger. Two turbocharged Turismos, using the Shelby front end, were seen Chrysler headquarters with a [[Plymouth Barracuda|'Cuda]] Plymouth badge, but they were not put into production. The previous high-compression {{convert|107|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Shelby Charger engine was now an option on regular Dodge Chargers. For 1986, the mandated [[center high-mounted stop light]] was added, and the {{convert|96|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 2.2&amp;nbsp;L engine made its way down to the base models.

1987 was the last year for the Omni/Horizon-derived Charger and Turismo. A total of 2,011 Chargers with the hotter {{convert|174|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler K engine#2.2 Turbo II|Turbo II]] engine were now badged the [[#Shelby Charger Turbo|Shelby Charger Turbo]] (not "Dodge"). For 1987, they were replaced by the [[Dodge Shadow]]/Plymouth Sundance, and the Belvidere plant was retooled to build the [[Dodge Dynasty]], which succeeded the preceding [[Dodge 600|600]] at the time.  [[Carroll Shelby]] bought 1,000 of the last Chargers and equipped them with the [[Dodge Omni|Omni GLH's]] engine and suspension to be sold under this name. The Duster name was revived for a model in the [[Plymouth Sundance]] line midyear in 1992.

[[File:1987shelby.jpg|right|thumb|1987 Charger Shelby Edition]]
For 1983, [[Carroll Shelby]] modified the Dodge Charger, to be sold at Dodge dealers as the '''Dodge Shelby Charger'''. Rather than focusing on speed, Shelby modified the suspension and styling. The engine compression was raised for {{convert|107|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, and the [[manual transmission]] had revised ratios. Shorter springs, special wheels, and tires complemented stronger brakes and a quicker, 14:1, power steering rack. Outside, a new nose and racing stripes accented the performance image. received a free-flowing exhaust system, making for a more aggressive sound.&lt;ref name=bonh1&gt;{{citation | title = From the Private Collection of Carroll Shelby: 1982 Dodge Shelby Charger Prototype | url = https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/24810/lot/145/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180630122418/https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/24810/lot/145/ | archivedate = 2018-06-30 | publisher = Bonhams | issue = Lot 145 | type = Auction description | location = Greenwich, CT | date = 2018-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The body kits, among other parts, were often shipped to dealerships along with the car to be put on after delivery. The reasoning behind this varied, but was said to speed delivery and compensate for ground clearance issues that the cars faced on many car carriers. Production was 8,251 for that first year.

[[File:1982 Dodge Shelby Charger prototype rear, 2018 Greenwich Concours.jpg|thumb|Rear view of the 1982 Dodge Shelby Charger prototype, mostly indistinguishable from production cars]]
For 1984, the Shelby Charger could be ordered with an optional [[automatic transmission]]. There were 7,552 Shelby Chargers sold this model year. The high-output engine (now up to {{convert|110|hp|kW|abbr=on}}) was also available in baseline Chargers and Turismos. These vehicles came in "Charger 2.2" and "Turismo 2.2" schemes, which included Shelby Charger side ground effects, an additional, skinnier, front ground effect (different from the Shelby Charger's due to the quad-headlight fascia), "2.2" decals, and an optional hood scoop.

The [[MPFI]]/Turbocharged Turbo I engine, commonly known as a 'T1' was added for Dodge's 1985 '''Shelby Charger'''. This engine produced {{convert|146|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and was changed from its first appearance in the Dodge Daytona Turbo during the previous year. A [[Garrett AiResearch]] T3 turbocharger and Chrysler/Bosch multiple-point fuel injection enabled the 2.2&amp;nbsp;L engine to produce the additional horsepower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allpar.com/omni/turismo.html Dodge Charger (four-cylinder), Turismo, Plymouth Horizon TC3, and Dodge Omni O24]&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 7,709 Shelby Chargers were made for the 1985 model year, and 7,669 in 1986. 1987 was the final year, with just 1,011 produced, plus 1,000 more Shelby Chargers that were sent to Shelby's Whittier Plant in CA, at which time were modified as the 1987 [[Shelby GLHS]]. Dodge Shelby Chargers were available in four different color combinations: Black w/silver skunk stripe (1985–87), Santa Fe Blue w/silver skunk stripe (1983–86), Silver w/Santa Fe Blue skunk stripe (1983–86), and Garnett Red w/silver skunk stripe (1984–87).

==Charger GLHS==
{{further|Shelby GLHS#1987}}
[[File:'87 Shelby GLHS (Centropolis Laval '10).jpg|thumb|1987 Shelby GLHS]]
Carroll Shelby purchased 1,000 of the last Dodge Shelby Chargers and converted them into GLHSs in his facility at [[Whittier, California]]. Every vehicle was built and optioned the same way. All were finished in black and had special badging that marked them as Shelby, not as a Dodge. This was a continuation of the Omni GLHS from the previous year. Shelby used the Turbo I engine updated with the intercooler and plumbing of the [[Chrysler K engine#2.2 Turbo II|Turbo II]] engine, but without the stronger forged crank, full-floating pin pistons and other durability enhancements of that engine. It has a blow-through long runner two-piece intake and a modified turbocharger, reclocked with a different compressor cover. They were rated at {{convert|175|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|175|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque from 2400 to 4800&amp;nbsp;rpm. The Turbo II also received a stronger [[Getrag]] A555 five-speed [[manual transmission]] in place of the rod linkage A525, which was still fitted to the GLHS models.

The suspension was upgraded with Koni adjustable struts/shocks and uprated  Goodyear Eagle GT  Z-rated tires. The Centurion 2 wheels were of Shelby's own manufacture. A special sticker on the speedometer upped the readout to {{convert|125|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. A special numbered Shelby Automotive badge went in place of the normal Charger badge. The modifications prompted the federal government to declare the car a Shelby model.  A ''Dodge'' badge appears nowhere on the car, unlike its five-door L-body sibling, the GLH Omni, which does have the Dodge nameplate.

The '''Dodge Ram SRT-10''' is a [[Sports car|sport]] [[pickup truck]] that was produced by American automaker [[Dodge]] in limited numbers. It was introduced at the January 2002 [[North American International Auto Show]], but was not put into production until 2004.

==Development==
The Dodge Ram SRT was created by DaimlerChrysler's PVO ([[Performance Vehicle Operations]]) division, using [[Dodge Viper]] and [[Plymouth Prowler]] engineers. Extensive wind tunnel testing was used in styling the exterior of the Ram SRT-10. This is the second time that Dodge has put a Viper engine into a Ram pickup. At the 1996 [[Chicago Auto Show]], Dodge introduced a concept Dodge Ram with a Viper Generation 2 engine, but it was not put into production. The Dodge Ram VTS was painted Banzai Blue with dual white skunk stripes, housed an 8.0 L (488 cid) V10, a six-speed Borg-Warner manual gearbox, and {{convert|17|in|mm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} Viper GTS wheels wrapped in BF Goodrich 275/60-HR17 Comp T/A HR4 tires.

==Overview==
[[File:Ram SRT engine.jpg|right|thumb|Dodge Ram SRT-10 engine (with aftermarket intake tube)]]The SRT-10 featured an 8.3 liter (Chrysler 8.3 L Viper V10) [[V10 engine|V10]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/car/02q1/dodge_ram_srt-10-auto_shows |title=Dodge Ram SRT-10 - Auto Shows |publisher=Car and Driver |date= January 2002|accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This engine produced {{convert|500|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 5,600 rpm and {{convert|525|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of [[torque]] at 4,200 rpm. The regular cab, with a total curb weight of {{convert|5130|lb|0|abbr=on}}, reached a top speed of {{convert|154|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, and could [[accelerate]] from 0 to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 4.9 seconds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/ram-1500/2005/2005-dodge-ram-srt10/- Road Test - Auto Reviews |publisher=Car and Driver |date= |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the Quad Cab, weighing {{convert|5618|lb|abbr=on}}, achieved 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph (97&amp;nbsp;km/h) in 5.3 seconds and reached a top speed of {{convert|147|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/car/05q1/dodge_ram_srt-10_quad_cab-short_take_road_test |title=Dodge Ram SRT-10 Quad Cab - Short Take Road Test - Auto Reviews |publisher=Car and Driver |date= January 2005|accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regular cab could complete the {{convert|1/4|mi|m|abbr=on}} in 13.6 seconds at {{convert|106|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="caranddriver1"&gt;http://www.caranddriver.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/original/application/5a5619a470a5176599349baa85c3defc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the Quad Cab in 13.7 seconds at {{convert|100|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="caranddriver2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/car/05q1/dodge_ram_srt-10_quad_cab-short_take_road_test/specs_page_2 |title=Dodge Ram SRT-10 Quad Cab - Specs |publisher=Car and Driver |date= |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine produced one horsepower for every 10.3&amp;nbsp;lbs of vehicle weight in the regular cab. The regular cab generated .86 g of grip on a {{convert|300|ft|m|abbr=on}} skidpad,&lt;ref name="caranddriver1"/&gt; while the Quad Cab generated .83 g.&lt;ref name="caranddriver2"/&gt; The regular cab was rated by the EPA at 9 MPG city/15 highway,&lt;ref name="caranddriver1"/&gt; while the Quad Cab was rated at 9 city/12 MPG highway.&lt;ref name="caranddriver2"/&gt;

===Drivetrain===
The V10 Viper engine delivered 90 percent of its torque from 1500 to 5600 rpm. The cast aluminum [[cylinder block]] had cast-iron liners and cross-bolted main caps. The [[Bore (engines)|bore]] and [[Stroke (engines)|stroke]] had been increased over previous Viper models. Compression ratio, firing order, rod length, block height and block length were unchanged from the second-generation Viper engine. The regular cab featured a [[Tremec T-56 transmission]], while the Quad Cab utilized a [[TorqueFlite#48RE|48RE]] four-speed automatic transmission modified from the Ram Heavy Duty transmission. Both regular cab and Quad Cab used a [[Dana 60]] rear axle.

PVO engineers modified the Ram Heavy Duty's rack and pinion steering and independent front suspension for use in the Ram SRT-10. A fully hydroformed Dodge Ram [[chassis|frame]] was used in conjunction with a custom-tuned suspension, lowering the Ram SRT-10's ride height one inch in the front and 2.5&amp;nbsp;inches in the rear. [[Bilstein Shock Absorbers|Bilstein shock absorbers]], performance-tuned springs and unique aerodynamic aids were used to enhance the Ram SRT-10's higher-speed performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/trucks/112_0401_2004_dodge_ram_srt10/performance.html |title=2004 Dodge Ram SRT-10 Dimensions and Performance |publisher=Motor Trend |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An additional 5th shock was used on the rear axle to prevent wheel hop during wheel-spin.

===Exterior===
The Ram SRT-10 had a unique hood that featured a wide power bulge and honeycomb grill hood scoop. The hood scoop allowed cool air to enter as well as forcing hot air to exit from the engine bay, thus helping the engine to run cooler. "Viper Powered" badges were added to the sides of the power bulge, to indicate the SRT-10 engine under the hood. Large chrome SRT-10 logos were mounted to the driver and passenger side doors and rear tailgate right side on the Quad cab and Single Cab 2005 models replaced in 2006 by smaller chrome and red SRT-10 logo badges . All models were outfitted with large molded kickerpanels painted to match body color. Another exterior feature was a [[tonneau cover]] with an attached [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] that was supposed to come standard on the 2005 Quad Cab version and all 2006 models, but due to manufacturing problems was not installed on nearly half of the Ram SRT-10s intended. To help remedy this situation, Dodge added a $1000 credit and a regular spoiler to the Ram SRT-10s that did not receive the tonneau cover. In addition to style, the spoiler also helped with air flow and provided a reduction in lift and drag. The Ram SRT-10 had a bed size of {{convert|6|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}}, giving the regular cab an overall length of {{convert|17|ft|7|in|m|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|19|ft|2|in|m|abbr=on}} overall length for the Quad Cab.

===Interior===
The Truck audio had 3 options of the Dodge Ram SRT-10 by 2006 and consisted of 8 [[Infinity (audio)|Infinity]] brand [[loudspeaker|speakers]] with a DVD based large color LCD map navigation system and a mid-tier CD turn by turn graphics CD-based system with small color LCD, and finally a standard LED Radio with CD player; all built and designed by Infinity audio and 10 inch woofer mounted in between the seats with silver bezel and 575 watts of total system output, Bluetooth by U-Connect for hands free communication through your car stereo as a factory option also full digital Satellite radio. The doors on both the Standard cab and Quad had silver accents along the middle above the arm rest. It also came with a leather trimmed [[steering wheel]] and with heavily bolstered racing-derived suede-trimmed charcoal leather seats. The center stack was adorned with silver trim, and a silver trim strip with the SRT-10 logo resided under the passenger-side [[air bag]] cover. Taking a cue from the Dodge Viper, the Ram SRT-10 came with a red start button on the dash. The manual transmission regular cab featured a [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] shift lever, which sprouted from a silver metal shift bezel and was fitted with a Viper shift knob. Aluminum performance-inspired pedals replaced the stock setup. The gauge cluster featured satin silver-faced gauges and Viper font and graphics. The [[speedometer]] and [[tachometer]] were re-calibrated to match the Ram SRT-10's increased performance.

===Colors===
Excluding the special editions, the 2004-2005 Ram SRT-10 came in three colors: Black Clear Coat, Bright Silver Metallic Clear Coat, and Flame Red Clear Coat. The redesigned 2006 Ram SRT-10 came in Mineral Gray Metallic, Inferno Red Crystal Pearl Coat, Brilliant Black Crystal Clear Coat, Flame Red Clear Coat and Black Clear Coat.

===Wheels and brakes===
The stock {{convert|22|in|mm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} wheels were fitted with [[Pirelli]] Scorpion P305/40R-22 performance tires and modeled after the 10-spoke wheels available on the Viper. The brakes for the 2004 model (front and rear) and 2005-06 (rear) were modified from the Ram Heavy Duty truck for use in the Ram SRT-10. The standard ABS-equipped brakes were fitted with {{convert|15|in|mm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} rotors in front and {{convert|14|in|mm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[Rotor (brake)|rotors]] out back. 2004 models used red-painted two-piston sliding brake [[Brake caliper|calipers]] front and rear; these were replaced with larger four-piston monoblock calipers up front in 2005–06, designed by TRW and unique to the SRT-10. Two [[NASCAR]]-inspired brake cooling ducts integrated into the front [[Fascia (car)|fascia]] provide cooling for the Ram SRT-10's brakes.

Following the success of the Ram SRT-10 regular cab, Dodge decided to introduce a Quad Cab version starting in the 2005 model year.  The new Quad Cab was aimed at the performance truck enthusiast who wanted a performance pickup, but not at the expense of room for passengers and towing capacity.  The Dodge Ram SRT-10 Quad Cab was fitted with a 4.56 final-drive gear ratio to improve low-end acceleration and was rated at {{convert|7500|lb|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} towing capacity. A body-color aluminum tonneau cover with an aerodynamic spoiler came standard on the Quad Cab. The Quad Cab was only offered with a 4-speed automatic transmission, a 48RE borrowed from the Ram Heavy Duty with the Cummins ISB turbo diesel. The 48RE was rated to handle up to {{convert|700|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} of torque.

==Special editions==
Dodge released several limited editions of the Ram SRT-10 alongside the standard regular cab and Quad Cab versions.

==World record==
[[File:Dodge ram srt10 streetrecord.jpg|right|thumb|February 2004 World Record]] In July 2004, a Dodge Ram SRT-10, driven by [[NASCAR]] driver [[Brendan Gaughan]] set both the [[Guinness World Record]] and [[Sports Car Club of America]]'s record for the world's fastest production truck&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/02-02-2004/0002101094&amp;EDATE=|publisher=DaimlerChrysler|title=World's Fastest Production Pick-Up Truck|accessdate=2004-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an average speed of {{convert|154.587|mi/h|km/h|3|abbr=on}}. It became the world's fastest full size factory pickup truck (there were a total of three Dodge Ram SRT10 trucks used to break the world speed record). One of the trucks (VIN # 3D3HA16H44G257254) reached a top speed of 157.327&amp;nbsp;mph but was disqualified because of what was considered an illegal exhaust system. 154.587 is the official speed that is used.

The '''Dodge Daytona''' is an automobile which was produced by the [[Chrysler Corporation]] under their [[Dodge]] division from 1984 to 1993. It was a [[front-wheel drive]] [[hatchback]] based on the [[Chrysler G platform]], which was derived from the [[Chrysler K platform]]. The '''[[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] Laser''' was an upscale rebadged version of the Daytona. The Daytona was restyled for 1987, and again for 1992. It replaced the Mitsubishi Galant-based [[Dodge Challenger|Challenger]], and slotted between the [[Dodge Charger (L-body)|Charger]] and the [[Mitsubishi Starion|Conquest]].  The Daytona was replaced by the 1995 [[Dodge Avenger]], which was built by [[Mitsubishi Motors]]. The Daytona derives its name mainly from the [[Dodge Charger Daytona]], which itself was named after the [[Daytona 500]] race in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]].

==History==
The Daytona originally used the 2.2 L [[Chrysler K engine]] in [[normally aspirated]] or [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] form. Power outputs are {{convert|93|and|142|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} respectively. The {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|adj=on}}, 2.5-litre K engine was added for 1986. In 1985, the 2.2-L Turbo I engine's horsepower was increased to {{convert|146|hp|abbr=on}}. The 1984 Daytona was available in three trim lines: standard, Turbo and Turbo Z. Total production was 49,347. The Daytona Turbo was on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver 10Best#1984|10Best]] list for 1984. Both the Daytona and Chrysler Laser were available with the Chrysler [[electronic voice alert]] system through 1987. A performance oriented "[[Carroll Shelby|Shelby]]" version of the Daytona was introduced in 1987.

===Chrysler Laser===
[[File:ChryslerLaserXE1985.jpg|thumb|left|1985 Chrysler Laser XE]]

The Chrysler Laser was billed as the Chrysler brand's first sports car. The Laser was a virtual clone of the Dodge Daytona, but came only in the upscale trim version. It was produced from 1984 to 1986. The Laser emphasized European luxury, and was intended to be an "executive personal luxury coupe". The Laser was sleek, low-slung, and aerodynamic, with a drag coefficient of 0.35. The car had a large rear hatchback, with a rear deck-lid spoiler. The 1984 Laser was available in two trim lines: standard and XE. In mid-1985, the XT trim was added as the top-of-the-line version. The standard, XE and XT trim lines would continue until the Laser’s demise in mid-1986. After 1986, the Daytona was exported to Canada as the ''Chrysler Daytona'', officially ending Canadian Daytona sales under the [[Dodge]] marque. The turbo version of the Laser could be recognized by its use of black hood louvers. The 2.2 L Turbo I engine was available as standard equipment in the XE and XT trim lines and optional on the standard model. The Laser was replaced by the Mitsubishi built [[Chrysler Conquest]], a rear-wheel drive vehicle which competed directly against the [[Toyota Celica Supra]]. The Laser name was silently terminated after the first half of 1986 model year, then resurrected for the 1990 model year as the [[Plymouth Laser]], built by [[Diamond Star Motors]], a joint venture between Chrysler and [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]]. The rebranded Laser shared its body and chassis with the [[Eagle Talon]] and [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]].

In 1987, the [[Chrysler LeBaron]] coupe was restyled as a more proper sports car, removing Chrysler's need for the Laser. However, the Laser’s luxury performance image would be carried over into the 1987 Dodge Daytona Pacifica as well as the [[Dodge Lancer|Lancer Pacifica]] and other Dodge vehicles styled by Chrysler's Pacifica Studios.

The Laser was specified to have an estimated {{convert|22|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} city/{{convert|35|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} highway fuel mileage. Chrysler offered a five-year or {{convert|50000|mi|km|sing=on}} warranty, or a protection plan with outer body rust-through protection, based on [[United States Automobile Club]] tests. [[Mark Cross (retail chain)|Mark Cross]] leather seats and a six-way power option were available as options.

Notable features of the Chrysler Laser XE included: 
*A dashboard with digital readouts for the speedometer, tachometer, odometer, temperature, oil pressure, voltage, and fuel
*An electronic monitoring system situated near the top of the center console. This monitoring system checked 22 separate functions on the car, such as an open door, low fuel, or a blown taillight, and would give a digital readout of the situation, along with an audio message produced by a synthesized voice.
*An electronic navigator, which would give information on fuel mileage, miles traveled, distance to destination, and elapsed driving time

===Production numbers===
*1984 - 59,858 (Laser- 33,976/Laser XE- 25,882)
*1985 - 50,866 (Laser- 29,221/Laser XE- 18,193/Laser XT- 3,452)
*1986 - 36,672 (Laser- 14,134/Laser XE- 15,549/Laser XT- 6,989)

===1984===
The Daytona debuted with a 142&amp;nbsp;hp Turbo I motor. Many Turbo Z models were produced and were more luxurious than other years due to their use of Mark Cross leather, light up speakers, and rear amplifier switches. These options were dropped after 1984.

===1985===
Changes were minimal for the Daytona's second year of production. The Turbo Z model was no longer listed as a package but was now a model in its own right. The wraparound spoiler, formerly exclusive to the Turbo Z model, was now offered on all three models. But the biggest change was under the hood: the 2.2 Turbo was given four more hp to 146&amp;nbsp;hp (109&amp;nbsp;kW), and a new shift linkage was added. Optional "Swiss cheese" wheels were replaced with new optional "pizza" wheels. All wheels now had five lug nuts (instead of four). Total production was 47,519.

===1986===
[[File:1986 Daytona Turbo Z CS (Carroll Shelby) with T roof.png|thumb|right|250px|1986 Daytona Turbo Z CS (Carroll Shelby&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dempseybowling.com/sheldodg/sheldodd.htm|title=Dodge Daytona C/S packages|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) with T roof]]
There were several changes for the 1986 Daytona. The middle "Turbo" model was dropped, leaving only two models, the base and Turbo Z. Engine changes were also made, including a new 2.5 L 100&amp;nbsp;hp (75&amp;nbsp;kW) four-cylinder engine for the base model. A new [[targa top|T-roof]] package was added to the option list, and 5,984 Daytona owners chose this option.{{cn|date=March 2018}} The biggest addition was the C/S ([[Carroll Shelby]]) suspension package, available only as an option on the Turbo Z. This consisted of {{convert|32|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} front and {{convert|28|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} rear anti-sway bars, performance tuned struts, and 225/50VR15 Goodyear Eagle Gatorback tires. This package would foreshadow the Daytona Shelby of 1987 and beyond. Some 7,704 owners added this handling package to their Daytonas.{{cn|date=March 2018}} Total production this year was 44,366.

===1987–1988===
[[File:87-91 Dodge Daytona.jpg|thumb|right|250px|1987–1991 Dodge Daytona]]
[[File:Daytonashelbyz.jpg|thumb|1987 Dodge Daytona Shelby Z]]
For 1987, the Daytona was restyled externally, and featured pop-up headlights. New in 1987 was a ''Shelby Z'' trim level with an available Chrysler developed Turbo II intercooled version of the 2.2 L [[Chrysler K engine]], as well as a heavy-duty A555 transaxle with [[Getrag]] gears. The engine produces {{convert|174|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|200|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The Shelby Z also featured numerous suspension upgrades, including a larger diameter front sway bar and disc brakes on all four wheels. This version was sold in Europe under the name ''Chrysler GS Turbo II''. A more luxury-oriented ''Pacifica'' trim line was also added to replace the Chrysler Laser, which was dropped in mid-year 1986. Among the optional equipment included a leather interior, eight-way power enthusiast driver's seat (with mechanical thigh and lumbar controls), digital instrument cluster, and a 12-button trip computer (with instant fuel ratings as well as trip averages and estimated travel times). In 1988, the C/S package was revived. However, this time the C/S was only available on the base model Daytona. In order to reduce weight and produce a lighter Daytona, the C/S came without the ground effects and other features that were on the Shelby. The AGB model C/S had a Turbo I 2.2 L engine, which was available with either an automatic or manual transmission.

====Decepzione====
Following the Chrysler takeover of [[Lamborghini]], product programs general manager Jack Stavana introduced a program to fit a [[Lamborghini Jalpa]] V8 into a Daytona. The motor was linked to an [[all-wheel drive]] (AWD) system designed by Lotus UK and the car was called the ''Decepzione''. Despite its performance and media buzz generated by articles in ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine, the project was discontinued because of the engine's [[oil pan]] having just {{convert|1.5|in|mm|1}} of ground clearance, necessitated by the comparatively tall engine block.

===1989–1991===
Model year 1989 saw the introduction of the ES model offered with silver contrasting ground affects, along with "snowflake" patterned alloy wheels. The 2.2 L Turbo I was replaced with the 2.5 L Turbo I, rated at 150&amp;nbsp;hp and 180&amp;nbsp;ft. lbs. of torque. The ES model was offered as an appearance package/equipment group on base models in order to attract the "average" Daytona buyer’s eye without a major price hike. Also introduced in 1989 was the AGS C/S Competition model, which was featured along with the regular AGB model. This new C/S model featured an intercooled 2.2 L Turbo II engine, along with many other features that were also on the Shelby.{{clarify|date=March 2018}} However, this model was only available with a manual transmission. The AGS C/S package would remain in availability until 1991. The AGB C/S Performance model had the 2.5 L non-intercooled Turbo I engine available with five-speed manual or three-speed automatic. A driver's side airbag was standard.  

For 1990, all Daytonas received an interior restyling, featuring a modernized cockpit-style wraparound dashboard. A variable nozzle turbocharger (''VNT Turbo IV''), borrowed from the 1989 [[Shelby CSX#CSX-VNT|Shelby CSX VNT]], was offered in the Shelby model producing the same {{convert|174|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} as the Turbo II but eliminated turbo lag and improved drivability. Also for 1990, a 3.0 L [[SOHC]] Mitsubishi [[V6]] was made available. 

For 1991, the 2.2 L turbocharged engine was dropped in favor of the new 2.5 L "high torque" turbocharged engine. Although sporting a lesser power output of 152&amp;nbsp;hp, this engine offered 210&amp;nbsp;ft. lbs. of torque, exceeding that of the Turbo II. Also new was the addition of an ''IROC'' model with either the 3.0 L V6 or turbocharged 2.5 L engine. Visually, IROC models differed from lesser models, having a ground effects kit and alloy wheels, among other differences. The IROC decals where added in halfway through 1991 even though all Shelby Daytonas from 1991 were considered to be IROCs. There is no difference between a 1991 Shelby and an IROC besides the decals and the letter "J" in the VIN sequence; on 1991 Daytona Shelbys, the VIN has the sequence ''G74J'' and IROC models have the sequence ''G743''.

===1992–1993===
[[File:Wiki cars 087.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Dodge Daytona]]
For the 1992 model year, production was moved from the St. Louis, Missouri plant to the Sterling Heights, Michigan plant. The Daytona also received a thorough facelift, which replaced the pop-up headlights with flush-mounted rounded ones and added a new grille and rear fascia.  Window surround moldings on the doors were also new, and rounder than the sharp angles of the moldings on 1984 to 1991 models. The 1992 model also displayed the new Dodge "ram head" emblem on the hood and below the taillights. While the 3.0 L V6 became an option on lower end models, it was the standard engine on IROC models. Optional on the 1992 IROC was the 2.5 L "High Torque" Turbo, available as a very rare option (less than 230 produced). Also available on the IROC was the new ''R/T'' performance package, which featured a {{convert|224|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} ''Turbo III'' version of the 2.2 L four-cylinder, but with a Lotus designed [[dual overhead cam|DOHC]] cylinder head and direct ignition system instead of a distributor-type ignition system. Although the Shelby trim was discontinued after 1991 (due to the end of Carroll Shelby's involvement with Chrysler), a small number of 1992 Daytona IROCs were produced bearing the Shelby name. These IROCs featured "Shelby" decals which was added at the dealership or later to help boost sales, and were all 2.5 Turbo cars, as they featured the Shelby Performance Package sales code, as this was superseded by the iroc package. Shelby versions were mainly "Chrysler" branded Daytonas which were sold overseas , and were part of an early run of IROCs. These were the last production vehicles produced by Chrysler to bear the Shelby name was in 1991 when replaced with Iroc. Production of the Daytona ended in February 1993 without an immediate replacement.&lt;ref name=NZCarp16&gt;{{cite journal | ref = NZC493 | journal = New Zealand Car | title = Newsline | page = 16 | volume = 7 | number = 6 | date = April 1993 | editor-last = Anderson | editor-first = Donn | location = Auckland, New Zealand | publisher = Accent Publishing Cnr | issn = 0113-0196 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1995 [[Dodge Avenger]] eventually took the Daytona's place.

The '''Dodge Phoenix''' is an [[automobile]] which was produced by [[Chrysler Australia]] from 1960 to 1972.

The Phoenix was introduced in May 1960 as an [[Australian]] assembled version&lt;ref&gt;Latest Dodge is Assembled here, Australian Motor Manual, 1 July 1960, page 11&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United States|American]] [[Dodge Dart]],&lt;ref name="allpar"&gt;[http://www.allpar.com/model/phoenix.html The Phoenix] Retrieved from allpar.com on 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; positioned above the locally developed [[Chrysler Royal (Australia)|Chrysler Royal]] as Chrysler Australia’s luxury model. It borrowed its name from the top Dart, the Dodge Dart Phoenix, but unlike its American namesake it was offered only as a four-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] and only with a 318 cubic inch [[V8 engine|V8]] engine.&lt;ref name="Glass"&gt;Glass’s Dealer Guide, Passenger Vehicle Values, South Australian and Northern Territory Edition, June 1973, page 42&lt;/ref&gt;

The Phoenix was subsequently restyled in line with the 1961 and 1962 Dodge Dart. For 1963 the new TD2 series Phoenix was derived from the US [[Dodge 440]],&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, 2010, page 84&lt;/ref&gt; and for 1965 and beyond the Phoenix was based on the Canadian [[Plymouth Fury III]].&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, 2010, page 87&lt;/ref&gt;  Like the 1965 Fury, the 1965 Phoenix featured vertically stacked [[headlamp]]s.&lt;ref name="allpar" /&gt; A four-door [[hardtop]] body style joined the sedan in 1967.&lt;ref name=Glass/&gt; The hardtop was fitted with a 383 cubic inch V8 engine&lt;ref name=Glass/&gt; whilst the sedan continued with the smaller 318 cubic inch V8.&lt;ref name=Glass/&gt; The two body styles continued to be offered until the Australian Phoenix was discontinued.&lt;ref name=Macquarie&gt;The Macquarie Dictionary of Motoring, 1986, pages 120-121&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, variants of the slightly longer U.S. station wagon were sold from the beginning for duty as hearses.  Eventually, these were modified with two doors and oversized rear quarter windows, in the British hearse tradition.

Although the 1965 and later Phoenixes were basically Plymouth Furys, they did feature the North American style full size Dodge Polara instrument panel (adapted for right hand drive).  They also continued to use the old-fashioned "clapper" windshield wipers (while North American models used modern parallel-action wipers).

After the Phoenix was discontinued, the Australian developed [[Chrysler by Chrysler]] inherited the role of the top level luxury model in Chrysler Australia's model range.

==Dodge 440 (1963-1964)==
[[File:Dodge Phoneix (TD2).JPG|thumb|right|[[Australia]]n built [[Dodge TD2 Phoenix]] based on the 1963 Dodge 440]]
From 1963 the 440 was separated from the new, smaller Dart range.&lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt; It now featured a 119-inch wheelbase shared with the [[Dodge 330|330]] and [[Dodge Polara|Polara]] and available as a 2-door sedan, 4-door sedan, 2-door hardtop and 4-door station wagon.&lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt;

During 1963 and 1964 [[model year]]s, the Dodge 440 was the mid-range model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=EnYkzsGr450C&amp;q=The+Dodge+440+was+the+intermediate+trim+level+Dodge+and+included+all |page=287 |title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975 |publisher=Krause Publications |isbn=0-87341-027-0 |editor-last=Gunnell |editor-first=John A. |year=1992 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured less chrome and a plainer interior than the top-trimed Polara.

For the 1965 model year, the 440, along with the 330, was replaced by the Polara, with the [[Dodge Custom 880|880]] taking the Polara's place in the lineup on the new C Body with {{convert|121|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase. The 426 engine was also no longer available in full-size Dodges. However, the name 440 stayed on as a trim level of the [[Dodge Coronet]].&lt;ref name="Gunnell"/&gt;

The '''Dodge Aspen''', which was produced during the 1976 to the 1980 [[model year]]s, was a [[compact car]], along with its then-concurrent '''Plymouth''' [[Badge engineering|branded]] counterpart, the '''Volaré''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "I will fly away" or "I will blow away", [[Italian language|Italian]] for "to fly"), which was launched as a four-door [[station wagon|wagon]], a four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] and a two-door [[coupe]]. By the end of their production run, the Aspen and Volaré would be considered [[mid-size car|intermediate car]]s.

The Dodge Aspen and Plymouth Volaré were introduced during the fall of 1975 as 1976 models, and were collectively named Motor Trend's "Car of the Year" for 1976. They were the successors to the [[Chrysler A platform|A-body]] &amp;mdash; [[Dodge Dart]] and [[Plymouth Valiant]]/[[Plymouth Duster]], which concurrently were sold along with Aspen and Volaré during the early part of the 1976 [[model year]] until A-body models were discontinued.

== Production history ==
[[File:'77 Plymouth Volare Sedan (Orange Julep).JPG|thumb|left|1977 Plymouth Volaré sedan]]
The vehicle was wind-tunnel tested to be aerodynamically sound in its fuel conservation potential as the complete aerodynamics development program included a wide range studies from drag reduction to crosswind stability, wind noise and ventilation performance. The effects of this testing resulted in softened front end contours, removal of drip troughs and helped shaped internal air flow ducting.&lt;ref name="AspenEngineering"&gt;Chrysler Corporation: 'Aspen Engineering. For release: Sunday, September 28, 1975'&lt;/ref&gt; Body engineering in the Aspen was executed using computer technology; unit body engineering was conducted by use of clear plastic stress models that showed up stress points before any sheet metal was formed. Weight reduction to provide maximum fuel economy was achieved through use of thinner glass, lighter weight side door beams and [[High-strength low-alloy steel|HSLA]] brackets and reinforcements that were four times as strong as conventional mild steel. A reduced number of stampings resulted in better panel fits and fewer welds. The Aspen had improved visibility and compared with other Dodge compacts, the Aspen provided a total glass area increase of 25% on two-door models and 33% on sedans.&lt;ref name="PressRelease"&gt;Chrysler Corporation: 'Press release for use in 1976 North American International Auto Show sections'&lt;/ref&gt;

Wheel alignment adjustments such as caster and camber could be made by removing plates over the wheel housings. The new isolated transverse suspension system was a substantial departure from the longitudinal torsion bars Chrysler had introduced in 1957 and used on all models since that year, until the release of the F-bodies.&lt;ref name="AspenEngineering" /&gt; The transverse (side-to-side) bars were not as geometrically favorable, but saved space and weight. &lt;ref name="AspenEngineering"/&gt; In addition, the new front suspension system was touted as giving a "big car ride" as the suspension had a low, or softer, fore and aft compliance which allowed the wheel to move rearward instead of straight up and down when the tire encountered an object, dampening the blow and rolling with the condition of the road.&lt;ref name="AspenEngineering" /&gt; The two parallel torsion bars and an anti-sway bar were mounted forward of the front wheels, integrated into a spring-strut front suspension. These components were attached to a K-shaped structural crossmember. The K-shaped crossmember was isolated from the unitized car body by four rubber mounts. This transverse torsion bar suspension was also incorporated into the M- and [[Chrysler J platform|J-body]] cars. The conventional leaf spring rear suspension was also rubber-isolated, so there was no metal-to-metal path through which road noise or vibration can be transmitted to the body; even the steering column was isolated.&lt;ref name="AspenEngineering" /&gt;

The 1976 Dodge Aspen also served as a test vehicle for a [[gas turbine]] engine installation, in a project sponsored by the [[United States Department of Energy]].&lt;ref name=CCMS76&gt;{{citation | title = Final Report: Automotive Propulsion Systems Pilot Study | publisher = U.S. Department of Energy | author = The Pilot Study Working Group | id = CCMS-76 | page = 21 | date = 1978 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Entering tests in August 1976, this engine was a new, smaller version of an earlier [[Chrysler turbine engines|Chrysler development]].&lt;ref name=CCMS76/&gt; There were hopes that such engines would be cleaner and more efficient than comparably powerful [[V8 engine]]s, but the turbine engine proved a dead end in automotive applications.

=== Marketing ===
R. M. "Ham" Schirmer, manager of Dodge car and corporate advertising for Chrysler, said that the Aspen name originated from the codename ''Aspen-Vail'' when the project for it and the Plymouth "sister car" began in 1971.&lt;ref name="Surprise"&gt;'"Surprise in naming", The Detroit News, December 18, 1975, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; "Aspen is a very pleasant name, " Schirmer said, "people think of the outdoors, but not necessarily skiing when they hear it. . . It won't inhibit where we want to position the car because it's basically neutral."&lt;ref name="Surprise" /&gt; Nonetheless, Chrysler sponsored the 1976 Dodge Aspen Team K2 Freestyle and opened up World Pro Skiing's seventh season in [[Aspen, Colorado]] as the Dodge Aspen Cup running courses on [[Aspen Highlands]] and [[Aspen Mountain (Colorado)|Aspen Mountain]]. In print and media actor [[Rex Harrison]] was spokesman for the Aspen, whose advertising campaign was inspired by the "Ascot Gavotte" scene in Harrison's ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]''. A patter song was spoken in rhythm, by Harrison, as "Unbelievable." Singer [[Sergio Franchi]] was the spokesman for the Volaré and sang the pop song "[[Volare (song)|Volare]]", with altered lyrics, in TV and radio commercials. The accent mark used in the car's name is not in the Italian word or the song title; Volaré commercials described it as an "accent on quality". "Volaré" in Spanish with the accent translates as "I will fly".

=== Aspen R/T ===
[[File:'79 Dodge Aspen R-T Coupe (Rigaud).JPG|thumb|left|1979 Dodge Aspen R/T coupé]]
The Aspen R/T coupe was the "performance" trim level of the Aspen and came with E70x14 tires, rallye wheels, a grille blackout treatment, body striping, as well as 'R/T' decals and medallions. A {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 option, with a {{convert|170|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|280|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque, was offered along with overdrive-4 transmission. This was unavailable in [[California]] because the engine, which averaged {{convert|15.2|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} did not meet California fuel economy regulations.&lt;ref name="MotorTrend"&gt;Motor Trend Magazine, February 1976: 'Aspen R/T (The 360 LA V8 was never made available with the Overdrive-4 transmission, only the 727 three speed automatic. The 225 Slant 6 and the 318 LA V8 were offered with the Overdrive-4 transmission. Rapid transit returns: an all-new performance car for the age of economy' p. 39-42&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''[[Motor Trend]]'' road test, a 360 R/T turned in a standing quarter mile at 17.4 seconds at a speed of {{convert|86.1|mi/h|km/h|1|}}.&lt;ref name="MotorTrend" /&gt; The R/T made a {{convert|60|to|95|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}} run in 13.8 seconds.&lt;ref name="MotorTrend" /&gt; The Plymouth version of the car was called the Volaré '''Road Runner'''.

=== Station wagons ===
Station wagons were available in both model lines, all featuring liftgates with fixed rear windows. These models had a cargo volume of {{convert|71.9|ft3|m3}} and load capacity of {{convert|1100|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, which was {{convert|100|lb|kg|abbr=on}} less than the intermediate and standard size Chrysler wagons. The liftgate opening was nearly {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|27.6|in|cm|abbr=on}} high. With the rear seat folded down, the cargo area was {{convert|74|in|cm|abbr=on}} long at the belt line and {{convert|43.2|in|cm|abbr=on}} wide between the wheel houses. Premium station wagons in either the Aspen '''SE''' or Volaré '''Premier''' series featured [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] on its exterior side panels. On Aspen SEs, the woodgrain was framed in simulated blond (painted metal) wood-look trim. On the Premiers, the side panels were trimmed in stainless steel frames accented in matte black. Aside from the brand badging and grilles unique on each brand, this station wagon trim element remains one of the few visual clues that differentiated the Aspen from the Volaré. Side covers of the cargo area were made of one-piece [[injection molding|injection molded]] [[polypropylene]]. Covered, lockable stowage compartments of {{convert|1.5|ft3|dm3|abbr=on}} capacity were provided in these panels; these compartments were standard on the Aspen SEs and optional on the low-line wagons.&lt;ref name="AspenEngineering" /&gt;

=== 1976 ===
[[File:1976 Dodge Aspen Coupe Special Edition, front left (Hershey 2019).jpg|thumb|right|1976 Dodge Aspen S/E coupe]]
The replacement for the venerable Dart, the Aspen would share the same engines and [[Three-box styling|three-box]] body style with its predecessor, but not much else.

Available as a 4-door [[station wagon|wagon]], 4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]] or 2-door [[coupe]], it came in three trim levels - base, Custom and SE (Special Edition). Coupes featured frameless door glass but a thick "B" pillar was used, replacing the popular hardtop body style of the Dart. The performance R/T package came only on the coupe and featured a {{convert|318|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 standard or an optional {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with either a 2- or 4-barrel [[carburetor]]. The {{convert|225|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine|Slant Six]] was standard across the line, and was available in most states with a choice of a 1- or 2-barrel carburetor. Total production was 189,900 (Aspen) and 255,008 (Volaré). {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

=== 1977 ===
The Aspen's second year was mostly a carryover. A new [[T-top]] was added to the coupé's options. The R/T package added a "Super Pak" option. This consisted of front and rear spoilers, wheel opening flares and louvred rear windows. A new stripe kit was also added as well. An R/T equipped with this package became a "Super R/T". The Volaré was Canada's top selling car this year. Total production was 266,012 (Aspen) and 327,739 (Volaré). The 3 speed manual with column shifter was last available in 1977.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

=== 1978 ===
[[File:'78 Dodge Aspen FROM HELL (Auto classique VAQ Mont St-Hilaire '11).jpg|thumb|right|1978 Dodge Aspen coupe]]
The three trim lines were consolidated into one for 1978. The Custom and Special Edition lines were still available, but were now reduced to option packages. The Aspen also received a new front fascia, similar to the Volaré, while the Volaré's grille was restyled with an eggcrate pattern. Sales were down over 30 percent for the 1978 cars. The 3 speed manual was all floor shifter after 1977. A "Duster" trim package was added. New performance packages included  the Super Coupe and Kit Car. Both had the same performance exterior add-ons as the "Super Pak", now renamed the "Sport Pak", but came in different colors as well as different options.
[[File:Aspen Super Coupe.jpg|thumb|2 Dodge Aspen Super Coupes]]
The Super Coupe included GR60x15 Goodyear GT radial tires mounted on 15x8 wheels, a heavy-duty suspension with rear sway bar, a matte black finish on the hood and came only in one color - Sable Tan Sunfire Metallic. Special three color (orange, yellow and red) stripes separated the body color from the matte black colors. Only 494 were built. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The Kit Car, made in honor of [[NASCAR]] legend [[Richard Petty]], was supposed to look as much like a race car as possible. The wheels had no hubcaps, the wheel opening flares had a bolted on look, and even the windshield had metal tie downs just like the race cars. Unlike a race car, the Kit Car came standard with an [[automatic transmission]]. A special addition was a decal kit with large door mountable "43" decals and 360 decals for the hood. These decals were shipped in the trunk either to be installed by the dealer or by the owner. It was available in one color - a special two-tone red. A total of 145 were built. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}
[[File:1978 Plymouth Volare 4 door.JPG|thumb|1978 Plymouth Volaré]]

A new Sunrise package, similar to the Volaré Duster package, was also new for 1978. This was available only on the coupé, and consisted mainly of new stripes and louvred rear windows.

Wider [[Automotive lighting|tail light]] lenses with amber turn signals replaced the Plymouth Valiant/Duster-styled lenses on both Aspen and Volaré coupés and sedans. Total production came to 166,419 (Aspen) and 217,795 (Volaré). {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

=== 1979 ===
The 1979 model year was a carryover with the only readily visible change being the replacement of the amber rear turn signals with red ones. The 1978 option packages continued into 1979, with the exception of the Super Coupe and Kit Car. A new {{convert|85|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} speedometer, new colors, and a diagnostic connector for the engine were added. The station wagon was available as a "Sport Wagon" with special stripes, a front airdam, and wheel arch flares. Total production came to 121,354 (Aspen) and 178,819 (Volaré). {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

=== 1980 ===
[[File:1980 Plymouth Volare Duster.JPG|thumb|1980 Plymouth Volaré with the Duster trim package that included Duster badges, a white stripe along the body and cloth-and-vinyl plaid bucket seats]] 
For its last year of production, and at the insistence of [[Lee Iacocca]], the Aspen and Volaré were restyled and gained a new front end (very similar to the [[Ford Fairmont]]) with a thin grille and rectangular [[headlamp]]s, achieved by sharing the hood, fenders and front bumper with the [[Dodge Diplomat]]. Special Edition and Premier packages were available, while the Special Edition package was now only available on the sedan and coupe. The "Duster" trim package was also available for the 1980 model year. The R/T package was installed on 285 Aspens for this year. Total production came to 67,318 (Aspen) and 90,063 (Volaré), though a significant portion of the sales were for fleet (Police and taxi) use. The {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 was dropped this year, leaving the {{convert|318|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 as the top engine. Power from the 318 dropped from {{convert|140|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 4,000 rpm to {{convert|120|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 3,600 rpm in two barrel models. Four barrel versions increased from {{convert|140|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} (non-California) at 4,000 rpm to {{convert|155|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 4,000 rpm. The {{convert|225|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} inline six-cylinder remained the base engine. The "Super Six" two barrel option was dropped, leaving the Holley 1945 single barrel set up as the sole choice. The "slant-six" produced {{convert|90|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 3,600 rpm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hennessy |first=Ed |url=http://www.allpar.com/model/aspen-volare-specs.html |title=Plymouth Volaré and Dodge Aspen including Super Coupe |publisher=Allpar.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Aspen was noted for having problems with its carburetors which resulted in frequent  stalling.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Aspen also had difficulty in starting, even after leaving the engine off for several minutes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} This resulted in several recalls thus the Aspen gained a reputation for poor build quality which led to a decline in sales; 1980 would be its final model year.

The Dodge Aspen was replaced with the front-wheel drive [[Dodge Aries]] for the 1981 model year.&lt;ref name="allpar.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/aspen.html |title=Plymouth Volaré and Dodge Aspen including Super Coupé cars and Chrysler LeBaron |publisher=Allpar.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International markets ==
Between 1977 and 1979, the small [[Switzerland|Swiss]] specialty automaker [[Monteverdi (car)|Monteverdi]] built a modified version of this car, called the Sierra, intended to compete in Europe's luxury car market.

The '''Dart''' name (rather than '''Aspen''') was applied to Dodge-branded F-body cars in [[Mexico]] and [[Colombia]], corresponding to the local Chrysler-branded F-body cars badged as '''Valiant Volaré'''. The Mexican F-body Volarés were not marketed as Plymouth, because that brand was dropped after 1969. The 1981 and 1982 Mexican market Dart coupes used the M body Diplomat coupe, but fitted with the 1980 Volare header panel. Chrysler de México also sold cheaper versions of the American K-cars -Plymouth Reliant and Dodge Aries- (in 1982–1987) and Plymouth Caravelle (1988) as Chrysler Volarés. The 1988 Chrysler Volaré E (an inexpensive version of the 1988 Plymouth Caravelle with a 1986–1988 Plymouth Reliant front end attached to it) served as Mexican Highway Patrol ("Policía Federal de Caminos" in Spanish) units from 1988 to 1990. They got a Chrysler Turbo II 2.2L engine and 3-speed automatic transmission (shifter on the dash, like U.S. patrol cars) and were known in Mexico as "Turbo-patrols".

The Volaré also became known as the '''Volaré "Duster"''' in Canada.&lt;ref name="allpar. com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/aspen.html |title=Plymouth Volare and Dodge Aspen including Super Coupe cars and Chrysler LeBaron |publisher=Allpar.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== After the F-body ==
The F-body cars were withdrawn from production after 1980 and replaced by the smaller [[front-wheel drive|front-wheel-drive]] [[Chrysler K platform|K-cars]] &amp;mdash; 1981 [[Dodge Aries]]/[[Plymouth Reliant]], 1982 [[Dodge 400]]/[[Chrysler LeBaron]], and the [[Chrysler M platform|M-body]] &amp;mdash; 1982 [[Dodge Diplomat]]/[[Plymouth Gran Fury]] four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]s, which were very similar in structure, size, and engineering to the F-body Aspen and Volaré.

The Aspen model name was revived in 2007 for the [[Chrysler Aspen]] luxury [[sport utility vehicle]] (SUV).

The '''Dodge Intrepid''' is a [[full-size car|full sized]] [[front-wheel drive]] four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] that was produced by Dodge (Chrysler) for [[model year]]s 1993 to 2004. It is related to the [[Chrysler 300M]], [[Chrysler Concorde]], [[Chrysler LHS]], [[Chrysler New Yorker]], and [[Eagle Vision]] which were all built on Chrysler's new "[[cab forward]]" [[Chrysler LH platform|LH]] [[automobile platform|platform]].

The Intrepid was sold in [[Canada]] as the '''Chrysler Intrepid'''.  In the [[United States]], it replaced the [[Dodge Monaco]] as Dodge's largest car.  With Dodge's introduction to [[Mexico]] during that time, it was badged as a Dodge, replacing the [[Dodge Dynasty|Dynasty]] which had been sold there under the [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] brand.

==Background==
The Intrepid's design goes back to 1986, when designer Kevin Verduyn completed the initial exterior design of a new aerodynamic concept sedan called Navajo. The design never passed the clay model stage. It was also at this time that the Chrysler Corporation purchased bankrupt [[Italy|Italian]] [[sports car]] manufacturer [[Lamborghini]]. The Navajo's exterior design was reworked and became the [[Lamborghini Portofino]], released as a concept at the 1987 [[Frankfurt Auto Show]]. The Portofino was heralded as a design triumph, setting in motion Chrysler's decision to produce a production sedan with the Portofino's revolutionary exterior design, called "[[cab forward#Road transport|cab forward]]". The [[cab forward]] design was characterized by the long, low slung windshield, and relatively short overhangs. The wheels were effectively pushed to the corners of the car, creating a much larger passenger cabin than the contemporaries of the time.

Design of the chassis began in the late 1980s, after Chrysler had bought [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]] (AMC) in 1987. During this time, Chrysler began designing the replacement for the then-new Dodge Dynasty, which was a [[mid-size car]]. Initial proposals bore resemblance to the Dynasty, but this design approach was scrapped entirely in 1988 by [[François Castaing]], the former AMC Vice President of product engineering and development.&lt;ref name="thebestof"&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070219/SUB/70216087 |title=The Best of Chrysler |journal=Automotive News |date=19 February 2007 |first=Bradford |last=Wernle |accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As AMC was purchased by Chrysler, Castaing became new Vice President for Vehicle Engineering for the new company. The acquiring automaker was in desperate need to replicate the AMC and Renault corporate culture where work was conducted in an atmosphere "of constant change".&lt;ref name="thebestof"/&gt; Castaing organized Chrysler's departments into AMC-style cross-function teams, as well as incorporated the use of simultaneous engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.toolpack.com/culture.html |title=Organizational culture |publisher=Toolpack Consulting |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the new vehicle's design, under Castaing's leadership, began with the [[Eagle Premier]] platform.

The Premier's longitudinal engine mounting layout was inherited, as was the front suspension geometry, and parts of the braking system. The chassis itself became a flexible architecture capable of supporting front or [[rear-wheel drive]] (designated "LH" and "LX" respectively). The chassis design was continually refined throughout the following years, as it underpinned more Chrysler prototypes: the 1989 Chrysler Millennium and 1990 [[Eagle Optima]].The transmission was inspired by the Premier's Audi and ZF automatics. Borrowing heavily from Chrysler's A604 (41TE) "[[Ultradrive]]" transversely mounted automatic, it became the A606 (also known as 42LE).The initial standard 3.3&amp;nbsp;L [[pushrod engine|pushrod]] [[V6 engine]] was joined in 1990 with a 3.5&amp;nbsp;L [[SOHC]] engine with four valves per cylinder. For the second generation Intrepid R/T the block was recast in aluminum as part of a comprehensive upgrade.

The first generation of LH cars debuted at the [[North American International Auto Show#1992|1992 North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]] as three 1993 models: the Chrysler Concorde, Dodge Intrepid (badged as a Chrysler in Canada), and the Eagle Vision (also badged as a Chrysler in Europe and Canada).

The Intrepid was available in two trim levels: base and the sportier, better-equipped ES, which added four-wheel disc brakes, 16" wheels with better tires, and stiffer "touring" suspension damping. All Intrepids received driver and front passenger airbags, a rarity at the time, as well as air conditioning and the four-speed automatic transmission. Anti-lock brakes were optional, as was traction control and the more powerful 3.5&amp;nbsp;L SOHC engine rated at (214&amp;nbsp;hp).

The Intrepid's launch marked a new image for the Dodge brand, which began to market itself as "The New Dodge" with a marketing campaign featuring actor [[Edward Herrmann]], who would go on to serve as the brand's spokesperson for the rest of the decade.

Changes were few over the Intrepid's initial five-year production. A new variable-assist power steering rack replaced the original for 1994, allowing for easier parking while maintaining a firmer feel at speed. The touring suspension tuning was also made standard equipment in the base model this year. [[Anti-lock brakes]] were made standard in the ES in 1995, and in 1996 a new manual shift function for the [[automatic transmission]], called [[Autostick]], was inherited from the Eagle Vision TSi: the first transmission of its kind available in a mainstream car. In addition, Chrysler updated the Dodge Intrepid for the 1995 model year, adding the previous Dodge Ram logo, which was used from 1994-2009. Each exterior treatment uses a hoodline and chrome accented [[Daytime running lamps|daytime running lights]] with body colored accents. The Intrepid was often compared with the [[Chevrolet Lumina]] and [[Ford Taurus]], and to a lesser extent, the [[Toyota Camry]], [[Nissan Altima]], and [[Honda Accord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Popular Mechanics |date=April 1993 |title=The Intrepid Challenge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intrepids were built at [[American Motors]]' [[Brampton Assembly]] facility, originally established to manufacture the [[Eagle Premier]], in [[Brampton, Ontario|Brampton]], [[Ontario]], Canada; and at the Chrysler plant at Newark, Delaware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chrysler’s Newark Plant (Delaware) |url= https://www.allpar.com/corporate/factories/newark.html |website=allpar.com |quote=In 1993, Newark started making the first Dodge Intrepid |accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LH cars were redesigned for the 1998 model year, with the 1998 Intrepid being designed by Robert Boniface and taking 31 months from design freeze to commencement. The engines were replaced by two new all-aluminum units: a [[DOHC]] 2.7&amp;nbsp;L ( 2736 cc), {{convert|200|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} V6 for base models, and a [[SOHC]] 3.2&amp;nbsp;L (3231 cc), {{convert|225|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} V6 for the ES. A new, top-of-the-line R/T model was added in 1999, the centerpiece of which was a redesigned version of the 3.5&amp;nbsp;L (3518 cc) V6, now producing {{convert|242|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|234|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the ES. At the same time the 3.2&amp;nbsp;L was reduced to an option in the ES. The Intrepid was completely redesigned for the 1998 model year, arriving in showrooms during late 1997. Body shells were designed to be stronger and stiffer, as well as incorporating double-shear suspension mounts and integrated side impact protection.

* MY1999: Minor changes to interior panels. The Chrysler Sentry Key theft-deterrent system disabled the ignition unless the proper key was used to start the engine.
* MY2000: New variable-assist steering, and an optional 4-disc in-dash CD changer.
* MY2002: The 3.2L engine was discontinued, and new wheel covers became available.  the R/T received an extra {{convert|2|hp|abbr=on}} from PCM programming changes which allowed it to have {{convert|244|hp|abbr=on}} on 89-octane fuel. This was also the year when DaimlerChrysler began cost-cutting that led to the deletion of various features from the Intrepid. Most notable were the deletion of the illuminated headlight switch, illuminated traction control switch, illuminated lock and window switches, door courtesy lights (replaced with red reflectors), illuminated ashtray receptacle, trunk lid liner, armrest power outlet, door emblems, driver's seat map pocket, and the blacked-out front fascia paint scheme. Cost-cutting was one of the reasons why sales of the Intrepid started to slump.
* MY2003: No major changes were made except the optional 4-disc in-dash CD changer was replaced with the optional 6-disc in-dash CD changer. The R/T was discontinued in 2003, but a new SXT model kept the 3.5&amp;nbsp;L High Output engine with an increase to a {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} rating. The SXT moniker was eventually used across the Dodge product line as a trim level. The Intrepid SXT was basically a base model Intrepid SE with the 3.5 H.O. engine taken from the R/T, with some "sportier" features such as a sunroof and spoiler. It was a value trim model actually classified as an ES (SXT), but had less features than the ES did with a more powerful engine.
* MY2004: Popularity of the Intrepid waned over its 12-year lifespan. The cab-forward design, revolutionary in 1993, had become ubiquitous and passé, culminating in the Intrepid's quiet cancellation. All Intrepids were built at AMC's former assembly plant, originally used to manufacture the Eagle Premier, in Brampton, Ontario, Canada. They were replaced by the new [[rear wheel drive]] LX vehicles; the 2005 [[Dodge Magnum]] and 2006 [[Dodge Charger (LX)|Dodge Charger]]. The last Intrepid rolled off the assembly line on August 30, 2004.

===Fleet sales===

The second generation was marketed to the commercial and government markets, particularly the base (1998-2000) and SE (2001-2004) trim levels. An Intrepid Police Package was sold from 2003-2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pardubicky.denik.cz/zpravy_region/straznici-v-bohdanci-maji-novou-posilu-dodge.html|title=Strážníci v Bohdanči mají posilu. Dodge Charger|date=December 5, 2011|access-date=December 7, 2017|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the earlier rear-wheel drive [[Chevrolet Caprice]] or [[Ford Crown Victoria]]. These packages had distinctive styling differences (such as small hub caps) and additional wiring to support strobes and flashers in the trunk compartment and in the front by the grill. The 3.5 V6 found in the R/T &amp; SXT was standard in the police package. These packages and some non-police (non-commercial) packages featured plastic front-end intake vents that routed air onto the rotors for additional cooling and stopping power.

[[File:Morgan Shepherd Watkins Glen 2004.jpg|thumb|Intrepid in [[NASCAR]] in 2004.]]
In 2001, the Intrepid made its debut on the [[NASCAR]] circuit, signifying the return of Dodge to NASCAR competition after an 18-year hiatus. Drivers in the initial Dodge campaign included [[Bill Elliott]], [[Kasey Kahne]], [[Jason Leffler]], [[Ward Burton]], [[Sterling Marlin]], [[John Andretti]], [[Casey Mears]], [[Jamie McMurray]], [[Buckshot Jones]], [[Kyle Petty]], [[Stacy Compton]], [[Dave Blaney]], [[Jeremy Mayfield]], and [[Casey Atwood]]. Marlin was the first to win in a Dodge, giving the marque its first victory since 1977, with [[Neil Bonnett]] driving. The Intrepid continued in NASCAR until 2005 when Dodge switched to the Charger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dodge to teams: Chargers only after TMS|url= http://www.nascar.com/2006/news/headlines/cup/03/20/dodge_charger/index.html |publisher=NASCAR |first=David |last=Newton |date=21 March 2006 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100729054127/http://www.nascar.com/2006/news/headlines/cup/03/20/dodge_charger/index.html |archivedate=29 July 2010 |accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hybrid electric concepts==
{{main|Dodge Intrepid ESX}}
In the late 1990s, Chrysler used the Intrepid as a research platform for a [[hybrid electric vehicle]] in a [[diesel-electric]] configuration. Three variations were built, the '''Intrepid ESX''', '''ESX II''', and '''ESX III'''. The first vehicle was built in a series hybrid configuration, while the next two were considered mild hybrids. These were attempted in the time frame of 1997 to 1998.

The ESX design team set a high goal of making the vehicle capable of sipping [[gasoline]] at the rate of {{convert|80|mpgus|lk=off}}, but the eventual vehicle only achieved an estimated {{convert|55|mpgus|lk=off}}. The figure was impressive for such a vehicle. However, the car used a number of exotic materials, which made the cost excessive if it were ever to go into full-scale production. It was estimated that the car would cost $80,000, or roughly $60,000 more than a regular Intrepid. Part of this price increase was caused by the use of [[lead-acid battery|lead-acid batteries]].

The ESX II team set a somewhat more modest goal of {{convert|70|mpgus|lk=off}}. The vehicle was made much lighter than normal by using an [[aluminum]] frame and [[Graphite-reinforced plastic|carbon fiber]] [[composite material]]. This version only cost around $37,000, or about $15,000 more than a standard Intrepid. This version used [[nickel metal hydride battery|nickel metal hydride batteries]].

The third vehicle, the ESX III, had a target mileage of {{convert|72|mpgus|lk=off}}. It used less expensive materials, such as [[injection molding|injection-molded]] [[thermoplastic]] instead of carbon fiber. The estimated cost was only about $7,500 more than a standard vehicle, which would give a total somewhere around $30,000. The ESX III used [[lithium ion battery|lithium ion batteries]].

==Awards==
The Intrepid and Concorde were on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 1993 and 1994. The second-generation Intrepid again made the list for 1998 and 1999. Both generations won Consumer Guide's "Best Buy" award.

==Oil sludge==
Some second-generation 2.7&amp;nbsp;L V6 engines have suffered from failures due to [[oil sludge]] contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oilsludge.com |title=What is Oil Sludge? |publisher=OilSludge.com |date= |accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autosafety.org/getcat.php?cid=28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041112200839/http://www.autosafety.org/getcat.php?cid=28 |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 November 2004 |title=The Center For Auto Safety - Oil Sludge |publisher=Autosafety.org |date= |accessdate=21 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009, five separate class action lawsuits related to the alleged oil sludge defect were consolidated to the District of New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://classactiondefense.jmbm.com/chrysler_class_action_defense_mdl_ord.pdf |title= MDL No. 2006 Transfer Order, In RE: Chrysler LLC 2.7 Liter V-6 Engine Oil Sludge Products Liability Litigation |author=U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation |date=10 February 2009 |publisher=classactiondefense.jmbm.com |accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These problems happen when fine engine oil passages become clogged with sludge, and often result in catastrophic failure of the engine. An unknown number of Intrepid owners have been affected. Fixes include changing to synthetic oil, inspection, and even engine replacement. During the Chrysler bankruptcy proceedings, there was concern among consumer advocate groups that Chrysler's proposed "free and clear" sale of assets to "New Chrysler" would allow the automaker to avoid liability for the oil sludge defect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Ditlow090521.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708002736/http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Ditlow090521.pdf |archive-date=2010-07-08 |df= }} Statement of [[Clarence Ditlow|Clarence M.

The '''Dodge Custom 880''' is an automobile that was marketed by [[Dodge]] from 1962 through the end of the 1965 [[model year]]. It was to fill Dodge's product offer in the mid-price full-size market segment, as well as to help fill the void in Chrysler's lineup left by the discontinuation of [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] in 1961.

==Origins==
The Custom 880 was developed to fill consumer demand for a full-size [[Dodge]] passenger car during the 1962 model year.

The 1962 Dodges introduced in the fall of 1961 had their origins in a rumor heard by a [[Chrysler]] executive that [[Chevrolet]] was planning to downsize their full-sized automobiles for the 1962 model year. Not wanting Chrysler to play catch-up, and wanting to beat Chevrolet at its own game, [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] and Dodge designs were placed in an emergency downsizing program that took the previously approved full-size designs and shrank them to smaller vehicles that would compete head-to-head with the rumored smaller Chevrolet.

But to Chrysler's shock and dismay, Chevrolet's 1962 full-size lineup emerged slightly ''larger'' than the 1961 models, with the mid-range [[Chevrolet Bel Air]] (on a {{convert|119|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase) growing a {{convert|.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} longer in its body, although the car weighed {{convert|45|lb|kg|abbr=on}} less than its 1961 predecessor. The rumored "small Chevrolet" turned out to be the new [[GM X platform (RWD)|GM "X" body]] [[Chevy II]] compact, which was intended to bolster Chevy's position where the [[Chevrolet Corvair|Corvair]] had faltered in that segment of the market. 
[[File:1964 Dodge Custom 880 convertible (5200724701).jpg|thumb|left|1964 Dodge Custom 880 convertible]]
The "full-size" [[Dodge Polara]] and [[Dodge Dart|Dart]] that emerged for 1962 were built on a {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}} shorter ({{convert|116|in|mm|abbr=on}}) wheelbase and were {{convert|7|in|mm|abbr=on}} shorter overall than the comparable Chevrolet, placing Dodge in the precarious position with consumers of not offering a true full-sized automobile. [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] also brought their new intermediate- or mid-size [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)#Fourth generation (1962–1965)|Ford Fairlane]] and [[Mercury Meteor#1962–1963 Mercury Meteor|Mercury Meteor]] to market for 1962 with a {{convert|115|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase ({{convert|116.1|in|mm|abbr=on}} on all Meteors but wagons). They were roughly the same size as the new standard-size Dodges, which made the new Mopars intermediates by default. The [[Rambler Classic|AMC Rambler]] was also similarly sized and was introduced to North America in 1961.

Compounding the size issue were the designs themselves, which did not translate well from their full-size origins to what amounted to intermediate size. The proposed curved side glass was deleted in favor of flat glass, which did not match the curve of the body sides. They also reduced the total glass area, which made the cars look smaller.

An unpopular design for the second year in a row, the 1961 models had awkward-looking "reversed" tailfins and a pinched grille, among other unusual features.  This combined with the cars' smaller overall size threatened Dodge's viability enough that Chrysler was forced to move immediately to stem Dodge's financial and market share losses.

==Model years==

===1962===
[[File:62 Dodge Custom 880 (7444782922).jpg|thumb|1962 Dodge Custom 880]]
Without lead time sufficient to develop an all new full-sized Dodge, Chrysler approved the sharing of the full-size body used by the [[Chrysler Newport]] and the non-letter [[Chrysler 300|300]] series. The models were differentiated by mating a modified 1961 Dodge Polara front clip to the Newport's defined rear quarter panels and passenger compartment. This body sharing allowed Dodge to launch the car in January 1962. It was fitted with a {{convert|361|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|265|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} V8 engine from the [[Chrysler B engine|B family]];&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Popular Science|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DSEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=Detroit+Report+Devon+Francis+Dodge:An+advance+peek+at+Chrysler+Corp.+cars |title=Detroit Report | first=Devon |last=Francis |page=50 |date=September 1962 |volume=181 |issue=3 |accessdate=2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; there were no optional engines.

The only visible cue at the front of the car that was different from the 1961 Dodge was the addition of Dodge’s new three-pointed "Fratzog" emblem in place of the stylized star bar from the 1961 Polara. From the rear, the 1962 Custom 880 was identical to the Chrysler Newport except for Dodge badging.

The model name '''Custom 880''' was derived from Dodge’s numerical sub-model naming structure that was also used on the Dart and sportier models of the Polara, although the model designation was not physically present on the car. Only "Dodge" badges on the rear quarter panels and decklid of the car were applied. A six-way power seat was optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1962_Dodge/1962_Dodge_880_Brochure/1962%20Dodge%20880-06.html |title=1962 Dodge 880 brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the short 1962 run, the Custom 880 was available as a four-door sedan, two- or four-door hardtop, a two-door convertible, as well as in six- or nine-passenger station wagons that featured the Chrysler [[hardtop]] (no center or B-pillar) body design.

Custom 880 production totaled 17,500 for the 1962 model year.

===1963===
[[File:1963 Dodge 880 station wagon at 2015 Macungie show 2of3.jpg|thumb|right|1963 Dodge 880 station wagon]]

For 1963, the Custom 880 series included a new base model, simply named  the '''880''', available only as a pillared four-door sedan or a station wagon. Chrysler-branded cars were redesigned for 1963, leaving the 880's body unique to Dodge, although the car was still produced alongside the now totally different Chrysler. There was also an optional engine, the {{convert|305|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} {{convert|361|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} two-barrel V8.

In what must have been near-record time, Dodge designers created an entirely new look for the car ahead of the cowl, fronted by a new convex grille in the shape of a very long oval, which shared visual similarities with the AMC Rambler. Straighter front fenders flanked a hood with a depressed central section featuring the Dodge name in block letters above the grille. Designers cleverly integrated the new Chrysler's front bumper into the design as well.

At the rear there was less change, although the car received restyled [[Automotive lighting|taillights]]. Set in heavy chromed housings, they were mounted to the carryover quarter panels and imparted a Dodge familial appearance to the rear, as one of Dodge's styling hallmarks of the time was round taillights.

The new base-model 880 station wagons utilized the pillared body in both six- and nine-passenger models, while the Custom-series wagons featured the pillarless hardtop design. With Chrysler no longer using the body and its interior trim elements, Custom 880s were better appointed than they had been during the 1962 model year.

A total of 28,200 vehicles were produced for 1963, of which 5,600 were station wagons.

===1964===

The 880 and Custom 880 received their most significant and final redesign of the 1960 body for 1964. This time, the rear body contours were squared up somewhat, with new decklids, wraparound rectangular taillights, and new quarter panels. Four-door models received a new roofline, although this was actually the same as had been used on the [[Chrysler New Yorker]] until 1962. Regardless, it did impart a fresh appearance. The grille was also updated, this time featuring a concave design with a central horizontal break spanning the distance between the [[Headlamp|headlights]].

Custom 880s received stainless steel rocker panel trim, foam-padded seats, and a grooved [[stainless steel]] panel that spanned the distance between the taillights. The Customs, as the top of the 880 line, also received better interior appointments than the base models. The engines remained as they had been in 1963.

Because of tooling expenses, station wagon bodies — which were also shared with Chrysler models — did not receive all of the changes applied to non-wagon models. Most notably, wagons continued to feature the heavy rear horizontal blade stamping first seen on the 1961 [[Plymouth automobile|Plymouth]] wagons. The station wagons continued in both pillared (880) and hardtop (Custom 880) models, although this would be the final year for the hardtop wagon — Dodge and Chrysler being the last American automotive brands to offer the style. Station wagons also received rectangular taillights that wrapped around the sides of the vehicle.

All 880s and Custom 880s received a revised instrument cluster layout, replacing the previous design which had been in use with little change since 1961. An oil pressure gauge was standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1964_Dodge/1964_Dodge_880_Brochure/1964%20Dodge%20880-05.html |title=1964 Dodge 880 brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Front leg room was 41.9 inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1964_Dodge/1964_Dodge_880_Brochure/1964%20Dodge%20880-16.html |title=1964 Dodge 880 brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 880 and Custom 880 received favorable press reviews, especially for their redesign. Sales for 1964 totaled 31,800 vehicles, a record for the model.

===1965===
The 1965 model year cars were the first that fully incorporated [[Elwood Engel]]'s influence on Chrysler's corporate overall design themes, although he had joined the company in 1961. Gone were the relatively extreme curves and angles that were a legacy from the final [[Virgil Exner]]-styled cars. Engel's design philosophy, which was encouraged by Chrysler chairman [[Lynn Townsend]], took Chrysler's products in the direction of rectilinear geometric angles; rectangular and trapezoidal shapes dominated Dodge's fullsize designs for the year.

The introductions of the 1965 models also allowed Chrysler to rectify its 1962 mistake and reintroduced a full-sized [[Dodge Polara]] to the public. The "new" Polara took the position formerly held by the 880, with the Custom 880 taking the top trim level. The luxurious new [[Dodge Monaco]], which was available only as a two-door hardtop, was the top-of-the-line model produced by Dodge in 1965 and was designed to compete against the [[Ford LTD (Americas)|Ford Galaxie 500 LTD]] and [[Chevrolet Caprice]], both new top-line luxury models for 1965. An AM/FM radio and a 7-position tilt steering wheel were optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/new/171110/1965%20Dodge%20Full%20Line/1965%20Dodge%20Full%20Line-25.html |title=1965 Dodge full line brochure |page=25 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/new/171110/1965%20Dodge%20Full%20Line/1965%20Dodge%20Full%20Line-24.html |title=1965 Dodge full line brochure |page=24 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All big Dodges, 880, Monaco, and Polara, now featured the same body and styling. Gone was the 1961 Chrysler design. All Custom 880s came with the standard features found in the Polara and added foam-padded seats and stainless steel window frames on station wagons and sedans. Hardtops and convertibles featured all-vinyl interiors. Custom 880s also featured a pillared six-window "town sedan" body that was unavailable in the Polara series. The series also featured the first Dodge-brand "wood" trimmed station wagon since the early 1950s, a look achieved through the use of [[DI-NOC]] appliqué framed in stainless steel trim. A total of 23,700 Custom 880s, all with V8 engines, were built during the model year.

The 361 V8 was replaced by a {{convert|270|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version of the 383. The more powerful version of the 383 received a four-barrel carburetor for {{convert|315|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. There was also an optional {{convert|340|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|413|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler B engine#413|''RB'']] V8, and at the top of the line the {{convert|365|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|426|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler B engine#426 Wedge|Wedge]] V8, also available with a four-speed manual transmission.

==End of the line==
Dodge discontinued the Custom 880 nameplate at the end of the 1965 model year in the United States. In an effort to move its top full-size series upscale for 1966, the division adopted the [[Dodge Monaco|Monaco]] name for all of the former Custom 880 models, with the exception of the six-window sedan, which was discontinued. The original Monaco hardtop added the '''500''' label for 1966, and was still promoted as a competitor to the [[Pontiac Grand Prix]].

==Production figures==
Combined Dodge 880 and Custom 880 annual production figures rounded to the nearest 100:

* 1962, 17,500
* 1963, 28,200
* 1964, 31,800
* 1965, 23,700
* Total: 101,200

The '''Dodge WC-54, Ambulance, {{fraction|3|4}}-ton, 4 x 4''', ([[List of U.S. Army weapons by supply catalog designation|SNL supply catalog]]
[[List of U.S. military vehicles by supply catalog designation#G500_to_G599|designation '''G-502''']]), was a variant of the [[Dodge WC series]] light 4×4 trucks, developed during World War II. Built from 1942 to 1945, they served as the U.S. Army's main [[ambulance]], with some used as late as 1953 during the [[Korean War]] by the [[U.S. Army Medical Corps]], and others serving as late as the 1960s in the armies of some European countries. 

==Design and production==
The WC-54 was designed to replace the earlier 1/2-ton, 4×4, G-505 models WC-9, WC-18, and WC-27 Dodge Ambulance trucks.&lt;ref name=dodgewc54com/&gt;
Although based on the 3/4-ton Dodge "Beep" chassis, which front and rear axles featured wider tracks of {{convert|64+3/4|in|m|2|abbr=on}}, the 3/4-ton ambulance versions retained a longer wheelbase, close to that of the previous half-tonners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://ia802508.us.archive.org/29/items/TM9-2800/TM9-2800.pdf |title=TM 9-2800 – Standard Military Motor Vehicles |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |publisher=U.S. War Department |date=1 September 1943 |location=Washington |work=Technical Manual |pages=356-357 |ref=TM9280043}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as adjusted suspension to make their ride softer. 
[[File:Dodge WC-27 Ambulance 02 (cropped).JPG|thumb|left|The body of the 1/2-ton WC-27 (pictured) was largely carried over on the 3/4-ton WC-54.]]
The closed sheet-metal body was made by Wayne Body works. It had room for a driver and four to seven patients plus a medic. If the fold-away bunk stretchers were used, four patients could be transported lying down.&lt;ref name=dodgewc54com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dodgewc54.com/ |title=Dodge WC54 Ambulance |publisher=Dodgewc54.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because of its intended role, the WC-54 featured a large matrix cab heater fitted on the [[Firewall (construction)#Firewalls outside of building construction|firewall]], providing comfort for patients and crew. It was fitted with a foldaway step to its rear to allow easier access for stretcher bearers and injured personnel. Early models featured a stuck out fuel filler cap which was changed to a recessed one in the later model, a modification that was retrofitted to some early model trucks.

From 1942 to 1945, total production of the 3/4-ton Dodge WC-series was some 250,000. Of these, 29,502 were ambulances — 26,002 WC-54 and 3,500 WC-64 KD models.&lt;ref name=SRATAM4045&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |editor=Chief of Ordnance Office |editor2=[[Military Vehicle Preservation Association]] |title=Summary Report of Acceptances, Tank-Automotive Materiel, 1940-1945 (Revision) |url= |location=Detroit |publisher=U.S. Army Service Forces, Office: Chief of Ordnance-Detroit, Production Division, Requirements and Progress Branch |publication-date=December 1945 |date=2010 |lay-source= |lay-date= |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Benedict |first=Chris |date=July 1979 |title=Dodge 3/4 Ton 4X4 And 1½ Ton 6X6 Production, 1942–1945 |magazine=Army Motors magazine |location= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicles were supplied under US government contracts W398-QM-11420 (850 examples), W398-QM-11422 (9945 examples), DAW398-QM-448 (16 examples), W398-QM-13596 (410 examples) and W374-ORD-2864 (11,636 examples).&lt;ref name=dodgewc54com/&gt;

Virtually unchanged for three years, apart from minor technical tweaks, it was replaced by a [[knockdown kit|knock-down body]] version, the WC-64 KD. Based on essentially the same chassis as the WC-54, the rear ambulance boxes were split in two major parts: lower and upper, designed to increase the number of vehicles that could be shipped at the same time. The lower part of the ambulance body was attached to the chassis at the factory, while the upper box was crated for installation in the field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wc64.com/technical.htm Dodge WC64KD Ambulance – Technical]&lt;/ref&gt; Only produced in 1945, just 3,500 of these were made before the war ended.&lt;ref name=SRATAM4045/&gt; The "knocked-down" condition was so much more space-efficient, that two ambulances could now be stacked, and shipped in the same space that would previously hold only one conventional WC-54 ambulance. Additionally, the reduced size also allowed air transportation of the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinodesign.nl/dodge/history.htm |title=Dodge WC64KD History |publisher=Pinodesign.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''K-50 telephone repair trucks''' were used by the [[U.S. Army]] [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]], during and after [[World War II]], for the installation and repair of hard telephone lines, primarily in territories liberated from Nazi Germany by the Allied forces.

==History==
The Signal Corps, at the beginning of World War II needed a light telephone repair truck, and contracted initially with [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]]-[[Chevrolet]], and later with [[Dodge]] / [[Fargo Trucks|Fargo]],&lt;ref name=SRATAM4045&gt;{{cite book |ref=SRATAM4045| author=&lt;!--Unnamed staff writers.--&gt; |editor=Chief of Ordnance Office |editor2=[[Military Vehicle Preservation Association]] |title=Summary Report of Acceptances, Tank-Automotive Materiel, 1940-1945 (Revision) |url= |location=Detroit |publisher=U.S. Army Service Forces, Office: Chief of Ordnance-Detroit, Production Division, Requirements and Progress Branch |publication-date=December 1945 |date=2010 |pages=62,63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for truck chassis to mount a standard [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph]] tool box bed. The original bed was styled after the [[Streamline Moderne]] motif of the 1930s. The second style bed, the '''K-50B''', was a more utilitairian square box, that mounted the ladder on the top rather than on the side. It was often used in conjunction with the [[K-38 trailer]]. All were eventually replaced by the [[Dodge M37]] series V-41 trucks.
[[File:WC43-01.jpg|thumb|left|Half-ton Dodge K-50 truck (1942)]]
The initial trucks were 1/2-ton, rear-wheel driven GMC-Chevrolet units, supplied under two contracts, in 1940 and 1941 respectively. All later K-50 and K-50B trucks were 1/2-ton and 3/4-ton units, contracted from Dodge / Fargo, from 1941 until war's end. Except for two initial rear-wheel drive evaluation units, all Dodges contracted were four-wheel drive.&lt;ref name=SRATAM4045/&gt;

The '''37&amp;nbsp;mm Gun Motor Carriage M6''', also known as '''M6 Fargo''', and under the manufacturer (Dodge)'s designation '''WC55''', was a modified [[Dodge WC series#WC55|Dodge WC52]] light truck mounting a light anti-tank gun. It was used by the [[United States Army]] for infantry support and as a [[tank destroyer|mobile anti-tank gun]]. It operated from late 1942 to January 1945 in the Mediterranean, [[Western Front (World War II)|European]], and Pacific theaters of [[World War II]]. The M6 saw limited use during the war, and was poorly suited to modern warfare as it was unarmored and was armed with a too small caliber gun. Being required to back into firing positions rather than forward firing proved to be a deficiency.

==Description==
[[File:Dodge WC-55 M6 Gun Motor Carriage Top schematic from TM9-808.jpg|{{largethumb}}|left|M6 WC-55 top schematic]]
The 37&amp;nbsp;mm Gun Motor Carriage (GMC) M6 was a modified 3/4-ton 4x4 [[Dodge WC series#WC52|Dodge WC52]] truck with a rear-facing [[37mm Gun M3|37&amp;nbsp;mm M3 gun]] mounted in its bed (''[[portee]]'') and designated WC55. The gun was normally fired to the rear — it could not be fully depressed when pointed to the front of the vehicle due to blast effects on the crew and vehicle windshield. The gun fired M74 Armor Piercing (AP) Shot&lt;!--'ap shot' is basically a solid round, whereas 'ap shell' is a casing filled with explosive; they are mutually exclusive!--&gt; that could penetrate {{convert|1.4|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} of armor at {{convert|500|yd|m|abbr=on}}. Other ammunition carried throughout its service life included the Armor Piercing Capped (APC) M51 Projectile (which could penetrate {{convert|2.4|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} of armor at 500&amp;nbsp;yd), and the High Explosive (HE) M63 Projectile. Eighty rounds of 37&amp;nbsp;mm ammunition were carried aboard.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Ian V. (introduction), ''The American Arsenal'', page 45. Mechanicsburg: Stackpole Books, 2001. (This is a reprint of the U.S. War Department ''Ordnance Standard Catalog.'' with other reference data for the GMC M6 as well.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The crew-members were equipped with personal weapons for self-defense.

==Service==
[[File:M6-37mm-GMC.jpg|thumb|Second Army Tennessee Maneuvers — to increase firepower, a 50 cal. machine gun was mounted on the front of the 37mm gun truck (June 1943).]]
With the design standardized in February 1942, 5,380 GMC 37&amp;nbsp;mm M6 GMC were built between April and October, 1942, at a cost of $4,265 per unit.&lt;ref&gt;Zaloga, (1996) page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; American doctrine planned for tank destroyers to defend against enemy tank attacks while tanks were used principally to support infantry. The 37&amp;nbsp;mm GMC M6 saw limited employment with U.S. forces (the [[601st Tank Destroyer Battalion|601st]] and [[701st Tank Destroyer Battalion|701st]] [[Tank destroyer battalion (United States)|Tank Destroyer Battalions]]) during the [[Tunisia Campaign|campaign in Tunisia]] in late 1942 and early 1943. The vehicle was not well liked because it lacked [[Vehicle armour|armor]] and carried an [[anti-tank gun]] that was largely ineffective against German tanks of the period. The 37&amp;nbsp;mm GMC M6 also saw limited use in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]] in 1943 and 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Zaloga (1996) pp 4, 64.&lt;/ref&gt; They equipped some Marine units, but were withdrawn before seeing combat. The 37&amp;nbsp;mm GMC M6 was soon classified as "limited standard" in September 1943, because of the availability of more powerful tank destroyers mounting {{convert|75|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} and {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns. In January 1945, the GMC M6 was declared obsolete.

After the Tunisian campaign, many M6 Fargos had their 37&amp;nbsp;mm gun removed and reverted to a cargo truck role as the ([[Dodge WC series#WC52|WC52]]). Some of these 37&amp;nbsp;mm guns were mounted onto halftracks to provide the [[Mechanized infantry|armored infantry]] with a gun halftrack.&lt;ref&gt;Zaloga, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Other 37&amp;nbsp;mm GMC M6 vehicles found their way into service with the [[French Army]], and were later provided to [[French Forces of the Interior]] units after the liberation of France.&lt;ref&gt;Zaloga, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the vehicle's obvious limitations on the battlefields of [[Western Front (World War II)|Northwest Europe 1944–1945]], the FFI used practically any vehicle they could obtain because of equipment shortages of all kinds.

The '''Dodge Brisa''' was a car model produced by the [[Venezuela]]n manufacturer [[:de:MMC Automotriz|MMC Automotriz]], between 2002 and 2009. It had two generations and they were [[Badge engineering|rebadged]] versions of two different [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]] models, under the strategic [[Hyundai Motor Company#Business|alliance]] between [[DaimlerChrysler]] and the South Korean manufacturer.

==Overview==

===First generation===
{{main|Hyundai Accent}}
The first generation was introduced in 2002 in the Venezuelan market as a [[Badge-engineering|badge-engineered]] [[Hyundai Accent#X3|Hyundai Accent X3]]. The car was offered in saloon and coupé body styles. In consideration of a lack of sales, the production of the coupé version was discontinued in 2004. The saloon was in the model lineup as a three and a five-door model.

It was powered by a four-cylinder gasoline engine with a displacement of 1,341 cc, 12 valves and a maximum power of 82 [[Horsepower|hp]]. The curb weight of the vehicles was between 942 and 1410&amp;nbsp;kg.

===Second generation===
{{main|Hyundai Getz}}
The second generation was introduced in 2006, after poor sales of the first generation model. This generation was based on the [[Hyundai Getz]]. With the modern design, it mainly appealed to the young clientele. It was powered by a four-cylinder gasoline engine with a displacement of 1.3 litres and a maximum power of 81.5 [[Horsepower|hp]]. The curb weight was at 992&amp;nbsp;kg. As of summer 2009, the Dodge Brisa has been discontinued without a successor.

The '''Dodge Ramcharger''' was a large sport utility vehicle built by Dodge from 1974 to 1993, and based on a shortened-wheelbase version of the Dodge D Series/Ram pickup truck chassis. A Plymouth version, named the '''Plymouth Trail Duster''' and offered from 1974 to 1981, was Plymouth's only SUV. The Ramcharger was primarily produced as a two-door, four wheel drive vehicle although a two wheel drive version was available. As a full-size SUV, it competed with the [[Chevrolet K5 Blazer]] and the 1978–1996 [[Ford Bronco]]. It was powered by a Chrysler LA engine and the most common was the 318 in³ (5.2 L) and the 360 in³ (5.9 L) and in the early years, the big-block RB 440 in³ (7.2 L) engines powered the Ramcharger. It was discontinued at the end of the 1993 model year in North America. In Mexico, it continued to run that platform until 1996. Then brought back in from 1999-2001 as a 2 door Dodge Ramcharger with a '94-'01 Ram front end. Approximately 30,000 were produced and were all two-wheel drive. Engine choices were the 5.2 318 c.i. Magnum or the 5.9 360 c.i. Magnum.

During development, it was known as the "Rhino".&lt;ref&gt;Off-Road Adventures, June 2007: page 90&lt;/ref&gt; The Ramcharger and Trail Duster were built using a nine-inch (228.6&amp;nbsp;mm) shortened pickup [[Chrysler AD platform]] that was introduced for 1972. First available in four-wheel drive with a rear-wheel drive only version available starting in 1975. The 1974 through 1980 models came without a roof, with a dealer-installed fabric top, or an optional removable steel roof with a flip up rear tailgate window.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.automobilemag.com/features/collectible_classic/1210_collectible_classic_1974_1980_dodge_ramcharger/ |title=Collectible Classic: 1974-1980 Dodge  |date=25 September 2012 |first=Rusty |last=Blackwell |publisher=Automobile magazine |accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early 1974 year model differs from the others in that its door pillars are attached to the removable roof. The "half doors" were used up to the build date of 6-10-74, afterwards the roof was changed to use normal pickup style doors. Marketed as a basic utility vehicle, only the driver's seat was standard equipment with the passenger seat optional up to 1976. Also in 1974, the big block 440 V8 became an option, but turned out to be the only year with the option.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt; Also available was an insulated center console for keeping items cool when filled with ice.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt;

The Ramcharger was entered in [[rallying]] and placed first in the 1975 [[Sno*Drift]] event.

The vehicle was powered by the [[Chrysler LA engine|"LA" series Chrysler small block engines]], the most common being the {{convert|318|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]], with the optional {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]]. Also, available were the larger big-block "B" and "RB" wedge series {{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]] and [[Chrysler RB engine|B]] {{convert|440|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]] as additional options. In 1978 and 1979 the {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} output was increased to {{convert|256|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. In 1979, the {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}, was rated at {{convert|275|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.

The Ramcharger and Trail Duster followed the D-series pickup's 1981 redesign into the Ram and is considered the second generation. They had an egg crate-style grille which was used until the 1986 model year, when the front was redesigned to the crosshair grille that remains common on many Dodges today. In 1991, there were another batch of grill changes that lasted until 1993 when American Ramcharger production stopped. The generation two trucks had a few different trim and interior option levels, but not much changed over the years. These models had a non-removable welded steel top instead of the removable top. The Trail Duster was only available for one year with the Ram design and steel non-removable top, as it was dropped after the 1981 model year.

From 1981 through 1987, all models were carbureted, but in 1988, throttle-body fuel injection (TBI) was added to the 318 ci V8 engine. Fuel injection was added to the 360 ci V8 engine in 1989. Power output for the TBI 318 was {{convert|170|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|245|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. The 360 with TBI was rated at {{convert|193|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|285|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. In 1992, the multiport fuel injected Magnum 318 was the standard engine while the LA 360 with TBI was still offered as an option. In 1994, the Magnum 360 replaced the LA engine.

Many [[manual transmission]]s were offered throughout the years, starting with the A-230 three-speed and ending with the A-535 five-speed in 1992. The NP435 "granny gear" 4 speed was the most common in 4WD models, as well as the close ratio version, the NP445. In 1988 the clutch was converted from a mechanical linkage to a hydraulic system. [[Automatic transmission]] models had the Chrysler [[TorqueFlite#A727|Loadflite TF-727A]] or B until, in 1991, it was replaced with the [[TorqueFlite#A500|A-500]]/[[TorqueFlite#A518|A-518]] four-speed.

An all-wheel-drive NP-203 transfer case was standard until 1980, when it was replaced with the part-time NP-208. This was supplanted by the NP-241 in 1988. Axles were [[Dana 44]] front and 9¼" or 8 1/4" Chrysler corporate rear. AWD models (1973–1979) were equipped with the full-time version of the Dana 44 that had no provision for locking hubs and had a front wheel bearing design with a somewhat dubious reputation. In 1978 when the part-time 4WD system was introduced, the front Dana 44 was equipped with a more conventional front wheel bearing design and automatic locking hubs. Late in the 1984 model year the Dana 44 was switched to a CAD ([[Center Axle Disconnect]]) version. The CAD Dana 44 was vacuum actuated by a switch on the transfer case and powered by engine vacuum. The CAD Dana 44 was carried on until the end of Ramcharger production in 1994. The vacuum switch on the transfer case would occasionally fail and either leave the CAD engaged or not engage the CAD at all. Limited slip differentials were available for the 9¼" rear axle. The AWD versions used a 5 on 4½" wheel bolt circle and the part-time 4WD models used a 5 on 5½" bolt circle.  Two wheel drive models used the 5 on 4.5" wheel bolt circle and in 1985 changed to the 5 on 5.5" pattern.

The Ramcharger continued to be sold in Mexico and Canada until 1996, with minor running changes from the last version sold in the U.S. in 1994.

The new Ramcharger was produced in Mexico from 1998 for the 1999 model year, based on the same platform as the [[Dodge Ram]] pickup and sharing most of its componentry with the Ram as well.&lt;ref name=SS03&gt;{{cite book | ref = SS03 | title = Katalog Samochody Świata 2003 | trans-title = World Car Catalogue 2003 | editor-first = Eligiusz | editor-last = Mazur | publisher = Print Shops Prego - Polska Sp. z o.o. | location = Warsaw, Poland | page = 217 | date = 2002 | issn = 1234-8198 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It had also shared some of its parts and components with the third generation Chrysler minivans (Chrysler Town &amp; Country, Dodge Caravan/Plymouth Voyager) as well. It was only sold in Mexico where the previous generation Ramcharger had been successful. It was available in the ST, SLT, SLT Plus and Sport trim levels. Powered by the {{convert|318|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} or {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Magnum V8 engines and offered only in rear-wheel drive versions, it was discontinued after the 2001 model year.

One of the features of this generation was a small third row folding seat in the cargo area that faced sideways, making it less practical for long trips. The rear of the vehicle had looked very similar to the 1996-2000 model Chrysler minivans.

The '''Dodge Charger (B-body)''' is a [[mid-size]] [[automobile]] that was produced by [[Dodge]] from 1966 to 1978, and was based on the [[Chrysler B platform]].

==Origin==
[[File:1965-Dodge-Charger-II-Rear.jpg|thumb|right|1965 Dodge Charger II Show Car]]

During the early-1960s, automakers were exploring new ideas in the personal luxury and specialty car segments. Chrysler, fast to enter the specialty car market, selected their Dodge Division to enter the marketplace with a mid-size [[Chrysler B platform|B-bodied]] sporty car to fit between the "[[pony car]]" [[Ford Mustang]] and "[[personal luxury car|personal luxury]]" [[Ford Thunderbird]].&lt;ref name="severson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Severson|first=Aaron|title=Dodging the Issue: The Original Dodge Charger|url= http://ateupwithmotor.com/model-histories/dodge-charger-1966-1967/ |publisher=Ate Up With Motor |date=27 November 2007 |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intention was to create a fastback look while sharing as much existing company hardware as possible.&lt;ref name="severson"/&gt;

The [[Dodge Coronet|Coronet]]-based Charger that resulted"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rZgfAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=mid-1966+surprise+was+Dodge's+Coronet-based+Charger+fastback |page=415 |title=History of the American Auto |publisher=Publications International |year=2004 |isbn=9780785398745 |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced in mid-season of the 1966 [[model year]] "in retaliation to the [[Rambler Marlin]], Ford Mustang, and [[Plymouth Barracuda]]".  Style-wise it was "a complete departure from the Dodge's mainstream cars."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HbWtLLmV9lcC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=The+fastback+Charger+had+been+introduced+in+mid-season+of+1966+in+retaliation+to+the+AMC+Marlin,+Mustang+and |page=64 |title=Dodge dynamite! 60 years of Dodge muscle cars |first=Peter |last=Grist |publisher=Veloce |year=2007 |isbn=9781845841126 |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1965 Marlin, along with the  Charger that arrived during the 1966 model year, were "the two cars set the standard for radical fastback design in American mid-size automobiles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VE1WAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Dodge+Charger,+arrived+in+the+'66+model+year,+and+the+two+cars+set+the+standard+for+radical+fastback+design+in |journal=Cars and Parts |volume=36 |page=20 |title=Fish story: AMC's Marlin |date=June 1993 |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Richard M. Langworth]], "because it was an intermediate like the Rambler Marlin, the Charger could have been an aesthetic disaster, but long side windows prevented its sweeping roof from looking too heavy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6jpVtX9Epi4C&amp;q=Because+it+was+an+intermediate+like+the+Rambler+Marlin,+the+Charger+could+have+been+an+esthetic+disaster,+but+long+side |page=154 |title=Complete Book of Collectible Cars: 70 Years of Blue Chip Auto Investments 1930-2000 |first=Richard M. |last=Langworth |publisher=Publications International |year=2000 |isbn=9780785343134 |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burt Bouwkamp, Chief Engineer for Dodge during the 1960s and one of the men behind the Dodge Charger, related his experience during a speech in July 2004.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Lynn Townsend was at odds with the Dodge Dealers and wanted to do something to please them. So in 1965 he asked me to come to his office - for the second time. He noted that one of the Dodge Dealer Council requests was for a Barracuda type vehicle. The overall dealer product recommendation theme was the same - we want what Plymouth has. The specific request for a Mustang type vehicle was not as controversial to Lynn. His direction to me was to give them a specialty car but he said 'for God's sake don't make it a derivative of the [[Plymouth Barracuda|Barracuda]]': i.e. don't make it a Barracuda competitor.

So the 1966 Charger was born.

"We built a Charger 'idea' car which we displayed at auto shows in 1965 to stimulate market interest in the concept. It was the approved design but we told the press and auto show attendees that it was just an "idea" and that we would build it if they liked it. It was pre-ordained that they would like it."

===1966===
The Charger made its debut in mid-1966.  Sharing its chassis and front-end sheet-metal with the mid-sized [[Dodge Coronet|Coronet]], the Charger "still looked a lot like a Coronet or AMC’s conceptually similar [[Rambler Marlin]] ... [and] substantially more expensive than either.&lt;ref name="severson"/&gt; The Charger with a $3,100 base price "was immediately paired up in the automotive press with American Motors' year-old Marlin, another fastback specialty machine that came in at around $2,850" and some called the Charger "a good-looking Marlin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6zSfB-ph6yYC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=up+in+the+automotive+press+with+American+Motors'+year-old+Marlin,+another+fastback+specialty |pages=91–92 |title=The complete book of Dodge and Plymouth muscle |first=Mike |last=Mueller |publisher=Motorbooks |year=2009 |isbn=9780760330791 |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charger's interior was different from all other cars with its pseudo-bucket back seats folded down to interior space accessible via the rear hatch.&lt;ref name="Holder-42"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1sh3KnKIgIwC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=The+Charger+didn't+begin+with+the+performance/+muscle+car+image,+though+you+could+get+a+Hemi+with+it |page=42 |title=Chrysler muscle: Detroit's mightiest machines |first=William G. |last=Holder |first2=Phillip |last2=Kunz |publisher=Krause Publications |year=2003 |isbn=9780873496339|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Charger didn't begin with the performance/ muscle car image, though you could get a Hemi with it."&lt;ref name="Holder-42"/&gt; The Charger evolved into possibly the top Chrysler-made [[muscle car]].&lt;ref name="Holder-42"/&gt;

On January 1, 1966, viewers of the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] were first introduced to the new "Leader of the Dodge Rebellion", the 1966 Charger. The Charger's debut also followed by a half model year the introduction of a new street version of the {{convert|426|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler Hemi engine]]. With the Charger, Dodge had a new model to build a performance image to go along with this engine.

Designed by Carl "CAM" Cameron, the Charger introduced a [[fastback]] roofline and pot-metal "electric shaver" grille, complete with fully rotating headlights, a feature not seen on a Chrysler product since the 1942 [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]]. In the rear the fastback design ended over a full-width six-lamp taillight with chromed "CHARGER" lettering.

[[File:66ChargerDash2.jpg|thumb|left|1966 Charger instrument panel]]
Inside, the standard Charger featured a simulated wood-grain steering wheel, four individual [[bucket seat]]s with a full length [[Center console (automobile)|console]] from front to rear. The rear seats and rear center armrest pad also folded forward while the trunk divider dropped back, which allowed for generous cargo room.&lt;ref name="genat"&gt;{{cite book|last=Genat |first=Robert |first2=David |last2=Newhardt |title=Mopar Muscle: Fifty Years |year=2004 |publisher=MBI Publishing |isbn=978-0-7603-2016-7 |pages=115–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous interior features were exclusive to the Charger including door panels, courtesy lights, as well as premium trim and vinyl upholstery. The instrument panel did not use regular bulbs to light the gauges, but rather [[electroluminescence]] lit the four chrome-ringed circular dash pods, needles, radio, shifter-position indicator in the console, as well as clock and air conditioning controls if equipped. The dash housed a 0 to 6000 rpm [[tachometer]], a 0 to {{convert|150|mph|abbr=on}} [[speedometer]], as well as alternator, fuel, and temperature gauges as standard equipment.&lt;ref name="genat"/&gt;

Engine selections consisted of only [[V8 engine|V8s]]. 1966 transmissions included a three-speed steering-column mounted manual with the base engine, a console mounted four-speed manual, or three-speed automatic. In 1966, four engines were offered: the base-model {{convert|318|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} 2-barrel, the {{convert|361|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} 2-barrel, the {{convert|383|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} 4-barrel, and the new [[Chrysler Hemi engine|426 Street Hemi]]. Only 468 Chargers were built with the 426.&lt;ref name="mueller"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mueller |first=Mike |title=Musclecar Icons |year=2003 |publisher=MBI Publishing |isbn=978-0-7603-1773-0 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=u38tuOjjkwAC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=1966+Dodge+Charger+ho-hum |page=262 |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Total production in 1966 came to 37,344 units for the mid-model year introduction.

[[File:66ChargerSpoiler.JPG|thumb|1967 Charger NASCAR Spoiler]]
In 1966, Dodge took the Charger into [[NASCAR]] in hopes that the fastback would make their car a winner on the high-banks. However the car proved difficult to handle on the faster tracks because its body generated [[Lift (force)|lift]]. Drivers would later claim that "it was like driving on ice." To solve this problem Dodge installed a small lip [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] on the trunk lid that improved traction at speeds above {{convert|150|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. This was made a dealer-installed option in late-1966 and in 1967 because of NASCAR rules, making the '66 Charger the first U.S. production vehicle to offer a spoiler. (Small [[quarter panel]] extensions were added in 1967.) The addition of the spoiler helped [[David Pearson (NASCAR driver)|David Pearson]], driving the #6 [[Cotton Owens]]-prepared Dodge cars, to win the NASCAR Grand National championship in 1966 with 15 first-place finishes, though only one, the Capital City 300 in Richmond, VA, was achieved using the Charger&lt;ref&gt;https://www.racing-reference.info/season-stats/1966/W/&lt;/ref&gt;

===1967===
The 1967 model year Charger received minor changes. Outside, new fender-mounted turn signals were introduced and this would serve as the main external identifier between a 1966 and 1967 Charger. A [[vinyl roof]] became available. Inside, the full length console was eliminated to satisfy customer complaints about the difficulty for entry and exit from the back seats. It was replaced with a regular sized console. Bucket seats were standard, but a folding armrest/seat and column shifter was an option allowing three people to sit up front.

The [[Chrysler RB engine#440|440 "Magnum"]] was added and the {{convert|361|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 was replaced by a {{convert|383|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine. The 440 was rated at {{convert|375|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} with a single 4-barrel carburetor. The 318 two-barrel "LA" [[Chrysler LA engine]] was now the base engine with wedge-shaped combustion chambers, unlike the previous 1966 polyspherical (or "poly") design, it was rated at {{convert|230|bhp|kW|abbr=on}}. The 383 4-barrel rated at {{convert|325|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} and the 426 Street Hemi rated at {{convert|425|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} remained as options. A mere 27 Chargers were built with the 426 engine.&lt;ref name="mueller"/&gt;

Sales of the 1967 Chargers dropped to half of the previous introductory half-year with a total of 15,788 units.&lt;ref name="67sales"&gt;{{cite web|title=1967 Dodge Charger Sales|url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1966-1967-dodge-charger11.htm |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |date=16 October 2007 |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to automotive historian Patrick Foster, both the AMC Marlin and the very similar looking first generation Dodge Charger "flopped on the market as sporty car buyers were showing their preference for compact pony cars."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=qwUpAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Marlin+Charger+flopped+on+the+market+as+sporty+car+buyers+were+showing+their+preference+for+compact+pony+cars |page=111 |title=American Motors, the last independent |first=Patrick R. |last=Foster |publisher=Krause Publications |year=1993 |isbn=9780873412407 |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1968===
[[Image:1968 Dodge Charger R-T - Flickr - Highway Patrol Images.jpg|thumb|left|1968 black Dodge Charger]]
The entire B-body lineup for the 1968 model year was redesigned and the Charger was further differentiated from the [[Dodge Coronet]] models. The first generation's efforts to look somewhat posh were abandoned in favor of designer Richard Sias' double-diamond [[coke bottle styling|coke bottle]] profile, with curves around the front fenders and rear quarter panels. Front and rear end sheet metal was designed by Harvey J. Winn. The rear end featured a "kick up" spoiler appearance, inspired by Group 7 racing vehicles. The fastback roof was gone, in favor of  a "flying buttress" similar to that of the [[Pontiac GTO#1966|1966-67 Pontiac GTO]]. The Charger retained its full-width hidden headlight grille, but a vacuum operated cover replaced the electric motor rotating headlights. The previous full-width taillights were replaced with dual circular units at the direction of Styling Vice President, Elwood P. Engel. Dual scallops were added to the doors and hood.

Inside, numerous "downscalings" were evident.  A conventional fixed rear seat replaced the folding bucket seat design. The conventional trunk area included a vinyl mat, rather than the previous model's carpeted cargo area. The center console in the front remained, but there was no center armrest. The tachometer was now optional instead of standard and the electroluminescent gauges disappeared in favor of a conventional design.

Even the model's engine options ended up reduced midyear, when the standard {{convert|318|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} 2-bbl V8,  was replaced with Chrysler's basic {{convert|225|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} slant-six. The 383-2 and 383-4 remained unchanged.

;R/T
[[Image:Dodge Charger RT 1968.Heck.jpg|thumb|upright|left|1968 Dodge Charger R/T]]
A new high-performance package was added, the [[R/T]] ("Road/Track", with no 'and' between the  two, as in the then highly influential, muscle car promoting [[Road &amp; Track]] magazine). The R/T came standard with the previous year's [[Chrysler RB engine#440|440 "Magnum"]], with the 426 Hemi optional.

In 1968, Chrysler Corporation began an ad campaign featuring a cartoon [[bee]] with an engine on its back promoting models called the "Scat Pack". The [[Dodge Coronet|Coronet R/T]], [[Dodge Super Bee|Super Bee]], [[Dodge Dart|Dart GTS]], and Charger R/T received bumble-bee stripes (of two thin stripes framing two thick ones). The stripes were standard on the R/Ts and came in red, white, or black, but could be deleted at no extra cost.

The 1968 film [[Bullitt]] helped popularize the Charger R/T for its notable car chase sequence alongside the titular character's [[Ford Mustang (first generation)#1967–1968|1968 Ford Mustang GT]] through the streets of San Francisco, which has been regarded as one of the most influential [[car chase]] scenes in movie history. In the film, a black Dodge Charger R/T 440 is chased by [[Steve McQueen]]'s Ford Mustang GT, jumping on the San Francisco slopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ponysite.de/charger_moviecar.htm|title=THE BULLITT CHARGER|last=Kohrn|first=Wolfgang|website=www.ponysite.de|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Movieclips|title=Bullitt (1968) - San Francisco Car Chase Scene (4/10) {{!}} Movieclips|date=2017-02-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no7XR7s8Z7o|accessdate=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The 1968 model year Charger sales increased to 96,100, including over 17,000 Charger R/Ts.

===1969===
[[File:1969 Dodge Charger R-T (5201374988).jpg|thumb|left|1969 Dodge Charger]]

The 1969 model year brought few modifications. Exterior changes included a new grille with a center divider and new longitudinal taillights, both designed by Harvey J. Winn. A new trim line called the Special Edition (SE) was added. This could be available by itself or together with the R/T, thus making an R/T-SE. The SE added leather inserts to the front seats only, chrome rocker moldings, a wood grain steering wheel, and wood grain inserts on the instrument panel. A sunroof was added to the option list, but was ordered on only 260 Chargers. The bumble bee stripes returned as well, but were changed slightly. Instead of four stripes, it now consisted of a wide stripe framed by two smaller stripes. In the middle of the stripe, an R/T cutout was placed. If the stripe was deleted, a metal R/T emblem was placed where the R/T cutout was. Total production was around 89,199 units.

There were two different 383 engines available for the 1969 model year: 2-barrel and 4-barrel.  The 2-barrel was rated at 290&amp;nbsp;hp. The four barrel engine was rated at 330&amp;nbsp;hp and was identified on the air cleaner as "383 / FOUR BARREL". The 330-hp engine was unique to the Charger model in 1969. While this engine was available with an un-silenced air cleaner option, it differed internally from the 335-hp 383 "Magnum". Differences between the 330-hp 383 4-barrel and 335-hp 383 magnum were mostly internal. Both versions used the Carter AVS carb and the larger exhaust manifolds from the 440 Magnum engines, but the Magnum had a windage tray in the oil pan, a different camshaft profile, and different valve springs. In 1969 the B-series engines were all painted Chrysler Engine Turquoise with the exception of the 4-barrel 383 four speed and 440 Magnum engines which were painted Chrysler "High-Performance Orange". As usual, the 426 Hemi was painted "Street Hemi Orange". The 383 Magnum motor was used in Road Runners and Super Bees, but did not appear in a Charger body until 1971.

[[File:Dodge Charger R-T (Centropolis Laval '10).jpg|thumb|Bo &amp; Luke Duke popularized the 1969 Dodge Charger in ''The Dukes of Hazzard'']]

The television series ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' (1979–1985) featured an orange 1969 Dodge Charger that was named ''[[General Lee (car)|The General Lee]]''. "The General" sported the Confederate battle flag painted on the roof and the words "GENERAL LEE" over each door. The windows were always open, as the doors were supposedly welded shut for racing, and the actors would do a window slide to get in and out. The number "01" is painted on both doors. Also, when the horn button was pressed, it played the first 12 notes from the ''de facto'' [[Confederate States]] anthem "[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]". The car performed spectacular jumps in almost every episode, and the show's popularity produced consumer interest in the car.

====Charger 500====
[[File:Dodge Charger 500 (Orange Julep).jpg|thumb|left|Dodge Charger 500]]

In 1968, the [[NASCAR]] inspired Charger R/T failed to beat the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] cars (the [[Ford Torino Talladega]] and the [[Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II]]) on the high-banks oval-tracks. Wind tunnel tests showed the tunneled rear window caused lift and the gaping mouth induced drag. As a result, Dodge made the rear window flush with the rest of the roof and put a 1968 Coronet grille in the front.

The original Charger 500 prototype was a 1968 Charger R/T with a 426 Hemi and automatic transmission. The prototype was painted in B5 Blue with a white stripe, as well as a white interior. The Charger 500 was one of three models introduced in September 1968. Standard engine was the 440 Magnum, but factory literature claims the 426 Hemi was standard. The Charger 500 had the Torqueflite standard and the same equipment standard as the R/T.

A total of 392 Charger 500s were made, of which only 67 had the 426 Hemi engine; 27 with a 4-speed and 40 with an automatic transmission.

====Charger Daytona====
{{Main|Dodge Charger Daytona}}
[[File:ChargerDaytona.jpg|thumb|right|Dodge Charger Daytona]]
Dodge was not satisfied with the results of the Charger 500. The car was not enough to beat the other aerocars on the NASCAR circuit. After months of research and development, including at the aftermarket shop, Creative Industries, the Dodge Charger Daytona was introduced on April 13, 1969. It quickly received over 1,000 orders.

Chrysler made many attempts at improving the aerodynamics of the 500 by adding noses rumored to be up to {{convert|23|in|mm|abbr=on}} long. The Charger Daytona finally received an {{convert|18|in|mm|abbr=on}} nose. The full size Charger Daytona was tested with an {{convert|18|in|mm|abbr=on}} nose at the Lockheed-Martin Georgia facility. The test was a success and the project was greenlighted. The nose piece was only part of the innovation. The Charger Daytona also received a {{convert|23|in|mm|abbr=on}} tall wing in rear. This wing was bolted through the rear quarter panels and into the rear subframe. Although proven to be less effective than shorter wing designs, the engineer responsible for the development of the wing, John Pointer, chose the tall design so the wing would be in "clean air" to help increase the car's overall speed. That the tall wing prevents interference with operation of the trunk lid can be considered a fortunate coincidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a29732/daytona-superbird-reason-for-wings/|title=The Real Reason the Dodge Charger Daytona's Wing Was So Huge|date=2016-06-27|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tall wing also helped out in another unintended way, by giving the car directional stability due to its deeply splinted sides.

The Charger Daytona engineering model was tested on the Chelsea, Michigan Chrysler Proving Grounds on July 20, 1969. Driven by Charlie Glotzbach and Buddy Baker, it was clocked at {{convert|205|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} with a small 4-bbl. carb. The Charger Daytona's nose made 1,200 pounds of downforce and the wing made 600 pounds of downforce. The Dodge styling department wanted to make changes to the Charger Daytona as soon as they saw it, but was told by Bob McCurry to back off; he wanted function over finesse.

The Charger Daytona introduced to the public had a fiberglass nose without real headlamps and a wing without streamlined fairings. The media and public loved the car, but were mystified by the reverse scoops on the front fenders. The PR representatives claimed it was for tire clearance. Actually, they reduced drag 3%.

The Charger Daytona came standard with the 440 Magnum Engine with {{convert|375|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|480|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque, A727 Torqueflite Automatic Transmission, and a 3.23 489 Case 8 3/4 Chrysler Differential. Optional was the 426 Hemi with {{convert|425|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|490|lb.ft|Nm|abbr=on}}. The 426 Hemi was also available with the no cost option of the A833 4-Speed Manual. Only 503 Charger Daytona's were produced as U.S. cars. (An additional 40 were for Canada), Of the 503 U.S. cars produced, 433 were 440 Magnum, 139 4-Speed and 294 Torqueflite; 70 were 426 Hemi power, 22 4-Speed and 48 Torqueflite.

In the end, the Daytona was brought down by the decision to make the 1970 [[Plymouth Superbird]] the only Chrysler winged car for the model year. While Daytonas were raced through the 1970 season, only one Daytona was raced until 1971 (in the 1971 Daytona 500) when NASCAR decreed that engine displacement of wing cars would be limited to {{convert|305|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}. That particular car, driven by [[Dick Brooks]], finished in seventh place.
The very first 1969 Charger Daytona was a hand build by the Chrysler engineers and was on display at the 1969 World fair in New York. After the fair ended the car went via a Dodge dealer lottery to a Dodge dealer in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. This is documented by Chrysler.

===1970===
[[File:'70 Dodge Charger (Auto classique St-Lambert '12 VAQ).jpg|thumb|350px|right|1970 Dodge Charger]]
The Charger was changed slightly for the 1970 model year. This was the last year of the 2nd generation Charger and featured a large wraparound chrome bumper and the grille was no longer divided in the middle. New electric headlight doors replaced the old vacuum style.  The taillights were similar to those used in 69, but 500 and R/T models came with a new more attractive taillight panel. On the R/T, new rear-facing scoops with the R/T logo were mounted on the front doors, over the door scallops. A new 440 or HEMI hood cutout made the option list for this year only.

Dodge painted the hood scallop inserts black and put the silver engine callouts on top. New "High Impact" colors were given names, such as Top Banana, Panther Pink,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pantherpink.com |title=Panther Pink, one of the wildest colors to ever come out of an American automobile company |publisher=pantherpink.com |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Interior changes included new high-back bucket seats, the door panels were also revised and the map pockets were now optional instead of standard. The ignition was moved from the dash to the steering column (as with all Chrysler products this year), and the glove box was now hinged at the bottom instead of the top as in 1968-69. The SE "Special Edition" trim option added luxury features and was available in as the 500 SE and R/T SE models. The all new pistol grip shifter was introduced, along with a bench seat, a first for the Charger since its debut.

A new engine option made the Charger's list for the first time, the 440 Six Pack. With three two-barrel carburetors and a rating of {{convert|390|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, it was one of the most exotic setups since the cross-ram [[Chrysler RB engine|Max Wedge]] engines of the early 1960s. The Six Pack was previously used on the mid-year 1969 Dodge Super Bee and [[Plymouth Road Runner]]. Despite this new engine, production slipped again to 46,576 mainly due to the new [[Chrysler E platform|E-body]] [[Dodge Challenger]] pony car, as well as rapidly increasing automobile insurance rates. In the 1970 NASCAR season, the 1970 Charger had ten wins, more than any other car, including the 1969 Dodge Charger Daytonas and Plymouth Superbirds, thus giving Bobby Isaac the Grand National Championship. Buddy Baker, driving the blue #88 Engineering Daytona, was the first and only legal car to run over 200&amp;nbsp;mph in 1970. That record lasted for over 13 years.

===1971===
The 1971 model year introduced the third generation Charger, characterized by a new split grille and more rounded "fuselage" bodystyle. The interiors were like those of the [[Chrysler E platform|E-body]] and were now shared by the Plymouth B-body, the Plymouth Satellite Sebring and Road Runner. The hidden headlights were now optional. A rear spoiler and a "Ramcharger" hood were new options. This hood featured a pop-up scoop mounted above the air cleaner controlled by a vacuum switch under the dash. On Plymouth Road Runners it was called the "Air Grabber" hood, and it was previously used on the Coronet R/T and Super Bee.

Dodge also merged its [[Dodge Coronet|Coronet]] and Charger lines. From 1971, all four-door B-bodies were badged as Coronets and all two-door B-bodies as Chargers. Thus for one year only, the [[Dodge Super Bee|Super Bee]] became part of the Charger lineup, after which it was discontinued. From 1971 to 1974, Charger models used the Coronet's VIN prefix of "W".

Several other models were carried over from 1970, including the 500, R/T, and SE. Sales of the R/T declined due in part to higher insurance costs and gasoline prices. A total of 63 [[Chrysler Hemi engine|Hemi]] RTs were built that year, marking its last appearance in any production car, and 2,659 with other engines. The 1971 model year was also the last for the 440 Six-Pack engine, which could still be mated to a ''Hurst'' 4-speed transmission, as well as the automatic. In the Super Bee's final year, the 340 became a $44 option over the standard, low-compression 383 .

The "Hi-Impact" colors were discontinued after the 1971 model year; with a 1971-only "Citron Yella".
[[File:Dodge Charger (Orange Julep '10).jpg|thumb|left|1972 Dodge Charger]]

===1972===
The 1972 Charger introduced a new "Rallye" option to replace the R/T version. The SE was differentiated from other 1972 Chargers by a unique formal roof treatment and hidden headlights. The 383 engine was replaced with a lower compression 4-barrel 400, while the 440 engine was still available, with lowered compression and downrated to net {{convert|280|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} instead of the previous {{convert|350|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} gross. The ratings went down as the net horsepower measure was more realistic. Also beginning in 1972, all engines featured hardened valve seats to permit the use of regular leaded or unleaded gasoline rather than leaded premium fuel as in past years due to tighter emissions regulations. Though the 440+6 (designating a triple 2-barrel carb setup and {{convert|310|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} was listed in the early 1972 sales literature, it was found in the August 1971 testing that this engine would not meet the new and more stringent 1972 emissions laws, although some early Dodge literature (August 1971 press) stated that this engine was available for 1972, and a few (six is the accepted number) factory installed six-pack Chargers were built, the engine was dropped out of production by September 1971.  The optional Pistol-Grip 4-speed [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] [[Manual transmission|manual]] shifter could be coupled to the 340, 400, and 440 Magnum engines. The ''Ramcharger'' hood scoop was discontinued, as well as optional lower geared performance rear axle ratios and extra heavy duty suspensions. It was also the final year for the Dana 60 differential, and was available only in combination with the 440/4 speed, heavy duty suspension, and the 3.54:1 rear axle ratio.

The only remaining "Hi-Impact" color choices were "Hemi Orange" (EV2) and "Top Banana" (FY1), the latter was available under different names through 1974.

===1973===
[[File:'73 Dodge Charger (Cruisin' At The Boardwalk '10).jpg|thumb|left|1973 Dodge Charger]]
[[File:1973 Dodge Charger SE opera windows.jpg|thumb|Unusual triple [[quarter window]] on 1973 Dodge Charger SE]]

For the 1973 model year, Chargers received new sheet metal (though at first glance only the rear roof "C-Pillars" looked different) and were in fact longer, wider, and slightly taller than the 1971-72 cars. Also new were vertically slatted taillights and new grilles. Hidden headlights were dropped, even as an option. The 318 was still standard, with the 340 (available only on the Rallye), 360 (2-barrel only), 400 (low power 2-barrel/single exhaust and high performance 4-barrel/dual exhaust) and 440 remaining as options. The SE models had a new roof treatment that had a "triple [[opera window]]" surrounded by a canopy-style vinyl roof. All other models had a new quarter window treatment, discontinuing its [[AMC Gremlin]]-style window in favor of a more conventional design. Total sales this year were around 108,000 units, the highest ever for the 1971-74 Charger generation, though more than 60 percent of the cars had the non-high performance engines. The 1973 Chargers, and all Chrysler products, were equipped with [[Bumper (car)#First standards 1971|5&amp;nbsp;mph bumpers]], front and rear.

===1974===
[[File:Dodge Charger ('10 Centropolis Laval).jpg|thumb|right|1974 Dodge Charger]]

The 1974 model year saw only minor changes that included new color choices, a softer grain pattern on interior surfaces, and a slight increase in the size of the rubber bumper tips. The 340 option was replaced with a 360 4-bbl as the small block performance engine. All other engine options remained the same, including the 360 2-bbl designated by a K in the fifth symbol in the [[vehicle identification number]]. Several performance rear end ratios, including a 3.23 "Sure Grip" rear end were still available. A four speed transmission was still an option except with the 440 engine.

In spite of the Charger no longer being perceived as a performance model sales rose as it veered towards being a [[personal luxury car]]. The muscle car era came to a close, with 1974 as the final year for performance options.

===NASCAR===

The 1971-74 Charger based cars were campaigned in [[NASCAR]], with [[Buddy Baker]], [[Bobby Isaac]], [[Dave Marcis]], and [[Richard Petty]] scoring several wins. Richard Petty won 35 races with this body style between 1972 and 1977 as NASCAR allowed the Chargers to run a few years longer than normal, as Chrysler did not have anything else to replace it.  A 1974 bodied Charger driven by [[Neil Bonnett]] scored Dodge's last NASCAR victory (until 2001) at the December 1977 [[Los Angeles Times 500]].  Richard Petty has proclaimed this body style as his favorite car that he ran during his career because it was balanced.

===1975===
[[File:Dodge Charger (Auto classique Laval '10).jpg|thumb|left|Dodge Charger]]
The 1975 model year had the Dodge Charger and Chrysler Cordoba share the same new body based on the [[Chrysler B platform|B platform]]. The Chrysler Cordoba had replaced the Plymouth Satellite Sebring.  The Charger SE (Special Edition) was the only model offered. It came with a wide variety engines from the {{convert|318|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} "LA" series small block V8 to three versions of {{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} big block V8. The standard engine was the {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} 2-bbl small block, along with the code E58 4-bbl and dual exhaust high performance version (225&amp;nbsp;hp) being available as an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charger|website=car.info|url=https://www.car.info/en-se/dodge/charger/charger-se-1975-16796485}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales in 1975 amounted to 30,812. Because of the extreme squareness of the bodystyle, NASCAR teams were forced to rely on the previous years (1974) sheet metal for race-spec cars. In order for Dodge to be represented, NASCAR allowed the 1974 sheet metal to be used until January 1978, when the new Dodge Magnum was ready for race use. In 1976 a Dodge Charger was one of two NASCAR stock cars to compete in the 24hrs at LeMans, having been modified with head-lamps, tail-lamps and windshield wipers. It was driven by Herschel and Doug McGriff and sponsored by Olympia Beer, earning the nickname "Oly Express"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Carmrades|title=Helpless Hulk - 1972 Dodge "Olympia" Charger NASCAR|author=Smit, Dylan|date=2016|url=https://www.carmrades-blog.com/all-articles/2016/9/23/helpless-hulk-1972-dodge-olympia-charger-nascar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1976===
The 1976 model year Charger range was expanded to four models; base, Charger Sport (formerly the [[Dodge Coronet]] 2-door model, which appeared for just the previous model year only), Charger SE and the Charger Daytona. The base and Sport models used a different body than the SE and Daytona, and were essentially a re-badging of what had been the 1975 Dodge Coronet 2-door models — and available with a {{convert|225|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Slant Six, which was not offered on the SE and Daytona. The Charger Daytona was introduced as an appearance package with either the 360 or 400 engine. Sales increased slightly to 65,900 units in 1976.

===1977===
In 1977, the Charger Sport (which dated back to the former Coronet 2-door, which had appeared for just the 1975 model year only) and the base Charger were dropped as this body style became part of the newly named B-body Monaco line, and only the Charger SE and Charger Daytona were offered. Estimated production was 30,367 units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/cars/production/dodge-US.html |title=Dodge Cars and Production Numbers, US |first=Gerard |last=Wilson |work=Allpar |accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1978===
In 1978, its final year as a B-Body, only 2,735 Chargers were produced. The [[Dodge_Magnum|Magnum]] replaced the Charger as Dodge's B-body personal luxury car this year, and the small number of Chargers produced were likely an effort to use up leftover 1977 bodies and parts.

The '''Dodge Neon SRT-4''' is a [[sport compact]] car manufactured by [[Dodge]] from 2003 to 2005. A [[turbocharged]] variant of the [[Chrysler Neon|Neon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/hot_lists/high_performance/american_performance/dodge_neon_srt_4_road_test |title=Dodge Neon SRT-4 - Road Test |publisher=Car And Driver |date=December 2002 |accessdate=September 29, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417062631/http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/hot_lists/high_performance/american_performance/dodge_neon_srt_4_road_test |archivedate=April 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the car was developed by [[DaimlerChrysler]]'s in house PVO (Performance Vehicle Operations) tuner group. PVO was officially renamed SRT ([[Street and Racing Technology]]) in 2004. The "4" in the SRT-4's name denotes the number of cylinders of the engine.&lt;ref name="autotropolis.com"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.autotropolis.com/wiki/index.php?title=SRT|first=Tony |last=Swan |title=Dodge Street &amp; Racing Technology (SRT) &amp;#124; SRT-4 &amp;#124; SRT-8 &amp;#124; SRT-10|publisher=Autotropolis.com|date=|accessdate= May 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACR (American Club Racing)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/sedans/0505_dodge_srt4_acr/index.html|title=2005 Dodge SRT4 ACR – Review &amp; Road Test |publisher=Automobilemag.com|date=April 11, 2005|accessdate=May 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Commemorative Edition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaehler|first=Justin|url=http://cars.ign.com/articles/620/620153p1.html|title=IGN: Commemorative Edition SRT|publisher=Cars.ign.com|date=May 27, 2005| accessdate=May 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; models were later introduced as well.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2009}}

In 1998, [[Tom Gale (designer)|Tom Gale]], (then Executive Vice President of Chrysler Product Development and Design), attended the 1998 [[Specialty Equipment Market Association]] (SEMA) Show in [[Las Vegas]]. Gale noted a list of performance features he saw on the sport compact cars at the show, and wanted to integrate those features into Chrysler's compact production car, the Dodge Neon. Gale was the design chief of the original [[Dodge Viper]] concept vehicle, and recognized an opportunity to build a [[sport compact]] that would appeal to the younger auto generation who grew up on [[Car tuning|tuner cars]], who may prefer a new car with the same performance appeal right off the showroom floor.

A group of young Dodge and Chrysler talent was assembled to put together a vehicle to meet Gale's request, with all of the team members sharing first-hand knowledge and familiarity of the existing Dodge Neon. They created a [[concept car]], the 2000 Neon SRT, in just 4 months, with a 2.0 L 16-valve four-cylinder topped with a 45-cubic-inch Eaton [[supercharger]], which produced {{convert|208|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|180|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque at the flywheel on {{convert|11|psi|bar|abbr=on}} of boost. (Sport Compact Car magazine tested the car in the Feb. 2001 issue and dynoed {{convert|179|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|149|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} torque at the wheels.)

The group put more than 1000 miles on the test track with the vehicle in under two weeks. In November 1999, the car was shown at the SEMA show with a glowing response. The vehicle was then shown at the [[Los Angeles Auto Show]] in January 2000, center stage on a turntable.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caranddriver.com/news/dodge-neon-srt-an-honorary-import-auto-shows&lt;/ref&gt; The team continued to work on the car, to try to bring it to the level of production vehicle, creating a second car using more production-oriented parts in an effort to lower the costs necessary to justify production. They even parked the second car in Gale's parking spot in order to get it noticed. Regardless, in fall of 2000, the executive committee rejected the production car proposal. The team put together a list of reasons why the car was not approved, and worked through the list item by item to find solutions to every issue presented. After three more versions of the car, the company's [[Specialty Vehicle Engineering]] (SVE) team took over the project. The executive committee once again considered the vehicle in the spring of 2001, and this time gave the go ahead for the project.

In January 2002, SVE became known as [[Performance Vehicle Operations]] (PVO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stone |first=Matt |date=May 1, 2004 |title=Viper |url= https://www.amazon.com/Viper-Enthusiast-Color-Matt-Stone/dp/0760317674 |location= |publisher=Motorbooks |page=63 |isbn=0760317674}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PVO group was responsible for developing the concept car into a production car. A turbocharged 2.4 liter [[inline-4]] [[gasoline engine]] (A853 engine) was used. This engine was nearly identical to the 2003 Chrysler [[PT Cruiser]] (A855 engine), except the SRT-4 did not have the unique intake manifold required to fit the engine into the PT Cruiser engine bay. The car was then given a [[New Venture Gear]] T-850 five-speed [[manual transmission]] (based on the unit from the European [[turbodiesel]] [[minivans]]), equal-length [[half shaft]]s, and a high capacity Sachs performance clutch. The suspension had stiffer springs, SRT-tuned Tokico struts (with travel reduced to provide clearance for the larger wheels), and larger front and rear [[sway bars]] were added. A unique steering gear, PT Cruiser [[steering knuckle]]s, and an updated [[K member]] were also incorporated. Front brakes used 11.0 in (280&amp;nbsp;mm) vented disc brakes with extra thick rotors to prevent warping, and 10.6 in (270&amp;nbsp;mm) non-vented disc brakes in the rear, with single piston calipers (57mm front, 36mm rear).

17 x 6 inch cast aluminum wheels were used, with an offset of 43mm, along with 205/50/17 [[Michelin]] Pilot Sport performance tires. The wheels were designed with a unique spoke pattern to allow for improved airflow to the brakes, and were similar to that of the TSW VX1 wheels used on the original 2000 Neon SRT. Unique side skirts, rear fascia, and a large rear wing (spoiler) were used to upgrade the exterior look of the vehicle. The cooling ducts (front nostrils) were added to the pre-production car in late 2002 on the front fascia to help reduce temperatures in the engine bay of the vehicle.

On the interior, the standard agate-colored front seats were modeled after the Dodge Viper SRT-10 seats, and featured enhanced lumbar and lateral side bolsters to stabilize occupants during performance driving. In 2004, base Neon side air-bag seats were added as an option. A faux carbon fiber steering wheel and shift boot were used, along with a satin silver “cue ball” type shift knob and silver aluminum floor pedals. Unique gauge designs in the SRT-4 (which were exclusive to the SRT lineup) featured special silver faces with satin silver ring accents, and the SRT-4 logo on the facing. The same satin metal trim was also featured on the instrument panel center stack, climate control knobs and on the door handles. A silver (white in early 2003 models) Auto-Meter brand turbo boost/vacuum gauge was set to the right of the instrument cluster. Like all other Neon models, the SRT-4 had power front windows, and manual rear windows, a costs saving feature. Overall, the vehicle's entire powertrain (engine and transmission), suspension, braking system, exhaust, wheels, and tires were upgraded from that of the base model Neon, along with the interior upgrades. The production model was produced in [[Belvidere, Illinois]], with 84% US content.

In 2003, the Dodge Neon SRT-4 went on sale to the public. At the time, the car was the second fastest stock production vehicle in the Chrysler/Dodge lineup, second only to the Viper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/dodge_neon_2003|title=2003 Dodge Neon Review, Ratings, Specs, Prices, and Photos|website=The Car Connection}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, PVO would changed their name to [[Street &amp; Racing Technology]] (SRT), Chrysler's high-performance automotive group. The 2004 model was updated with more power and torque, and included a torque-sensing [[Quaife]] [[limited-slip differential]], larger fuel injectors, new engine management software, [[BF Goodrich]] g-Force T/A KDW-2 three season ultra-high-performance tires, and paint/trim changes. Dodge removed the “Neon” designation from the vehicle in 2004, marketing the car simply as the “SRT-4”. In 2005, an American Club Racer (ACR) package and limited edition numbered Commemorative version of the SRT-4 were also offered.

Initially, Dodge expected to sell a conservative number of only 2,500 units per year. However, during the three year production run (2003 through 2005), more than 25,000 Neon SRT-4s were produced. With the discontinuation of the [[Chrysler PL platform|PL platform]] after model year 2005, the SRT-4 ceased production. In 2008 Dodge introduced the [[Dodge Caliber#SRT4|Caliber SRT-4]] as a replacement.

==Engine details==
The SRT-4 used the same basic engine block as the naturally aspirated 2003+ 2.4L, and was different from the years previous used in the naturally aspirated Chrysler 2.4L mid-size cars such as the PT Cruiser and four-door Stratus. The SRT4 engine had many improvements, including: stronger crank case webbing, a thicker deck with 11&amp;nbsp;mm head bolts (vs 10&amp;nbsp;mm), an oil drain back for the turbo, a cast aluminum structural oil pan, a higher capacity oil pump, a crankshaft of higher hardness steel, improved machining of bearing journals, oil squirters (to cool underside of pistons), eutectic aluminum alloy pistons made specially by [[Mahle GmbH|Mahle]], and forged connecting rods with cracked caps and 9&amp;nbsp;mm bolts. The cylinder head was also different for turbo engines, from naturally aspirated. The turbo version (PT Cruiser GT Turbo and SRT-4) included: larger diameter valves and seats, exhaust valves made of [[Inconel]], improved cooling and larger oil drain back passages, different camshafts. The PT Cruiser Turbo engine package differs from the SRT-4 because the intake manifold, [[turbocharger]] plumbing and [[intercooler]] are different. The SRT-4 [[intercooler]] was a front-mounted cast aluminum 8-row unit produced by [[Valeo]], unique in its efficiency and computer designed end tanks for air flow.

The turbocharger was a reverse rotation [[Mitsubishi]] TD04LR-15Gk with a {{convert|6|cm2|sqin|abbr=on}} turbine inlet. Tight packaging forced some creative thinking on the turbocharger. The TD04 compressor has a compressor bypass valve built right into the compressor housing. The exhaust manifold and turbine housing were cast in one piece by Mitsubishi from high-nickel Ni-Resist steel. The one-piece design improved flow, reduced size and reduced thermal mass for quicker cat light-off. The turbine discharge was also part of the manifold/turbine housing casting, and it looped back around and hit the manifold again on its way to the catalytic converter. Where they met, there was a wastegate valve; keeping the wastegate valve away from the turbine housing improved flow where it mattered most. Maximum boost in stock form was around {{convert|14|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}. Piston velocities and valve-train components force a rev limit of 6240&amp;nbsp;rpm although MOPAR upped the ante with their Stage 2 and 3 kits which have a rev limit of 6500&amp;nbsp;rpm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moparsupercenter.com/pdfs/P5007863.pdf|title=Mopar Stage 3R information sheet|publisher=Mopar|accessdate=May 10, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714114143/http://www.moparsupercenter.com/pdfs/P5007863.pdf|archivedate=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhaust system for the vehicle consists of {{convert|2.25|in|mm|2|sing=on}} steel tubing, which is run first through the catalytic converter, then through two resonators. The exhaust then splits into two separate sections of piping, exiting through two {{convert|3.75|in|mm|abbr=on}} stainless steel tips at the rear of the vehicle. The exhaust system is unique in that there is no muffler, instead relying on the turbocharger and resonators to reduce the exhaust volume. The end result is a very distinctive and audible exhaust note, specific only to the SRT-4.

*No performance extras were added on the Commemorative Edition.

==2003 SRT-4 Extreme LightWeight==
In 2003, Dodge engineers built a special SRT-4 Extreme LightWeight for the 2003 SEMA show. It was designed to showcase the factory upgrade parts available for the SRT-4 from Mopar. The vehicle featured lightweight, carbon fiber body pieces (produced in-house), a [[polycarbonate]] rear window, and the front window glass removed for weight reduction.

The '''Dodge B series''' was a range of [[full-size van]]s that were produced by [[Chrysler|Chrysler Corporation]] from 1970 to 2003.  Through their production, the full-size [[van]]s were sold under several different nameplates.  Most examples were sold by the Dodge division, although [[Rebadging|rebadged]] versions were sold by the now-defunct [[Fargo Trucks|Fargo]] and [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] divisions. Despite many customer requests, the B-series was not available in the desired 360 V8 model until 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mclellansautomotive.com/photos/B28439.jpg 1974 Plymouth Voyager promotional postcard (McLellan's Automotive)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://grassrootsmotorsports.com/reader-rides/4979/ Readers' Rides; 1974 Plymouth Voyager (Grassroots Motorsports)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Chrysler would make two redesigns of the B-platform van, much of the exterior sheetmetal would remain nearly unchanged over 32 years of production, making it one of the longest-used automotive platforms in American automotive history.  For 2003, [[Daimlerchrysler|DaimlerChrysler]] introduced the [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter|Dodge Sprinter]] (produced by [[Mercedes-Benz]]), making the B-platform van the last full-size van designed by Chrysler; [[Ram Trucks]] currently markets the [[Ram ProMaster]] (a rebadged Fiat Ducato).

For its entire production run, Chrysler produced the B-platform vans at the now-demolished [[Pillette Road Truck Assembly]] plant in [[Windsor, Ontario]], Canada.&lt;ref name="Demolition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcnonl.com/article/id49891/--mammoth-chrysler-warehouse-rises-from-plantrsquos-ashes|title=Mammoth Chrysler warehouse rises from plant’s ashes|work=Daily Commercial News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309011113/http://dcnonl.com/article/id49891/--mammoth-chrysler-warehouse-rises-from-plantrsquos-ashes|archivedate=2013-03-09|url-status=dead|accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Built on the [[Chrysler AB platform|B platform]] (later AB), the [[full-size van]]s entered production for the 1971 [[model year]]. Due to a one-welded-piece "Uniframe" design, the Dodge platform was lighter and stronger and featured a lower cargo floor than the competition, at the expense of [[noise, vibration, and harshness]] (NVH).  The resulting lower center of gravity improved handling versus the competing products. The B-series van was popular for cab-over motorhome conversion until Chrysler Corporation's egress from that market during their financial difficulties in the late 1970s.

All generations of the B-series van feature similar construction, with only small variation from era to era.  The most pronounced changes were to the front fenders, hood, grille, and bumpers, which tended to follow their full-size [[truck]] counterparts in each era.  Much of this was a result of the need to meet Federal "[[crashworthiness]]" standards. Additionally, the first generation's side door was mounted back several inches, using a fixed panel between the passenger's side front door and the side door, allowing for more access to the side door without interfering with the front passenger's seat.  This panel was eliminated in 1978 which was a transitional year for the B-series van.  Similar construction for the entire 32 years of production made the Dodge Van very popular with upbuilders, service companies, and other fleets due to the compatibility of installable options from year to year without necessitating a redesign.

Dodge first x mark pioneered the extended-rear 15-passenger van favored by school and church groups and dominated this market until overtaken by Ford in the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} It offered a sliding side door as well as a unique side-swinging tail door with a full-width window.

It was also popular in class-C RV and ambulance conversions.

The [[minivan]] eventually took over the passenger wagon market. With the Sprinter, Chrysler shifted from American-style full-sized vans in favor of more fuel-efficient European-style models.

[[File:Dodgeramvan3rdgen engine.JPG|thumb|right|Third-generation Dodge Ram van engine bay]]
The B-series van was available with nearly every engine used in a rear-wheel-drive Chrysler product during its production.  Six-cylinder [[engine]]s included the {{convert|225|in3|adj=on}} Slant Six [[Straight-six engine|I6]] (1971–1987), the 3.9-liter LA V6 (1988–1991), and the 3.9 [[Liter|L]] Magnum [[V6]] (1992–2007).  Small-block [[V8 engine]]s included the LA-series 318 in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (1971–1991), 360 in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (1972–1992), the Magnum 5.2 L (1992–2007), and the Magnum 5.9 L (1993–2007).  Big-block V8 engines were the {{convert|400|in3|abbr=on}} and {{convert|440|in3|abbr=on}} (1976–1978). Certain model years came with an optional 5.2-liter engine utilizing [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG), with a range of up to {{convert|300|mi|km}} on a full tank, and CNG-powered Ram vans were classified as [[super ultra-low emission vehicle]]s in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eere.energy.gov/afdc/pdfs/b2500.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodge was the last of the four major full-size van makers to market a short-wheelbase van and passenger wagon.  The rest of the [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)#United States and Canada|Big Three]] took their shortest full-size vans off the market early in the 1990s. All American vans are now produced with wheelbases proportional to the body length (i.e. made longer to match van size), rather than a fixed length that does not change with body or roof size extensions (as with the E-series and Ram vans).

DaimlerChrysler discontinued production of the Ram van and Ram wagon after the 2003 model year, replacing them with the M-B-based [[Dodge Sprinter]].

 [[File:B100 01.jpg|thumb|left|1977 Sportsman]]
For the first eight model years, the different configurations of B vans were given names. '''Sportsman''' passenger vans had side windows and passenger seating not present in the otherwise identical '''Tradesman''' models.  The same range of gasoline-powered [[Chrysler Slant 6 engine|slant-6]] and V8 engines was offered in these vans as was offered in the [[Dodge D Series]] [[pickup truck]].

Dodge pioneered the American 15-passenger van genre with the introduction of the Maxiwagon along with the other front engine B series vans that were new for 1971.  Ford didn't produce a 15-passenger van until 1978, and GM did not introduce theirs until 1990. Little changed on Dodge vans produced between 1971 and 1977, with only a grille change from metal to plastic for the 1974 model year. 1978 was a transition year for B series vans, consisting of the nose from 1977 and earlier vans (with a one-year only Dodge symbol in the grille) but with a completely new dashboard and rear end cap.  On the standard length vans, the rear end cap just contained new larger tail lamps, but the extended length Maxivan and Maxiwagon had a completely redesigned rear extension which was longer and had large windows that wrapped around the corners for better visibility. This was unique to the B vans, and this same extension was used until the B vans were discontinued in 2003. On the 1971–77 models, the rear side doors were set back about two feet towards the rear wheelwells, with a filler panel between them and the front doors. Passenger models had a small window between the front and rear doors. Early 1971 vans had black plastic door push buttons, an inlaid pentastar logo low right front fender, drum brakes and points type ignition. 1972 model year began a phase in of chrome door push buttons, electronic ignition, and front disc brakes.  In 1978, the filler panel was removed and the doors were moved forward to be next to the front passenger door, similar to the Ford and Chevrolet vans.

In the late 1970s, Chrysler marketed the B van in their lineup of "Adult Toys", along with the D-Series-based Dodge Warlock, Dodge Lil' Red Express Truck, and Dodge Macho Power Wagon, plus the Dodge Macho Ramcharger.

===Street van===
[[File:SV-Drivers.jpg|thumb|left|1978 Dodge Street Van]]
Dodge vans, particularly '''Tradesman''' vans from the 1971–1977 model years, were very popular as the basis for many custom vans during the custom van craze that occurred during the mid- to late 1970s and early 1980s. Dodge capitalized on this craze, creating a factory customization package called the "Street Van" package. This was advertised alongside the Lil' Red Express and Warlock trucks as "Adult Toys". The Street Van package consisted of a "Street Van" logo on the passenger and driver's side door in lieu of the Tradesman logos, chrome trim on the grille and windshield, simulated wood grain inlays in the steering wheel horn cover and passenger side glare shield, five-slot chrome wheels or white spoked "off-road" type wheels, chrome front and rear bumpers, chrome trim on the gauges, smaller chrome side-view mirrors, patterns and plans to create custom interiors, and membership in the "Dodge Van Clan". This package was available from the 1976 model year until it was discontinued in the early 1980s. This was not an overly popular option from the factory, and Street Vans are somewhat rare.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} The chrome metal Street Van emblems found on later Street Vans (emblems through mid-1978 were stickers) in good shape are quite valuable to collectors or restorers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Kary-van===
The name "Kary van" comes from the cube shape of the cargo section of the van. Dodge used the van body for the front end of its 1973–1978 cube-vans usually with dual rear axles and heavy-duty 1-Ton suspensions. Many examples of these cube-vans can still be found on the streets today as they were typically owned by companies that kept them in service for some time. Thanks to regular maintenance, some still see service.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Rebadged variants===
[[File:Fargo Van (702191260).jpg|200px|right|thumb|Last-generation Fargo Van]]
During the last two years of its existence, [[Fargo Trucks|Fargo]] offered a [[Badge engineering|rebadged]] variant of the Tradesman and Sportsman in Canada for 1971 and 1987 only. [[Plymouth automobile|Plymouth]] also received a rebadged variant of the Sportsman, called the [[Plymouth Voyager#1974–1983|Voyager]] for the 1974 model year.  While never as popular as the Dodge version, Plymouth marketed the Voyager in this format through 1983, after which the nameplate was transferred to the new [[minivan]] that was introduced for 1984 as a rebadged [[Dodge Caravan]].

In 1979 the van received a redesigned front end, including a new grille with wraparound turn signals. Lower-end models had single round headlights, while Royal Sportsman and other high-end vans received four rectangular headlights. The van would keep this body style and the 1978 dash intact with only grille changes all the way through the 1993 model year. The Sportsman, Tradesman, and Adventurer names were phased out after 1980, replaced with the Ram van moniker, which included the Ram wagon for passenger models. As with the D-series trucks, B100 and B150 models were 1/2-ton rated, B250 models were 3/4-ton, and B350s were one-ton. The body shell and most fixtures would be one of the longest running of any US vehicle, remaining nearly identical from the vans' introduction in 1971 through their discontinuance in 2003, while Ford and GM would go through two or three generations of platform redesigns. Kentron Inc. build exclusively on Dodge chassis doing Van conversion. They had range of conversions including '''Medallion 7 &amp; Medallion 7 SR, Daytona &amp; Daytona SR, Traveler SR, Special Edition, Conquest &amp; Conquest  SR,''' various  '''Polara Models.''' Each will be marked with the conversion model plaque and a badge.

In 1986 the Ram van was given a new grille to resemble those of the 1986 Ram trucks. In 1994 the entire front end was redesigned with flush headlamps to resemble the all-new Dodge Ram pickups, and new taillights wrapped around the sides of the van. The 1978-style dash was kept.

In 1994, the entire front end was redesigned with flush headlamps to resemble the all new Dodge Ram pickups, and new taillights wrapped around the sides of the van. The 1978-style dash was kept. In 1998, the van went through the most thorough update since its introduction in 1971. The engine was moved forward in the chassis to improve crash protection, and the front end sheet-metal was redone with a longer nose to accommodate this change. Moving the powertrain forward also resulted in a smaller dog house (engine access cover) which increased front interior room and allowed better access when moving between the front seats. The 1978-style dashboard and door panels were finally replaced in the 1998 model year with a modern design using components from contemporary Chrysler products. The side-view mirrors were now break-away units mounted to the sail portion of the front window openings. This change resulted in the elimination of the front door vent windows. The van remained mostly unchanged until it was discontinued after the 2003 model year, ending production that June. 
 
===Revival===
In 2012, a [[Dodge Caravan]]-based cargo van, previously sold as the Dodge Caravan C/V, was renamed the Ram C/V Tradesman. In 2013, a new Mexican-built full-sized van based on the [[Fiat Ducato]] was introduced and sold under the name Ram ProMaster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curiositesautomobiles.blogspot.com/2013/11/dodge-ram-promaster-american-van-with.html|title=Dodge RAM ProMaster: an American van with European origins.|accessdate=2014-11-22|work=curiositesautomobiles.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which fills the marketing slot once held by the original Dodge B-Series full-size van. The Ram ProMaster City, a [[Fiat Doblo]]-based replacement for the Dodge Grand Caravan C/V Tradesman, was introduced in 2014.{{Update inline|date=June 2015}} The Turkish-sourced Promaster City is said to be a modern descendant of the [[Dodge A100]] compact van in the showroom lineup. Both of these vehicles are FWD.

The '''Dodge Little Red Wagon''' is an exhibition [[drag racing]] truck introduced in 1965. It was the first [[wheelie|wheelstanding]] truck and was the world's fastest truck at that time.

Builders Jim Schaeffer and John Collier performed extensive modifications to the [[Dodge A100]] in order to fit a [[Chrysler Hemi engine#Sedond Generation|426 Hemi]] engine and [[TorqueFlite]] automatic transmission. Since the A100 was a [[cabover]] design, Schaeffer and Collier opted to install the drivetrain in the pickup bed, within a welded steel subframe.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Parts deemed unnecessary were removed from the body, among them the heater, dashboard, front bumper, and all body sealer. The Little Red Wagon's first dragstrip run netted a mid-11 second quarter mile at {{convert|120|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/littleredwagon.html |title=The Little Red Wagon|publisher=allpar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vehicle was not originally intended to perform wheelstands; the slight rearward weight bias caused the nose to lift in the air for nearly the entire quarter-mile run. The truck was initially given to Dick Branstner Enterprises and Roger Lindamood to help sort out the ill-handling and unpredictable truck.{{cn|date=September 2018}}  The team's Dodge ''[[Color Me Gone]]'' entry had just won the 1964 [[NHRA U.S. Nationals|U.S. Nationals]]. They enlisted [[Jay Howell (drag racer)|Jay Howell]] as driver; and the first known photo of it doing a wheelstand has Howell behind the wheel.{{cn|date=September 2018}}  Chrysler's Director of Marketing, Frank Wylie, arranged for Super Stock Champion [[Bill Golden|Bill "Maverick" Golden]] to purchase the truck.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Golden turned the A100 pickup into the first exhibition wheelstander.{{cn|date=September 2018}} The truck toured extensively throughout the United States and was used in television commercials for Dodge trucks. The Little Red Wagon debuted in the 1965 season opener at [[Lions Drag Strip]] in [[Wilmington, California]], in front of 10,000 fans and reporters from major newspapers and automotive publications. 

The vehicle suffered wrecks in 1969, 1971, and 1975.  After the 1975 wreck, Golden converted a non-operable show truck and campaigned it until he retired in 2003.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Golden entered the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] in 1977 with a 4230' (1289m) wheelstand, approximately the length of three quarter-mile dragstrips.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

In 2009, the replacement Little Red Wagon from 1975  was sold at [[RM Auctions]] Icons of Speed and Style Auction.  The vehicle was expected to fetch US$300,000; it was instead the auction's top seller at $550,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rmauctions.com/auction-results-overview.cfm?SaleCode=RW09 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005015331/http://www.rmauctions.com/auction-results-overview.cfm?SaleCode=RW09 |date=2009-10-05 }} Icons of Speed page ar RMAuctions.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the original Little Red Wagon was sold to stunt driver Mike Mantel, also the current driver of the ''[[Hemi Under Glass]]'' wheelstander. Mantel has converted a 1965 Dodge A100 into a Little Red Wagon wheelstander to perform and tour with the original crashed truck on display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.littleredwagonwheelstander.com/the-build.html|title=The Build|publisher=littleredwagonwheelstander.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also the subject of a 1/25 scale model kit from IMC which was later reissued by [[Lindberg Models]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lindberg-models.com/land_model72158.html |title=No. 72158 Dodge "Little Red Wagon"|publisher=Lindberg Models|accessdate=2010-01-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313093206/http://www.lindberg-models.com/land_model72158.html |archivedate=2009-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Squad 51''' is a 1972 [[Dodge D Series|Dodge D-300]] truck, one of 3 different rescue squad vehicles ("squads") that were used in the filming of the television series ''[[Emergency!]]''

Because of the tight filming schedule, [[Universal Studios]] decided to build the vehicle entirely from scratch according to the [[Los Angeles County Fire Department]]'s specifications at that time.  After the filming of ''Emergency!'', Universal Studios donated Squad 51, and it was used as a reserve paramedic vehicle by the LACOFD. In 1999 the title was transferred, and Squad 51 was then donated to the [[Los Angeles County Fire Museum]] in [[Bellflower, California]]. In the same year it was thoroughly and completely restored by the museum, at a cost of approximately $30,000. Squad 51 is now residing with its co-star in ''Emergency!'', [[Engine 51]], which completed restoration in 2012.

Squad 51 also made appearances in TV hit show CHiPs at times including season 3 ep.17 E.M.T. 

Plans call for the museum to completely restore all of the period equipment used during the filming of ''Emergency!''

In 1999, Project 51 took off along with Squad 51 and many of the cast members from ''Emergency!'', and made appearances in Southern California, Lake Tahoe, Las Vegas, Chicago, Long Island, Baltimore, Hyattsville and Washington DC.

The museum will eventually build a new facility to house the squad and engines in a rebuilt facade of Station 127 in [[Carson, California]], where the show was filmed.

On July 9, 2011, on the apron in front of Station 127 (which doubled as "Station 51" during the series), the newly restored 1973 Ward LaFrance Engine 51 was unveiled next to its old running mate, Squad 51. Thousands of people from around the world were in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jems.com/articles/2011/07/emergency-51-quarters-0.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
*The Squad 51 in the LACO Fire Museum is the only vehicle of that model used during the filming of ''Emergency!''.  *In the Mascot episode (episode 7?) approximately half way through the program the squad truck shown driving down the street in response to a possible heart attack victim, the truck appears to be a Ford model. Definitely not the normal Dodge truck.*
*The original gasoline powered 440 ci motor is still in the vehicle. Squad 51 has not been repowered.
*The restoration cost was about $30,000 due to the restoration being a complete frame off restoration.
*In the TV movie ''Survival on Charter 220'' where Squad 51 was crushed, a dummy squad was used to take its place.
*Squad 51 was not originally equipped with a siren. Instead, various siren sounds were dubbed in during its response scenes.
*Squad 51 contained actual medical equipment including a [[Biophone]].

The '''Dodge Challenger''' is the name of three different generations of automobiles (two of those being [[pony car]]s) produced by American automobile manufacturer [[Dodge]]. However, the first use of the Challenger name by Dodge was in 1959 for [[marketing]] a "value version" of the [[Full-size car|full-sized]] [[Dodge Coronet#Silver Challenger (1959)|Coronet Silver Challenger]].

From [[model year]]s 1970 to 1974, the first generation Dodge Challenger pony car was built using the [[Chrysler E platform]] in [[hardtop]] and [[convertible]] body styles sharing major components with the [[Plymouth Barracuda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grist |first=Peter |title=Dodge Challenger, Plymouth Barracuda: Chrysler's potent pony cars |date=2009 |publisher=Veloce |isbn=9781845841058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second generation, from model years 1978 to 1983, was a [[Badge engineering|badge engineered]] [[Mitsubishi Galant Lambda]], a coupe version of an economical [[compact car]].

The third and current generation is a pony car that was introduced in early 2008 originally as a rival to the evolved [[Ford Mustang (fifth generation)|fifth generation Ford Mustang]] and the [[Chevrolet Camaro (fifth generation)|fifth generation Chevrolet Camaro]].

Introduced in fall 1969 for the 1970 [[model year]],&lt;ref name="1960s"&gt;{{cite book | last=Gunnell |first=John |title=American Cars of the 1960s |publisher=Krause Publications |year=2005 |page=69 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_apeyhD-Dj8C&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=As+Dodge’s+answer+to+the+Mustang+and+Camaro |isbn=978-0-89689-131-9 |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Challenger was one of two [[Chrysler E platform|Chrysler E-body]] cars, the other being the slightly smaller [[Plymouth Barracuda]].

The Challenger's longer [[wheelbase]], larger dimensions, and more luxurious interior were prompted by the launch of the 1967 Mercury Cougar, likewise a bigger, more luxurious and more expensive pony car aimed at affluent young American buyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1970-1974-dodge-challenger.htm |title=1970–1974 Dodge Challenger |author=Auto editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |date=October 17, 2007 |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|110|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase was {{convert|2|in|mm|abbr=on}} longer than the Barracuda's, and the Dodge differed substantially in its sheetmetal, much as the Cougar differed from the shorter-wheelbase Mustang. Air conditioning and a rear window defogger were optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1970_Dodge/1970_Dodge_Challenger_Lineup/1970%20Dodge%20Challenger%20Lineup-08.html |title=1970 Dodge Challenger Lineup |page= |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With 1971 being the sole exception, the front ends of both cars differed from each other in that the Challenger had four headlights and the Barracuda had only two; a trend replicated by offerings from Chrysler's rivals. 

Exterior design was penned by Carl Cameron, who was also responsible for the exterior designs of the 1966 [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Dodge Charger]]. Cameron based the 1970 Challenger grille on an older sketch of a 
stillborn 1966 Charger prototype that was to have a turbine engine. The pony car segment was already declining by the time the Challenger arrived. Sales fell dramatically after 1970, and though sales rose for the 1973 model year with over 27,800 cars being sold, Challenger production ceased midway through the 1974 model year. A total of 165,437 first generation Challengers were sold.

====1970====
For its introductory model year the Challenger was available in two series, Challenger and Challenger R/T, and three models, two-door [[hardtop]], Special Edition two-door [[hardtop]], or convertible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Dodge/1970_Dodge/1970_Dodge_Challenger_Lineup/1970-Dodge-Challenger-Lineup-01 |title=1970 Dodge Challenger Lineup |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |pages=96–97 |accessdate=July 13, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714170532/http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Dodge/1970_Dodge/1970_Dodge_Challenger_Lineup/1970-Dodge-Challenger-Lineup-01 |archivedate=July 14, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=November 2014}} The base model was the Challenger with either an inline-6 or V8 engine. The Special Edition hardtop, available on either the base Challenger or on the R/T, added a number of appearance, convenience, and comfort features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Dodge/1970_Dodge/1970_Dodge_Challenger_Lineup/1970-Dodge-Challenger-Lineup-11 |title=1970 Dodge Challenger Lineup |page=117 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=July 13, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714132949/http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Dodge/1970_Dodge/1970_Dodge_Challenger_Lineup/1970-Dodge-Challenger-Lineup-11 |archivedate=July 14, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Produced for the 1970 model year only, this more luxurious SE specification included as standard a vinyl roof with a "SE" medallions on the pillars, a smaller "formal" rear window, leather and vinyl bucket seats, and an overhead interior console that contained three warning lights (door ajar, low fuel, and seatbelts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1970_Dodge/1970_Dodge_Challenger_Lineup/1970%20Dodge%20Challenger%20Lineup-11.html |title=1970 Dodge Challenger Lineup |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard engine on the base model was a {{convert|225|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-6]]. The standard engine on the higher trim models was a {{convert|318|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with a 2-barrel [[carburetor]]. For 1970, the optional engines included the {{convert|340|and|383|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}, as well as the {{convert|440|and|426|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8s, all with a standard 3-speed [[manual transmission]], except for the {{convert|290|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} 383 cuin. engine, which was available only with the [[TorqueFlite]] [[automatic transmission]]. A 4-speed manual was optional on all engines except the 225 cuin. Inline-6 and the 2-barrel 383 cuin. V8.


The performance model was the '''Challenger R/T''' (Road/Track), with a {{convert|383|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} "Magnum" V8, rated at {{convert|335|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}; {{convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for 1971, due to a drop in compression. The standard transmission was a 3-speed manual. Optional R/T engines were the {{convert|375|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|440|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Magnum, the {{convert|390|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|440|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Six-Pack and the [[Chrysler Hemi engine#426|{{convert|426|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Hemi]] rated at {{convert|425|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,000 rpm and {{convert|490|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,000 rpm. The R/T was available in either the hardtop or convertible. The Challenger R/T came with a Rallye instrument cluster that included a {{convert|150|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} speedometer, an 8,000 rpm [[tachometer]] and an oil pressure gauge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1970_Dodge/1970_Dodge_Challenger_Brochure/1970%20Dodge%20Challenger-04.html |title=1970 Dodge Challenger Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shaker [[hood scoop]] was not available after 1971.

A mid-year introduction was the low-priced '''Challenger Deputy''', a [[coupe]] with fixed rear [[Quarter glass|quarter windows]] and stripped of some of the base car's trim and with fixed rear side glass.
The "Western Sport Special" was a version available only to west coast dealers. It came with a rear-exit exhaust system and Western Sport Special identification on the rear decklid. Some examples came with a vacuum-operated trunk release.

====The 1970 Dodge Challenger T/A====
[[image:Dodge Challenger (9885025066) (cropped).jpg|thumb|1970 Dodge Challenger T/A]]
A special model only available for the 1970 model year was the '''Challenger T/A''' (Trans Am) racing homologation car. In order to race in the Sports Car Club of America's Trans American Sedan Championship [[Trans-Am Series|Trans Am]], Dodge built a street version of its race car (just like Plymouth with its [[Plymouth Barracuda|Plymouth 'Cuda]] AAR) which it called the Dodge Challenger T/A (Trans Am). Although the race cars ran a destroked version of the 340, street versions took the 340 and added a trio of two-barrel carburetors atop an aluminum intake manifold, creating the 340 Six Pack. Dodge rated the 340 Six Pack at {{convert|290|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, only {{convert|15|hp|0|abbr=on}} more than the original 340 engine (which also had the same rating as the [[Chevrolet Camaro (second generation)|Camaro]] Z/28 and Ford Boss 302 [[Ford Mustang|Mustang]]). Air came in through a suitcase-sized air scoop molded into the pinned down, hinged matte-black fiberglass hood. A low-restriction dual outlet exhaust ran to the stock muffler location, then reversed direction to exit in chrome tipped "megaphone" outlets in front of the rear wheels. Options included a TorqueFlite automatic or pistol-grip [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]]-shifted four-speed transmission, 3.55:1 or 3.90:1 gear ratios, as well as manual or power steering. Front disc brakes were standard. The special Rallye suspension used heavy duty parts and increased the rate of the rear springs. The T/A was one of the first U.S. muscle car to fit different size tires front and rear: E60x15 Goodyear Polyglas in the front, and G60x15 on the rear axle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://musclecars.howstuffworks.com/classic-muscle-cars/1970-dodge-challenger-t-a.htm |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1970 Dodge Challenger T/A |date=10 January 2007 |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/model/RT-TA-challenger.html |title=1970 Dodge Challenger R/T and Challenger T/A |first=Kelly |last=Doke |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modified chamber elevated the tail enough to clear the rear tires and its side exhaust outlets. Thick dual side stripes, bold ID graphics, a fiberglass ducktail rear spoiler, and a fiberglass front spoiler were also included. The interior was identical to other Challengers.

Dodge contracted Ray Caldwell's [[Autodynamics (race car manufacturer)|Autodynamics]] in Marblehead, Massachusetts to run the factory [[Trans-Am]] team. [[Sam Posey]] drove the No.77 "sub-lime" painted car that Caldwell's team built from a car taken off a local dealer's showroom floor. When the No.76 was completed mid-season from a chassis provided by Dan Gurney's All American Racers, Posey alternated between the two. Both cars ran the final two races, with Posey in the #77. [[Ronnie Bucknum]] drove the No.76 at Seattle Washington, and [[Tony Adamowicz]] drove it at Riverside, California.

The Challenger T/A's scored a few top three finishes, but lack of a development budget and the short-lived [[Keith Black (engineer)|Keith Black]] built {{convert|303|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engines led to Dodge leaving the series at season's end. The street version suffered from severe understeer in fast corners, largely due to the smaller front tires. Only 2,399 T/As were made. A 1971 model using the 340 engine with a 4-barrel carburetor was planned and appeared in advertising, but was not produced since Dodge had withdrawn from the race series.

====1971====

For the 1971 model year the '''Challenger Coupe''' became the entry-level model, with either a six or V8 engine. Like the Challenger Deputy it replaced, it had fixed rear quarter windows and a basic black steering wheel with horn button.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Dodge/1971_Dodge/1971-Dodge-Challenger-Brochure-Cdn/1971-Dodge-Challenger-Cdn--06 |title=1971 Dodge Challenger Brochure |page=6 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=July 13, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715003553/http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Dodge/1971_Dodge/1971-Dodge-Challenger-Brochure-Cdn/1971-Dodge-Challenger-Cdn--06 |archivedate=July 15, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1973 Dodge Challenger Rallye Hardtop (45669341001).jpg|thumb|left|1973 Dodge Challenger Rallye]]

====1972====
For 1972 model year, the options lists (both for performance and appearance/convenience items) had been drastically cut back. The convertible version (though a sun-roof was made available), most interior upgrade options (in particular leather seats), comfort/convenience items (in particular power windows and power seats), and all the big-block engine options were gone. The R/T series was replaced by the Challenger Rallye series. The Rallye model featured four simulated vents on the front fenders, from which exited matte black strobe tape stripes. Engine choices were down to three: the {{convert|225|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} slant-6, {{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, and a {{convert|340|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 that was equipped with a 4-barrel carburetor, dual exhausts, as well as a performance-oriented camshaft and heads. All three engines were detuned to lower compression ratios in order to run on lead-free gasoline, and the horsepower ratings were lowered to reflect the more accurate [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE) net horsepower calculations. Each engine could be mated to a 3-speed manual or automatic transmission, while the 340 could also be equipped with a 4-speed manual if so ordered. The performance axle ratios were also gone except for a 3.55 sure grip which could only be had with the 340 and the heavy duty suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1972_Dodge/1972_Dodge_Challenger_Brochure/1972%20Dodge%20Challenger-02.html |title=1972 Dodge Challenger Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1972 models also received a new grille that extended beneath the front bumper, as well as new rear tail-lights. Toward the end of the 1971 model year a few convertibles were made with the 1972 front end (grille, lights, etc.) and rear end (tail lights and their panel). The only way to ascertain these 1972 Challenger convertible is to look at its fender tag. On the code line which gives the dealer order number, that number will start with an "R", which designates "Special Meaning" (in this case, a TV 'special promotions' car).

====1973–74====
The 1972 grille and tail-light arrangement was carried over for the 1973 (and 1974) model years, and the mandatory 5&amp;nbsp;mph bumpers were added. While the {{convert|225|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-six engine|six-cylinder engine]] was dropped, (leaving just the two V8s), all option lists otherwise were carry-overs from 1972.

For 1974, the {{convert|340|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine was replaced by a {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} version offering {{convert|245|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, but the pony car market had fallen off and production of Challengers ceased in late April 1974.

===Cosmetic variations===
[[File:1973 Dodge Challenger red.jpg|thumb|right|Protruding bumper guards, 1973]]

Although the body style remained the same throughout the Challenger's five-year run, there were two notable changes to the front grille. The 1971 models had a "split" grille, while 1972 introduced a design that extended the grille (nicknamed the "sad-mouth") beneath the front bumper. With this change to the front end, 1972 through 1974 models had little to no variation. The only way to properly distinguish them is that the 1972s had flush mounted bumpers with no bumper guards, (small bumper guards were optional), while both the 1973 and 1974 models had the protruding "{{convert|5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}" bumpers (with a rubber type filler behind them) in conjunction with large bumper guards. The 1974 cars had larger rear bumper guards to meet the (new for 1974 and on) rear {{convert|5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} rear impact law. These changes were made to meet U.S. regulations regarding crash test safety.

The 1970 taillights went all the way across the back of the car, with the backup light in the middle. In 1971, the backup lights were on the left and right instead of the middle. The taillight array also changed for 1972 onwards, with the Challenger now having four individual rectangular lamps.

===Collectibility===
Although few mourned the end of the E-body models, the passage of time has created legends and highlighted the unique personalities of both the Challenger and the Barracuda.&lt;ref name=edmunds/&gt; With a low total production, as well as low survivability over the years, any ''Challenger'' is worth a substantial amount of money.  In a historic review, the editors of ''Edmunds Inside Line'' ranked these models as: 1970 was a "great" year, 1971 was a "good" one, and then "three progressively lousier ones" (1972–1974).&lt;ref name=edmunds/&gt; With total sales and production off by 2/3 from 1970, the performance engine 1971 Challengers are the most rare. Sales and production of the 1973 cars (with only two V8s available) actually exceeded 1971 by approximately 1,700 cars.

===Export markets===
Dodge Challengers were mainly produced for the U.S. and Canadian markets. Chrysler officially sold Challengers to Switzerland through [[AMAG Automobil- und Motoren]] AG in [[Schinznach-Bad]], near [[Zurich]]. Only a few cars were shipped overseas each year to AMAG. They did the final assembly of the Challengers and converted them to Swiss specifications. There are few AMAG cars still in existence. From a collector's point of view, these cars are very desirable. Today, fewer than five Swiss Challengers are known to exist in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.car-lots.net/dodge-challenger.htm|title=Dodge Challenger – The Car That The World Prefers|publisher=car-lots.net|accessdate=July 13, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918200308/http://www.car-lots.net/dodge-challenger.htm|archivedate=September 18, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrysler exported Dodge Challengers officially to France as well through their Chrysler France [[Simca]] operation, since Ford sold the [[Ford Mustang|Mustang]] in France successfully in small numbers. However, only a few Challengers were exported and Chrysler finally gave up the idea of selling them in France.

===Engines===
The [[Horsepower#SAE gross power|SAE gross horsepower]] ratings were determined testing the engine with no accessories, no air cleaner, or open dyno headers. In 1971 compression ratios were reduced in performance engines, except the {{convert|426|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} and the high performance {{convert|440|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}, to accommodate regular gasoline. 1971 was the last year for the {{convert|426|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Hemi.

[[File:1982 Dodge Challenger (all original).jpg|thumb|left|Rear view (1982 Challenger)]]

The Challenger name was revived in late 1977 for the 1978 model year for a version of the early [[Mitsubishi Galant Lambda]] coupe. It was known overseas as the Mitsubishi Sapporo/Scorpion and sold through [[Dodge]] dealers as a [[captive import]], originally as the "Dodge Colt Challenger".&lt;ref name=RTbg79&gt;{{citation | ref = RT79 | title = Four Sports Coupes | work = Road &amp; Track's Road Test Annual &amp; Buyer's Guide 1979 | date = January–February 1979 | publisher = CBS Publications | location = Greenwich, CT | page = 31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was identical except in color and minor trim to the [[Plymouth Sapporo]] with the Dodge version emphasizing sportiness, with bright colors and tape stripes, while the Plymouth emphasized luxury, with more subdued trim. Both the Sapporo and Challenger were completely redesigned in 1981 with an entirely new body that was longer, taller, and wider. The 1981–1983 body had more foot and head room, a larger trunk, and more sound-proofing for a more comfortable ride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_mitsubishi_scorpion_gj.htm |title=Mitsubishi Scorpion GJ/GK/GL |work=Unique Cars and Parts |accessdate=24 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both cars were sold until 1983, when they were replaced by the [[Mitsubishi Starion#North America|Conquest]] using the same rear-wheel-drive platform through 1989, and in 1984 by the front-wheel-drive [[Chrysler Laser|Laser]] and [[Dodge Daytona|Daytona]].

The car retained the frameless hardtop styling of the old Challenger, but had smaller engines, a 1.6 L inline-four and a 2.6 L inline-four instead of the [[Chrysler_Slant-6_engine|slant-6]] and V8 engines of the old Challenger, and was a long way off in performance from its namesake. The engines were rated at power outputs of {{convert|77-105|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Nevertheless, it acquired a reputation as a reasonably brisk performer in its class when equipped with the available 2.6 L "hemi" engine.&lt;ref name=RTbg79/&gt; Four-cylinder engines of this size had not usually been built due to inherent vibration, but [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]] pioneered the use of [[balance shaft]]s to help dampen this effect, and the Challenger was one of the first vehicles to bring this technology to the American market; it has since been licensed to many other manufacturers.

[[File:Dodge Challenger 2006 PBCd'E.jpg|thumb|left|2006 Dodge Challenger Concept]]

In late 2005, Dodge teased spy photos of the Dodge Challenger prototype on the internet and it was announced on November 21, 2005 showing an official drawing sketch of the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2006 Dodge Challenger concept car |url=https://www.allpar.com/cars/concepts/dodge/challenger-concept.html |website=allpar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dodge Challenger Concept was unveiled at the [[North American International Auto Show#2006|2006 North American International Auto Show]] and was a preview for the 3rd generation Dodge Challenger that started its production in 2008. Many design cues of the Dodge Challenger Concept were adapted from the 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T. It was the second pony car to reuse a previous design in the 2000s, after the 2005 [[Ford Mustang]] but before the 2010 [[Chevrolet Camaro]] (which was revived after seven years of being out of production).

===Initial release===
On December 3, 2007, Chrysler started taking deposits for the 3rd-generation Dodge Challenger which debuted on February 6, 2008, simultaneously at the [[Chicago Auto Show]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=123858 |title=Dodge Swamped With Challenger Orders |publisher=Inside Line |date=December 6, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131221116/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId%3D123858 |archivedate=January 31, 2008 |accessdate=July 13, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Philadelphia International Auto Show. Listing at US$40,095, the new version was a 2-door [[notchback]] [[coupe]] (seating 5 passengers with over 33 cubic feet of rear passenger volume) which shared common design elements with the first generation Challenger, despite being significantly longer and taller. As with Chevrolet's new Camaro, the Challenger [[concept car]]'s [[pillar (car)|pillarless]] [[hardtop]] body was replaced with a fixed "B" pillar, hidden behind the side glass to give an illusion of the hardtop. The LC chassis is a modified (shortened wheelbase) version of the LX platform that underpins the [[Dodge Charger (LX)]], [[Dodge Magnum]], and the [[Chrysler 300]]. The LX was developed in America from the previous Chrysler LH platform, which had been designed to allow it to be easily upgraded to rear and all-wheel drive. Many Mercedes components were incorporated, or used for inspiration, including the Mercedes-Benz W220 S-class control arm front suspension, the Mercedes-Benz W211 E-Class 5-link rear suspension, the W5A580 5-speed automatic, the rear differential, and the ESP system. All (7119) 2008 models were SRT8s and equipped with the {{convert|370|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} Hemi V8 engine and a 5-speed AutoStick [[automatic transmission]]. The entire 2008 Canadian produced run of 6,400 US market cars were pre-sold and production commenced on May 8, 2008.

Chrysler of Mexico offered only 100 SRT8s, with a 6.1 liter V8 engine rated at {{convert|425|hp}} (SAE). Chrysler auctioned off two 2008 SRT8s for charity with the first car going for US$400,000 and a "B5" Blue No.43 car with a winning bid of US$228,143.43.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.redletterdodge.com/2008/02/23/sold-43-dodge-challenger-srt8-raises-22814343-for-charity/ |title=SOLD!

The base model Challenger SE was initially powered by a {{convert|214|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[Chrysler SOHC V6 engine#3.5|SOHC V6 engine]] rated at {{convert|250|hp|0|abbr=on}} (SAE) and {{convert|250|lbfft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque which was coupled to a 4-speed automatic transmission for the first half of 2009, and was then changed to have a standard 5-speed automatic transmission.&lt;ref name="2009jbspecs"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.jbcarpages.com/dodge/challenger/2009/specs/ |title=2009 Dodge Challenger Specs |publisher=JB car pages |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several different exterior colors, with either cloth or leather interiors became available. Standard features included air conditioning, power windows, locks, and mirrors; cruise control, and {{convert|17|in|mm|adj=on}} aluminum wheels. Leather upholstery, heated front seats, sunroof, 18-inch aluminum wheels, and a premium audio system are available as options, as are ABS, and stability and traction control.&lt;ref name="2009jbreview"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.jbcarpages.com/dodge/challenger/2009/ |title=2009 Dodge Challenger Review |publisher=JB car pages |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian market also sports the SXT trim, similar to the SE, but more generous in terms of standard features. Some of these features being ESP, an alarm system, and {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on}} wheels. Starting with the 2012 model year, the SE was replaced in the U.S. with the SXT model.

Previous to the 2012 model year, the SXT version of the Challenger was only sold in Canada and is a more well-equipped variation of the SE. It adds fog lamps, a rear spoiler, larger wheels, illuminated vanity mirrors, security alarm and a leather-wrapped shifter. In addition, the SXT has increased option packages available to it that aren't available on the SE, and are also available to the R/T. (Such as the high-end navigation-enabled entertainment system.)

====Challenger 500====
Chrysler Canada offered a further 670 SRTs uniquely badged as the Challenger 500 (paying homage to Charger and Coronet 500s) all of which were shipped to Canadian Dodge dealers.

===2009 model year===

Production of the limited edition 2008 SRT8s ended in July 2008, and production of the expanded 2009 line-up started in early August of the same year. The expanded offering was the same as had been unveiled earlier that spring at the 2008 [[New York Auto Show]]. Chrysler debuted the full Dodge Challenger line-up for 2009, with four different trims – SE, R/T, SRT8, and the SXT in Canada only. In addition to the SRT8, which remained unchanged except for the optional 6 speed manual and standard limited slip differential, the line-up included the previously mentioned SE and SXT which offered the {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.5-Liter V6. The R/T hosted a 5.7 Hemi sporting {{convert|372|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|398|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque when coupled with the 5 speed automatic, and {{convert|375|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with {{convert|404|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} when matched with the same Tremec 6-speed manual transmission as the SRT8.

New for 2009 was the Rallye Package for the SE model. The package featured design cues including dual body stripes on the hood and the trunk, chromed fuel cap, deck lid spoiler, 18-inch aluminum wheels, and Micro Carbon interior accents.

The mid-level Challenger R/T is powered by a {{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[Chrysler Hemi Engine|Hemi]] V8 coupled to a 5-speed automatic transmission or a Tremec TR-6060 6-speed manual transmission. On cars equipped with the automatic transmission, the engine features the [[Multi-Displacement System]] and is rated at  {{convert|372|hp||abbr=on}} (SAE) and {{convert|398|lbfft|Nm|abbr=on}} torque.&lt;ref name="2009jbspecs"/&gt; With the 6-speed manual transmission, the [[Multi-Displacement System]] option was deleted and the engine is rated at {{convert|375|hp|0|abbr=on}} (SAE) and {{convert|404|lbfft|Nm|abbr=on}} torque.&lt;ref name="2009jbspecs"/&gt; Another feature was the Intelligent Deceleration Fuel Shut-Off (iDFSO) available for the automatic models only. The first to combine both a Multi-Displacement system and fuel shut-off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/news/index.php/2009/07/chrysler-adds-fuel-shutoff-to-increase-mileage |title=Chrysler adds fuel shutoff to increase mileage &amp;#124; Allpar Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep News |publisher=Allpar.com |date=July 7, 2009 |first=David |last=Zatz |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[final drive ratio]] was 3.06:1 on cars with the automatic transmission, 3.73:1 on cars with the 6-speed manual and {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on}} wheels or 3.92:1 with the 6-speed manual and optional {{convert|20|in|mm|adj=on}} wheels. Also available on R/T was the "Track Pak" option group, which includes the Tremec manual transmission, a limited slip differential and self-leveling rear shock absorbers.

The Challenger R/T Classic has retro aspects such as script "Challenger" badges on the front panels and black or white "R/T" stripes. It comes with a five-speed automatic standard, with an optional six-speed manual transmission including a pistol-grip-shifter. The wheels are Heritage 20" Torq-Thrust style specials. It became available in Brilliant Black Crystal Pearl, Bright Silver Metallic, Stone White and in multiple "heritage" colors: Toxic Orange, HEMI-Orange, TorRed, B5 Blue, Plum Crazy Purple, Detonator Yellow and Furious Fuchsia. Production started in February 2009.

The 2009 SRT8, while still equipped with the 6.1 L (370 cu in) Hemi V8, is virtually identical to its 2008 counterpart, with the main difference being the choice of either a 5-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission. Standard features include Brembo brakes, a sport suspension, bi-xenon headlamps, heated leather sport seats, keyless go, Sirius satellite radio, and {{convert|20|in|mm|adj=on}} forged aluminum wheels in addition to most amenities offered on the R/T and SE models such as air conditioning and cruise control.&lt;ref name="2009jbreview"/&gt; In addition, the 2009 had a "limited slip" differential that was not offered on the 2008 model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.challengertalk.com/forums/f30/summary-srt-chat-session-2017/ |title=SRT Engineers Chat Session |publisher=Challenger Forum |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "Spring Special" SRT8 Challenger was also offered in B5 Blue, but due to rolling plant shutdowns, just over 250 Spring Special Challengers were built before the end of the 2009 model year.

The '''Mopar '10 Challenger R/T''' is a limited version of the 2010 Challenger R/T with metallic pearl black body color, three accent colors (blue, red, silver) of stripes to choose from. In addition, these cars were available with black R/T Classic-style wheels along with a Hurst aftermarket pistol grip shifter, custom badging, Mopar cold air intake for a ten-horsepower increase, and a Katzkin-sourced aftermarket interior. The cars were built in [[Brampton Assembly]] and completed at the Mopar Upfit Center in Windsor, Ontario. There were 500 U.S. Units and 100 Canadian units built. Of the 500 Mopar special edition U.S. versions, 320 had automatic transmissions, 180 had manuals, while 255 had blue stripes, 115 had red stripes, and 130 had silver stripes. A limited numbered run of 400 SRTs in 2010 were produced with "Furious Fuchsia" paint and white leather seats with horizontal fuchsia colored slash bars on the back rests. Special badging on the passenger side dash script denotes the production number of each individual car ranging from the numbers 1 to 400. Dodge marketed this package as homage to the original Panther Pink cars 40 years previous. These cars came with both automatic and Tremec six speed transmissions.

The Drag Race Package is a race model designed for [[NHRA]] competition, based on the Dodge Challenger SRT-8. The car is {{convert|1000|lb|0|abbr=on}} lighter than the street vehicle by eliminating major production components and systems. To accentuate the weight savings, they also feature added composite, polycarbonate and lightweight components designed for drag racing that is part of the new Package Car program. The engine was repositioned to improve driveline angle and weight distribution. The {{convert|116|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase was shortened by ½ inch. The car also features a front cradle with bolt-in crossmember and solid engine mounts.

At least 50 Challenger Drag Race Package Cars are being built to meet NHRA requirements. Engine options include a 6.1liter HEMI, 5.7-liter HEMI, and a 5.9-liter Magnum Wedge. Manual or automatic transmissions are available, and the rear axle is solid (not IRS). An initial run of the required 50 cars was completed and over 100 of the "2009 Challenger Drag Pak" vehicles were produced. "Big Daddy" [[Don Garlits]] bought the first drag race package car and has raced it in NHRA competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://jalopnik.com/398484/mopar-dodge-challenger-drag-pack-finally-revealed |title=Mopar Dodge Challenger Drag Pack Finally Revealed |publisher=Jalopnik.com |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prototype cars shown at SEMA were built by MPR Racing of Michigan, who continue to modify the production cars as delivered from Chrysler.

===2010 model year===
In its second year of production, the Challenger received only a few minor feature and option changes. Electronic stability control is newly standard across the entire Challenger model line. R/T models gained the following standard features: automatic headlamps, an LED-lit cupholder and door-handle lights. UConnect Multimedia and UConnect Navigation options now include steering-wheel audio controls while UConnect Multimedia features have been combined with the optional Sound Group.

The most significant new option for 2010 is the Super Track Pack, which brings a host of track-ready hardware and upgrades that includes:
* 20x9 wheels with Goodyear F1 Super Car tires
* Front and rear Sachs Nivomat self-leveling shock-absorbers
* Larger rear stabilizer bar (20mm &gt; 16mm stock)
* Variable displacement performance steering pump (standard on 6 speed)
* 3.06 rear-axle ratio (n/a on 6-speed R/Ts which maintain 3.92 ratio)
* Anti-lock 4-Wheel disc heavy duty brakes with performance brake linings
* "ESP-off" stability calibration. A limited slip differential remained standard only on R/Ts equipped with the 6 speed manual transmission.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nadaguides.com/Cars/2010/Dodge/Challenger&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 model year===
The base SE trim was renamed to SXT for consistency with the naming scheme of the remaining Dodge lineup. The SRT8 392 model gains a two-mode adaptive suspension system which features an Auto and Sport mode. The car uses a variety of sensors to measure inputs like vehicle speed, steering angle, brake torque, throttle position and acceleration forces to instantly tune the suspension for the given condition depending on what mode is chosen.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.torquenews.com/106/changes-announced-2012-dodge-challenger-srt8-392&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a new heated steering wheel featuring Chrysler's new paddle shifter system, new sport seats, and a 900 watt Harman Kardon audio system became available.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.autoblog.com/buy/2012-Dodge-Challenger/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat is a high performance variant of the Challenger equipped with a supercharged [[Chrysler Hemi engine#Hellcat|6.2-liter HEMI engine]] rated at {{convert|707|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|650|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. This engine is also available in the [[Dodge Charger (LX)|Dodge Charger]] SRT Hellcat full-sized sedan, the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK2)|Jeep Grand Cherokee]] Trackhawk SUV, and as the [[Chrysler Hemi engine|Hellcrate]] engine swap kit. The inner driving light on the left front has been removed to allow air to get into the engine resulting in more torque, and the wheel wells are different from the standard SRT to accommodate the 20-inch aluminum wheels. The SRT Hellcat is equipped with two separate key fobs; use of the "black" fob limits engine output to {{convert|500|hp|abbr=on|0}}, while the "red" fob enables full output capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.autoblog.com/2014/07/16/2015-dodge-challenger-srt-hellcat-will-hit-199-mph-burn-1-5-gal/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000058 |title=2015 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat will hit 199 mph |website= Autoblog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hellcat has a quarter mile time of 10.85 seconds; this was accomplished with street legal drag tires.

}}

In 2016, there were no major changes introduced. Some Texas Dodge Dealers sold a limited edition version of the Hellcat, which were lowered about 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm in the back, 3&amp;nbsp;cm in the front, came with an upgraded supercharger which was dynamometer tested at between {{Convert|745 and 750|hp|0|abbr=on}} (readouts were packaged with the autos), featured 305/35 20 rear-wheel tires, and all vehicles were backed by a standard factory warranty. Most were white with black Carbon-fiber 'rally stripes', but a small number were red, with black carbon-fiber stripes. The upgraded models were 'sticker priced' at about $80,000. The program was terminated by Dodge, who announced the 2017 Challenger Hellcat with upgraded performance, and began work on The Demon model (which was not available for sale until the 2018 model year).

===2017 model year===
[[File:2017 Challenger GT in Graphite Crystal.jpg|thumb|left|2017 Challenger GT in Graphite Crystal. Note the higher stance of the Pursuit-based suspension.]] 
For the 2017 model year, a GT model was introduced with an [[all-wheel drive]] (AWD) version of the SXT Plus.&lt;ref name="GT AWD"&gt;[http://autoweek.com/article/car-reviews/2017-dodge-challenger-gt-first-drive-sacrilege-feels-right 2017 Dodge Challenger GT First Drive], autoweek.com, dated 30 January 2017, last accessed 2 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The Challenger GT uses the same AWD system and suspension as the [[Dodge Charger (LX)#2014 Dodge Charger Pursuit.2C Charger Pursuit V-8 AWD|Dodge Charger Pursuit]]. It is available exclusively with the 3.6-Liter V6 Pentastar engine and the 8-speed automatic transmission.

The AWD system includes both an active transfer case and front-axle disconnect system. The system defaults to rear-wheel drive (RWD) but can seamlessly transition between RWD and AWD if certain conditions are met, like low external temperature, rainfall, or loss of traction. No driver input is required.&lt;ref name="2017 Model Year"&gt;[http://www.dodge.com/2017/challenger/safety-security/index.html 2017 Dodge Challenger, Safety and Security, Advanced All-Wheel Drive], dodge.com, last accessed 17 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In Sport Mode, the car uses AWD exclusively. The AWD system in the Challenger GT is configured to be rear-biased (applies more power to the rear wheels). Only up to 38% of power is transferred to the front wheels.

Other model additions include the 5.7-liter V8 equipped T/A and 6.4-liter V8 equipped T/A 392 models. T/A models include a black painted hood with center air intake, black roof, black decklid, bodyside graphics, a cold-air induction system through the front head lamps similar to that used in the Challenger SRT Hellcat, Houndstooth cloth performance seats, and white-faced gauges. T/A 392 models include everything on T/A models in addition to the more powerful 6.4 L V8, six-piston front Brembo brakes with two-piece 15.4-inch vented/slotted rotors and 4-piston rear Brembo brakes, and 20x9.5-inch wheels with 275/40ZR20 tires. Every Challenger gains an updated Uconnect infotainment system; the optional 8.4-inch touchscreen with navigation adds multitouch gestures.

Models equipped with the 5.7-liter V8 now have an electronically controlled low-restriction active exhaust for a more aggressive exhaust note. Among the other additions are standard Houndstooth cloth seats on some models and revised paint choices. Green Go, Yellow Jacket, Destroyer Grey, and Octane Red are new colors, while White Knuckle and Contusion Blue are renamed carryovers.&lt;ref name="caranddriver.com"&gt;https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2018-dodge-challenger-in-depth-model-review&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2018 model year ===

Minor changes were made for the 2018 model year. For SXT and R/T models equipped with the 3.6-liter V6 and 5.7-liter V8, an all new Performance Handling Group package is available. This package adds 4-piston black Brembo brakes (a $500 option for red brake calipers is optional) in the front along with a Bilstein performance suspension, 20x9 inch wheels with 245/45ZR20 performance tires, and upgraded steering. The Challenger GT gains a new 19-inch wheel option while SXT Plus and R/T Plus trims equipped with the Super Trak package come with nappa leather and microsuede sport seats. The SXT, R/T, R/T Shaker, and T/A models receive a standard 7.0-inch Uconnect touchscreen. A backup camera is now standard.

The Demon is a limited production wide body and extreme ([[Drag racing|drag race]] level) performance variant of the already high performance Challenger SRT Hellcat. It debuted as the fastest and most powerful production car in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.topgear.com/car-news/top-gear-series-25/heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-dodge-demon|title=Everything you need to know about the Dodge Demon|last=|first=|date=2018-03-19|website=BBC Top Gear|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6001372/lifestyles-of-the-rich-and-the-famous-kyrgios-new-300k-toy/ "Lifestyles of the rich and the famous" --''Canberra Times'']&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[New York Auto Show#2017|New York Auto Show]] in April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=18158&amp;mid=1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Demon uses an all-new 6.2-liter V8 engine equipped with a 2.7-liter [[supercharger]], which is rated at {{convert|808|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} with 91 [[octane]] gasoline and {{Convert|840|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} with 100 octane fuel or higher (both outputs are with the red key fob supplied with the car). Torque stands at {{Convert|770|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} on 100 octane fuel. The car weighs {{Convert|215|lbs|kg|0|abbr=on}} less than the Hellcat, the total being {{Convert|4254|lbs|kg|0|abbr=on}}. The SRT Demon uses a set of road tires by [[Toyo Tire &amp; Rubber Company|Nitto Tire]], called the NT05R. The tires are the 315/40R18 variations at both front and rear. The tires are targeted for the drag strip, but have enough tread pattern to make them legal for the road. This tire, although an NT05R consumer tire, is a variation built specifically to withstand the power output of the Demon. This makes the Challenger SRT Demon the first production car to contain a set of drag radial road tires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/news/dodge-challenger-demon-record-wide-drag-racing-tires-article-1.2956247 |title=Dodge’s Challenger Demon gets record-wide drag racing tires|publisher=NYDailyNews |access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SRT Demon contains a system that is used specifically for drag racing called [[transbrake]], which is a mechanism that puts the transmission in 1st gear and the reverse gear simultaneously, holding the Demon stationary.&lt;ref name="Dodge Demon 1"/&gt; This is used along with the car's [[torque converter]] to build up hydraulic pressure before launch.

The power-to-weight ratio of the SRT Demon is {{convert|418|hp|kW PS|abbr=on|0}} per ton on 91 octane gasoline and {{convert|435|hp|kW PS|abbr=on|0}} per ton on 100 octane or higher.

The SRT Demon accelerates from {{Convert|0-30|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}} in 1.0 second, {{Convert|0-60|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}} in 2.3 seconds (2.0s with a rollout), {{Convert|0-100|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}} in 5.1 seconds, a top speed of {{Convert|168|mph|kph|abbr=on}} (factory limited), and the quarter mile (400 m) in only 9.65 seconds at {{Convert|140.09|mph|kph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hotrod.com/articles/2018-dodge-challenger-srt-demon-runs-9s-makes-840-hp/&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the Demon the [[List of fastest production cars by acceleration|fastest non-electric]] production car to reach 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph (0–97&amp;nbsp;km/h) and to complete a straight-line quarter mile at its time of announcement. The SRT Demon is also capable of accelerating at 1.8 G's of force at launch, making this the hardest launching production car.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Dodge|title=Demon Unleashed {{!}} Challenger SRT® Demon {{!}} Dodge|date=2017-04-11 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vD6A6NxySQ |accessdate=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boost pressure of the supercharger can be increased to 14.5 psi and redline up to 6,500 rpm. With this extreme power, and hard acceleration, the SRT Demon is the first production car to perform a [[wheelie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.autoblog.com/amp/2017/04/11/the-840-horsepower-2018-dodge-challenger-srt-demon-has-arrived/ |title=Inner Demon revealed: 840 hp and other jaw-dropping details|publisher=AutoBlog |access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the control module from the "Demon Crate" and high-speed tires, the Demon has attained a top speed of over {{convert|200|mph|kph|abbr=on}} in test runs.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/a27031798/dodge-challenger-srt-demon-top-speed-211-mph/&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the lack of an NHRA certified roll cage, which is required if the quarter mile time is under 10 seconds, the [[National Hot Rod Association|NHRA]] banned the SRT Demon from competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-shows/new-york-auto-show/news/a33207/how-you-can-drag-race-the-demon-despite-the-nhra-ban/ |title=How You Can Drag Race the Demon Despite the NHRA Ban |author=Sorokanich, Bob |magazine=[[Road &amp; Track]] |date=12 April 2017 |accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the SRT Hellcat, it comes with both red and black key fobs, with the black fob limiting the power output to {{convert|500|hp|0|abbr=on}}. With the red key and the use of 100+ octane gasoline, the Demon can utilize its full power potential. Only 3,300 cars were made, with production beginning in the summer of 2017 and market introduction happening in the fall of 2017.&lt;ref name="DODGEdemon"&gt;{{cite web|title=2018 Dodge Demon - Domestic.

The interior of the SRT Demon is the same as all other Challenger trims, but with changes that differentiate it to the other trims. The Demon only includes a front driver's seat as standard, and no other seats front or rear in the vehicle. However, the front passenger's seat, as well as a rear bench seat, can both be added back as options for one dollar each. To replace the rear seats, Dodge included rear roll bars, and has a 4-point harness installed on it for the driver seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://st.automobilemag.com/uploads/sites/11/2017/04/2018-Dodge-Challenger-SRT-Demon-interior-bars.jpg |title=Dodge Challenger SRT Demon (Interior Bars)|publisher=AutomobileMag|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dashboard display and the seats now have the Demon logo on them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tflcar.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2018-dodge-demon-srt-interior-1024x682.jpg |title=Dodge Challenger SRT Demon (Interior w/ Demon Logo)|publisher=TFLcar |access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.caricos.com/cars/d/dodge/2018_dodge_challenger_srt_demon/2560x1440/99.html |title=2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon (Photo #99)|publisher=Caricos |access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and includes a performance display on it, as well as on the center console touch screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEno4uHvHXg |title=Performance Pages - Challenger SRT® Demon - Dodge|publisher=YouTube (Dodge)|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Discontinuation ====
The last SRT Demon rolled off the assembly line in Brampton, Ontario, Canada on May 31, 2018. It was sold at a Barrett-Jackson auction in June 2018 alongside the final Dodge Viper.

=== 2019 model year ===
For the 2019 model year, Dodge released new high performance versions of the challenger, trimmed the line-up down to six models, and made numerous other tweaks and changes. The model line-up for 2019 includes the following trims: SXT, GT, R/T, R/T Scat Pack, SRT Hellcat, and SRT Hellcat Redeye. Both SXT and GT models are now available in both rear and all wheel drive, with the GT previously having been the only model available in AWD. GTs gain a more aggressive look with a performance hood, front splitter, steering and suspension while maintaining the optional performance handling group which includes wider wheels, performance summer tires, 4-piston Brembo brakes, and fixed-rate Bilstein suspension. The SXT model loses the performance handling group as an option, lacks the more aggressive exterior upgrades of the GT and has less aggressive gearing, making it the cheaper economical alternative. R/T Scat Pack models come with a new power-bulge aluminum hood standard. Shared with the SRT Hellcat, this hood features dual air extractors that cool the engine and help reduce lift. For 5.7L and 6.4L V8 R/T models, the rear seats can be deleted at the cost of $1 and have a net weight savings of 55 lbs. In addition, a second level of the performance handling group called the "performance plus package" is offered, providing 20-Inch x 9.5-inch low-gloss black forged wheels, 275/40ZR20 Pirelli P Zero summer tires, and a limited slip differential in addition to the upgrades found in the performance handling group which remains unchanged since its introduction in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=19971&amp;mid= |title=Press Kit: 2019 Dodge Challenger and Challenger SRT |publisher=[[FCA US]] |date= |accessdate=4 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SRT Hellcat:''' A slight increase in power is present for 2019, with horsepower rising to 717 and torque to 656 lb-ft. A new dual snorkel hood is introduced. Additionally, the 2019 model's starting price is more than $5,500 lower compared to the 2018 model. A 6-speed Tremec manual and ZF 8-speed automatic remain the sole transmission options.

[[File:2019 Dodge Challenger Hellcat Redeye (2), Cleveland Auto Show.jpg|thumb|2019 Challenger Hellcat Redeye at the Cleveland Auto Show]]

'''SRT Hellcat Redeye:''' Following the discontinuation of the Demon, the Redeye was developed to fill the void. Essentially a heavily upgraded Hellcat, the Redeye is equipped with a slightly less powerful (due to a smaller hood intake system) Demon engine: a supercharged 6.2L V8 rated at {{convert|797|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|707|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque, an increase of {{convert|90|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|11|lbft|0|abbr=on}} over the standard Hellcat motor. Other upgrades include reinforced ZF 8 speed automatic transmission, track-tuned suspension, Torque Reserve and 41-Spline Heavy-Duty Half-Shafts, SRT Power Chiller® and After-Run Chiller.

'''Scat Pack 1320 Package:''' Equipped with the 6.4L [[Chrysler Hemi Engine]] rated at {{convert|485|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|475|lbft|0|abbr=on}}, the Scat Pack 1320 adds 20-Inch x 9.5-Inch Low Gloss Black Drag Wheels, 275/40R20 102W drag radial tires, adaptive damping suspension, SRT-tuned drag suspension, air catcher headlamps, deletion of front and rear passenger seats, a special speed limited engine controller, extreme-duty 41-spline half shafts and a trans-brake. Specially developed Nexen 275/40R20l street-legal drag radial tires are available for better grip.

The Dodge Challenger R/T Scat Pack 1320 can be modified for NHRA competition in accordance with Stock and Super Stock class rules. It will feature a class weight break of 8.72 and carry a minimum weight of 3,400 pounds. Contestants intending to compete at an NHRA event must meet all regulations for the category entered.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dodgegarage.com/news/article/product/2019/04/licensed-to-drag.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Widebody Package:''' For the 2019 model year, buyers can order the Challenger Scat Pack, SRT Hellcat, and SRT Hellcat Redeye with the "Widebody Package".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/challenger/2019/2019-dodge-challenger-rt-scat-pack-392-widebody-hellcat-redeye-first-drive-review/&lt;/ref&gt; When purchased, the challenger gains the following:
* Widebody fender flares
* 20x11 Devils Rim forged aluminum wheels
* 305/35ZR20 Pirelli 3-season performance (P Zero Nero All Season) tires
* 3-mode Bilstein adaptive damping suspension uniquely tuned for competition use
* 6-piston calipers with 15.4 inch vented and slotted rotors in the front (standard on Hellcat and hellcat Redeye models)
* Stiffened anti-roll bars sized 34mm in front and 22mm rear (standard on Hellcat and hellcat Redeye models)

=== Limited production 3rd party variants ===
In addition to official Dodge concept cars, there have been numerous limited production and street legal variants created by third parties, based on stock cars that have been rebuilt with modified powertrains, suspensions, and interiors. These include the SMS 570 and (supercharged) 570X with up to a claimed {{convert|700|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, the Mr. Norm's Challengers with a claimed {{convert|637|or|900|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} horsepower, the supercharged SpeedFactory SF600R with around {{convert|600|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, the supercharged Richard Petty Signature Series with a claimed {{convert|610|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, and the Legacy by Petty Convertible Challenger completely customized by Petty's Garage to include a one of a kind front end and NASCAR styled treatments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?q=legacy+by+petty+convertible+challenger&amp;rls=com.microsoft:en-US:IE-SearchBox&amp;biw=1088&amp;bih=498&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u7eKVdSpOMut-AHB4azoBA&amp;ved=0CCgQ7Ak#imgrc=HO5GF4553DUJtM%253A%3BtVN-ZF3NM1ekrM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fcarphotos.cardomain.com%252Fstory_images%252F1%252F2673%252F3821%252F6681910003_large.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fautoholics.com%252F2012%252F10%252F30%252F-Richard-Petty-Challenger-Convertible-668191%3B900%3B599 Legacy by Petty Convertible Challenger]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allpar.com/cars/dodge/challenger/special-cars.html  | title=Special 2009–2011 Dodge Challenger cars  |publisher=allpar.com | accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Every year a handful (12 or less) of Challenger convertibles are created by various conversion companies. The cars cost close to $100,000.

[[File:Challenger Sebring.jpg|thumb|2017 Trans Am TA class Challenger at Sebring]]

The Challenger was introduced to the SCCA [[Trans Am Series]] in 1970. Two factory-backed cars were prepared by Ray Caldwell's Autodynamics and driven by [[Sam Posey]] and [[Tony Adamowicz]]. The No.77 car was built at Autodynamics from a street Challenger T/A that was taken from a local dealer showroom. The No.76 chassis arrived mid-season from Dan Gurney's All-American Racers, and was completed by Autodynamics.
* Dodge's early to mid-1970s factory-supported "Kit Car" program for short-track late-model stock car racing offered a choice of Challenger, and a few (less than 12) were made, but in 1974 Dodge ended the Challenger line and they went to the Dodge Dart Sports and Dodge Aspen bodies over a steel-tube chassis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.superbirdclub.com/earnhardtkitcar.html |title=Dale Earnhardt Tests the Chrysler Kit Car |publisher=superbirdclub.com |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Blackforest Motorsports has currently entered a Challenger in the [[Continental Challenge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.grand-am.com/schedule/entrylist.cfm?series=k&amp;eid=1502 |title=Event Information – Entry List |publisher=Grand-am.com |date=January 10, 2010 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110811062836/http://www.grand-am.com/schedule/entrylist.cfm?series=k&amp;eid=1502 |archivedate=August 11, 2011 |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Challenger R/T has been used as the Chrysler model for starting in [[2010 NASCAR Nationwide Series]] competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://nationwide.nascar.com/nationwide-series/2010/news/headlines/bg/07/01/nationwide.new.car.ford.mustang.dodge.challenger.nascar.roots/ |title=Dodge, Ford hope new cars mark return to NASCAR roots |publisher=Nascar.com |date=July 1, 2010 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100704043626/http://nationwide.nascar.com/nationwide-series/2010/news/headlines/bg/07/01/nationwide.new.car.ford.mustang.dodge.challenger.nascar.roots |archivedate=July 4, 2010 |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Dodge officially out of NASCAR at the end of the 2012 season, the remaining cars and racing parts have been bought up by "privateer" racing teams and continue to show up in [[Nationwide Series]] during the 2013 and 2014 seasons. [[J. J. Yeley]] indicated his two-car team would continue to field a Challenger in the series for as long as he can find parts to keep the cars running. The team stopped after the 2014 season after his No. 93 (later No. 28) regularly ran in the top-20 during races, though the [[Mike Harmon]]-owned No. 74 and the [[Derek White (racing driver)|Derek White]]-operated No. 40 qualified and ran Dodges in 2015. [[Mike Harmon Racing]] ran a Dodge the entire season and also did so in 2016, and has raced in over half of the 2017 season so far. Likewise, White's [[MBM Motorsports]] team fielded the Nos. 13 and 40 as Dodges in some races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jayski.com/news/nxs/2016/story/_/page/2016nxs-teamchart|title=2016 NASCAR XFINITY Series Team Chart|work=[[Jayski's Silly Season Site]]|accessdate=March 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202034351/http://www.jayski.com/news/nxs/2016/story/_/page/2016nxs-teamchart|archive-date=December 2, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; MBM continues to field Dodges into 2018 with Timmy Hill in the 66 (was the 13).

In late 2014 two Challengers fielded by Miller Racing with the support of SRT and [[Mopar]] driven by Cameron Lawrence and Joe Stevens started racing in the [[Trans-Am Series]]'s TA2 class.  Both cars used a spec Howe road racing tube chassis with fiberglass bodies. Powered by a Hemi 392 slightly modified for road racing extremes and restricted by class rules, the cars made around 500 horsepower. Except for slightly bulged fenders and large rear wing, the cars look very much like the stock/street version, despite being roughly 7/8s the size of the road car. Lawrence won four of 12 races in the 2015 season, finishing third overall in the Trans Am TA2 championship. 
Joe Stevens in the No. 11 "Green Car" finished sixth overall after a fourth place at the season finale at Daytona International Speedway.  Joe Stevens also received the Cool Shirt Hard Charger award for his excellent rookie season performance. For the 2016 season, the Stevens-Miller Team fielded three Challengers in the TA2 series and ran in 16 events, scoring a few wins.  The No. 77 car was painted in a throw-back paint scheme very similar to the 1970 No. 77 car driven by [[Sam Posey]]. The No. 12 car occasionally fielded a blue scheme paying tribute to the Plymouth Cuda Trans-Am car driven by [[Swede Savage]].

In March 2017 the Challenger returned to the TA class in Trans-Am at Sebring after a nearly 40-year absence from Trans-Am's fastest class of racing.  It was driven by Jeff Hinkle under the American V8 Road Racing team with John Debenedictis as crew chief. The car was orange and purple with stripes of many of the other challenger colors to celebrate the current stable of street cars.  It is powered by a Penske Engines Mopar R5 / P7 carburated motor producing {{convert|855|hp|0|abbr=on}}. In its debut it qualified 16th and finished 9th out of a field of 24.

At all [[Superbike World Championship]] races held in the United States, Fiat's Alfa Romeo safety car is replaced with Chrysler's Dodge Challenger.

The '''Dodge LCF''' (for "'''L'''ow '''C'''ab '''F'''orward") was a series of medium- and heavy-duty trucks built by [[Dodge]] from 1960 until 1976. They replaced the [[Dodge Forward Look]] range of [[cabover]] trucks built in the fifties. The 500 through 700 series were medium duty only, while 800 through 1000 series were reserved for heavy-duty versions.

LCF range was also sold in Canada with the [[Fargo Trucks|Fargo]] badge.&lt;ref name=Sweptline&gt;{{cite web | last = Wickstead | first = Kris | title = Dodge Big Rigs | url = http://www.sweptline.com/hist/bigtrucks.html | work = The '61–'71 Dodge Truck Website | publisher = Sweptline.com | accessdate = 2011-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, following [[Chrysler Corporation]] policy of [[Rebadging|badge engineering]] to provide a greater number of sales outlets overseas, LCFs were also marketed in some countries with the [[De Soto (automobile)|De Soto]] badge.

LCF cabin section was taken directly from the 1956–1960 [[Dodge C series|range of Dodge pickup trucks]], with its panoramic windshield, but was fitted with a unique front section. One of the Dodge LCF's main selling points was accessibility; the sides of the engine compartment and fenders being arranged to swing open. A mechanic could easily stand between the engine and the front wheel while working.&lt;ref name=Dodgetruck&gt;{{cite web | first = Kyle | last = Youngblood | title = Dodge LCF/HCF | url = http://www.olddodges.com/cseries.htm | accessdate = 2011-08-23 | work = Dodge Trucks of the 60's and 70's }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A range of Dodge and [[International Harvester]] gasoline engines were available, as were diesels from [[Perkins Engines|Perkins]] (for lighter variants), [[Cummins]], [[Caterpillar Inc|Caterpillar]], and [[Detroit Diesel]] for the heaviest duty versions, both [[Straight-six engine|six-cylinder]] and V8 versions. Gasoline-powered versions were simply called the "C" series, followed by a numeral indicating weight class, and all of them were [[V8 engine|V8]]-powered. Perkins diesel-engined units were called "PC", while inline diesels were called "CN" and V-type diesels were "CV". A "T" following the letters indicates a tandem rear axle. On LCFs equipped with inline-six [[Diesel engine|diesels]] the engine intruded into the cabin. This was covered with a removable panel for maintenance.&lt;ref name=Dodgetruck/&gt; A near unlimited range of engines, transmissions, and rear axles were available for what was usually a built-to-order truck. The biggest diesel available was the Cummins V-903, a giant {{convert|14794|cc|cid|0|disp=flip|abbr=on}} unit with a modest {{convert|289|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} max output. The smaller {{convert|9299|cc|cid|0|disp=flip|abbr=on}} [[Detroit Diesel Series 71|Detroit Diesel 8V-71N]] was the most powerful engine, with {{convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} on tap.&lt;ref name="73 heavy duty"&gt;{{ citation | title = Dodge Trucks: Heavy-Duty LCF Diesel Models | publisher = Chrysler Motors Corporation |date=September 1972 | url = http://www.olddodges.com/literature/cseries/cnt900-1.jpg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Dodge pulling out of the heavy truck business, the C series' last year in the US market was 1975. A few hundred more CNT800's and CNT900's were exported in 1976 as [[Complete knock down|CKD kits]] to Latin American countries, where the last units were assembled until 1978.&lt;ref name=Sweptline/&gt;

The '''Dodge Charger''' is a [[full-size]] four-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]], introduced first at the 2005 North American Auto Show and built by [[FCA US LLC]], a subsidiary of [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]]. It is available in [[rear-wheel drive]] or [[all-wheel drive]] drivetrains. The Charger was developed to continue the [[Dodge Charger]] line with its [[muscle car]] heritage, and replaced the [[Dodge Intrepid]] as Dodge's full-size sedan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=22048 |title=Compare Side-by-Side |publisher=Fueleconomy.gov |date= |accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second-generation Charger debuted for the 2011 [[Model year#United States|model year]].

==History==
The first Charger was a 1964 show car based on the [[Dodge Polara]] and fitted with a [[Chrysler RB engine|426 Wedge]] [[V8 engine]]. The first production Charger, based on the [[Dodge Coronet]], was introduced as a 1966 model. There were several different vehicles bearing the Charger nameplate built on three different [[Car platform|platform]]s and sizes, all bearing the Charger nameplate. Although the name is associated with the late-1960s performance model in the Dodge range, it was also used on [[personal luxury]] coupes during the late-1970s and on front-wheel drive [[Dodge Charger (L-body)|subcompact hatchbacks]] during the 1980s.

In 1999, Dodge introduced a new [[Dodge Charger R/T (1999 concept)|Charger R/T concept car]]. It took many styling cues from the 1960s Chargers, sharing their long nose and rearward cab, but was shorter at {{convert|187|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, compared to {{convert|203|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} for the 1966 Charger. It was also {{convert|650|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} lighter. It featured a four-door sedan body design, whereas all the previous production Chargers had two doors.

It was a return to a rear wheel drive sedan platform Dodge had not offered since the mid-size [[Dodge Diplomat]] had been discontinued in 1989.

Both the SXT and R/T models were available in rear and all-wheel drive drive trains starting in 2007. The [[All-wheel drive|AWD]] system is derived from the [[Mercedes-Benz]] [[4Matic]] technology. The AWD system is engaged all the time, routing approximately 60% of the power to the rear wheels and 40% of the power to the front wheels. The 2009 Charger AWD utilized the [[BorgWarner#TorqTransfer Systems|Torque-on-Demand]] system manufactured by [[BorgWarner]] which disconnects the front axles until extra traction is needed. This results in a slight boost in fuel economy while retaining the same maximum power split to the front wheels.

After three years of production, an update for 2009 models was made. This included moving the rear decklid's "CHARGER" badge from the left to the right, making way for "DODGE" at the left. Tail lamps were also revised. 2008 models had seen minor revisions to the interior (a new center console and switchgear changes).

The Charger ''SE'' and ''SXT'' are equipped with [[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.5|Chrysler's 3.5 L V6]], rated at {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|250|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. In Canada, the base model Charger has a 2.7 L V6, which is rated at {{convert|178|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|190|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. In 2006, the 2.7 L V6 was also available in the U.S. for fleet sales only. For 2007, the SE package could be had with the 2.7 L engine for all buyers. The Canadian SXT model included the 3.5 L V6.

The ''R/T'' version uses the [[Chrysler Hemi engine#5.7|5.7 L Hemi V8 engine]]. From 2006 to 2008, this engine was rated at {{convert|340|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|390|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. For 2009, Variable Camshaft Timing was added, raising power output levels to {{convert|368|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|395|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque respectively.

The ''SRT8'' model comes with the [[Chrysler Hemi engine#6.1|{{convert|370|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} Hemi V8]], which is rated at {{convert|425|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|420|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://runbidsell.com/resources/2010-dodge-charger-srt8/ |title=2010 Dodge Charger SRT8 Technical Specs|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SRT-8===

{{See also|Street and Racing Technology}}
An '''SRT8''' version of the Charger debuted at the 2005 [[New York International Auto Show]]. Powered by a {{convert|425|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} version of the ''[[Chrysler Hemi engine#6.1|{{convert|370|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} Hemi]]'', it also featured upgraded [[Brembo]] brakes, and interior and exterior updates. The engine produces {{convert|420|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,800 rpm. The 425 [[Horsepower#SAE net power|SAE net horsepower]] of the modern 6.1 L Hemi makes it even more powerful than the [[Chrysler Hemi engine]]s of the [[muscle car]] era, the biggest of which was rated at 425 [[Horsepower#SAE gross power|SAE gross horsepower]]. This made the 6.1 L Hemi engine the most powerful [[V8 engine]] that [[Chrysler]] had put in a production vehicle up to that point. The SRT8 can accelerate from {{convert|0-60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 4.8 seconds (5.0 average).&lt;ref name="caranddriver.com"&gt;Page 11: [http://www.caranddriver.com/features/the-quickest-sedans-of-2008-30000-to-40000-2008-dodge-charger-srt8-page-11 The Quickest Sedans of 2008: $30,000 to $40,000 - Car Comparison - Feature Article - Page 11], accessdate: 20. tammikuuta 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2007 Dodge Charger SRT8 Super Bee.jpg|thumb|left|Dodge Charger SRT8 Super Bee]]
A new '''Super Bee''' version of the Charger debuted at the 2006 [[New York International Auto Show]] for the 2007 model year. It shared the SRT-8's {{convert|425|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|370|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[Chrysler Hemi engine#6.1|Hemi]] engine, but was available in a special "Detonator Yellow" paint with black decals. It is a limited edition with only 1,000 being produced. A B5 Blue version of the Super Bee was shown at the 2007 North American International Auto Show and went on sale in early 2008, also with a limited run of 1,000. A total of 425 Hemi Orange Super Bees were built in 2009. In 2011, it was announced that the Super Bee will be returning as a 2012 model on the redesigned Dodge Charger with the 392 HEMI engine in "Stinger Yellow" and "Pitch Black"&lt;ref name="Allpar-2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.allpar.com/index.php/2011/11/new-special-editions-from-srt-anddodge-12522 |title=New special editions from SRT and Dodge at Allpar Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep News |publisher=Allpar.com |date=November 9, 2011 |accessdate=June 3, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927103115/http://news.allpar.com/index.php/2011/11/new-special-editions-from-srt-anddodge-12522 |archive-date=September 27, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 2,180 Charger DUB Edition cars were produced for the U.S. market. They carried a MSRP of $30,999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://carscoop.blogspot.com/2008/04/chrysler-300c-dodge-charger-dub-edition.html |title=Chrysler 300 &amp; Dodge Charger "Dub Edition" |publisher=Carscoop.blogspot.com |date=April 23, 2008 |accessdate=October 4, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725025928/http://carscoop.blogspot.com/2008/04/chrysler-300c-dodge-charger-dub-edition.html |archive-date=July 25, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety===
The [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] gives the Charger an overall ''Good'' score in frontal crash tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=240 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Chrysler 300 |publisher=Iihs.org |date=November 25, 2008 |accessdate=May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In side impacts Charger models equipped with optional side airbags are given a ''Marginal'' score overall, and models without side airbags are given the lowest overall ''Poor'' score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=664 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Chrysler 300 |publisher=Iihs.org |date=November 25, 2008 |accessdate=May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=661 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Chrysler 300 |publisher=Iihs.org |date=October 23, 2007 |accessdate=May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gives the Charger five stars on passenger, driver, and rear passenger crash test ratings and four stars in regard to side impact rating.

All models come standard with [[electronic stability program]] (ESP) (except in 2.7L V6 cars where it is optional) with ABS and all speed [[traction control]].

===NASCAR===
[[File:Kahne in CoT at Richmond 2008.jpg|thumb|right|NASCAR Sprint Cup's newest Dodge car design "The COT" (Car of Tomorrow), driven by [[Kasey Kahne]]]]
[[File:Dodge Charger NASCAR.jpg|thumb|left|Dodge Charger NASCAR]]

Racecars based on the Charger were campaigned by several NASCAR [[Sprint Cup Series|Sprint Cup]] teams starting in 2005 through to 2012.  Although [[NASCAR]] [[stock car]]s bear only a slight resemblance to actual street cars, Dodge's 2005 and 2006 NASCAR entries were based on the Charger silhouette, replacing the previous Dodge Intrepid. Unlike the Intrepid, the Charger shares [[rear-wheel drive]] and a [[V8 engine]] with its NASCAR counterparts.

During the 2007 NASCAR season the Charger was used in all non [[Car of Tomorrow]] races and the [[Dodge Avenger]] was used in all [[Car of Tomorrow]] races. The Car of Tomorrow was used exclusively in 2008. However, the Avenger Car of Tomorrow was redesignated as a Charger R/T through the use of different decals. The decals have been revised again for 2011–2012 to reflect the updated nose and tail styling of the production Charger, including the full-width taillight panel.

Though the car was successful in ''Sprint Cup'' competition fewer teams were running Dodge's from 2007 and on. This would lead Dodge and Ram abandoning its NASCAR (Sprint, Nationwide, and Camping World Truck-series) factory support efforts at the end of the 2012 season.  For the 2012 NASCAR season, [[Penske Racing]] was the only full-time team champaigning Dodges (the #2 and #22 Chargers) in the [[Sprint Cup Series|Sprint Cup]], and their #2 [[Miller Lite]] Dodge (driven by Brad Kesolowski) won the NASCAR Sprint Cup Championship.  Despite winning the Sprint Cup and producing the new 2013 version of the NASCAR Charger, Penske Racing switched to Ford for the 2013 season, ending Dodge's second tenure in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.

[[File:2013 Dodge Charger Daytona (8402980977).jpg|thumb|left|Interior]]

The 2011 LD Charger underwent both exterior and interior changes, taking some styling cues from the 1968–1970 models.&lt;ref name="caranddriver2"&gt;Car and Driver: [http://www.caranddriver.com/spy-shots/2011-dodge-charger-spied 2011 Dodge Charger - Spied - Car and Driver], accessdate: 20. tammikuuta 2016&lt;/ref&gt; It features a completely new body with the most striking changes being the redesigned fascia and hood section,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2011 Dodge Charger |url= http://www.leftlanenews.com/dodge-charger-2011.html |accessdate=June 17, 2010 |date=June 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; modified "racetrack" vintage-style taillights and a new dashboard. Silver aluminum wheels became standard equipment over plastic hubcaps. 

===Powertrain===
The new 3.6 L [[Chrysler Pentastar engine|Pentastar]] V6 engine replaced the 2.7 L V6 engine as well as the 3.5 L High-Output V6 engine. The 3.6 L Pentastar has [[variable valve timing]], which is a technology that adjusts the timing of the intake and/or exhaust valves. The engine uses a [[timing chain]], not a belt. The [[exhaust manifold]] is cast directly into the [[cylinder head]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://australiancar.reviews/3-6L_Pentastar_V6.php 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine (2010-16)]. ''AustralianCar.Reviews''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Charger was built alongside the 2011 Challenger SRT8 392 and Chrysler 300C. Engines are available with both the 5-speed and 8-speed automatic transmissions.

===2012===
From 2012 model year the 3.6 L engine was available with an 8-speed automatic that improves fuel economy by 4-mpg on the highway.
The 3.6 liter Pentastar V6 is rated at {{convert|292|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|260|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque, the 5.7 liter V8 delivers {{convert|370|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|395|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque, and the new 6.4 liter V8 is rated at {{convert|470|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|470|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque.  According to the October 2011 issue of [[Motor Trend]], the Dodge Charger SRT-8, weighing {{convert|4361|lb|abbr=on}}, accelerates from 0-{{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 4.3 seconds, and completes the quarter mile (~400 m) in 12.8 seconds at {{convert|110|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. It is mechanically identical to the [[Chrysler 300#SRT-8 2|Chrysler 300 SRT-8]].

====Charger SRT8====
The Charger SRT8 returned as 2012 model, which was previewed at the 2011 Chicago Auto Show. Chrysler began putting the Dodge logo with slanted red rectangles on the grilles of the SRT8 halfway through the 2012 model year.

====Charger Mopar Designs Edition====
[[File:Mopar11.jpg|thumb|Mopar 11 Dodge Charger grille emblem and stripe]]

In 2011 Dodge introduced the Dodge Charger [[R/T]] [[Mopar]] 11 Edition. In the Mopar Edition, there are several appearance and performance changes to set it apart from the rest of the production models that year. The Mopar edition came only in the ”Pitch Black“ exterior color with a Mopar blue driver side stripe and a Mopar grille badge instead of an "[[R/T]]" badge. The interior is finished in the same black as seen on the outside except for a splash of chrome and carbon fiber dash and center console, along with a pistol grip shifter.  The Mopar blue stripe is carried to the interior as a part of the driver's front seat and the left side rear passenger seat.  The performance of the Mopar edition Charger is improved with the Super Track Pack, a 3.91 final drive gear ratio, a 3 mode traction control, heavy duty brakes, larger stability bars, front and rear strut tower bars, and a sport tuned steering rack.

====Recalls====
9,688 2011 and 2012 Dodge Charger police vehicles were recalled for overheated lighting harness connector causing low beams to fail, and an overheated power distribution center could result in a loss of the vehicle's anti-lock braking and stability control systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Chris Paukert RSS feed Google+ |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/02/13/nearly-10-000-dodge-charger-police-cars-recalled/ |title=Nearly 10,000 Dodge Charger police cars recalled |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=2012-02-13 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 7, 2012, a recall announcement was made by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) regarding loss of anti-lock brakes and stability control as a result of an overheated fuse in the PCD. This failure could lead to loss of vehicle control, which increases crash risk. Over 127,350 Chrysler 300s and Dodge Chargers were recalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Chrysler recalls 127,350 Dodge Chargers, Chrysler 300s |url=https://news.yahoo.com/chrysler-recalls-127-350-dodge-chargers-chrysler-300s-133846321--sector.html |accessdate=May 7, 2012 |date=May 8, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510103326/http://news.yahoo.com/chrysler-recalls-127-350-dodge-chargers-chrysler-300s-133846321--sector.html |archivedate=May 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the new cars received positive reviews by the automotive press and in track testing, attempts by Dodge Motorsports to get other teams to switch to the new Charger for 2013 came to naught, and Dodge folded its NASCAR racing efforts in all series except the [[NASCAR Pinty's Series]], which is dominated by Dodge cars.

====Dodge Charger Juiced====
The Dodge Charger Juiced is based on Dodge Charger, with Mopar (650&amp;nbsp;hp) crate [[Viper engine|Viper V10 engine]], Mopar cold air intake and Mopar cat-back exhaust, Mopar front chin spoiler, Mopar Performance prototype hood (with a functional forward-facing intake), roof in a darker matte version of the custom Metallic "Copperhead" body colour, unique Mopar matte black hood graphics and decklid graphics, body-color split cross hair grille with a Mopar grille badge, Mopar-exclusive 20-inch lightweight wheels trimmed in matte black with an accent "Copperhead" stripe, unique black Katzkin leather seats with touches of "Copperhead" color, "Copperhead" color stitching at the steering wheel, shifter and armrest; a "Copperhead" embroidered on the seatbacks, aluminum instrument panel bezel in matte black, Mopar logo door-sill guards, Mopar logo premium carpet floor mats, Mopar pistol-grip shifter.

[[File:Dodge Charger Autox (26957760722).jpg|left|thumb|Rear]]

Unveiled at the 2014 [[New York International Auto Show]], the 2015 Dodge Charger received a substantial makeover, the most noticeable change coming in the new front grille and rounded LED headlights. Retaining its [[Coke bottle styling]] Dodge claims to have reworked just about every panel on the car; made to look "leaner and more athletic" than its previous look while keeping the same dimensions.&lt;ref name="caranddriver3"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Swan|first=Tony|title=2015 Dodge Charger|url= http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2015-dodge-charger-photos-and-info-news |magazine=Car and Driver |date=April 2014 |accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dodge is reported to have used the 1969 Charger as its inspiration for the remodeling.

The engines include the {{convert|370|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler Hemi engine|Chrysler 5.7 liter Hemi V8]] and the {{convert|292|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.6 liter [[V6 engine|V6]]. The V6 model is [[EPA#Fuel economy|EPA-rated]] at 31MPG or 7.6L/100&amp;nbsp;km which is claimed by the manufacturer to be the best in its class. Except for the Police Pursuit version (which retains the 5 speed automatic), the only available transmission is the Chrysler eight-speed automatic, coupled with optional all-wheel drive. The all-wheel drive system will automatically remove drive to the front axle when not required, giving an improvement in fuel economy. The new electronic gearshift with optional paddle shifters gives shift times of as little as 0.25 seconds in sport mode.&lt;ref name=caranddriver /&gt;

The reworked interior includes new materials for the door, console and dash panels, a new steering wheel and seats, and a wide range of trim packages with both leather and cloth seating.&lt;ref name=caranddriver /&gt; The refreshed interior also features a new instrument cluster featuring a 7-inch (180mm) TFT (Thin Film Transistor) display. The available 8.4 inch Uconnect touchscreen radio with available navigation has been revised, now including Uconnect Apps. Mechanically, the 3.6L Pentastar V6 and the 5.7L/6.4L HEMI engines remained the same. All engines are now backed by the [[ZF 8HP transmission|ZF 8HP]] 8-Speed Automatic transmissions co-produced by ZF (previously only V6 models used the ZF 8-speed). There have been revisions to the chassis components, including Electric Assist Power Steering, which replaces the previous models Electro-Hydraulic Assist Power Steering. New aluminum rear differentials now use 4 mounting bolts for rigidity. AWD is no longer available on 5.7L R/T models.

The 2015 Dodge Charger went on sale starting December 2014 in the US and Canada.

====Charger SRT 392====
The SRT 392 Hemi is a 6.4 liter V8 making {{convert|485|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|475|lb·ft|N·m}} of torque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.autobytel.com/dodge/charger/2015/srt-392-rwd/specifications/ |title=2015 Dodge Charger - SRT 392 RWD Specifications |work=autobytel.com |accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Charger SRT 392 also comes with 20-inch forged aluminum wheels, 15.4-inch brake rotors out front, and 13.8-inch rear brake rotors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drivesrt.com/2015/charger-srt/|title=2015 Dodge Charger SRT - driveSRT|work=SRT|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Charger R/T Scat Pack====
The Charger R/T Scat Pack essentially takes the place of the former SRT8 Super Bee in the Charger lineup. The powertrain of the SRT 392 is present, as are the front and rear bumpers, but leather upholstery is optional (as opposed to standard), the suspension uses fixed rate Bilstein shocks, the brakes are slightly smaller, and the wheel and tire package is narrower. The Scat pack shares its exterior look with the Charger Hellcat and features a narrow grille, a hood scoop, tinted headlamps and 20-inch forged wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/autos-large/2019-dodge-charger-r-t-scat-pack-review/ar-AADRd7L|title=2019 Dodge Charger R/T Scat Pack: Review|date=2019-07-04|first=Perry|last=Stern|publisher=[[MSN]]|accessdate=2019-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2020, a "Widebody Package" is newly available for the Charger R/T Scat Pack, but replaces the normal body Charger Hellcat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motor1.com/news/358934/charger-hellcat-non-widebody-discontinued/|title=Dodge Charger Hellcat Non-Widebody Is Dead, Long Live The Widebody|work=[[Motorsport Network#Automotive Businesses|Motor1.com]]|last=Alaniz|first=Anthony|date=9 July 2019|accessdate=9 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The package mirrors that of the Challenger Widebody. When purchased, the Charger gains the following:
* Widebody fender flares
* 20x11 Devils Rim forged aluminum wheels
* 305/35ZR20 Pirelli 3-season performance tires
* 3-mode Bilstein adaptive damping suspension uniquely tuned for competition use
* 6-piston calipers with 15.4 inch vented and slotted rotors in the front (standard on Hellcat models)

==Police package version==
[[File:2006 Michigan State Police Dodge Charger 1.jpg|thumb|Dodge Charger of the [[Michigan State Police]]]]
In early 2006, [[Chrysler Group LLC|DaimlerChrysler]] released a new [[police car|police version]] of the Charger. It made its debut at the 2005 [[New York International Auto Show]]. Unlike the civilian version, the police version features upgraded heavy-duty brakes, a severe-duty cooling system, police-performance [[Electronic Stability Control|Electronic Stability Program]], police performance-tuned steering, and a gear shifter that is mounted on the steering column instead of in the center console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fleet.chrysler.com/v7fleet/StaticFiles/files/BuyerGuides/MY13_Charger_Pursuit_Buyer_Guide.pdf |title=MY13 Charger Pursuit Buyer Guide |publisher=Fleet Chrysler |accessdate=May 1, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324064332/https://www.fleet.chrysler.com/v7fleet/StaticFiles/files/BuyerGuides/MY13_Charger_Pursuit_Buyer_Guide.pdf |archivedate=March 24, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In place of the center console, Dodge has equipped the police edition with an aluminum plate appropriate for mounting radio equipment, computers, and controllers for lights and sirens. The vehicle's electrical system is specifically designed for integration of siren and light controls, and other police vehicle accessories. The Charger is in use with many American, Canadian, and Mexican police organizations.

The {{convert|340|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} Hemi V8 is powerful enough to accelerate the car from 0 to {{convert|60|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} in 6.0 seconds and to a top speed of {{convert|152|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Police Vehicle Evaluation Model Year 2013, Michigan State Police Training Division, Nov 2009, p. 30-33&lt;/ref&gt; In Michigan State Police testing, the Charger V8 easily outperformed all other pursuit vehicles in acceleration, cornering, and braking (except the [[Dodge Magnum]] and V6 Charger, which stopped slightly faster in some tests) in the first five years since its introduction.&lt;ref&gt;Police Vehicle Evaluation Model Year 2010 (and ibids 2006–2009), Michigan State Police Training Division, Nov 2009 (and related dates for ibids), p. 30-40 for 2010 publication&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charger is in use with numerous police agencies in North America as both a marked and an unmarked patrol car. Law enforcement agencies outside of the U.S. have also purchased the Charger, including police services in Canada, Mexico, [[Chile]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIvRAqAKaQo|title=Dodge Charger Police Interceptor Carabineros de Chile|first=|last=CarsyTuning|date=April 1, 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Czech Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://pardubicky.denik.cz/zpravy_region/straznici-v-bohdanci-maji-novou-posilu-dodge.html |title=Strážníci v Bohdanči mají posilu. Dodge Charger - Pardubický deník |publisher=Pardubicky.denik.cz |language=Czech |date=5 December 2011 |accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Middle East]], including [[Bahrain]], [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=US donates 97 vehicles to ISF |publisher=Now Lebanon | url = https://now.mmedia.me/lb/en/archive/us_donates_97_vehicles_to_isf_ |accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both V6 and V8 models are used by the Police forces, with highway patrols favoring the {{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[Chrysler Hemi engine|Hemi]] V8 engine and cities more likely to purchase the base police package with the 3.5 L V6 fuel-efficient engine.{{citation needed|reason=need a source confirming that assertion|date=October 2019}} The Charger is also in service with the U.S. federal government and in its military police services.

For 2009, the base Charger police car came with the 3.5 L V6 and a 5-speed [[automatic transmission]]. The rear is slightly updated, moving the "CHARGER" badge to the right, and replacing the left with the badge reading "DODGE." The V8 version uses HEMI V8 engine shared with the Charger Daytona R/T, rated at {{convert|370|hp}} and {{convert|395|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque.

When the Charger was redesigned for the 2011 model year, the police package version was renamed Dodge Charger Pursuit. In mid-2014, All Wheel Drive (with a mandatory 5.7 L Hemi V8) became optional, along with a BR9 brake package. In 2012, the Dodge Charger Pursuit replaced the [[Ford Crown Victoria]] as the #1 police sedan in North America following the latter's discontinuation, with the AWD Ford Explorer Interceptor soon becoming the #1 selling police vehicle. For the 2015 model year, the Dodge Charger Pursuit also received a facelift like its regular version. By 2017, however, the Charger Pursuit and Explorer Interceptor essentially shared the sales award, as sales of the ultra high performance AWD Charger rapidly increased.

==Production==
The Dodge Charger is assembled at the [[Brampton Assembly|Brampton plant]] in [[Brampton, Ontario]], Canada. The Charger shared the [[Chrysler LX platform|LX platform]] with the [[Chrysler 300]], the newer fourth generation [[Dodge Challenger]], and the discontinued [[Dodge Magnum]].

The '''Banks Sidewinder''' is a [[land speed record]] vehicle that was built by [[Gale Banks Engineering]] in 2001. Based on a [[Dodge Dakota]] [[pickup truck]], the Banks Sidewinder became the fastest pickup ever when it set a speed record of {{convert|213.583|mph|km/h|3|abbr=on}} at [[Bonneville Salt Flats|Bonneville]] in October 2001.


==Sidewinder Dodge Dakota Pickup==
One of the fastest roadgoing vehicles, the Gale Banks Built [[Dodge Dakota]] has broken many speed and quarter mile records and is used as the shop truck for Gale Banks own company.

===Overview===

In 2002, a 5.9 L [[Cummins]] diesel-powered pickup, modified by [[Gale Banks]] and his company [[Gale Banks Engineering]] set an [[FIA]]-certified [[land speed record]] at the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] with a one-way pass of 222-mph and a combined two-way speed of 217-mph. This record-breaking and street-legal vehicle was driven on the highway to Bonneville from [[Southern California]] and pulled its own service trailer, defying the modern racing tradition of competition vehicles being transported via trailer for legality and vehicle wear-and-tear reasons. During this trip, the Sidewinder Dakota achieved fuel economy figures of 23.6-mpg while in highway driving trim.

===Modifications===
Starting with a stock 5.9L Cummins straight-six engine that produced approximately 393-horsepower, Gale Banks Engineering extensively modified the engine, adding a variable geometry (VGT) [[Holset Engineering|Holset]] turbocharger, water-cooled intercooler, and six-speed transmission from [[New Venture Gear]]. The [[Dodge]] Dakota’s firewall was moved back approximately 18-inches to accommodate the new high performance engine, which now tested on the dyno at 735-horsepower with 1300&amp;nbsp;lb-ft of torque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bankspower.com/magazines/show/513-Banks-Sidewinder-The-Worlds-Fastest-Pickup |title=Banks Sidewinder: The World's Fastest Pickup! |publisher=PickupTruck.com |date=February 2003 |accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 300-mph speed-rated tires were also added to safely get the power to the ground.

===Summary===
The Gale Banks Engineering Cummins-powered Dodge Dakota is the world’s-fastest diesel or gasoline-powered pickup truck and still holds the [[FIA]] record as of late 2009. It is currently on display at the NHRA Museum [[National Hot Rod Association]] as part of their "Gale Banks: The First 50 Years" temporary exhibit.

The '''Dodge Colt'''  is a [[subcompact car]] manufactured by [[Mitsubishi Motors]] and marketed by [[Dodge]] for model years 1971-1994 as [[captive import]]s.  [[Badge engineering|Badge engineered]] variants included the  '''Plymouth Champ''' and '''Plymouth Colt''', marketed by [[Plymouth automobile|Plymouth]].

The Colt was initially a rebadged variant of the rear-wheel drive [[Mitsubishi Galant|Galant]] and [[Mitsubishi Lancer|Lancer]] families before shifting to the smaller front-wheel drive [[Mitsubishi Mirage]] subcompacts in 1979.

[[File:1973DodgeColt.jpg|thumb|left|1973 Dodge Colt HT Coupe]] Introduced in 1970 as model year 71, the first generation Dodge Colt was a federalized first generation [[Mitsubishi Galant#A51|Mitsubishi Colt Galant]]. Available as a two-door pillared coupe, two-door hardtop, 4-door sedan, and 5-door wagon, the Colt had a {{convert|1597|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on}} four-cylinder engine. The unibody layout was traditional, front engine and rear-wheel drive with [[MacPherson strut|MacPherson]] struts in front and a live rear axle. Standard transmission was a four-speed manual, with a three-speed automatic being an option. The engine initially produced 100&amp;nbsp;hp, but this dropped to 83 in 1972 when stricter emissions standards took effect. For 1973 a sporty GT hardtop coupe was added, featuring rally stripes, sport wheels and a center console amongst other features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Standard Catalog of Imported Cars, 1946-1990 | author = James M.

Based on the underpinnings of the first generation model, Galant sedans and coupes received a new, somewhat rounder body in 1973, while wagons continued with the old body and new nose. The new version, with single headlights rather than the doubles of the previous generation, became the 1974 Dodge Colt in the US, available in the same bodystyles as the first one. The base engine also remained the same, but a larger [[Mitsubishi Astron engine#4G52|G52B "Astron"]] engine became optionally available (standard in the GT coupe). This one develops {{convert|96|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5500&amp;nbsp;rpm. Ratings varied from {{convert|79|-|83|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the smaller one and {{convert|89|-|96|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the larger engine in different publications.&lt;ref name="scimp1"&gt;Flammang, ''Standard Catalog of Imported Cars'', p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AR76"&gt;{{cite journal | ref = AR76 | title = Automobil Revue '76 | editor1-last = Braunschweig | editor1-first = Robert  |display-editors=etal| language = German, French | publisher = Hallwag AG | pages = 362–363 | location = Berne, Switzerland | volume = 71 | date = 11 March 1976 | isbn = 3-444-60023-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A four-speed manual or three-speed automatic remained available, but for 1977 a five-speed became available (standard in the GT and Carousel coupes). The Carousel, introduced in 1975 along with larger bumpers, was more luxurious and carried a blue and white paintjob. For 1977, the [[Balance shaft|"Silent Shaft"]] version of the smaller engine became available, and was fitted as standard equipment in GT and Carousels. The introduction of the new Dodge Colt "Mileage Maker" meant there was a mix of second and third generation models in 1977. Second generation 2-door hardtops and wagons continued alongside 2- and 4-door "Mileage Makers". The wagon was also available with an "Estate" package, including wood grain applique and adjustable reclining seats.

This model was also sold as the Dodge Colt 1600 GS in South Africa, only as a two-door hardtop coupé.&lt;ref name=SAMotor&gt;{{cite journal | ref = SAM1275 | journal = SA Motor | title = News Models | page = 59 | editor-last = Howard | editor-first = Tony | publisher = Scott Publications | location = Cape Town, South Africa | date = December 1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third generation Dodge Colt was effectively made up of two lines: coupes and sedans were of a smaller, Lancer-based series, while the Wagons were based on the new [[Mitsubishi Galant#Third generation|Mitsubishi Galant Sigma]]. In late 1976, for the 1977 model year, the smaller A70-series [[Mitsubishi Lancer/Celeste (A70)|Mitsubishi Lancer]] became the Dodge Colt, with two-door coupe and four-door sedan bodies. While the wheelbase was only slightly shorter than that of the second generation Colt, overall length was down from 171.1 to 162.6&amp;nbsp;inches (4346 to 4130&amp;nbsp;mm). The new Colt was also referred to as the Dodge Colt "Mileage Maker" to mark it as different from its larger predecessor. Second generation Coupe and Wagon versions remained on sale for the 1977 model year.&lt;ref name="scimp1"/&gt;

The engine was the familiar ''4G32'' iteration of Mitsubishi's [[Mitsubishi Saturn engine|Saturn engine family]], of 1597&amp;nbsp;cc and still with 83&amp;nbsp;hp at 5,500&amp;nbsp;rpm. A "Silent Shaft" ([[balance shaft]]) version of this engine along with a five-speed manual transmission (instead of the standard four speeds) were part of a "Freeway Cruise" package, which also included a maroon/white paintjob. For 1978 power dropped to 77&amp;nbsp;hp with the introduction of the "[[Mitsubishi MCA|MCA-Jet]]" high-swirl system.&lt;ref name="scimp2"&gt;Flammang, ''Standard Catalog of Imported Cars'', pp. 194-195&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1978 a new, larger, Dodge Colt wagon also arrived, a rebadged [[Mitsubishi Galant#Third generation|Mitsubishi Galant Sigma]]. It came with the same 1.6-litre [[Mitsubishi MCA|MCA-Jet]] four as the smaller sedans and coupes, but a 2.6-litre, {{convert|105|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Mitsubishi Astron engine#4G54|Astron engine]] was an option, as was a five-speed manual.&lt;ref name=BG79&gt;{{citation | ref = RT79 | title = Road &amp; Track's Road Test Annual &amp; Buyer's Guide 1979 | date = January–February 1979 | publisher = CBS Publications | location = Greenwich, CT | page = 92 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the last year for the Lancer-based Colts was 1979, the wagon lingered on alongside the front-wheel drive Mirage-based fourth generation until 1981 when it was effectively replaced by the domestic [[Dodge Aries]] K wagon. The larger [[Mitsubishi Galant Lambda]] coupé was also marketed as the [[Dodge Challenger|Dodge Colt Challenger]] from 1978, although the "Colt" part was later dropped. It shared the chassis as well as the engine options of the Colt wagon.&lt;ref name=BG79/&gt;

From late-1978 for model year 1979, the Dodge Colt and Plymouth Champ nameplates were applied to the [[front-wheel-drive]] [[Mitsubishi Mirage]] imports into North America. The Colt and Champ (Plymouth Colt after 1982&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Flammang | first1 = James | last2 = Covello | first2 = Mike | date = 1 October 2001 | title = Standard Catalog of Imported Cars 1946–2002 | location = [[Iola, Wisconsin]] | publisher = [[Krause Publications]] | pages = 503–504 | isbn = 9780873416054}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a 3-door hatchback, and came in Deluxe or Custom equipment levels. These imports used a 70&amp;nbsp;hp [[Mitsubishi Orion engine#4G12|Mitsubishi Orion 4G12]] 1.4-liter overhead-cam, four-cylinder engine at first, which received the highest [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] rating in its debut year. This engine was joined by the 1.6-liter [[Mitsubishi Saturn engine#4G32|4G32 Saturn engine]] (80&amp;nbsp;hp) at the end of the year.&lt;ref name="scimp2"/&gt; For 1981, a bare bones "low-line" version was introduced. An RS package also became available, with stiffer suspension, sportier interior with extra gauges, and a larger fuel tank.&lt;ref name=RT81a&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Road &amp; Track's Road Test Annual &amp; Buyer's Guide 1981 | issue = January–February 1981 | title = 1981 Buyer's Guide | editor-first = Tony | editor-last = Hogg | page = 92 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were three manual transmissions and one automatic transmission available. There was a KM110 four-speed manual transmission, or a novel [[Mitsubishi Super Shift transmission|"Twin Stick" (Mitsubishi Super Shift)]] version of the transmission that used a two-speed transfer case to give 8 forward and 2 reverse speeds. There was also the option of a KM119 five-speed manual transmission or a TorqueFlite three-speed automatic transmission.

For 1982 a five-door hatchback joined the lineup. The names of the equipment levels changed to "E" and "DL". At some point claimed power dropped to 64 and 72&amp;nbsp;hp respectively for the small and large engines, while the 1.6 was only available with the automatic transmission. In August 1983, for the 1984 model year (which was to be the last year of this model of Colt), the GTS Turbo model arrived along with a naturally aspirated GTS package, similar to the earlier RS one.&lt;ref name=plym84&gt;{{citation | ref = PC84 | title = 1984 Colt and Colt Vista | date = August 1983 | pages = 4–5 | publisher = Chrysler Corporation | type = catalog | id = 81-005-40011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unique for North America - the turbocharged Colt/Mirages sold elsewhere had a 1.4-litre engine - this used the fuel-injected 1.6-litre 4G32T engine also seen in the next-generation Colt, providing {{convert|102|hp|kW|abbr=on}} at 5500&amp;nbsp;rpm and considerable performance.

In 1984, the fifth generation Dodge/Plymouth Colt appeared (model year 1985). A carbureted 68&amp;nbsp;hp 1468&amp;nbsp;cc four was the base engine, while the upscale Premier four-door sedan and GTS Turbo models received the [[Mitsubishi Saturn engine#4G32|4G32BT]] [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] 1.6-litre already seen in the last model year of the previous Colts. A first for FWD Colts was the availability of a three-box sedan body, though this was no longer available after 1986. From 1988 (and lasting until 1991), this car was also marketed as the ''Eagle Vista'' in Canada. There was also a five-door minivan/station wagon called the Dodge/Plymouth "Colt Vista"; this was simply a rebadged [[Mitsubishi Chariot]].

Early cars have small rectangular headlights in black inserts, while later models received more aerodynamic, flush-fitting units. The lowest priced model was the "E" (for economy), followed by the "DL" and topped by the turbocharged (but short-lived) Premier and GTS Turbo.

The Colt wagon, while never available with the turbocharged engine, did receive a more powerful 1,755&amp;nbsp;cc engine in the four-wheel-drive version. Unlike the FWD version, the DL 4x4 was not available with an automatic transmission.&lt;ref name=TAM/&gt; While the hatchback Colts were replaced for 1989, the Colt wagon continued to be available until the 1991 introduction of the Mitsubishi RVR-based Colt wagon, which also replaced the Colt Vista. This car was also marketed as the Eagle Vista wagon in Canada.

In 1989, Eagle began marketing its '''[[Eagle Summit|Summit]]''' as another [[badge engineering|rebadged]] Mitsubishi Mirage.

Since the demise of the [[Dodge Omni]]/[[Plymouth Horizon]] in 1990, the Colt was the only subcompact in the Dodge and Plymouth lineups.  The Colt sedan was not sold in the [[United States]] for the sixth generation (though it was sold in [[Canada]]), as it would be replaced by the [[Dodge Shadow]]/[[Plymouth Sundance]] liftbacks in the Dodge/Plymouth lineup for 1989. In Canada only the [[Eagle Vista]], a carryover model that replaced the Colt sedan continued when the Colt underwent a redesign. The sedan bodywork was available to American consumers as an [[Eagle Summit]], however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3V4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA106 | title = Black Enterprise 1989 Auto Guide | magazine = Black Enterprise| date = November 1988 | page = 106 |first = Jay | last = Koblenz | publisher = Earl G. Graves Publishing Co. Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dodge and Plymouth Colt sedans returned for 1993-1994 as a variant of the next generation Eagle Summit. The Dodge/Plymouth Colt, Eagle Summit, and Mitsubishi Mirage of this generation used a 1.5 or 1.6-litre inline-four engine.

A model powered by the 1.6-litre [[Mitsubishi Sirius engine#4G61|4G61T]] {{Convert|135|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} turbocharged four-cylinder was produced for the 1989 model year only. There are a rumored 1500 of these special editions to have been produced. The engine was only offered in the Mirage and the Colt GT Turbo, which were distinguished by their ground effects and spoilers (although these parts were also available for a price as add-ons to other model ranges) and by their extra features not normally found on base model ranges such as power seats, power windows, power locks, and power mirrors, special colored interior and seats, as well as a 150&amp;nbsp;mph/9000 rpm gauge cluster. The Turbo Colt/Mirage Turbo was one of ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best]] for 1989. A naturally aspirated version of this engine was available for the following years Colt GT, with power down to 113&amp;nbsp;hp.
[[File:Plymouth-Colt-Rear.jpg|thumb|left|Sixth generation Plymouth Colt 3-door]]
Power of the 1.5-litre 4G15 was up to {{convert|82|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} thanks to multi-point fuel injection. Top speed was {{convert|160|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=TAM90&gt;''Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1990'', p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

The seventh generation of the Colt was the same as Plymouth's version, and also the same as the Eagle Summit. As usual, they were all simply badge-engineered versions of the Mitsubishi Mirage/Lancer. The two-door coupe bodystyle was unique to the North American market. There was no hatchback version of the seventh generation Dodge/Plymouth Colt. Originally available in Base and GL versions, the ES (with supposedly more sporting intentions) was added later.

1.5 and 1.8 litre four-cylinder engines were used, with the larger engine originally only available to four-door Colts. While the sporting variants offered in the sixth generation were not renewed, the two-door ES was available with the more powerful sixteen-valve SOHC 1.8 for the 1994 model year.&lt;ref name=Guide&gt;{{cite web | title = 1993-1994 Dodge Colt: Full Review | publisher = Publications International, Ltd. | work = Consumer Guide Automotive | url = http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1993-to-1994-dodge-colt-6.htm | date = 2012-02-28 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120831210801/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1993-to-1994-dodge-colt-6.htm | archivedate = 2012-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller engine has {{Convert|92|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} while the larger version has {{Convert|113|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The previous Colt Wagon ([[Mitsubishi RVR]]) continued to be sold until 1996, while the Dodge Colt was replaced by the new [[Dodge Neon|Neon]] after the 1994 model year.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt;

The '''Plymouth Cricket''' nameplate was used (in addition to Dodge Colt) on Galants sold in [[Canada]] between mid-1973 and 1975, after Chrysler stopped using the Plymouth Cricket name for a rebadged [[Hillman Avenger]]-based model sourced from the United Kingdom (and sold across North America between 1971 and 1973).

The '''[[Plymouth Arrow]]''' was offered from 1976 to 1980 as a rebadged version of the Mitsubishi Lancer Celeste, not to be confused with the rebadged Mitsubishi truck sold as the Plymouth Arrow starting in 1979.

[[File:1963 Dodge Van.jpg|thumb|1963 [[Power Wagon]] carryall. 2010 photo.]]
The '''Dodge Town Panel''' and '''Dodge Town Wagon''' are respectively a [[panel truck]] and a [[carryall]], manufactured between 1954 and 1966 in the USA and between 1954 and 1971 in Argentina by [[Dodge]]. The model resembles what would be called an [[SUV]] nowadays. A competitor with the [[Chevrolet Suburban]], it was initially available in 2 wheel drive only, but the [[4 wheel drive]] model was ultimately more popular. The Dodge "Town Wagon" model was a "twin" passenger version of the Town Panel. The Town Panel had no windows or seats behind the driver and was more of a commercial-use vehicle.  Dodge had previously built panel trucks prior to the Town Panel, but the name didn't exist for these trucks until the Town Wagon was built along with them.

The Town Wagon in four wheel drive configuration was called the Power Wagon Town Wagon. Offered from 1957, it had a higher stance and large fender flares,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.townwagon.com/sites/tw/years.htm Town Wagon / Town Panels through the years]&lt;/ref&gt; and a "Power Wagon" badge linking it to the [[Dodge Power Wagon]]. The Town Panel and Town Wagon trucks were based upon the design of the [[Dodge C Series]] Pickup trucks with round fenders and wraparound windshields. Even after the [[Dodge D Series]] pickup trucks with square fenders and flat windshields were released, the Town Wagons retained the 1958 sheet metal design of the C Series pickups and heavy-duty trucks.

The '''Dodge 300''' was a medium- to heavy-duty [[cab over]] [[truck]] built by [[Dodge]]'s British arm at their [[Kew]] plant from 1957 until the mid-sixties. It replaced the earlier, bonneted [[Dodge 100 "Kew"|Dodge 100]] (nicknamed "Parrot-Nose") truck and was itself replaced by the [[Ghia]]-designed [[Dodge 500]] which appeared in late 1964.&lt;ref name=allparkew&gt;{{cite web | title = Kew Dodge: Dodge Trucks from the United Kingdom | url = http://www.allpar.com/world/kew.html | work = Allpar Trucks | publisher = Allpar LLC | last1 = Wright | first1 = Kelsey | last2 = Zatz | first2 = David | accessdate = 2014-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the retirement of the 300, Dodge's Kew plant was shuttered as production was moved to [[Dunstable]].&lt;ref name=rusty&gt;{{cite web | url = http://rustytrucks.tripod.com/id15.html | title = A Brief History of Dodge Trucks in the UK | accessdate = 2014-05-16 | work = Rusty Trucks }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Truck and tractor models were available, as well as a four-wheel drive model for military use. The weight range offered was from {{convert|5|to|9|LT|kg|-2|abbr=on}}, with the tractor models being rated for {{convert|10|or|12|LT|kg|-2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=allparkew/&gt; Most Dodge 300s received diesel engines from [[Perkins Engines|Perkins]].

The [[Motor Panels]] cab design used was shared with [[Leyland Motors|Leyland]] and [[Albion Motors|Albion]].&lt;ref name=rusty/&gt; It is therefore often referred to as the [[LAD cab|"LAD" cab]] ('''L'''eyland-'''A'''lbion-'''D'''odge).

==Bus Models==
A bus variant of the Dodge 300 was developed in the early 1960s, but only eight were built.  A prototype model S306 with a Leyland engine and Weymann bus body was built in 1962 (registered 2498PK), followed by a model S307 with Perkins engine and Marshall bus body in 1964 (registered 3033PE).  These were used as demonstrators by Dodge, but the only orders which resulted were for six S307 models with Strachans coach bodies which were delivered to Rickards of Brentford later in 1964 (registered AYV93B to AYV98B).

==1972-1982 models==
From 1972 on, a new Dodge 300 series of heavy lorries was sold in the UK. These were made in Spain by [[Barreiros (manufacturer)|Chrysler Spanish subsidiary]], and included a 38-tonne tractor and four, six and eighth-wheelers rigids. Sales took off well, and the model was not dropped until 1982, well after [[Renault Véhicules Industriels]] took control of [[Chrysler Europe]] truck operations.

The '''Dodge Shadow''' and '''Plymouth Sundance''' are [[small family car|economical]] 3-door and 5-door [[hatchback]]s that were introduced for the 1987 model year by the [[Chrysler Corporation]]. For 1991, a 2-door [[convertible]] variant was added to the Shadow lineup; but not the Sundance lineup. The 3-door hatchback model replaced the [[Dodge Charger (L-body)]] model, while the 5-door hatchback model replaced the [[Dodge Omni]] model; of their respective marque. With the 1987 acquisition of [[American Motors]] by Chrysler from [[Renault]], the Shadow/Sundance also replaced the American Motors-built [[Renault Alliance]] sedan and convertible, marking the official withdrawal of Renault from the United States and Canadian markets.

The first vehicle rolled out of [[Sterling Heights Assembly]] on August 25, 1986. In late 1988, production of the Mexican market version called the '''Chrysler Shadow''' began at [[Toluca Car Assembly]]. The Shadow/Sundance was also sold in Europe from 1988 to 1991 as the '''Chrysler ES'''. Production ended on March 9, 1994, with the Shadow/Sundance being replaced by the [[Chrysler Neon]].

==Design==
The Shadow/Sundance employed a variant of the [[Chrysler K platform|K-car platform]], the [[Chrysler P platform|P-body]], which was based on a combination of the [[Dodge Daytona]]'s suspension (alongside some of its interior styling cues) with a shortened version of the [[Dodge Lancer]]'s body. While they appeared to have a trunk, it was actually a [[hatchback]]. Chrysler considered this a special feature and advertising literature referred to it as "hidden hatchback versatility"; the relatively large storage capacity of these vehicles was a major selling point for the company. The [[Peugeot 309]] which had been developed to replace the European [[Chrysler Horizon]] used a similar layout.

===Safety===
A motorized passenger's side seat belt was added to US-market Shadows/Sundances in 1994, to comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208's requirement for [[passive restraint]]s. These [[motorized seat belt]]s did not comply with Canada's safety standards; Canadian-market Shadows/Sundances continued to use a manual passenger seatbelt, and 1994 Shadows/Sundances cannot legally be imported across the US-Canada border in either direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.riv.ca/english/html/how_to_import.html  |title=How to import |publisher=Registrar of Imported Vehicles |accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nhtsa.gov/cars/rules/import/FMVSS/#SN208 |title= Federal Motor Vehicle Standards and Regulations - Standard No. 208 |publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation |date=March 1999 |accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, the Shadow/Sundance was the lowest-priced car on the market with a standard driver's side [[airbag]], which had been made standard on all US-market domestic [[Chrysler Corporation]] cars in 1990, giving them a remarkable crash test rating for a car its size at the time.

===Engines===
The Shadow/Sundance was offered with a variety of four-cylinder engines, all with displacements of either 2.2 or 2.5 L, some were [[turbocharged]]. Naturally aspirated versions were [[fuel injection|fuel injected]], except those sold in [[Mexico]] which were [[carburetor|carbureted]]. The engines were tuned for torque rather than horsepower, resulting in [[horsepower]] and [[torque]] numbers that appear to be reversed from competitors such as the [[Honda Civic]]. A [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]]-built 3.0 L [[V6 engine]] was added later, replacing the turbocharged engines. All engines were available with a five-speed [[manual transmission]], while a 3-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]] was optional on the four cylinder equipped cars and a 4-speed automatic transmission was optional on the V6 powered cars.

==Plymouth Sundance==
[[File:87-90 Plymouth Sundance coupe.jpg|thumb|right|1987–1988 Plymouth Sundance 3-door]]
For the Sundance's first year, it was available in a single base model. For 1988, a higher-end ''RS'' model was available. The ''RS'' model, which stood for Rally Sport, came with standard features that included two-tone paint, fog lights, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. It was also available with a turbocharged 2.2 L [[Straight-4|I4]] engine, and other amenities like an [[Infinity (audio)|Infinity sound system]], tinted window glass, and dual power mirrors. For 1991, the base model split into two distinct models: entry-level ''America'' and mid-level ''Highline'', in addition to the high-end ''RS''. The stripped-down ''America'' had previously been offered for the [[Plymouth Horizon]]'s final year in 1990.

For 1992, the ''RS'' model was dropped, in favor of the revival of the [[Plymouth Duster#Revivals of the Duster name|Duster]] name for a performance version of the Sundance. The Duster featured a 3.0&amp;nbsp;L V6, special alloy wheels, "Duster" graphics, a body-colored grille &amp; trim, as well as other equipment. Although the Sundance was criticized by some{{who|date=March 2018}} as being a poor choice to bear the "Duster" name, the car offered very good performance and decent handling at a low cost (only about $2,000 more than a base Sundance), which was said to be part of the reason why Chrysler used the "Duster" name, as those were the qualities the original car offered.

For the 1993 model year, the ''America'' model was replaced by a better-equipped base model. The ''Highline'' would also be dropped for 1993.

==European market==
Between April 1988 and mid-1991, Chrysler offered the Dodge Shadow in numerous European markets as the '''Chrysler ES'''. The ES was based on the Dodge Shadow ES and was relatively the same vehicle, only without the "Shadow" badge. Offered only as a 3-door [[hatchback]], the standard engine was the fuel-injected 2.2 L, with an optional [[turbocharger]]. For 1989, the 2.2 L engine was replaced by the larger 2.5 L unit. Engines were linked to a standard five-speed manual transmission, with a three-speed automatic available as an extra-cost option. As European sales figures turned out to be very poor{{cn|date=March 2018}}, sales of the Chrysler ES ended in mid-1991, leaving the segment without any direct successor until the introduction of the [[Chrysler Neon]] in 1995.

[[Carroll Shelby]] Enterprises modified Shadows into several performance-oriented vehicles such as the [[Shelby CSX]], which was equipped with a turbocharged 2.2 L engine producing {{convert|174|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Because of the car's light weight and powerful engine in an era of government emissions choked engines, it was capable of acceleration equal or greater than that of many contemporary muscle and sports cars of the time. A version without the intercooler, rated at {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, was sold to [[Dollar-Thrifty Automotive Group|Thrifty]] as the [[Shelby CSX|CSX-T]].

The '''Chrysler Viper GTS-R''' (also known as the '''Dodge Viper GTS-R''' when raced in North America) was a successful [[race car|racing]] variant of the [[Dodge Viper]] developed in conjunction with [[Chrysler]] of North America, [[Oreca]] of France, and [[Reynard Motorsport]] of the United Kingdom.  Officially unveiled at the 1995 [[Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance|Pebble Beach Concours]], it has won numerous championships and famous events in its history.  Some chassis are still in use today.

==Development==
:''For the development of the road car, see [[Dodge Viper]].''
In the early 1990s, first generation Dodge Viper RT/10s had been modified by racing teams for use in GT racing in North America and Europe without much success.  Although its [[V10 engine]] was powerful, the car was not adapted to racing and teams lacked the funding to build a car that could compete with factory efforts.  One key issue was the fact that the Viper was a roadster, therefore lacking the rigidity that a coupe bodystyle would have.  However, following the sales success of the first generation Viper, Dodge began redesigning the car in 1995, upgrading the roadster while at the same time adding a new coupe, known as the Viper GTS.

Although the first generation Vipers had sold well, Dodge wished to showcase the potential capabilities of the new car, mostly in the realm of handling.  At the same time, Dodge also hoped to increase sales in Europe where importation of the Viper had struggled.  Dodge's parent, [[Chrysler]], therefore approved the development of a racing program centering on the Viper GTS which was still in development at the time.  This co-development would allow for elements of the racing car to be adapted to the road car, and vice versa, for each car's mutual improvement.

Chrysler believed that in order to adapt their car not only for North American but also European circuits, they would require outside assistance.  An agreement was made with the French racing and engineering firm [[Oreca]], who had many years of experience in sports car racing as well as assistance in the [[Mazda 787B]]'s win in the [[1991 24 Hours of Le Mans]].  Oreca would construct and maintain the racing cars in their shops, as well as run Chrysler's official factory teams in Europe.  For North America, Chrysler would recruit the Canaska/Southwind Team as their factory effort.

Although Oreca would construct the cars, key elements would come from British engineering firm [[Reynard Motorsport]].  This would mainly consist of the construction of the car's basic chassis and other integral parts before they were shipped to Oreca for assembly.  As for the Viper's engine, it was ideally suited for competition at the time due to limits of 8000 cc being just beyond the Viper's 7998.5 cc.  Modifications were therefore light for the ''356-T6'' V10, with concentration on redesigned intakes for horsepower and reinforcements for endurance.

In terms of design much of the bodywork of the Viper GTS was retained on the race car.  Mandatory elements such as a rear wing, rear diffuser, and front splitter were added for aerodynamics, while initial cars had their fog lights covered over before being put back for increased visibility at night.  To aid in lighting, optional lights were able to be placed in square notches above the grill.  The exhaust would also be routed out the side of the car, just under the doors, about halfway between the front and rear wheel wells.  Side exhausts had been a feature of the first generation American-market RT/10s, but were no longer used on the GTS.  Vents were also added to the hood for cooling the engine, while intakes were placed on the roof and rear fenders.

In total, 57 Viper GTS-Rs would be built.  After the production of an initial five prototypes for testing and early usage by Oreca and Canaska/Southwind, 52 more cars would be built.  Although some would be used by the factory teams, most would be sold directly to customers for use in whatever series would allow them.  Viper GTS-Rs continued to be built into 2005, after which Oreca concentrated on maintaining and supporting the existing Viper GTS-R fleet.

===Naming===
Although the production cars have mostly been known as Dodge Vipers, the Dodge brand did not sell the Viper in Europe.  Because the new cars, named GTS-R, were built in Europe, they were mostly known as Chrysler Viper GTS-R.  However cars racing in North America usually ran under the Dodge banner, making them Dodge Viper GTS-Rs.  This naming difference therefore depends on location and region.  The cars themselves actually carried no badging for either Chrysler or Dodge, with only the ''Viper GTS-R'' name appearing on the side of the bonnet.

===Commemorative Edition===

With the FIA GT2 Team and Driver series wins in October 1997, Team Viper set forth with the creation of a unique Viper called the GT2 Commemorative Edition.  There would be 100 offered through the top Dodge Viper dealers.

The team started working on the concept in November 1997 with design concept approve in January 1998, prototype parts in February 1998, pricing approval of $85,200 in April 1998, and production from June 16th to July 7th, 1998.  The vehicles were the first to be built in VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) sequential order with the first having 001 as its last three on the VIN and the last being 100.  

The GT2 exterior is best known for its white with blue stripes paint, large rear wing, front dive planes and splitter, side sills, American flag, BBS rims, and GTS-R badging.  Its this badging that causes many to refer to the vehicle as the GTS-R.  However, the GTS-R was the race version of the Viper and not street legal.

The GT2 interior is best known for the blue accent trim, Oreca 5-point racing harness, and the center dash plaque with the vehicles unique production number.

The GT2 power increased by 10 horsepower to 460 HP with the use of K&amp;N air filter and smooth tubes connecting the filter to the intake manifold.  Torque increased by 10 to 500 foot pounds.

Of the 100 number vehicles, number 100 was keep by the Chrysler museum until it was later sold into private ownership.  Number 051 was given to Oreca Team drive Olivier Beretta.  However, due to Monaco's import regulations, Olivier was unable to take delivery.  The vehicle was later sold at Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale's auction and is in private hands.  Number 052 was given to Oreca Team driver Justin Bell.  He kept the vehicle for several years before being sold into private hands.

The GT2 is regarded as the pinnacle of the Gen II (Generation Two) GTS Viper coupe collectability.

Any reference to the GT2 being built to meet any homologation effort are inaccurate.

==Racing history==
Debuting in 1996, two racing teams separately developed the Chrysler Viper GTS-R coupe for competition. Canaska Southwind started in the North American [[IMSA GT Championship]] GTS-1 class at the 1996 [[24 Hours of Daytona]], managing to finish in 29th place. However, the team would improve with a twelfth-place finish at the [[12 Hours of Sebring]].  [[Oreca|Viper Team Oreca]] would also run a limited schedule beginning with the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]].

Both teams appeared at the [[1996 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] with two entries each.  Three of those four cars managed to finish with Canaska Southwind earning the best result in tenth place.  The two teams returned to their respective series afterwards. Viper Team Oreca concluded the year with three races in the [[BPR Global GT Series]] earning eighth place at [[Brands Hatch]], ninth at [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa]], and sixth at [[Circuit Paul Armagnac|Nogaro]]. Canaska Southwind concluded the season by finishing second in class at [[Mosport]] and sixth overall. 

The Canaska Southwind team would end their involvement in the Viper program in 1997.  This meant Oreca would make the only appearance for a Viper in IMSA GT by submitting a lone entry at the Rolex 24 at Daytona, finishing in 12th place.  After Daytona, the team returned to Europe to concentrate on the new [[FIA GT Championship]] which had replaced the BPR series.  The team would switch to the less powerful GT2 class due to the strength of the [[Porsche]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]] teams which were entering GT1, while at the same time being joined by the customer Chamberlain Engineering team.  Oreca began the season strong with a 1-2 finish in their class ahead of the Roock Racing Porsches, and would go on to take six more victories in the eleven race season and winning the GT2 championship.  The team also returned to Le Mans with three cars, although they would only finish in 14th place, fifth in their class.  Another customer Viper would also appear in the [[All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship]] for [[Team Taisan]], making two appearances with a best finish of eighth.

The Oreca team would strengthen their dominance in FIA GT in 1998, as the team managed to win all but one event in the ten race schedule.  Oreca would also take their first class victory at [[1998 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] with an eleventh place overall finish.  Chamberlain continued as a privateer in FIA GT earning several points, as well as earning a 14th-place finish at Daytona.  Meanwhile, the Oftedahl Motorsport would purchase a Viper GTS-R and go on to score six class wins in the [[British GT Championship]], including an overall race win at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] and earning Kurt Luby and Richard Dean the drivers' championship.

For 1999, Oreca's efforts were expanded further, as the team now operated in two championships: A two-car team in the new [[American Le Mans Series]] and the existing two car team already competing in FIA GT.  FIA GT saw the Vipers once again sweep the series with nine wins for Oreca, and a lone win for the [[Paul Belmondo]] Viper.  Chamberlain improved their team to finish second in the championship, while [[PK Carsport|GLPK Carsport]] would be the fourth Viper squad to compete.  A similar story occurred in the ALMS, with Oreca winning six races and taking that championship as well.  Oreca would also earn their second straight win at [[1999 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]], with various Vipers finishing in the top six positions in their class.  The [[FFSA GT Championship]] would see the appearance of Belmondo's Vipers, earning two victories over the season, and the [[24 Hours Nürburgring]] would see [[Zakspeed]] claiming overall victory.

For 2000, Oreca chose to concentrate on North America, leaving the FIA GT Championship to privateers. The team opened the season with one of their most notable victories, winning the 24 Hours of Daytona by a small margin over the new [[Chevrolet Corvette]] factory team.  Oreca went on to win ten races in the American Le Mans Series, eventually falling to Corvette in two rounds late in the season but once again securing the championship.  Oreca would also outperform Corvette at Le Mans, winning their third straight class victory with a seventh-place finish.  In FIA GT, the Paul Belmondo and new Carsport Holland teams would run strong and win a collective four races, but would not be able to overcome the five victories by the [[Lister Storm]], forcing the two teams to settle for second and third in the championship.  In French GT, the DDO, ART, and MMI squads would combine for a total of eight Viper victories.

The backing by [[Chrysler]] officially ended in 2001, as Chrysler and Oreca had begun work the previous year on developing a [[Le Mans Prototype]], forcing Oreca to abandon their Viper teams.  The American Viperacing squad would be the sole contender in the American Le Mans Series, scoring no victories and finishing the season in third for the championship.  FIA GT would however see a blossoming of teams, as eight different Viper squads competed over the season. [[Larbre Compétition]] would win three events (including the [[Spa 24 Hours]]) and win the championship, while Carsport Holland won two races and finished second.  Hayles Racing would win four races in British GT to win that championship by two points over [[Lister Cars|Lister]], while the DDO team would win five French GT events, and [[Zakspeed]] would manage to win the 24 Hours Nürburgring for the second time.  Le Mans however would not see the Vipers repeat their past success, as the factory Corvette squad won the class and only a lone Viper finished.
[[File:Dodge Viper Team Zakspeed.jpg|thumb|right|250px|One of [[Zakspeed]]'s Viper GTS-Rs from the [[24 Hours of Nürburgring]], advertising the new presence of [[Dodge]] in Europe]]
Larbre was able to defend their FIA GT championship in 2002, but were only able to win one race in the process.  Carsport Holland and Paul Belmondo also managed single victories, while the new [[Ferrari 550]]s showed their potential with four wins.  The only other victories for Vipers that season came in French GT, with four earned by DDO, and a third victory at the Nürburgring for Zakspeed.  An Oreca-backed entry at [[2002 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] would manage to finish on the class podium, although several laps behind the two factory Corvettes.

In 2003, the dominance of the [[Prodrive]]-built [[Ferrari]]s began.  Vipers were unable to win any races in FIA GT, leaving Larbre as the best finishing Viper in the championship, a distant seventh.  Some victories were still scored by Vipers however, as Larbre took six wins in French GT and Force One Racing a further two.  The Team Taisan Viper in JGTC would also manage its first class victory in an event at [[Fuji Speedway]].  Vipers would compete for the first time in Italian GT, winning all but three races during the season.  However at the same time, Vipers would make their final appearance at [[2003 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]], with Larbre finishing fourth in their class.

2004 would see the Viper GTS-Rs begin to be phased out.  Only Zwaan's Racing would be entered in the full FIA GT season, earning ninth in the championship.  Vipers would remain dominant in FFSA GT and Italian GT, winning eleven and five races respectively.  For 2005, the only Viper entry in FIA GT would be a single entry at the Spa 24 Hours, finishing 12th, while Italian GT would see only three teams competing and unable to score any victories.  French GT became the only series in which Vipers were competitive, which lured former [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Formula One champion]] [[Alain Prost]] to run Viper GTS-R chassis #C50 in the series as part of his 50th birthday, eventually winning one race as part of the Vipers nine victories that season.

In 2006, Viper GTS-Rs continue in French GT and Italian GT, although their victories continued to diminish.  By 2007, the homologation of the Viper GTS-Rs would come to an end as the Viper GTS bodystyle had been replaced nearly seven years prior.  Few privateers entered Vipers in French and Italian GT, while Red Racing would enter a lone car in select rounds of the FIA GT Championship as part of the amateur Citation Cup but would be unable to even finish any of its events. In 2008 Italian team Lanza Motorsport entered a GTS-R in the Italian round of the FIA GT Championship, but the car did not finish the race.

In 2007 a Viper GTS-R was first raced during a historic event at Magny-Cours by Florent Moulin. The new GT90s serial accepts former FIA GT racers from 1990 to 2000. The car was chassis C23, the FIA GT Championship-winning car from 1999 driven as by Karl Wendlinger and Olivier Beretta, completely restored into original 1999 Oreca specifications. The same car was invited at Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2008 and driven by its period driver Justin Bell in its Le Mans 1999 livery when Justin drove this very car to 2nd place in GTS.  In November 2008 Florent Moulin entered it again in GT90's Revival race at Le Castellet, co-driven by another of its period driver from Le Mans 1999 Marc Duez.  In 2010, chassis 27 participated in the Goodwood Festival of Speed to celebrate the 10th Anniversary 24 Hours of Daytona victory.

==Achievements==

==Replacement==
Following Dodge's official end of their factory-backed racing program in 2001, as well as the redesigning of the Viper in 2003, the first generation GTS-Rs have been retired.  Nonetheless, Dodge persevered in motorsports competition by backing a different type of racing endeavor.  Unlike before, there would be no factory team.  These racing vehicles, known as Dodge Viper Competition Coupes, would be sold to those customers who wanted a ready-made track car.  Because they complied with the [[Group GT3|FIA GT3]] regulations, these vehicles were prevented from exhibiting the same level of extreme performance characteristic of the earlier Viper GTS-Rs which ran in GT1.  In this instance, Oreca ran the Viper Competition Coupe program, building the cars for Dodge.

Attempts were made by Oreca as well as privateers Racing Box and Woodhouse Performance to modify Viper Competition Coupes to run in the faster [[Group GT2|GT2]] class.  Although this has not received official support from Dodge, they have expressed interest in exploring the idea. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Coinciding with the release of the fifth generation Viper road car in 2012, Chrysler returned to motorsports competition under the [[Street &amp; Racing Technology|SRT Motorsports]] banner in the [[American LeMans Series]] with the SRT Viper GTS-R race car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drivesrt.com/news/2012/05/alms-com-documents-the-top-five-wins-for-viper-gts-r-in-american-le-mans-series.html |title=ALMS.com documents the top-five wins for Viper GTS-R in American Le Mans Series | work=driveSRT.com |date=May 4, 2012 |accessdate=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After winning the GTLM Class of the [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship|Tudor United Sportscar Championship]] in [[2014 United SportsCar Championship|2014]], factory support was again terminated. Nevertheless, private racing teams can still compete with the 2013 release of the Dodge Viper SRT GT3-R which is FIA GT3 homologated as GT3-036.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drivesrt.com/racing/viper-gt3r/ |title=SRT Viper GT3-R |work=driveSRT.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fia.com/homologations |title=FIA Homologations |work=Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile | date=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dodge Attitude''' is a [[Rebadging|badge engineered]] [[subcompact car|subcompact]] [[sedan (car)|sedan]] sold by [[Dodge]] in Mexico over three generations since 2006. Dodge [[rebadging|rebadged]] the [[Hyundai Accent#MC|Hyundai Accent (MC)]] for the original version, updating the model line in 2011 with the [[Hyundai Accent#RB|RB series Accent]]. [[Mitsubishi Motors]] became the source of the Dodge Attitude from January 2015, using the [[Mitsubishi Mirage#Attrage|Mitsubishi Mirage sedan (Attrage)]] as the donor car.

[[File:Dodge Kew lorry TPG 866, 2007 HCVS London to Brighton run.jpg|thumb|300px|Dodge Kew "Parrot Nose" tipper truck]]
The '''Dodge 100 "Kew"''' was a range of trucks made from 1949 until 1957 by the American [[Dodge]] company at their British factory in [[Kew]], [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;http://rustytrucks.tripod.com/id15.html&lt;/ref&gt; The trucks were often nicknamed the "parrot nose" due to their distinctive shaped bonnets and grilles. Most of the trucks were powered by either [[Perkins Engines|Perkins]] diesel or [[Chrysler flathead engine|Chrysler]] petrol engines. The cab body was built by Briggs Motor Bodies and was shared with the [[Ford Thames ET6]] and [[Leyland Comet]]. They were featured in the 1957 film ''[[Hell Drivers (film)|Hell Drivers]]''.

In India the same model was manufactured by [[Premier Automobiles Limited]] and production continued until the 1980s. Many were still in operation as of 2016 in some regions. Since the early 1970s it has been known as Premier Roadmaster for diesel versions and Pioneer for Petrol versions, otherwise simply known as Fargo.

The '''Dodge Custom''' is a [[full-size car]] which was produced by [[Dodge]] in the United States from 1946 to early 1949.

==Overview==
The D24 was introduced in 1946, as the top trim level in the Dodge range (bigger than Plymouth's counterparts Dodge D25).&lt;ref name=Gunnell&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975, Revised 4th Edition, pages 327 to 329&lt;/ref&gt; It differed from the basic Deluxe model only in terms of interior trim, seats, dual electric windshield wipers and chrome exterior beading around the windows.&lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt; The Custom was offered in 4-door 6 passenger Sedan, 4-door 6 passenger Town Sedan, 4-door 7 passenger Sedan, 2-door Club Coupe and 2-door Convertible models.&lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt; The 7 Passenger model rode on a 137.5 inch (3492.5 mm) wheelbase and all other models on 119.5 inches (3035.3 mm).&lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt; All models were powered by a 230 cid inline six cylinder engine.&lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt; A three-speed manual transmission was standard whilst a "Fluid Drive" option provided "no metal-to metal contact between the power source and drive".&lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt;

Changes for the 1947 and 1948 model years were minimal.&lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt; From 1 December 1949 all units were considered 1949 models for registration purposes.&lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt; The actual 1949 Dodge range was introduced in April 1949, with the [[Dodge Coronet|Coronet]] name now used for the top trim level. Dodge D24 shared consumers with Pontiac Silverstreak, Oldsmobile Series 66, Studebaker Champion, Hudson Commodore and Nash Ambassador. &lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt;

The '''Dodge Deluxe''' is a [[full-size car]] which was produced by [[Dodge]] in the United States from 1946 to early 1949.

==Overview==
The Deluxe was introduced in 1946 as the lowest trim level in the Dodge D-24 range.&lt;ref name=Gunnell&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975, Revised 4th Edition, pages 327 to 329&lt;/ref&gt; It differed from the top trim level Custom in terms of interior trim and seats and it lacked the dual electric windshield wipers and chrome exterior beading around the windows fitted to the Custom.&lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt; The Deluxe was offered in 2-door Sedan, 4-door Sedan and 2-door Coupe models.&lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt; It rode on a 119.5 inch wheelbase &lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt; and was powered by a 230 cid inline six cylinder engine.&lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt; A three-speed manual transmission was standard whilst a "Fluid Drive" option provided "no metal-to metal contact between the power source and drive".&lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt; It used Petrol Gasoline as standard fueling. 

Changes for the 1947 and 1948 model years were minimal &lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt; and from 1 December 1949 all units were considered 1949 models for registration purposes.&lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt; The actual 1949 Dodge range was introduced in April 1949, with the [[Dodge Meadowbrook |Meadowbrook]] name now used for the lowest trim level full size model.&lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt;

==Canada==

In Canada, the Dodge Deluxe (and Special Deluxe) were used for 1942 and then from 1946 until 1950 for the lowest-priced, Plymouth-based models. They corresponded largely to the [[Plymouth Deluxe]], with some Dodge trim pieces.

The '''Dodge Wayfarer''' is an [[automobile]] produced by [[Dodge]] from February 1949 until 1952. It was discontinued without a replacement in the United States, although the [[Dodge Kingsway|Kingsway]] series remained available in export markets. The Wayfarer was the first true [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]] built by the Big Three since the 1930s.&lt;ref name=JG72&gt;[[#AQ181|Godshall]], p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; However, the roadster concept was soon altered to the plusher Sportabout as higher comfort levels were demanded by the post-war auto buyers.&lt;ref name=JG79&gt;[[#AQ181|Godshall]], p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; 9325 roadsters and Sportabouts were built, out of a total of 217,623 Wayfarers of all bodystyles.&lt;ref name=JG81&gt;[[#AQ181|Godshall]], p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

==1949==
The "true" 1949 Dodges were introduced in February 1949, after a long production run of the 1948s. The Wayfarer (known as the '''D-29''' series), aside from its shorter wheelbase, shared the boxy corporate design of the new 1949 Chrysler products. While much improved over the earlier Dodges, the Wayfarer still had to do without features such as a crankshaft dampener, the new Micronic oil filter, a splash-proof distributor, and rivetless brake linings. The windshield wipers were vacuum-powered rather than electric, and only the right-hand door received an exterior lock - the roadster receiving none. The Wayfarer arrived with three different bodystyles: a two-door sedan, a two-door business coupe, and the two-door roadster (only entering production in May).&lt;ref name=JG78&gt;[[#AQ181|Godshall]], p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; The business coupe shared some bodywork with Plymouth's business coupe version, but the other Wayfarer's had unique pressings.&lt;ref name=JG77/&gt;

The roadster had removable plastic side windows instead of wind-down units, and a short top which eliminated the need for rear quarter windows. More permanent swing-out vent windows were available as an option. However, Californian regulations on hand signalling meant that roll-down windows had to be added quick and retro-fitted to Californian market vehicles.&lt;ref name=JG78/&gt; This happened in September, after which the roll-down windows became a rarely selected delete-option.&lt;ref name=JG79/&gt; A roadster with a rumble seat was even tested (with a bottom-hinged trunk lid), but the opening would have had to be moved and the cost of tooling up for such an option meant that it was soon dropped.&lt;ref name=JG78/&gt;

1949 production totalled 63,816, equalling 25 percent of Dodge's total number. Of these, 49,054 were sedans, 9342 were coupes, and 5420 were roadsters.&lt;ref name=JG79/&gt;

==1950==
[[File:1950 Dodge Wayfarer 2-door sedan, front left.jpg|thumb|left|A 1950 Dodge Wayfarer two-door sedan]]
For 1950, the '''D-33''' Wayfarers (as for the entire Dodge lineup) received a facelift with a sleeker grille, new bumpers, and new rear fenders with the taillights mounted directly on them.&lt;ref name=allparWF&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.allpar.com/cars/dodge/wayfarer.html | title = 1949-1952 Dodge Wayfarer | work = Allpar.com | first = Terry | last = Parkhurst | accessdate = 2015-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mid-year, the roadster was renamed Sportabout as Chrysler realized that very few "true" roadsters were sold. The Sportabout, unlike the rest of the Wayfarer line, also received a body moulding which extended onto the front doors.&lt;ref name=JG79/&gt; A one-barrel, L-head [[Straight-six engine|inline-six]] of {{convert|230|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} was installed, with {{convert|103|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. This was to be the only engine option for the Wayfarer's entire production run.

A disastrous 104-day strike, lasting from 25 January until 8 May, hamstrung all of Chrysler's production this year.&lt;ref name=JG79/&gt; Meanwhile, the arrival of the [[Nash Rambler#1950|Rambler Landau convertible]] meant serious competition for the roadster. While a little more expensive, the new Rambler was much more comprehensively equipped and could seat five rather than two people.&lt;ref name=JG79/&gt; Business coupe production also dropped, although the sedan increased for a better overall than in 1949. 75,403 were built, made up of 65,000 sedans, 7500 coupes, and 2903 roadsters/Sportabouts.

==1951-1952==
[[File:1952 Dodge Coupe Wayfarer Fluid Drive (9643217356).jpg|thumb|1952 Dodge Wayfarer business coupe]]
1951's '''D-41''' Wayfarers received a thorough upgrade, with a new hood, front fenders, and new slotted grille in two sections. The windshield was bigger and the dashboard new, and underneath there were new "Oriflow" shock absorbers.&lt;ref name=JG81/&gt; 1951 was the last year that the Sportabout was available with the removable side windows.&lt;ref name=JG79/&gt; A period road tester ([[Tom McCahill]], for ''[[Mechanix Illustrated]]'') reached a {{convert|87|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} top speed, and sixty&amp;nbsp;mph from standing was reached in 17.4&amp;nbsp;seconds.&lt;ref name=JG81/&gt;

The 1952s were nearly identical to the 1951s, with Dodge not even bothering to separate the yearly sales numbers.&lt;ref name=JG81/&gt; When the 1952s were introduced, the Sportabout was listed with an asterisk regarding availability but was not produced. The business coupe was discontinued in February 1952, with material shortages due to the [[Korean War]] forcing automobile manufacturers to focus on their more popular models.&lt;ref name=JG81/&gt; Thus, only the two-door sedan was available for most of the Wayfarer's last model year. Production for 1951 and 1952 totalled 78,404, of which 70,700 were sedans, 6702 business coupes, and a mere 1002 of the 1951 Sportabouts.&lt;ref name=JG81/&gt; For 1953, the "[[Dodge Meadowbrook|Meadowbrook Special]]" series was added to replace the Wayfarer at the lower end of Dodge's lineup.&lt;ref name="chrysler"/&gt;

==Chrysler Wayfarer==

The Wayfarer model name was also used by [[Chrysler Australia]] for the Chrysler Wayfarer, a series of [[Ute (vehicle)|ute]] models built between late 1958 and 1960 (AP2 and AP3 models, some perhaps built as late as 1961) in 1205 examples.&lt;ref name=allparOZ&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.allpar.com/world/royal.html | title = The Australian Chrysler Royal, Plainsman, and Wayfarer | work = Allpar.com | first1 = David | last1 = Hoffman | first2 = Mike | last2 = Sealey | accessdate = 2015-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, there was a ute called the "[[Chrysler Valiant|Chrysler Valiant Wayfarer]]". This model was built from April 1965&lt;ref name=Unique&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_chrysler_valiant_ap6.htm | title = Chrysler Valiant AP6 | publisher = Unique Cars &amp; Parts | location = Australia | accessdate = 3 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; until August 1971.

The '''Deora''' is a 1965 [[Dodge A100]] pickup truck that was heavily [[custom car|customized]] by Mike and Larry Alexander in Detroit for the 1967 [[Detroit Autorama]]. After winning many awards, including the [[Detroit Autorama#Ridler Award|Ridler]] in 1967, it became the prototype for a [[Hot Wheels]] car, and plastic model kit. It was sold at auction in 2009 for $324,500.

==Design==
The Alexander brothers commissioned the design from [[Harry Bentley Bradley]] in 1964. It was unveiled in their home town during the Detroit Autorama in 1967, where it won nine awards including the [[Detroit Autorama#Ridler Award|Ridler Award]]. The Deora is based on the compact [[Dodge A100]] pickup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drive: Dodge Deora Gold Rush: The world's coolest skateboard|url=http://www.motortrend.com/classic/roadtests/c12_0509_dodge_deora/|work=Motor Trend|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The back hatch of a 1960 Ford station wagon served as the windshield. It was chopped, sectioned, and channelled to create the fully functional, futuristic-looking pickup. The slant six engine and 3-speed manual transmission were moved rearward 15 inches, out of the cab and into the bed and covered by the hard [[tonneau]]. Entry into the gold-painted custom is achieved by lifting up the windshield, swivelling the lower gate and entering through the front.

After a naming contest run by AMT model cars. It was called the Deora. Harry Bradley had proposed to call it XTAB (standing for eXperimental Truck Alexander Brothers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1967 Dodge Deora|url=http://www.cartechbooks.com/featuredcar/1967dodgedeora|work=Car Tech Books|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The winning entry was from a 13-year-old boy, and is a technically incorrect version of the Spanish word for “golden”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.petersen.org/default.cfm?DocId=1813&amp;CarID=183 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214000819/http://www.petersen.org/default.cfm?DocId=1813&amp;CarID=183 |archive-date=2009-02-14 |url-status=dead|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrysler liked the resulting truck so well that they leased it for two years to display with their other factory concept cars. It was then put into storage after being sold to Al Davis. His son took the Deora out of storage in 1998 and Harry Bradley was asked to help restore it. The finished restoration took part in the 50th-anniversary Detroit Autorama in 2002 as part of a special display of classic Alexander brothers customs.

In 2009 the Deora was put up for auction in California and was sold for $324,500. It was described as featuring a {{convert|101|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 6-cylinder {{convert|170|cuin|cc|abbr=on}} engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICONS OF SPEED &amp; STYLE AUCTION|url=http://www.rmauctions.com/CarDetails.cfm?SaleCode=rw09&amp;CarID=r184&amp;Currency=|work=RM Auctions|accessdate=29 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801033819/http://www.rmauctions.com/CarDetails.cfm?SaleCode=rw09&amp;CarID=r184&amp;Currency=|archive-date=1 August 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hot Wheels==
The Deora is also a major player in [[Hot Wheels]] history.  It was part of the very first Hot Wheels line in 1968.  In 2000, Hot Wheels released the Deora II, an update of the original.

Three years later, in preparation for Hot Wheels' 35th anniversary, a full size Deora II was unveiled.  It was built by [[Chip Foose]] and 5-axis, and sports a [[Northstar engine series|Cadillac Northstar V8 engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pickuptrucks.com/html/autoshows/sema2007/hotwheels/deoraii.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730121757/http://www.pickuptrucks.com/html/autoshows/sema2007/hotwheels/deoraii.html |archive-date=2012-07-30 |url-status=dead|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="2035" xml:space="preserve">The '''Dodge Warlock''', originally a concept vehicle and part of [[Dodge]]'s late 1970s "adult toys" line, is a short wheelbase truck that was produced in limited production in 1976 and regular production from 1977 to 1979.The 1978 models were offered only in black. The Warlocks most commonly came in black, however other colors could be special ordered. Its main draw was that it was a factory customized truck, also known as a "trick truck", and was designed to appeal to young 4x4 buyers. The Warlock featured custom gold wheels, wide tires, bucket seats, a utiline{{not a typo}} bed, and oak racks for the bed. Optional equipment included five-spoke wheels, bucket seats, tinted glass, chrome rear bumper, and power steering. All had black interiors, with gold accents on the dash and the doors, and a "tuff" steering wheel. Like the standard pickups, it had front disc brakes, and a standard slant six or a V-8. The exterior was accented by gold pin striping around the wheel wells and the body lines. The pin striping continued inside onto the doors, dashboard, and instrument panel. Warlock was printed in gold on the tailgate. The 1979 model however is different in that it has "Warlock II" printed on the tailgate. It appears that all normal engine options were available. It could have come with the standard Slant six, the 318 with either the 2 barrel or 4 barrel carburetor, the 360, the 400, or the 440. The 318 appears to be the most common engine selected.

The Ram 1500 Classic Warlock came out in 2019 and was offered in ether quad or crew cab with the V6 Pentastar or V8 Hemi.

The '''Dodge Dynasty''' was a [[front-wheel drive]] [[mid-size car|mid-size]] [[sedan (car)|sedan]] that was introduced in 1987, as a 1988 model, to replace the [[Dodge 600]]. The Dodge Dynasty is related to the [[Chrysler New Yorker]] and both car lines were built on the [[Chrysler C platform]] in [[Belvidere, Illinois]]. It is also similar to the [[Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue]] and [[Chrysler Imperial]], which were available from 1990 to 1993 on an extended wheelbase platform of the [[Chrysler New Yorker]]. Production ended on May 28, 1993, and the Belvidere plant was retooled to build the [[Chrysler Neon|Dodge Neon]]. The Dynasty was replaced by the [[Dodge Intrepid|Intrepid]].

==History==
The name is believed to be a reference to the popular 1980s primetime ABC-TV series, "Dynasty." In fact, one magazine declared, "Blake and Krystle, your car is ready," when the car debuted for the 1988 model year. However, it is most likely that Chrysler named its late 1980s and early 1990s C-Bodied cars on a "royalty" theme, which stemmed from the classic Imperial badge to attract customers, including the Chrysler Imperial/New Yorker Fifth Avenue and the standard Chrysler New Yorker. The Dynasty was considered the budget automobile of the three, with the standard New Yorker in the middle and the Imperial/New Yorker Fifth Avenue as the top of the line model.

Although it was fairly popular, the [[Lee Iacocca]]-dictated styling was boxy and conservative compared to more aerodynamically styled competitors such as the [[Ford Taurus (first generation)|Ford Taurus]] and the [[Chevrolet Lumina]]. When the new front-wheel-drive Chrysler Corporation C-body cars (Dynasty and New Yorker) debuted for the 1988 model year, they were the first mass-produced cars in the world to have a fully multiplexed, fiber-optic wiring buss connecting all electronic accessories and controllers, which greatly reduced the amount and weight of wiring harnesses in the car.  All models (1988-1993) featured power locks that automatically locked when the car's speed exceeded 15 miles per hour. Dynasty trim levels included base and LE. Additionally, a "Brougham" package was offered on 1992-93 LE models that added a padded "landau" [[vinyl roof]].  

==Specifications==
[[File:93 Dodge Dynasty (14344073600).jpg|thumb|left|1993 Dodge Dynasty]]
A 2.5-litre [[inline-four engine|inline-4]] Chrysler engine (base model only), a [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]]-sourced 3.0-litre [[V6 engine|V6]], the 6G72 engine, and a [[Chrysler]]-built 3.3-litre V6 were available, although the 3.3&amp;nbsp;L V6 was not available until 1990. The four-cylinder came equipped with a TorqueFlite three-speed automatic transmission (the A413), as did the 3.0 L in 1988. The 1988 3.0L V6 models with TorqueFlite transmission were rated at 18 city / 24 highway MPG. The 1989-1990 Ultradrive equipped models came with a 2.36:1 axle ratio, which was revised to 2.52:1 for 1991-1993. EPA mileage ratings were 21 city/25 highway MPG with the 4 cylinder &amp; 3-speed TorqueFlite transmission. In 1989 the EPA rating for the 3.0/Ultradrive power-train changed to 18 city / 26 highway MPG. Also, the 3.0 engine is a non-interference engine, meaning that if the timing belt breaks, it is less likely to damage valves and pistons when it does so.

The new 3.3L V6 engine for 1990, with the Ultradrive transmission, was rated at 19 city/ 26 highway MPG. The new electronically controlled four-speed [[automatic transmission]], known as the Ultradrive or A604 ([[List of Chrysler transmissions]]), debuted in 1989, and became the sole transmission for V6 models through the 1993 final production year of the Dynasty. In 1989 the EPA rating for the 3.0/Ultradrive power-train changed to 18 city / 26 highway MPG.  The new 3.3L V6 engine for 1990, with the Ultradrive transmission, was rated at 19 city/ 26 highway MPG.  

===Features===
The vast majority of Dynastys sold new to private customers had V6 engines, while four-cylinder base Dynastys were primarily sold to fleets. Dynasty models were all equipped with a driver's side airbag starting in 1990.  A Bendix [[anti-lock braking system]] (including 4-wheel disc brakes) was available on V6 models during those years as well at a list price of ~$900. The 1993 models were the only year to feature a stainless steel exhaust system and a tamper-proof odometer. 

The 1988 LE models featured rear headrests, but were deleted for 1989-1993. Early production models (1988-1990) featured standard cornering lamps and remote fuel door release even on base trim models. By 1991-1993 those features were gradually removed from all Dodge passenger cars. By 1993, the only Dodge products that offered a remote fuel door release were the minivans and trucks, but in the late 1980s, this was standard on every Chrysler Corporation car including the Omni and Horizon twins. The base models lost cornering lamps for 1991, and the LE models lost them for 1992. 

Leather seats were optional on the LE models, but very few were so equipped.  Also available were load-leveling suspension, 14-inch alloy wheels, wire wheel covers, illuminated entry system, Infinity stereo with equalizer and power antenna, power trunk pull-down, dual 6-way power seats with memory for driver's seat and outside mirrors.

==Trim levels==
*Base (1988-1993)
*LE (1988-1993)
*Brougham: option offered on LE models that added a padded "landau" [[vinyl roof]] (1992-1993)

==International versions==
[[File:Chrysler Dynasty -- 08-28-2011.jpg|thumb|left|Chrysler Dynasty (Canada)]]
In [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]] it was marketed as the '''Chrysler Dynasty'''. The Chrysler Dynasty was identical to the 1990 Chrysler New Yorker Salon (sold in the U.S.), the only difference being their names. It was supposed to fill a void between the [[Chrysler LeBaron]] sedan and the [[Chrysler New Yorker]], just like what the LeBaron GTS did in Canada. In Mexico, the cars were only available with the V6 engine. In Canada, both [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] and V6 engines were available. Also in Canada, it replaced the [[Chrysler LeBaron GTS]] hatchback since Chrysler Canada did not want to market the [[Dodge Diplomat]]'s successor, the [[Dodge Monaco|Monaco]] in 1990. However, Chrysler Canada replaced the 600, the Dynasty's predecessor, with the [[Dodge Spirit]] instead.

[[File:1940 Dodge RX70 Airflow Texaco Tanker.jpg|thumbnail|1940 Dodge Airflow tanker truck]]

The '''Dodge Airflow''' truck was a special request model truck that [[Dodge]] introduced in late 1934 and available through 1940. It used styling cues from [[Chrysler Airflow]] cars. Most of the units produced, a few hundred, were fitted with streamlined [[tank truck]] bodies, and were used by major oil companies, like [[Texaco]], [[Socony-Vacuum Oil Company]] and [[Esso]].

Airflow trucks were based on standard Dodge models, so from an engineering point of view they were rather conventional, despite their striking look. Five model names were assigned successively to the Airflow production; namely K-52, LM-70, LM-71, RX-70 and RX-71.

[[Garfield Wood#Garwood Industries|Garwood Industries]] and [[Heil Environmental Industries|Heil Co. of Milwaukee, Wis]], among others, were the producers of the tank bodies; while the bodies of two beer trucks for [[Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company]] were built by H. Barkow Co., of Milwaukee.

==Other streamlined tanker trucks==
By the same years other streamlined tanker bodies were fitted to more conventional chassis-cabs of other truck makers, like [[Mack Trucks|Mack]], [[International Harvester|International]] and [[Diamond T]].

Specially unconventional and noteworthy were the impressive Texaco's [[Texaco Doodlebug|Diamond T ''Doodlebug'']] tankers, designed by the futuristic industrial designer [[Norman Bel Geddes]]. They featured a Heil low profile body and used a [[Hercules engines|Hercules]] six-cylinder engine mounted in the rear and a large radiator behind it. Air pressure actuated the four-speed gearbox and clutch, using the same pneumatic system for braking. A compound-curved [[windshield]] and curved side glass were also noticeable features.

In Australia the [[Socony Vacuum Oil Company]] owned several remarkable streamlined ''Reo Speed Tankers''. These trucks were built on [[REO Motor Car Company|Reo]] [[Cab over]]-engine three-Ton chassis. Bodies were built by [[Martin &amp; King]] Coachbuilders in [[Melbourne]].

The '''Dodge Dakota''', known as the '''Ram Dakota''' for the final two years of production, is a [[Pickup truck#Mid-size pickups|mid-size pickup truck]] from [[Chrysler]]'s [[Ram Trucks|Ram]] (formerly Dodge Truck) division. From its introduction through 2009, it was marketed by [[Dodge]]. The first Dakota was introduced in 1986 as a 1987 model alongside the redesigned [[Dodge Ram 50]]. The Dakota was nominated for the [[North American Car of the Year#2000-2009|North American Truck of the Year]] award for 2000. The Dakota has always been sized above the compact [[Ford Ranger]] and [[Chevrolet S-10]], but below the [[full-size]]d pickups such as Dodge's own [[Dodge Ram|Ram]]. It is a conventional design with [[body-on-frame]] construction and a [[leaf spring]]/[[live axle]] rear end. The Dakota is the first mid-size pickup with an optional [[V8 engine]]. One notable feature was the Dakota's [[rack and pinion steering]] which was added as a part of the 1997 re-design, a first for work trucks.{{ clarify|date=September 2013|reason=What steering do work trucks usually have?}} Dakotas have been used by police and fire departments, as off-road vehicles, patrol trucks, or even [[brush truck]]s.

The Dodge Dakota was developed by [[Chrysler]] as a mid-sized pickup. To keep investment low, many components were shared with existing Chrysler products and the manufacturing plant was shared with the full-sized Dodge D-Model.

The first generation of the Dakota was produced from 1986 through 1996 (for the 1987 to 1996 model years). It was slightly updated for the 1991 model year. [[Inline-four]] and [[V6 engine]]s were offered along with either a five-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] or three-speed [[automatic transmission]]. [[Four-wheel drive]] was available only with the V6. Both 6.5- and 8-foot beds were offered. [[Fuel injection]] was added to the 3.9&amp;nbsp;L V6 for 1988, but the output remained the same.

In 1988, the Sport package was added as a mid-year release. Exterior colors came in Black, Bright White, and Graphic Red. Available in both 2WD and 4x4, the Sport included:
* AM/FM stereo radio with cassette player
* Carpeted logo floor mats
* Center armrest bench seat
* Charcoal/silver deluxe cloth interior with fold-down arm rest
* Color-keyed leather-wrapped sport steering wheel
* Deluxe wipers
* Dual remote control outside mirrors
* Floor Carpet
* Gauge Package
* Mopar air dam with Bosch fog lamps
* Mopar light bar with Bosch off-road lamps (4x4 only)
* Unique bodyside tape stripes
* Euro-style black out grille and bumpers
* Sliding rear window
* 3.9 liter V6 engine
* 15" aluminum wheels

The N-body platform was the result of operational efforts by Harold K. Sperlich, who was in charge of Chrysler's Product Planning in the early 1980s, in which Japanese-inspired compact pickups of the time lacked the size and features necessary to meet the demands of American buyers. In the late-1970s, Chrysler was still recovering from their near-bankruptcy and resources were in short supply. Sperlich challenged the N-Body team to search for all opportunities to reuse existing components to create the Dakota. The resulting highly investment-efficient program enabled Chrysler to create an all-new market segment at low cost. Key individuals involved in making this product a reality included Glenn Gardner, Glen House, Robert Burnham, Don Sebert, Jim Hackstedde, and Clark Ewing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The basic Dakota vehicle was ultimately used as a foundation to create the Dakota extended cab version and the Dodge Durango SUV.

Additional options found in first-generation trucks:
* Lowered suspension
* 15-inch chrome rims
* Chrome bars along the bed
* AM/FM stereo with cassette, and (optional) CD player
* Leather seats
* Sunroof
* Sliding rear window
* Chrome bumpers
* V8 engine
* Infinity sound system

For MY 1989, the unusual Dakota [[convertible (car)|convertible]] was rolled out. It featured a fixed roll bar and a simple manual top. Roughly 2,482 were sold that first year. The idea came from [[Jerry York (businessman)|Jerry York]] and they were manufactured by [[American Specialty Cars|ASC]] (American Sunroof Company, now known as [[American Specialty Cars]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2011/09/cars-only-bob-lutz-remembers-the-dodge-dakota-convertible/|title=Cars Only Bob Lutz Remembers: The Dodge Dakota Convertible - The Truth About Cars|date=2011-09-06|work=The Truth About Cars|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important addition that year was [[Carroll Shelby]]'s [[V8 engine|V8]]-powered [[Shelby Dakota]], his first [[rear-wheel drive]] vehicle in two decades.

An extended "Club Cab" model was added for 1990, still with two doors. This model allowed the Dakota to boast capacity for six passengers, though the rear seat was best suited for cargo, children, and shorter adults.

[[File:Dodge Dakota 1994 SLT.JPG|thumb|left|1991–1996 Dodge Dakota Club Cab]]

In 1990, the front of the 1991 Dakota received a new grille and hood which extended the engine compartment to better fit the optional {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 5.2&amp;nbsp;L V8, which was inspired by the earlier [[Shelby Dakota]] V8 option. By the end of 1991, the standard square sealed-beam glass headlamps were phased out for the aerodynamic-style molded plastic headlamps attached to the grill components. It was equipped with halogen lights, making 1991 the only model year for a unique front-end for the Dakota, though it is mechanically possible to fit sealed beams on 1992 to 1996 model years, as this model year was an overlap between new grille introduction and new headlamp introduction. Also debuting on 1991 models were six-bolt wheels (replacing the earlier five-bolt wheels) based on Dodge's marketing attempting to differentiate the Dakota from competing manufacturers' trucks and the upcoming introduction of the redesigned Ram, and the last year for the Dakota convertible.

To fulfill the Dodge division's commitment to the [[American Sunroof Company]] (which was responsible for the modifications to these trucks), production of the "drop top" Dakota was extended into the 1991 model year. Production was extremely limited, with just eight produced in total, making them the most rare of all Dakotas. Unlike the previous years, colors and options varied more than before, as the manufacturer picked each of these trucks in a somewhat random fashion. No advertising was given to these trucks, and they do not appear in sales literature. This is most likely because the majority of them were sold before getting to their dealer lots.

Both of the V-configuration engines were updated to Magnum specs the next year, providing a tremendous power boost. Along with the introduction of the Magnum engine came multiport electronic fuel injection (EFI). The EFI computer (called a [[Power-train control module|PCM]] by Chrysler) was partially responsible for the improved performance. The new engine/computer combination produced about {{convert|230|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}

The 1994 model year had a few minor changes, with the most notable being the addition of a standard driver's-side airbag, located in a new, two-spoke design steering wheel (also found in the Ram). Other changes included the discontinuation of the "SE" and "LE" trims. In following with the all-new Ram full-sized pickups, the top-end trim was renamed to "SLT", with these models (along with select others) wearing the new chrome finished, styled six-bolt steel wheels styled similar to the five-bolt type found on the larger Ram. Other changes included revisions to color and overall trim options. [[Supplementary Restraint System|SRS]] [[airbags]] were also added for 1994. A [[CD player]] became optional, as did a combination [[cassette player]] and [[CD player]] unit. Leather seats were also available on LE models. New [[alloy wheels]] were available.

In 1995, the first generation's final model year of 1996, the base [[Chrysler K engine|K-based]] 2.5 L SOHC [[I4 engine]] option was out of production and had been considered vastly underpowered compared to the competition, so Dodge replaced it with another 2.5 L [[AMC straight-4 engine|I4]] engine; this being of [[American Motors]] heritage with an OHV valvetrain and rated at {{convert|120|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. This was the only major change for 1996, and the AMC 2.5 L would also be carried over as the base engine in the new, larger 1997 model.

=== Li'l Red Express Dakota and Dakota Warrior ===
Two special editions of the first were constructed with step-side beds. Both were constructed by L.E.R. Industries of Edwardsburg, Michigan. The step-side beds were constructed out of [[fiberglass]] and [[galvineel]].&lt;ref name="cardomain.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardomain.com/ride/505243/1992-dodge-dakota-regular-cab-chassis/|title=Cujo317 1992 Dodge Dakota Regular Cab &amp; Chassis Specs, Photos, Modification Info at CarDomain|website=CarDomain.com|accessdate=9 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wooden bed rails were also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/tomcat98.geo/warrior.html|title=Dakota Warrior Page|website=www.oocities.org|accessdate=9 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Li'l Red Express Dakota was made to resemble the original Express, which was based on the Dodge D-Series. It featured the classic-looking step-side bed and also had dual vertical exhaust stacks just behind the cab, which were purely cosmetic (though they could be made to be functional). The Dakota Warrior was made to resemble the Warlock trucks of the late 1970s. Warriors featured the same custom bed as the Dakota Express, but lacked the vertical exhaust stacks.&lt;ref name="cardomain.com"/&gt; Both the Express and Warrior Dakotas had a graphics package made to resemble those of the original Express and Warlock, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dakota-durango.com/forum/showthread.php?t=3956&amp;page=2|title=Lil' Red Express - Page 2 - Dakota Durango Forum|website=www.dakota-durango.com|accessdate=9 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production numbers for the Expresses and Warriors were very low, in the hundreds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dodgedakota.net/boards/gen/25232.html|title=1992 dakota warrior - Dodge Dakota Forum|website=www.dodgedakota.net|accessdate=9 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rarest of those came with the 5.2 L Magnum V8 engine, which was only an option during 1992, the final model year of Express and Warrior.&lt;ref name="cardomain.com"/&gt;

=== Models ===

The 1987-1996 Dodge Dakota came in three basic models:

The '''Dakota''' was the base trim level. It included the following features: base vinyl seating surfaces, radio delete package and audio system delete package (later, an AM/FM stereo with a two-speaker audio system became standard equipment on the '''Dakota''' model with a two-speaker audio system), a heater with fan control, vinyl flooring, a black front grille and front and rear bumpers, full-faced steel wheels, all-season tires, and manual "roll-up" windows and door locks. This model wasn't typically seen as a Club Cab model, and also wasn't available with a V8 engine option like the other Dakota models were available with.

The '''Sport''' was the mid-range trim level. It added features such as vinyl-and-cloth-trimmed seating surfaces, an AM/FM stereo with a two-speaker audio system, sport-styled steel wheels, body side cladding delete, a tilt-adjustable steering column and wheel, and "sport" interior accents to the base '''Dakota''' model. Later, it also added chrome-clad steel wheels, as well as a color-keyed front fascia and front grille, and '''Sport''' decals that adorned the doors and pickup bed sides of the Dakota. V6 and V8 engines were available on the '''Sport''' model.

The '''Sport Convertible''' was the only convertible Dakota available, and was only available until the early 1990s, when it was finally discontinued. It added the following features to the mid-range '''Sport''' trim level: sport-styled alloy wheels, cloth seating surfaces with vinyl inserts and accents, an AM/FM stereo with cassette player and a four-speaker audio system, air conditioning, a manual-folding vinyl convertible roof, and '''Sport''' decals on the doors of the Dakota. The V6 engine and two-door regular cab was the only available configuration of the '''Sport Convertible''',

The '''LE''', later renamed '''SLT''' was the top-of-the-line trim level. It added features such as cloth seating surfaces, air conditioning, an AM/FM stereo with cassette player and a four-speaker audio system, alloy wheels, body side cladding, a leather-wrapped premium steering wheel, carpeted flooring, and power windows and door locks to the mid-range '''Sport''' model. V6 and V8 engines were available on the '''LE''' or '''SLT''' model.

The second-generation Dakota began development in 1991, with an exterior design proposal by Dennis Myles under design director John R. Starr being approved in mid-1993 and frozen for production in January 1994, 30 months ahead of Job 1. Design patents were filed on May 20, 1994 under D373,979 at the USPTO. The 1997 model year Dakota was unveiled via press release in the summer of 1996 and built from July 1996 through July 2004. It inherited the [[semi truck]] look of the larger Ram, but remained largely the same underneath although steering was updated to rack and pinion as a part of the re-design. That year had the introduction of the 'R/T' model with the big 5.9&amp;nbsp;L {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler LA engine#5.9L Magnum V8|Magnum]] V8. At the time of its introduction, it was seen as one of the most radical in its class, not only for its styling, but also because it remained the only truck in its class with an available V8 engine that rivaled many V8s found in full-sized trucks with payloads up to {{convert|1500|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}.

In spring of 1998, a new limited-edition R/T package was available as an option on the Dakota Sport model from 1998 -2003. This version is considered a true street/sport truck, only available in RWD. Factory modifications such as a 360 cid/5.9-liter V8 which produced {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,400 rpm and 345 foot-pounds of torque at 3,200 rpm. The only transmission choice available was the heavy-duty, 46RE four-speed automatic, performance axle, limited-slip differential, sport suspension and steering, upgraded brakes, performance exhaust, special 17x9" cast aluminum wheels, monotone paint, bucket seats with R/T in the headrests, and many other standard options came with the package. Chrome wheels were available on 2002 &amp; 2003 models. Some of the last models made in 2003 came with the new stampede lower body cladding package and chromed version of the original cast 17x9 aluminum wheels at no extra charge. This version of the R/T Dakota was produced through 2003, with the newer 2003 R/T trucks designated as their own trimline and no longer as part of an option package on the Dakota Sport trim. The Dakota R/T could accelerate from 0 to 60&amp;nbsp;mph (97 km/h) in 6.9 seconds and complete a quarter-mile sprint in just a hair over 15 seconds. It had a maximum towing capacity of {{convert|1800|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} and a maximum payload capacity of {{convert|970|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}. The RT Package: While the Magnum 360 V-8 under the hood was the clear star of the show, the R/T package also included a host of additional upgrades. It came with a performance-tuned suspension, quicker steering gear, thicker stabilizer bars front and rear, sticky P255/55R17 tires and a ride height that was 1 inch lower than the standard Dakota.

Also in 1998, the Dakota R1 was released for production in Brazil through the efforts of a small team known as Truck Special Programs and featured a base four-cylinder engine and offered a 2.5L VMI turbodiesel along with a V8, all designed around a reinforced four-wheel drive chassis used on both two- and four-wheel drive models. Altogether, 28 roll-in-chassis R1 configurations were designed for the Brazil market to be built at the Curitiba assembly facility as CKDs. This program was cancelled when Chrysler was purchased by Daimler.

[[File:Dodge Dakota Quad Cab Sport.jpg|thumb|left|Dodge Dakota Sport Quad Cab]]

Gone for 2000 was the 8-foot bed on the regular cab, but new for this year was the Quad Cab. Four-door Quad Cab models had a slightly shorter bed, 63.1&amp;nbsp;in (1602&amp;nbsp;mm), but riding on the Club Cab's 130.9&amp;nbsp;in (3325&amp;nbsp;mm) wheelbase. The Quad Cab featured a full-sized flip up rear seat to provide room for three passengers in the back or lots of dry, interior room for cargo. The aging 5.2&amp;nbsp;L Magnum V8 was replaced by a new high-tech 4.7&amp;nbsp;L [[SOHC]] PowerTech V8 this year, and the new 45RFE automatic transmission was introduced.

A fairly extensive revision of the Dakota's interior was made in 2000 for 2001 year models, including a completely redesigned dash, door panels, and revised seats. Other minor trim revisions were made, including redesigned aluminum wheels on various models. All vehicles also got new radio options. Only the standard AM/FM radio (with no cassette deck) was discontinued, making an AM/FM radio with a [[cassette deck]] standard on all models. AM/FM stereo CD and cassette/CD variants were also available.

The 2002 model was the final year for the [[Straight-4|four-cylinder engine]] in the Dakota, as Chrysler ended production of the former [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] design. Most buyers ordered the V6 or V8 engines, which were considerably more powerful and, in the case of the V6, which was made standard for 2003, nearly as fuel-efficient with a manual transmission. Also, an automatic transmission was not available with the four-cylinder. [[SIRIUS Satellite Radio]] was also now available as an option, and revised radios with new wiring harnesses could accommodate this new feature. A [[CD changer]] radio was also available, eliminating the need for a separately mounted unit located elsewhere inside the truck. The drivers could load up to six discs into the unit at a time, and could switch out the discs at any time, something they could not do with the old unit. [[Radio Data System]] became standard equipment on some radios.

The 2003 model was the end of the old [[pushrod engine|OHV]] V6 and the big R/T V8; the 2004 model year vehicles were available with a new 3.7 L [[Chrysler PowerTech engine|Magnum]] V6 engine to go along with the 4.7 L V8 variant.

In 2004, the cassette deck option was discontinued, and a [[CD player]] became standard equipment on all models.

This generation was also assembled and sold in [[Brazil]] from 1998 to 2001.

The [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety|IIHS]] gave this generation a 'Poor' rating in the frontal offset crash test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=96 |title=IIHS-HLDI:Dodge Dakota regular cab |publisher=Insurance Institute for Highway Safety |accessdate=July 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trim levels ===
The 1997 to 2004 Dodge Dakota was available in several different trim levels:

The '''ST''' served as the base model of the Dakota. It included features such as an A/M-F/M stereo (later with cassette player) and a four-speaker sound system, vinyl-trimmed seating surfaces, front (or front and rear) bench seats, styled steel fifteen-inch (later sixteen-inch) wheels, and vinyl flooring. It also included, and was only available with, the 3.9L (later 3.7L) V6 engine. The '''ST''' was also not offered as a four-door Quad Cab model.

The '''Sport''' served as the "step-up" Dakota model. It added the following features to the '''ST''' model: an A/M-F/M stereo with cassette player (later, a single-disc CD player), cloth seating surfaces, sport-styled alloy wheels, and carpeted flooring. It was available with all engines except for the high-performance 5.9L V8 engine.

The '''SXT''', introduced for model year 2001, served as the "mid-range" Dakota model. It added the following features to the '''Sport''' model: an A/M-F/M stereo with single-disc CD player, air conditioning, power windows and door locks with keyless entry (available as an option), and a premium interior. It was available with all engines except for the high-performance 5.9L V8 engine. An '''SXT Plus''' model was available that added "value" features such as an A/M-F/M stereo with cassette and single-disc CD players with integral CD changer controls, a premium cloth interior, and sixteen-inch alloy wheels mounted on sixteen-inch tires.

The '''SLT''' was the "top-line" Dakota model from late 2000. It added the following features to the '''SXT''' model (2001 to 2004 model years) or the '''Sport''' model (1997 to 2000 model years): power windows and door locks (Sport only) with keyless entry, a premium interior (Sport only), and premium-styled alloy or chrome-clad wheels. It was available with all available engines on the Dakota. An '''SLT Plus''' Package was available that added "value" features to the '''SLT''' model, such as sixteen-inch alloy wheels, sixteen-inch tires, an A/M-F/M stereo with cassette and CD players (and integral CD changer controls on 2001 to 2004 year models), a premium cloth interior, and more "upscale" features.

The '''R/T''', otherwise known as the '''5.9 R/T''' was known as the "high-performance" and "top-line" Dakota model from 1997 to 2000. It added the following features to the '''SLT''' model: sport front seats, sport-styled chrome-clad wheels, larger performance-rated tires, an A/M-F/M stereo with cassette and single-disc CD players, a six-speaker Infinity amplified premium audio system, and the high-performance 5.9L V8 engine. It was available in all available Dakota models except for the 4-Door Quad Cab model, which was introduced after the '''R/T''' or '''5.9 R/T''' was discontinued.

The redesigned 2005 Dakota still shared its [[automobile platform|platform]] with the new [[Dodge Durango]] [[SUV]] (which is now similar to the Ram platform). This model is {{convert|3.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} longer and {{convert|2.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wider, and features a new front and rear suspension, and rack-and-pinion steering. This new generation model also reverted to five-lug wheels from the prior generation's six-lug wheels due to cost and assembly time saving measures. The Dakota is built at the [[Warren Truck Assembly]] plant in [[Warren, Michigan]].

A V6 and two V8 engines were available: The standard engine is a 3.7&amp;nbsp;L Magnum V6; the two 4.7&amp;nbsp;L V8 engines are the standard Magnum V8 and the V8 High Output or HO. The 3.7&amp;nbsp;L V6 produces {{convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|235|lbft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. The standard-output 4.7&amp;nbsp;L V8 produces {{convert|230|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|295|lbft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. The high-output 4.7&amp;nbsp;L V8 produces {{convert|260|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|310|lbft|N.m|0|abbr=on}} of torque. Both the 3.7&amp;nbsp;L and standard output 4.7&amp;nbsp;L V8s were available with the six-speed manual transmission in 2005 and 2006. For 2007, that option was deleted on the V8 models.

In addition to a refresh of the Dakota's styling, this generation was not offered in a regular cab model. Only the club cab and quad cab configurations were available. the Dakota R/T returned in late 2005 for the 2006 year model, but only with cosmetic modifications. Despite the "R/T" moniker which signifies "Road and Track", the newest Dakota R/T was simply an option package, characterized by a nonfunctional hood scoop, exclusive gauge cluster, and hockey stick-style side stripes. The package was available on both two- and four-wheel drive models.

[[File:2008 Dodge Dakota.jpg|thumb|left|2008 Dakota crew cab]]

The facelifted third-generation Dakota was unveiled at the 2007 [[Chicago Auto Show]]. The Dakota received another facelift and interior upgrade along with a few other upgrades, including built-in cargo-box utility rails, heated bench seats, best-in-class towing (up to {{convert|7050|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}), the largest and longest standard bed in the class, and the largest mid-size truck cab. Its new 4.7-liter V8 produces {{convert|310|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|330|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The standard engine remained the 3.7-liter V6 with {{convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|235|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. Production began in August 2007.

As of 2010, the Dakota was considered a part of the [[Ram Trucks|Ram]] lineup. However, the "Dodge" emblem still existed on the tailgate, and the truck was interchangeably referred to as a Ram Dakota or Dodge Dakota. Its [[Mitsubishi Raider]] sibling was discontinued in 2009.

The [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety|IIHS]] gave this generation a 'Good' rating in the frontal offset crash test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=929 |title=IIHS-HLDI:Dodge Dakota crew cab |publisher=Insurance Institute for Highway Safety |accessdate=July 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Models ===
Throughout its production run, the 2005 to 2010 Dodge Dakota was available in three basic models:

The '''ST''' served as the base Dakota model. It included the following features: sixteen-inch styled steel wheels, sixteen-inch tires, vinyl-trimmed seating surfaces, manual windows and door locks, an A/M-F/M stereo with a single-disc CD player (later, single-disc CD/MP3 player) and auxiliary audio input jack (on most models), a four-speaker sound system, air conditioning, and the 3.7L "Power-Tech" V6 engine, which was the only available engine on the '''ST''' model.

The '''SLT''' served as the "mid-level" Dakota model. It added the following features to the base '''ST''' model: sixteen-inch sport-styled alloy wheels, cloth seating surfaces, and power windows and door locks with keyless entry. The '''SLT''' was available with any engine offering on the Dakota. A '''Big Horn''' (all states other than Texas), or '''Lonestar''' (Texas Only) Package was also available for the '''SLT''' model, which included "value-added" features, as was an '''SXT''' Package that added a color-keyed front grille, color-keyed front and rear bumpers, and sport cloth seating surfaces.

The '''Laramie''', otherwise known as the '''SLT Laramie''', was the "top-line" Dakota model. It added the following features to the "mid-level" SLT model: seventeen-inch chrome-clad alloy wheels, seventeen-inch tires, an A/M-F/M stereo with a six-disc, in-dash CD/MP3 changer and auxiliary audio input jack (on most models), a premium Infinity (later Alpine) six-speaker amplified audio system, leather-trimmed heated seating surfaces, power front seats, a security system, a five-speed automatic transmission, and the base 4.7L "Power-Tech" V8 engine, though the high-output version of the same engine was also available on the '''Laramie''' or '''SLT Laramie'''.

== Discontinuation ==
The third-generation Dakota was discontinued in 2011, with the last unit coming off the assembly line on August 23, 2011, ending the truck's 25-year run.&lt;ref name="end"/&gt; As of 2011, according to Sergio Marchionne, the CEO of Chrysler Group, the Dakota will probably not be replaced by a similar vehicle, mostly due to declining popularity of compact trucks on the North American market (see [[Ford Ranger (North America)|Ford Ranger]] for similar outcome).&lt;ref name="end"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://detnews.com/article/20110820/AUTO01/108200317/1148/rss25 |title=Chrysler to stop Dakota production |newspaper=The Detroit News |date=August 20, 2011 |accessdate=August 24, 2011 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20110824001759/http://detnews.com/article/20110820/AUTO01/108200317/1148/rss25 |archivedate=August 24, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem was that buyers complained that the smaller pickup was not priced lower than the full-sized Ram 1500; nevertheless, the Dakota's return continues to be reported since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allpar.com/trucks/ram/dakota-2012.html |title=The 2016 Dodge Dakota pickup truck |publisher=Allpar.com |accessdate=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.pickuptrucks.com/2012/01/the-next-dodge-dakota-more-intel-from-chrysler-ceo.html |title=The Next Dodge Dakota: More Intel From Chrysler CEO |first=Mark |last=Williams |date=January 9, 2012 |accessdate=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]] announced in September 2014 an agreement with [[Mitsubishi Motors]] to codevelop the next-generation [[Mitsubishi L200]] to be sold globally by both companies.

The '''first-generation [[Chrysler minivans]]''' are a series of [[minivan]]s produced and marketed by the [[Chrysler Corporation]] in North American and Europe from 1984 to 1990.  Sold in both passenger and cargo configurations, the series is the first of six generations of Chrysler minivans.  Launched ahead of chief competitors [[Chevrolet Astro|Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari]] and [[Ford Aerostar]], the first-generation Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager effectively created the modern minivan segment in North America, with many later North American minivans adopting a similar body configuration.

Launched in November 1983 for the 1984 model year, the Chrysler minivans were produced in a single body style, with the extended-length Grand Caravan and Grand Voyager introduced in 1987.  For 1990, the minivan was added to the Chrysler brand, adopting the Chrysler Town &amp; Country nameplate.  For export, Chrysler sold the Chrysler Voyager, competing against the [[Renault Espace]] (which began life as a Talbot, part of the former Chrysler Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.matrasport.dk/Cars/Espace/history.html|title=The Matra/Renault Espace|last=Sorth|first=Lennart|website=www.matrasport.dk|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The development of what became the Chrysler minivans began in the early 1970s, as both Ford Motor Company and the truck division of Dodge began separate projects on "garageable vans".  Intended as a more powerful, safer-handling alternative to the Volkswagen Microbus, both companies sought to create vehicles capable as a second car.&lt;ref name="allpar.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/m/history.html|title=A Brief History of the Chrysler Minivan|publisher=Allpar|accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dodge project did not progress past the clay model stage; Chrysler chairman [[Lynn Townshend]] argued that if a market for such a vehicle existed, Ford and GM would have already done it. At Ford, Lee Iaccoca and Hal Sperling developed a proposed garageable van called the [[Ford Carousel]]. It was rejected for the same reason, that GM would have done it already if it was a viable idea.

At the end of 1977, development of Chrysler minivans restarted with four main goals, with a planned 1982 model year launch.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;

# The ability to park in a standard-size garage 
# Car-like [[Noise, vibration, and harshness|NVH]]
# Low, flat load floor
# Removable rear seats (ability to carry a 4×8 sheet of building material on the floor)

Although both the front-wheel drive [[Chrysler K platform|K-Cars]] and L-body ([[Dodge Omni|Omni/Horizon]]) were being considered as donor platforms, Chrysler also allowed consideration of rear-wheel drive.  Ultimately, the L-body was ruled out, as it was considered too light-duty for either the size of the vehicle or its planned six-cylinder engine.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;

In 1978, both [[Lee Iacocca]] and Hal Sperlich were fired from Ford Motor Company, joining Chrysler Corporation.  The same year, the truck engineering division of Dodge was merged within its car counterpart of Chrysler.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  During 1978, Chrysler began research across the United States, seeking what features customers desired in a potential minivan, finding agreement in its planned goals.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  Though potential customers found concept sketches "ugly", Chrysler still found a potential market of nearly 1 million vehicles per year, with Chrysler selling 215,000 of them.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;

By 1979, Chrysler chose front-wheel drive for the minivan project, codenamed "T-115".&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  Though the van would share its transverse engine and transmission with the K-cars, it would be based on a separate body structure.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  Approved by Lee Iaccoca at the end of 1979, the T-115 project would cost $500 million to produce, funded as part of the $1.5 billion in federal loan guarantees given to Chrysler.

From is 1979 approval to the 1984 launch, the proposed design would undergo several major changes.  Originally intended to use four sedan-style doors (similar to a station wagon), Chrysler changed to two sliding doors for the rear, claiming better parking-lot access. The design was later changed to a single sliding door, as Chrysler wanted to market the van to commercial buyers; while engineers wanted to make the left-side door an option. The decision to go with a single sliding door was done to reduce costs.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  During development, the configuration of the rear door was also contentious, with a liftgate winning out over a station wagon-style tailgate.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  On the exterior, in 1981, the side windows were redesigned to become flush with the body; while requiring a major redesign of components and tooling, the design change allowed for a reduction of wind noise and drag.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  To further reduce costs, a number of visible interior components were shared with the [[Plymouth Reliant|Dodge Aries/Plymouth Reliant]], including the instrument panel, interior controls, radio, and various trim items. Drivetrain choices proved problematic as the K-car 2.2&amp;nbsp;L four was considered inadequate and the Slant Six was unsuited for transverse FWD mounting. The Mitsubishi 2.6&amp;nbsp;L four could however be offered as an interim engine until a V6 became available.

==Overview==
Launched in November 1983 for the 1984 model year, Chrysler marketed the first-generation minivans as the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager, along with the Mini Ram Van cargo van.  While the Dodge Caravan nameplate was used for the first time, Plymouth had used the Voyager nameplate since 1974 on its version of the Dodge Sportsman full-size passenger van.

Initially released in a single 112-inch wheelbase, Chrysler introduced a 119-inch wheelbase as part of a 1987 update, launching the Grand Caravan/Grand Voyager.  Starting in 1988, the Chrysler Voyager was exported to markets outside of the United States and Canada.  For 1990, Chrysler began production of the Chrysler Town &amp; Country, among the first luxury vehicles produced as a minivan.

=== Body ===
[[File:1984 Plymouth Voyager LE (30965894313).jpg|left|thumb|LE-trim Chrysler minivan rear seats (1984-1986)]]
Designed as an alternative to full-size station wagons, the standard-length Dodge Caravan/Plymouth Voyager (two inches shorter and two inches wider than a K-car station wagon), presented nearly double the cargo space of a K-car station wagon with a 7-foot long cargo floor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/original-minivans.html|title=Original Minivans: 1984-91 Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager, Chrysler Town &amp; Country|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to the K-car station wagons, the minivans use a liftgate rear door (supported by gas struts), unlocked by key.

Several seating configurations were offered, depending on trim level.  The standard configuration of five-passenger seating in two rows was included with seven or eight-passenger seating in three rows; the back two seats were two-passenger and three-passenger bench seats (in the style of a larger van, these latched to the floor).  The more popular two-passenger configuration was offered in several configurations, with low-back seats (as the minivan was technically a light truck), or high back seats with headrests; depending on trim level, seats could have vinyl, "deluxe" cloth or vinyl, or "luxury" cloth/vinyl upholstery.  Two styles of rear seats were offered.  The three-passenger rear bench was adjustable for passenger legroom or cargo space; the seatback also folded down when not in use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In 1985, a five-passenger version was introduced with a fold-flat rear seat; called "Convert-a-bed", the option allowed the rear seat to fold backwards into a bed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

To lower production and development costs of the Chrysler minivans, the vehicles maintained a high degree of visible parts commonality with other Chrysler vehicles, sharing wheel covers, door handles, instrument panels, and other visible trim pieces with the Aries/Reliant and other Chrysler vehicles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  As the design of the dashboard precluded a conventional glove box, Chrysler added a large storage drawer underneath the passenger seat (a feature retained in later generations of Chrysler minivans and the Chrysler PT Cruiser).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The minivans also became the first automobiles ever with modern cup holders.&lt;ref&gt;https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2013/03/08/when-did-cars-get-cup-holders/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dean |first1=Sam |title=The History of the Car Cup Holder |url=https://www.bonappetit.com/trends/article/the-history-of-the-car-cup-holder |accessdate=24 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1984–1986 ===
At their 1984 launch, as with the K-Cars, the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager were externally distinguished largely by their grilles.  Both vehicles were fitted with four headlights, with the Caravan fitted with an eggcrate grille while the Voyager was fitted with a horizontally-oriented grille.  In what would become a signature styling feature of 1980s Chrysler minivans, top-trim Caravans and Voyagers were both offered with [[Woodie (car body style)#simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] as an option.

In following with many other Chrysler vehicles, for 1986, Chrysler minivans shifted from 4-lug to 5-lug wheels.  To reduce high-speed wind noise, Chrysler added a bumper-mounted air dam.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== 1987–1990 ===
The 1987 model year saw a mid-cycle update to the S-platform minivans.  Largely centered around the May 1987 introduction of the Grand Caravan and Grand Voyager, the update brought a new front fascia and taillights.  To better differentiate the Caravan from the Voyager, the model lines received different grilles; all models except the Mini Ram Van (cargo van) were shifted to flush-lens composite headlamps.  Fourteen inches longer in length than a standard-wheelbase Chrysler minivan, the Grand Caravan/Grand Voyager was the largest minivan in North America in 1987. The first Chrysler minivans fitted with a V6 engine, the Grand Caravan/Grand Voyager eventually became the two most popular configurations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  With both rear seats removed, the "Grand" minivans offered 150 cubic feet of cargo room, 25 extra than a standard wheelbase Chrysler minivan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The front bench seat and Convert-A-Bed, both seldom ordered, did not return for 1987. Interior upholstery was upgraded on several trims, with base vinyl seats removed (and deluxe vinyl remaining as an option on SE trim); for the first time, leather seating was offered on LE/Grand LE trim.

For 1989, the minivans saw a minor update.  To improve fit and finish, Chrysler redesigned the front and rear bumpers, with single-piece bumper covers, painted to match the color of the body.  The early-1980s K-Car steering wheel was replaced by a 3-spoke design (though the rest of the dashboard remained unchanged).  In addition to the standard trim levels, Chrysler added the top-line Dodge Caravan ES and Plymouth Voyager LX; as an early 1990 model, the Chrysler Town &amp; Country luxury minivan was introduced in early 1989.

=== Chassis ===
The first-generation Chrysler minivans are based upon the Chrysler S platform, using unibody construction.  Contrary to popular belief, the S platform is not directly related to the K platform;&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; though sharing powertrains to lower development and production costs, the S platform has a distinct body structure, allowing for a higher hoodline and seat height.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  The S platform is produced in two wheelbases: 112.1 inches for standard-length minivans; 119.1 inches for "Grand"-length minivans.

Adapting the layout of the K platform for a larger vehicle, the S-platform vans were fitted with [[MacPherson strut]] front suspension and a [[Beam axle|beam rear axle]] with [[leaf spring]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  All S-platform minvans are fitted with front disc and rear drum brakes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Engines ====
For the first three years of production, two engines were offered&amp;nbsp;– both [[inline-4]] engines with two-barrel [[carburetors]]. The base [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2&amp;nbsp;L]] was borrowed from the [[Chrysler K platform|Chrysler K-cars]], and produced {{convert|96|hp|kW|abbr=on}} horsepower. The higher performance fuel-injected version of the [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2&amp;nbsp;L]] engine later offered in the K-cars was never offered in the Caravan, and the 2-bbl version would remain the base power plant until mid-1987. Alongside the [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2&amp;nbsp;L]], an optional Mitsubishi [[Astron 2.6|2.6&amp;nbsp;L]] engine was available, producing {{convert|104|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.

[[File:Dodge V6 EFI fender badge.jpg|thumb|right|Fender badge originally used on V6 equipped minivans]]

In mid-1987, the base [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2&amp;nbsp;L]] [[Straight-4|I4]] was replaced with a [[fuel-injected]] [[Chrysler K engine#2.5|2.5&amp;nbsp;L]] [[Straight-4|I4]], which produced {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while the [[Mitsubishi Astron engine|Mitsubishi ''G54B'']] I4 was replaced with a new [[fuel-injected]] [[Mitsubishi 6G7x engine#6G72|3.0&amp;nbsp;L Mitsubishi]] [[V6 engine|V6]] producing {{convert|136|hp|kW|abbr=on}} in March of that year.

Shortly thereafter, in model year 1989, a more powerful engine became optional: a [[Chrysler K engine#2.5 Turbo|turbocharged version]] of the 2.5&amp;nbsp;L I4 producing {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Revisions to the Mitsubishi V6 increased its output to {{convert|142|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, and in 1990 a new {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.3|3.3&amp;nbsp;L V6]] was added to the option list. The V6 engines became popular as sales of the 2.5 turbo dwindled, and it was dropped at the end of the year.

None of the V6 engines nor the turbocharged four were available on the European Chrysler Voyager. The Chrysler Town &amp; Country was only available with one engine option, the Mitsubishi 3.0&amp;nbsp;L V6, until June 1989 when it was replaced by the newly introduced 3.3&amp;nbsp;L V6.

====Transmissions====
Both a three-speed [[TorqueFlite]] A413 [[automatic transmission]] and a five-speed manual were available with most [[inline-4]] engines, including the turbocharged 2.5 L (this was a rare combination). Manual transmissions were not available on 2.6&amp;nbsp;L Mitsubishi 4-cylinder models nor V6 models of the passenger Caravan, but were an option on the Mini Ram Van and Caravan C/V's long wheelbase models with a 3.0 L V6.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[V6 engine]]s were only offered with the fully hydraulically operated TorqueFlite until the computer controlled [[Ultradrive]] 4-speed automatic became available in 1989. The [[Ultradrive]] offered much better fuel economy and responsiveness, particularly when paired with the [[inline-4]] engine. However, it suffered from reliability problems, usually stemming from what is known as "gear hunt" or "shift busyness", resulting in premature wear of the internal clutches. It also required an uncommon type of automatic transmission fluid and is not clearly labeled as such, leading many owners to use the more common [[Dexron|Dexron II]] rather than the specified "Mopar ATF+3", resulting in transmission damage and eventual failure.

The [[Ultradrive]] received numerous design changes in subsequent model years to improve reliability,{{Original research inline|date=February 2015}} and many early model transmissions would eventually be retrofitted or replaced with the updated versions by dealers, under warranty. These efforts were mostly successful, and most first-generation Caravans eventually got an updated transmission.{{Original research inline|date=February 2015}}

=== Trim ===
The S-platform Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager were both offered in three trim levels, an unnamed base trim level, mid-range ''SE'', and top-range ''LE''; LE-trim minivans were marketed with the option of [[Woodie (car body style)#simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] paneling.  In 1989, as part of a minor exterior update, Dodge and Plymouth each gained an additional trim level for the top of the model range, the Dodge Caravan ES and Plymouth Voyager LX, available only in standard-wheelbase configuration.

== Variants ==

=== Cargo van ===
[[File:Dodge Caravan CV.jpg|thumb|1989-1990 Dodge Caravan C/V]]
Chrysler produced two cargo van variants of the S platform, both based upon the Dodge Caravan.  From 1984 to 1988, Dodge marketed the Mini Ram Van.  Distinguished by a "Ram" nameplate under the side-view mirror, the Mini Ram Van was renamed the Caravan C/V (Cargo Van) for 1989.  In contrast to passenger vans, the Caravan C/V was fitted with model-specific headlight clusters, using dual sealed-beam headlamps (shared with the export Chrysler Voyager).  Several window configurations were available, ranging from either no windows to a full set of windows.  Coinciding with the 1987 introduction of the Grand Caravan, cargo van production expanded to both wheelbases.

On the Caravan C/V, in addition to the liftgate rear door, Chrysler offered 50/50 split rear doors (similar to the [[Chevrolet Astro]] and traditional cargo vans).  Produced as an option, the 50/50 doors were constructed of fiberglass; custom-installed by an outside vendor, the doors were installed between the factory and shipment to a dealer.

As with the larger [[Dodge Ram Van]], the Mini Ram Van and Caravan C/V also served as a basis for [[conversion van]]s, sold through Chrysler dealers as well as through converters themselves.

=== Chrysler Voyager (export) ===
{{Main|Chrysler Voyager}}
[[File:VoyagerIEuropeLeft.jpg|thumb|1989-1990 Chrysler Voyager]]
Starting for the 1988 model year, Chrysler began exports of minivans to Europe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  As neither the Plymouth nor the Dodge brands were marketed outside of North America by Chrysler, minivans were exported under the [[Chrysler Voyager]] nameplate, competing against the [[Renault Espace]] and [[Volkswagen Type 2 (T3)|Volkswagen Transporter/Caravelle]] (sold as the Vanagon in North America).

While the Voyager name was derived from the Plymouth division, the Chrysler Voyager was a rebranded version of the Dodge Caravan, fitted with the front fascia of the Caravan C/V cargo van.  To accommodate the vehicle for European sale, the Chrysler Voyager was fitted with amber turn signal lenses (requiring new taillights), turn signal repeaters, and a model-specific license plate surround (adapted for European license plates and embossed with "Chrysler").

Along with its rebranding, the Chrysler Voyager saw internal modifications, largely to comply with European safety and emissions regulations.  With the exception of the turbocharged 2.5&amp;nbsp;L I4 and 3.3&amp;nbsp;L V6, the Chrysler Voyager shared its powertrain with its North American counterpart; many examples were produced with manual transmissions.

=== Chrysler Town &amp; Country ===
{{Main|Chrysler Town &amp; Country}}
[[File:1990 Chrysler Town &amp; Country minivan.jpg|thumb|1990 Chrysler Town &amp; Country]]After being discontinued in the 1988 model year, the Chrysler Town &amp; Country nameplate was revived as Chrysler released a minivan for its namesake division.  Introduced in the spring of the 1989 as an early 1990 model, the Town &amp; Country was released as the highest-trim version of the three Chrysler minivans, sold exclusively in the long-wheelbase body length.  Originally slated for a 1989 release,&lt;ref&gt;[http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/wqIAAOxy4c5RsPPu/$T2eC16FHJIQE9qUHrjB(BRsPPur4DQ~~60_57.JPG?rt=nc Early sales material for the model referring to it as a 1989 model], retrieved on 2014-12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; the Town &amp; Country was the first of the three minivans produced as a 1990 model.

Designed as a competitor to luxury-themed minivans such as the Ford Aerostar Eddie Bauer and the (then-upcoming) [[Oldsmobile Silhouette]], the Town &amp; Country included nearly every feature of the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager as standard equipment, with a number of trim features of its own.  All examples were produced with woodgrain trim (a feature associated with the nameplate).  Initially, Bright White Clearcoat was the sole color available, with Black Clearcoat added as an option in June 1989 (as 1990 Caravans/Voyagers entered production&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imperialclub.com/Yr/1990/index.htm "1990 Chrysler Showroom Brochure" pg. 30], retrieved on 2011–06–18.&lt;/ref&gt;).

To externally distinguish the Town &amp; Country, Chrysler added a chrome waterfall grille (styled similar to the [[Chrysler New Yorker]]), clear-lens turn front turn signals, body-color mirrors, a crystal Pentastar hood ornament (shared with the New Yorker/Fifth Avenue), lower body trim (a monochromatic, long-wheelbase version of the Dodge Caravan ES body trim), and 15" alloy wheels&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imperialclub.com/Yr/1990/index.htm "1990 Chrysler Showroom Brochure" pg. 20-21], retrieved on 2011–06–18.&lt;/ref&gt; (later used with the Plymouth Voyager LX and other Plymouth models).  The interior featured model-specific leather seating, leather interior trim panels, all available power-operated equipment, front and rear air conditioning, and an [[Infinity (audio)|Infinity II sound system]].

Depending on production date, the 1990 Chrysler Town &amp; Country was produced with one of two V6 engines.  Prior to June 1989, it was fitted with a 142&amp;nbsp;hp 3.0L Mitsubishi V6.  From June 1989 onward, all examples were fitted with the 150&amp;nbsp;hp Chrysler 3.3L V6.  Although all S-platform Town &amp; Country minivans have 1990 VINs, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] classifies examples with the 3.0L V6 as 1989 vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/noframes/6255.shtml "Fuel Economy of the 1989 Chrysler Town and Country"], retrieved on 2015-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both engines were paired with the 4-speed [[Ultradrive]] automatic transmission.

In total, 5,404 examples of the Chrysler Town &amp; Country were produced, making this variant the rarest of all Chrysler minivans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/cars/production/chrysler-US.html|title=Chrysler Cars and Production Numbers, United States|last=Wilson|first=Gerard|date=June 2013|work=Allpar|accessdate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=July 2019}}

== Marketing ==
Original commercials for the 1984 Voyager featured magician [[Doug Henning]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joE9juKuWSY "1984 plymouth voyager commercial"], retrieved on 2010–08–25.&lt;/ref&gt; as a spokesperson to promote the Voyager "Magic Wagon's" versatility, cargo space, low step-in height, passenger volume, and maneuverability. Later commercials in 1989 featured rock singer [[Tina Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl2HV4UlZ84 "1989 Tina Turner Plymouth Voyager Commercial"], retrieved on 2010–08–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian commercials in 1990 featured pop singer [[Celine Dion]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi5t4AxvKKg "Celine Dion : 1990 Dodge Caravan &amp; Plymouth Voyager"], retrieved on 2010–08–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''second-generation [[Chrysler minivans]]''' are a series of [[Minivan|minivans]] that were manufactured and marketed by [[Chrysler|Chrysler Corporation]] in North America and Europe from 1991 to 1995.  Officially designated the AS platform by Chrysler, the second-generation minivans were an extensive revision of the first-generation chassis and body.  As before, passenger and cargo configurations were sold by Dodge, Plymouth, and Chrysler divisions.  The first minivans offered with driver-side airbags (in 1991) and with optional integrated child safety seats (in 1992), the second-generation Chrysler minivans offered all-wheel drive as an option for the first time; a manual transmission would be offered for the last time in the North American market.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/1991-voyager.html|title=1991-1995 Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager minivans|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;      

As with its predecessor, Chrysler assembled second-generation minivans at [[Windsor Assembly]] in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, with additional production at [[Saint Louis Assembly|Saint Louis (North) Assembly]] in Fenton, Missouri from 1990 to 1994.  In 1992, to supplement exports from the United States, the Chrysler Voyager and Dodge Mini Ram Van began production in Graz, Austria (in the [[Eurostar Automobilwerk|Eurostar]] joint venture factory between Chrysler and [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch]]).  

For the 1996 model year, the AS-generation minivans were replaced by the [[Chrysler minivans (NS)|NS platform]], marking the first complete redesign of the Chrysler minivans since their 1984 introduction.

==Overview==
Introduced in November 1990, the second-generation Chrysler minivans were marketed by the Dodge, Plymouth, and Chrysler divisions.  The Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager nameplates returned, with both short-wheelbase and long-wheelbase (Grand) body configurations.  As with the first-generation minivans, base-trim examples were equipped with 5-passenger seating, with 7-passenger seating as standard in higher-trim versions (SE, LE, ES/LX, and all Town &amp; Country vans).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For 1994, the model range underwent a mid-cycle revision, primarily intended to comply with 1998 upgrades to US federal safety standards for cars (although the entire model range was officially considered a light truck).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/1994.html|title=1994 minivans: Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager, Chrysler Town &amp; Country|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alongside minor exterior styling changes, the minivans were given dual airbags, four-wheel disc brakes with ABS, and side impact beams in the front and sliding doors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In another set of revisions, Chrysler sought to make the vans quieter, improving fit and finish.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Chassis ===
The second-generation Chrysler minivans are officially designated the Chrysler AS platform (matching the Chrysler shift to two-letter platform designations in 1990).  Largely a substantial revision of the first-generation S-platform minivans, the AS chassis retained the 112.0 inch wheelbase for standard-wheelbase vans and 119.1 inches for extended-wheelbase "Grand" vans.  While structurally unrelated to the (discontinued) [[Chrysler K platform|Chrysler K-cars]], the second-generation minivans shifted mechanical commonality towards its larger derivatives, adopting engines and transmissions from the Chrysler AA platform (Dodge Spirit/Plymouth Acclaim) and the Chrysler AC/AY platform (Chrysler New Yorker/Fifth Avenue/Imperial and Dodge Dynasty).  

Retaining the unibody construction of the first-generation minivans, the second-generation minivans are fitted with a MacPherson strut front suspension with coil rear springs; all-wheel drive versions have 4-wheel independent suspension with a leaf-sprung rear axle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  During the development of the platform, attention was paid on refining the handling over the first-generation vans, in order to improve stability, maneuverability, and steering feel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For 1991 to 1993, a disc front/rear drum brake configuration was utilized, with a four-wheel disc brake system introduced in 1994.  All versions were fitted with anti-lock brakes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

====Powertrain====
With the lone exception of the Chrysler 2.5L Turbo I inline-4, the second-generation minivans returned the powertrain from their 1990 predecessors. The standard engine was a naturally-aspirated Chrysler 2.5L inline-four, producing 100 hp; this engine was standard on standard-wheelbase passenger vans and all cargo vans. A Mitsubishi-produced 3.0L V6 (producing 142 hp) was an option on short-wheelbase vans. Introduced in 1990, the Chrysler 3.3L V6 (producing 150 hp; increased to 162 hp in 1994) was standard on all Grand Voyagers/Grand Caravans, Town &amp; Countrys, and vans with all-wheel drive; the 3.3L V6 was offered on short-wheelbase as a second option.

For 1994, the AS-platform minivans adopted the 3.8L V6 engine from the Chrysler Imperial.  A larger-bore version of the 3.3L V6 tuned for additional torque output, while producing the same 162 hp of the 3.3L V6, produced 213 lb-ft of torque. The standard engine of the Chrysler Town &amp; Country and all-wheel drive vans, the 3.8L engine became an option on the Grand Voyager/Grand Caravan. In January 1992 a 2.5-liter turbodiesel built by Italy's [[VM Motori]] was made available in Austrian-built Voyagers.&lt;ref name="AR93"&gt;{{citation | ref = AR93 | title = Automobil Revue 1993 | editor-last = Büschi | editor-first = Hans-Ulrich | publisher = Hallwag AG | location = Berne, Switzerland | language = German, French | page = 206 | volume = 88 | date = 4 March 1993 | isbn = 3-444-00559-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially deleted from the model line for 1991, the 5-speed manual transmission made a return for 1992 through 1994 on base-trim or cargo vans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The 2.5L engine was available with a 3-speed TorqueFlite automatic, along with the 3.0L V6. The 4-speed Ultradrive overdrive automatic transmission was fitted to both the 3.3L and 3.8L V6 engines. The Europe-only turbodiesel was only available with a five-speed manual transmission.&lt;ref name=AR93B&gt;[[#AR93|''Automobil Revue 1993'']], p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Body ===
In an extensive redesign, the second-generation minivans featured a major revision of the exterior, lowering the exterior coefficient of drag from 0.43 to 0.39.  While the styling changes were largely evolutionary, the only shared body panels from the first-generation vans were the front doors and the sliding door.    

The front fascia saw the largest degree of change, with redesigned front fenders allowing for a lower hoodline.  Introduced in 1987, composite headlamp units made their return, wrapping into the front fenders.  With the lower hoodline, a smaller grille was used.  As part of the model change, stylists sought to differentiate the three model ranges from each other.  The Plymouth Voyager was given chrome-trimmed headlights and a sleeker version of its 1987-1990 grille; the Dodge Caravan was given headlamps without chrome trim and adopted the Dodge divisional four-segment grille for the first time.  The Chrysler Town &amp; Country shared its headlamps with the Plymouth Voyager with a model-specific waterfall-style grille.  In an effort to lessen rust and improve fit and finish, front and rear bumpers were redesigned, with wraparound plastic bumpers replacing steel and rubber-ended bumpers.

For 1991, the exterior door handles were carried over from the 1984-1990 vans; for the 1992 model year, the door handles were replaced by a larger design, fitted flush with the body.  

In line with the front fascia, the rear fascia underwent several major changes, with the rear liftgate redesigned.  In addition to rounded edges to improve aerodynamics, the liftgate added a larger rear window and a center/third rear brake lamp;  the rear window wiper was updated to feature intermittent modes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In addition to the extensive exterior changes, the interior saw a complete redesign; as with the previous generation, the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager shared nearly identical interiors (across comparable trim levels).  Coinciding with the addition of a driver-side airbag, the dashboard was reconfigured, placing many primary and secondary controls within closer reach of the driver.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Dodge and Plymouth vans were offered with two different analog instrument panels, with the Chrysler Town &amp; Country fitted with a digital instrument panel.  For the first time, a glovebox was added to the dashboard (the underseat storage drawer made its return).  

The 1991 redesign adopted the seating configurations offered on the 1989-1990 vans.  While 5-passenger seating remained available on base-trim vans, 7-passenger seating became standard for all SE and LE-trim vans (regardless of wheelbase).  To meet federal safety standards, all outboard seating positions were fitted with 3-point seatbelts.  The Chrysler Town &amp; Country (in line with other high-content minivans) shifted from a second-row bench seat to second-row bucket seats as part of the redesign.  Marketed as "Quad Command" seats, the configuration was available on higher-trim (LE and LX/ES) Dodge and Plymouth vans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For 1992, for vans with second-row bench seats, Chrysler introduced integrated child safety seats as an optional feature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For 1994, the integrated child safety seats were modified, allowing for a recline position (closer to a standard carseat).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;    

=== Marketing variations ===
From the first-generation minivans, Chrysler carried over the previous trim levels essentially unchanged (the Mini Ram Van was replaced by the Dodge Caravan C/V, although the nameplate continued to be used in the Netherlands).  Although once a distinguishing feature of the Chrysler minivans in the 1980s, simulated woodgrain trim began to fall out of favor in the 1990s.  In 1992, woodgrain became a delete option from the Chrysler Town &amp; Country and removed entirely from the Dodge Caravan for 1994.  

As part of the 1994 model revision, the liftgate badging was changed from a stamped silver-on-black badge to a smaller embossed silver font; this was the first change to badging since 1984.  Chrysler Town &amp; Country versions retained their script-style badging.

==== Chrysler Town &amp; Country ====
As part of the introduction of the second-generation minivans, the Chrysler Town &amp; Country became a permanent member of the minivan model range, intended as its flagship.  Produced only in the long-wheelbase body configuration, the Town &amp; Country was equipped with woodgrain trim, body-color mirrors, and alloy wheels; the Town &amp; Country is the only version of this generation produced with a [[Electronic instrument cluster|digital instrument panel]].  As with its Chrysler New Yorker and Imperial counterparts, the Town and Country was fitted with a crystal Pentastar hood ornament.  Along with tufted leather interior trim, the Town &amp; Country was fitted with "Quad Command" seating, replacing the second row bench seat with bucket seats matching those of the front row.

Although woodgrain trim had been associated with the Town &amp; Country nameplate since the 1940s, in 1992, the feature became a delete option (replaced by a gold pinstripe and a Town &amp; Country fender script) as it began to fall out of favor with buyers.  In 1993 for [[Model year|MY]]1994, Chrysler introduced a version of the Town &amp; Country with a body-color grille alongside the woodgrain side trim.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Chrysler Voyager (export) ====
Outside North America, as Chrysler does not own the rights to the Dodge or Plymouth brands, exports of the Chrysler minivans were done under the Chrysler nameplate.  In Europe, Chrysler began sales of the Voyager in 1988.  As with its first generation counterpart, the second-generation Chrysler Voyager is largely related to the Dodge Caravan in trim. Initially produced by St. Louis Assembly, in late 1991, Chrysler began sourcing the Voyager from Eurostar in Austria. In January 1992, the Chrysler Voyager began production with a 2.5L VM Motori diesel engine. The Chrysler minivans have never been sold with a diesel option in North America, however.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager ====
As with the first generation minivans, the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager were trimmed nearly identically, with the exception of cargo vans marketed exclusively by the Dodge division (as the Dodge Caravan C/V and Grand Caravan C/V in North America, and Mini Ram Van in the Netherlands).  With the exception of the steering wheel, second-generation Dodge and Plymouth minivans are nearly identical internally across comparable trim levels; Dodge Caravans are fitted with a four-spoke steering wheel while Plymouth and Chrysler minivans use a two-spoke steering wheel.

Along with the base-trim 5-passenger vans, both divisions continued the mid-grade SE and deluxe-trim LE, with the LX serving as the top trim for the short-wheelbase Voyager and the ES serving as the top.

In a change from the first-generation vans, all SE and LE vans were offered with 7-passenger seating, regardless of wheelbase.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  LE-trim vans included many features available on SE-trim vans as option as standard, along with additional sound insulation; long-wheelbase ("Grand") vans and all-wheel drive models were equipped with 15-inch wheels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The top trim in the Caravan and the Voyager was the ES (for both versions of the Caravan) and the LX (for the short-wheelbase Voyager).  Sharing its model features with LE-trim models included as standard equipment,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA2"&gt;Chrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure "1991 Plymouth Voyager/Grand Voyager"&lt;/ref&gt; the LX/ES trims served as a cosmetic upgrade similar to namesake trims in the [[Plymouth Acclaim]] and [[Dodge Spirit]].  In place of woodgrain trim, the LX was given color-keyed two-tone exterior; the ES was given nearly monochrome trim (as with the Dodge Spirit, ES-trim Caravans were fitted with white-painted wheels).  In line with the European Chrysler Voyager, the Dodge Caravan ES was not fitted with a stand-up hood ornament (with a body-color Chrysler Pentastar affixed directly onto the hood).

== Alternative-fuel vehicles ==

=== CNG minivan (1994) ===
Following the production of CNG-fuel ([[compressed natural gas]]) van prototypes derived from the [[Dodge Ram Van]] in 1992, Chrysler began production of a CNG-fuel version of its minivan in 1994.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/CNG-van.html|title=Chrysler CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) Minivans|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using the 3.3L V6 and 4-speed Ultradrive transmission powertrain, the CNG minivans underwent several modifications to accommodate the change in fuel.  Along with modifications to the engine valvetrain, four 3000PSI CNG fuel tanks were added to the vehicle, taking the place of the spare tire well and gasoline tank, holding the energy equivalent of 8.5 gallons of gasoline.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Electric vehicles (1992-1995) ===
{{Main|Chrysler TEVan}}
The Chrysler TEVan is a [[battery electric vehicle]] developed between Chrysler and the Electric Power Research Institute.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/corporate/electric-cars.html|title=Chrysler and Electric Cars and Minivans: TEVan, EPIC, and more|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First unveiled as a concept in 1992, an unknown number were produced between 1993 and 1995 (between 56 and 80).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Deriving its name from the original T-115 codename for the Chrysler minivans and EV, the TEVan was sold nearly exclusively to fleet buyers; the vehicle was based on a standard-wheelbase five-passenger Dodge Caravan.

The TEVan used a 27&amp;nbsp;hp, 65&amp;nbsp;hp max (48&amp;nbsp;kW) Separately-Excited [[GE]] DC traction motor coupled to a two-speed FWD trans-axle that featured Hi, Lo, Reverse and Park. The owner's manual referred to it as a 'semi-automatic transmission' although it used a clutch. The motor controller was also manufactured by GE.

Two different battery types were available for the TEVan during its production;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; weighing in at {{convert|1800|lb}}, the battery pack brought the curb weight the minivan to {{convert|5060|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}.  The 180 V nickel-cadmium pack consisted of 30 [[Saft Groupe S.A.|SAFT]] STM5-180 6 V 180 Ah batteries in six removable pods under the floor of the car, delivering over {{convert|50|mi|km}} of range, and used an automatic watering system for easy battery maintenance.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The nickel-iron pack consisted of 30 Eagle-Pitcher 6 V 200 Ah batteries in six pods under the floor and delivered over {{convert|60|mi|km}} of range. The TEVan owner's manual stated {{convert|80|mi|km}} of range.  The TEVan's on-board charger was a PFC Martin-Marietta and accepted 120 V AC@20 A or 40 A, 240 V AC@20 A or 40 A, and as high as 220 V AC@40 A three-phase inputs.

The TEVan had an 8.8&amp;nbsp;kW three-stage ceramic [[electric heater]]. The 120 A DC/DC converter provided all the 12 V power, there was no auxiliary (12 V) battery. [[Dashboard#Dashboard items|Gauges]] included motor temperature and SOC (state of charge, akin to "Fuel Level") using the stock instruments. It was also equipped with electric [[air conditioning]] (R-134a), regenerative braking, power brakes using a Delco electric vacuum pump, [[power steering]], [[Radio|AM/FM Stereo]], and [[airbag]]s. The original equipment tires were LRR, (Low Rolling Resistance), Goodyear P205/75R15 Momentum at 50 PSI.

As a successor, Chrysler would produce the 1997-1999 EPIC (Electric Powered Interurban Commuter Vehicle), based upon the third-generation minivans.

The '''RS-platform Chrysler minivans''' are a series of passenger [[minivan]]s marketed by [[Chrysler]] from model years 2001 to 2007, the fourth in six generations of [[Chrysler minivans]], which were heavily revised versions of the [[Chrysler minivans (NS)|NS minivans]]. Depending on the market, these vans were known as the '''Dodge Caravan''', '''Chrysler Town &amp; Country''' and the '''Chrysler Voyager'''. With the discontinuation of the [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] brand, the [[Plymouth Voyager]] didn't return.

==Overview==
In development from February 1996 to December 1999, the Generation IV minivans were based on the [[Chrysler S platform|Chrysler RS platform]] and featured a larger body frame with modified headlights and taillights. Design work by Brandon Faurote was approved in January 1997 and reached production approval in October 1997. Unveiled at the 2000 [[North American International Auto Show]] (NAIAS) on Monday, January 10, 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DdJIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PoIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3634,6863785&amp;dq=2001+dodge+caravan&amp;hl=en |title=DaimlerChrysler Debuts minivans |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the RS minivans were released for sale in August 2000. The release was part of a promotional tie-in with [[Nabisco]], which unveiled their new "[[Oreo|Mini Oreos]]" inside the van during the unveiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-28159731_ITM |title=Article: New Mini Oreos Debut in New Mini Van |publisher=AccessMyLibrary |date=August 10, 2000 |accessdate=September 26, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530062823/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-28159731_ITM |archivedate=May 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first vans rolled off the line at the [[Windsor Assembly]] Plant on July 24.

[[File:Chrysler_Voyager_front_20090206.jpg|thumb|left|European market Chrysler Voyager]]
The RS minivans were sold as the Dodge Caravan, Chrysler Voyager and Chrysler Town &amp; Country, in 4 door body styles. The Caravan was available in a long wheelbase model, called the Grand Caravan, while the Chrysler Voyager was a short wheelbase model with base levels of equipment and the Town &amp; Country was only available with a long wheelbase and was the highest end model. The U.S. and Canadian market Chrysler Voyager was originally intended to be a Plymouth, but became a Chrysler with the discontinuation of the Plymouth brand in 2000. This model was also exported, while the Town &amp; Country was exported as a high-level model of the Voyager. Export models had the platform designation RG.

Trim levels for the Caravan and Town &amp; Country were carried over from the previous generation, while the Voyager was only offered in a base model.&lt;ref name="consumerguideauto.com"&gt;[http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2001-to-2004-chrysler-town-country.htm "2001-2004 Chrysler Town &amp; Country"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020134650/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2001-to-2004-chrysler-town-country.htm |date=October 20, 2010 }}, retrieved on 2011–08–22.&lt;/ref&gt; The Caravan was available in Base, SE, Sport and ES trims, and the Town &amp; Country was available in LX, LXi and Limited. In addition to other detailed changes, remote operated sliding doors and rear hatch, which could be opened and closed at the push of a button, either inside the vehicle, or with the keyless entry fob, became options, as well as a new tri-zone climate control system and side seat mounted airbags. In 2002, the value-packed '''eL''' and '''eX''' models were added to the Town &amp; Country. These models were both value-priced versions of the LX and LXi, respectively, with popular option packages.&lt;ref name="edmunds.com"&gt;[http://www.edmunds.com/chrysler/town-and-country/2002/?sub=minivan "2002 Chrysler Town &amp; Country"], retrieved on 2011–08–22.&lt;/ref&gt; 2004 saw the addition of an unnamed base short-wheelbase model.

In 2003, the Chrysler Voyager was discontinued in the U.S., a short wheelbase Town &amp; Country became available, and the Caravan C/V and Grand Caravan C/V returned after having been discontinued in 1995. The C/V featured the option of deleted side windows (replaced by composite panels), optional rear seats, a cargo floor made of plastic material similar to pickup truck bedliners, rubber flooring in lieu of carpeting and normal hatch at the rear. Minor changes were made to the Grand Caravan ES including many of the features included in Option Group 29S becoming standard, the 17&amp;nbsp;inch Titan Chrome wheels no longer being an option replaced with standard 16&amp;nbsp;inch chrome wheels, and the disappearance of the AutoStick Transmission option. This year also saw the appearance of an optional factory-installed rear seat DVD system with single disc player mounted below the HVAC controls, and the addition of a SXT model. 2004 offered an exclusive one year only "Anniversary Edition" package to mark Caravan's 20th year in production. This package was offered on higher level SXT models, and included chrome wheels, body color moldings, special interior accents and a unique fender badge.

The 2005 minivans received a mid-cycle refresh including revised front fascias and a mildly restyled interior. This model introduced a system of second- and third-row seating that folded completely into under-floor compartments. It was marketed as ''Stow 'N Go'' and was available exclusively on long-wheelbase models. In a development program costing $400 million,&lt;ref name="ameinfo"&gt;{{cite web|title= Chrysler extends leadership in Mideast minivan segment with 'Stow 'n Go' |publisher =Ameinfo.com |url= http://www.ameinfo.com/53687.html |date=February 12, 2005 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130325175844/http://www.ameinfo.com/53687.html |archivedate=March 25, 2013 |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; engineers initially used an [[Erector Set]] to visualize the complex interaction of the design&lt;ref name="pressrel1"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Chrysler Group Brings Minivan Segment's Only Stow 'n Go Seating And Storage System to Market in Just 18 Months |publisher=PRnewswire – Chrysler Group |url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chrysler-group-brings-minivan-segments-only-stow-n-go-seating-and-storage-system-to-market-in-just-18-months-58686772.html |date=January 5, 2004 |accessdate=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and redesigned under-floor components. The system included the spare tire well, fuel tank, exhaust system, parking brake cables, rear climate control lines, and rear suspension&lt;ref name="pressrel1"/&gt; but brought the elimination of [[Four-wheel drive|all-wheel drive]] (AWD). The system, in turn, creates a combined volume of {{convert|12|cuft|L}} of under-floor storage when second-row seats are deployed. With both rows folded, the vans have a flat-load floor and a maximum cargo volume of {{convert|160.7|cuft|L}}.&lt;ref name="ameinfo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="www.media.chrysler.com"&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://www.media.chrysler.com/newsrelease.do?&amp;id=129 |title=Stow 'N Go Seating and Storage System Solidifies Dodge Caravan as the Leader in Minivan Sales and Innovations |publisher=Chrysler Group |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stow 'n Go system received the Popular Science Magazine's "Best of What's New" for 2005 award.&lt;ref name="autointell"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stow 'n Go Minivan Technology Awarded Popular Science Magazine's "Best of What's New" for 2005 |publisher=Autointell.com |url= http://www.autointell.com/News-2004/November-2004/Nov-2004-3/Nov-17-04-p3.htm |date=November 10, 2004 |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trim levels were again reshuffled on the Town &amp; Country, being available in a short-wheelbase base model, and long-wheelbase LX, Touring and Limited models.&lt;ref&gt;[http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2005-chrysler-town-and-country.htm "2005 Chrysler Town &amp; Country"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110730005022/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2005-chrysler-town-and-country.htm |date=July 30, 2011 }}, retrieved on 2011–08–22.&lt;/ref&gt; As with the pre-refresh model, only the Touring and Limited were sold to consumers in Canada, the LX being restricted to fleets. A driver's side knee airbag was now standard on all models. The front seat-mounted side airbags of previous years were discontinued in favor of side-curtain airbags for all three rows. These were standard on Limited trim and optional on all other models, however could not be ordered with the moonroof option. Uconnect Bluetooth phone pairing was now available, as well as an overhead rail storage system with three moveable or removable compartments.

Taiwanese-market Town &amp; Country minivans were assembled between 2005 and 2007 in [[Yangmei District|Yangmei]], [[Taiwan]] under license by the [[China Motor Corporation]], starting with the 2006 model year. They were based on the RG variant Grand Voyager for global market. Taiwanese models featured minor variations for the local market including LED taillights, backup cameras and mirror-mounted turn signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://roadtest.u-car.com.tw/article/5173/%E4%B8%83%E4%BA%BA%E5%85%B1%E8%B3%9E%E5%9F%8E%E9%84%89%E4%B9%8B%E7%BE%8E%EF%BC%8DChrysler%20Town%20%20Country%E8%A9%A6%E9%A7%95%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20|title=七人共賞城鄉之美－Chrysler Town &amp; Country試駕|author=高英凱|work=U-CAR|date=June 21, 2006|accessdate=November 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, production ended and the production line was relocated to China where [[Soueast]] continued to assemble it under the [[Chrysler Grand Voyager]] and [[Dodge Grand Caravan]] nameplates from 2007 until late 2010.

Production of this generation continued in China under the Chrysler Grand Voyager and Dodge Grand Caravan nameplates from 2007, when the Taiwanese Town &amp; Country production line was relocated to [[Soueast]] (a [[joint venture]] between CMC, [[Mitsubishi Motors]] and the [[Fujian Motors Group]], until late 2010 when the facelifted fifth generation Chrysler Grand Voyager was introduced there. The Grand Caravan was replaced in this market by the [[Dodge Journey|JCUV]]. The Chinese Grand Voyager was identical to the Taiwanese Town &amp; Country, while the Grand Caravan was not based on the RS Grand Caravan sold in the United States and Canada. Instead, it was a modified version of the Grand Voyager with a new grille, incandescent taillights instead of the Grand Voyager's LED units, fender-mounted turn signals instead of mirror-mounted units, and wheels from the RS Grand Caravan. Chinese models were equipped with [[Mitsubishi 6G7x engine|Mitsubishi 6G72]] engines.

===Safety===
The 2001 model of this version earned a "Poor" rating in the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]
's 40&amp;nbsp;mph offset test. It did protect its occupants reasonably well, and the dummy movement was well controlled, however, a fuel leak occurred. Chrysler corrected this problem starting with the 2002 models, moving it up to an "Acceptable" rating.

The 2006 model year brought optional side curtain airbags and a stronger B-pillar, which was tested by the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]'s side impact crash test. With the side airbags, it got an "Acceptable" rating. For the driver, there is a chance of serious neck injuries, rib fractures and/or internal organ injuries. The rear passengers, however, could leave this accident unharmed, as there is a low risk of significant injury in a crash of this severity for them.

The 4th generation Town &amp; Country (Grand Voyager, as it is known in Europe))right hand drive (RHD) version performed very poorly in the [[Euro NCAP]] car safety tests and achieved the following ratings:&lt;ref name="Euro NCAP"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.euroncap.com/tests/chrysler_voyager_2007/277.aspx |title=For safer cars &amp;#124; Chrysler Voyager |publisher=Euro NCAP |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
However, it was noted that "The LHD car performed significantly better than the RHD car in the frontal impact, scoring 9 points, giving a potential four star adult occupant rating." &lt;ref name="Euro NCAP"/&gt;
Thatcham's New Car Whiplash Ratings (NCWR) organization tested the 4th generation European Grand Voyager for its ability to protect occupants against whiplash injuries with the car achieving an 'Acceptable' rating overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thatcham.org/ncwr/index.jsp?page=147&amp;year=2008&amp;rating=All&amp;manufacturer=6&amp;model=672&amp;display=s&amp;showDisclaimer=Y&amp;showResultCount=Y |title=Safety &amp;#124; New Car Whiplash Ratings &amp;#124; Car Search &amp;#124; Thatcham MIRRC |publisher=Thatcham.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-08 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110728092658/http://www.thatcham.org/ncwr/index.jsp?page=147&amp;year=2008&amp;rating=All&amp;manufacturer=6&amp;model=672&amp;display=s&amp;showDisclaimer=Y&amp;showResultCount=Y |archivedate=July 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powertrains==
As with the previous generation, the Caravan came standard with a 2.4&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Chrysler Neon engine#2.4 and 2.4 Turbo|EDZ]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] and a 3-speed [[TorqueFlite]] automatic transmission, with optional 3.3&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.3|EGA]]'' and 3.8&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.8|EGH]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] engines, which came with a 4-speed [[Ultradrive]] automatic transmission. The 3.3L V6 was the standard engine on the Voyager and Town &amp; Country, as well as Canadian Caravans, where the 2.4L wasn't offered. Export models could be equipped with a 2.5 L Turbo Diesel ''[[List of VM Motori engines#R 425 DOHC|R 425]]''&lt;br /&gt; or a 2.8 L Turbo Diesel ''[[List of VM Motori engines#R 428 DOHC|R 428]]'' from [[VM Motori]], and were available with a 5-speed manual transmission. Chinese models got a 3.0 L ''[[Mitsubishi 6G7 engine|6G72]]''.

}}The '''third-generation [[Chrysler minivans|Chrysler minivan]]s''' are a series of passenger [[Minivan|minivans]] that were marketed by the [[Chrysler Corporation]] (later [[Daimler AG#Merger with Chrysler|DaimlerChrysler]]) from the 1996 to 2000 model years.  Designated the NS platform by Chrysler, these minivans were sold by Chrysler, Dodge and Plymouth divisions in passenger configurations; minivans were exported under the Chrysler brand.  While the second-generation AS platform was a revision of the original vans, the NS platform marked the first ground-up redesign of the Chrysler vans since their 1984 introduction, ending the use of components from [[Chrysler K platform|K-Car]] derivatives.

The first non-compact minivans{{Original research inline|date=November 2019}} in North America to adopt four sliding passenger doors, the third-generation Chrysler minivans saw its form factor adopted by many competitors.  In addition to chief competitors [[Ford Windstar]], [[Honda Odyssey (North America)|Honda Odyssey]], and [[Toyota Sienna]], the NS-platform configuration was adopted by the [[Chevrolet Venture]], [[Oldsmobile Silhouette]], and [[Pontiac Montana|Pontiac (Trans Sport) Montana]], and the [[Mercury Villager]]/[[Nissan Quest]].

In line with the first and second-generation minivans, the third-generation minivans were assembled at [[Windsor Assembly]] in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor, Ontario, Canada]], with additional production sourced from [[Saint Louis Assembly|Saint Louis (South) Assembly]] in [[Fenton, Missouri]].  To supplement exports from the United States, production of the Chrysler Voyager was sourced from [[Graz|Graz, Austria]] (in the [[Eurostar Automobilwerk|Eurostar]] joint venture factory between Chrysler and [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch]]).

== Development ==
Development of the NS platform minivans commenced in 1990; with a team lead by [[Tom Gale (designer)|Tom Gale]] and Chris Theodore, design work (by Don Renkert) was approved in September 1991 with a design freeze in May 1992.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQhTq18vi7AC&amp;pg=PA300&amp;lpg=PA300&amp;dq=chrysler+ns+may+1992+november+prototype&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Baa1wOSccR&amp;sig=AzR2pxZT2AWQuP-2jLCW3ZGN--0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9GBiUZCpAvSC2gWRk4DoBg&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=chrysler%20ns%20may%201992%20november%20prototype&amp;f=false|title=Riding the Roller Coaster: A History of the Chrysler Corporation – Google Books|date=1991-09-23|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to becoming the first all-new Chrysler minivan in a decade, the third-generation vans were also a response to the development of a front-wheel drive replacement for the [[Ford Aerostar]] (unveiled in 1994 as the 1995 Ford Windstar).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.org/NLD_docs/DHUM0006.pdf|title=Civil Action File No. 0110133833|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016062810/http://www.justice.org/NLD_docs/DHUM0006.pdf|archivedate=October 16, 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the S/AS-platform vans did not share direct structural underpinnings with the Chrysler K-Cars, in contrast to their predecessors, the NS vans were the first generation designed from the ground up as a minivan.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/96-development.html|title=1996-2000 Chrysler, Plymouth, and Dodge Minivans: the reasons behind the choices (development story)|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the first Chrysler vehicles designed with [[CATIA#Automotive|CATIA]], which allowed for much tighter design tolerances.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In its effort to design the third-generation minivans, Chrysler benchmarked the vehicle from various sources of data, using customer input, warranty data, and research based on various other minivans (the Ford Aerostar, Mercury Villager, and Toyota Previa)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  During its market research, Chrysler sought owner feedback on adding a $300 driver-side sliding door option from minivan owners, with 85% of participants answering that they would buy the van with the second sliding door, even as an extra-cost option.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Ironically, the feature was planned for the first-generation minivans, but was removed in 1980 due to concerns over additional tooling costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/history.html|title=Creating the Plymouth, Dodge, and Chrysler Minivan: The Caravan/Voyager Development Story|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside the sliding door, several designs underwent consideration for the floor layout.  Initially, a lower floor height was considered (research feedback felt that the step-in height was too high), but was rejected as it jeopardized the higher driving position sought by buyers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  For production, a compromise design was approved, retaining the same floor height as the previous generation eased into lower door sills.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In addition to preserving the higher driving position, the floor design allowed the fitment of all-wheel drive without major modification, larger wheels and tires, CNG tanks, and batteries for electric vehicles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

While the V6 powertrains of the previous-generation platform were retained, during the development of the NS platform, several configurations underwent configuration.  To improve the body structure, a mid-engine powertrain (in line with the [[Toyota Previa]]) was initially considered, but was rejected for cost and complexity considerations.  A transition to a longitudinal-mounted powertrain (to simplify V6 engine access and all-wheel drive configuration) underwent strong consideration; the transverse layout was chosen in order to reduce overall length.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In an extensive shift from the boxy design of the first two generations, the body adopted [[Cab forward|cab-forward design]], shifting the dashboard and windshield forward.  In contrast to the controversial styling of the GM APV minivans, the roof was moved upward (nearly 3 inches) and the cowl moved lower&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, allowing for a less radical windshield angle.  To move the base of the windshield back several inches (to further improve visibility), Chrysler designed the windshield wiper module/lower windshield cowl to be removable (allowing for improved engine bay access).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In total, the development of the NS platform would cost Chrysler Corporation $2.8 billion dollars (approximately $4.6 billion in 2017 dollars&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://westegg.com/inflation/infl.cgi|title=The Inflation Calculator|website=westegg.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the most costly vehicle ever developed by Chrysler at the time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Model overview ==

=== Chassis ===
The third-generation Chrysler minivans use the Chrysler NS platform designation.  Using a completely new unibody chassis, the NS platform uses a 113.3 inch wheelbase for standard-wheelbase vans (1.3 inches longer) and a 119.3 inch wheelbase for long-wheelbase vans (same as 1994-1995 AS-platform vans).  Front-wheel drive is the standard drivetrain configuration with all-wheel drive offered as an option.

The suspension of the NS platform is a modified version of the previous two generations.  In front, the use of [[MacPherson struts]] continued, with leaf springs and a beam axle in the rear.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/96-development.html|title=1996-2000 Chrysler, Plymouth, and Dodge Minivans: the reasons behind the choices (development story)|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During its development, a number of suspension configurations were considered, including a 4-wheel double wishbone layout.  Rear leaf springs were retained largely in an effort to provide an ideal handling balance with a load in addition to maximize interior load space.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

In a major modification, the front track width was widened three inches, allowing for lower mounting of the engine and transaxle, reduction in turning radius, and a lower cowl height.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

Front-wheel drive vans had front-wheel disc brakes and rear drum brakes.  From 1997, all-wheel drive vans were fitted with four-wheel disc brakes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/overview.html|title=1996-2000 Chrysler, Plymouth, and Dodge Minivans: Caravan, Voyager, Town &amp; Country|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Powertrains====
For 1996, the Chrysler minivans received the first new four-cylinder engine in the powertrain line since 1987, with the introduction of a 2.4L engine (shared with the JA-platform cars).  While smaller in displacement than its 2.5L predecessor, the 150hp engine nearly matched the 3.0L V6 in both output and fuel economy.

In states that did not observe [[California emission standards]], the Mitsubishi 3.0L V6 was the standard V6 option.  In those that followed California emissions standards, the Chrysler 3.3L V6 was the standard V6 option.  In the Dodge Caravan ES and Chrysler Town &amp; Country LXi, the 3.8L V6 was standard.

In 1999, the 3.8L V6 became optional on the Plymouth Voyager Expresso; in Canada, the 2.4L engine was dropped, with the 3.0L V6 becoming the standard engine.

In the United States and Canada, a manual transmission was no longer available, with a 3-speed [[TorqueFlite]] automatic fitted to the 2.4L and 3.0L engines.  The 3.3L and 3.8L engines were fitted with a 4-speed  [[Ultradrive]] automatic.

For the first time, export vehicles were fitted with different powertrains, with the standard engine being a SOHC 2.0L engine with an optional  DOHC 2.0L engine (from the Neon); a VM Motori 2.5L inline-4 was offered, becoming the first diesel Chrysler minivan.  All three engines were offered with either a 5-speed manual or an automatic transmission.  In addition to the four-cylinder engines, export vehicles were offered the 3.3L and 3.8L V6 engines offered in American-market minivans.  AWD models were not sold in the [[United Kingdom]].

=== Body ===
In an extensive shift from the second-generation minivans, the NS-platform minivans abandoned the boxy body design of the previous two Chrysler minivan generations.  While (on average) three inches taller than their predecessors, the new design lowered the exterior coefficient of drag from 0.39 to 0.35&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/overview.html|title=1996-2000 Chrysler, Plymouth, and Dodge Minivans: Caravan, Voyager, Town &amp; Country|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; (matching the Ford Windstar, bested only by the GM APV minivans).   In the redesign, no body panels were carried over, with all three brands adopting new model badging.

A central feature of the redesign (later becoming a standard feature on some trim levels) was the driver-side sliding door.  While first used on compact minivans, including the [[Nissan Stanza Wagon]] and [[Nissan Axxess]], the NS-platform minivans were the first mid-size minivans to adapt the feature.  Though again using a 3-track mounting system for the sliding doors, the system was redesigned to consume less interior space; the exterior door track was hidden below the side windows.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;  In addition to its styling, the function of the liftgate was changed for the first time, with an exterior handle available for the first time, eliminating the pop-and-lift maneuver of the two previous generations (adapted from the K-car station wagon).  The exterior door handles were redesigned, switching from a flip-up design to a pull-out design.

Alongside the exterior, major changes were made to the interior of the NS-platform minivans.  Again offered with 7 passenger seating, the latching system for the 2nd and 3rd row seats was redesigned; in a single motion, owners could release 2nd and 3rd-row bench seats by floor latch, raising them onto rollers to move them out of the vehicle (the lighter 2nd-row bucket seats did not have them).&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;  For the first time, the seatbacks of front bucket seats folded forward.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;  The mounting positions for the third-row seat were moved inboard, matching the second row, eliminating a separate set of seat mounts on the floor.

While styled far differently from its 1995 predecessor, the dashboard of the NS-platform minivans adopted a similar layout to the second-generation minivans.  For the first time since 1988, each Chrysler minivan shared the same steering wheel (among the only Chrysler Pentastars visible to the driver).  While the glovebox was enlarged, the underseat storage drawer made its return as an option, complemented by a second locking storage compartment mounted to the side of the passenger seat.  As a first for minivans, the NS minivans introduced dual-zone climate control (as an option) and adjustable cupholders.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

=== Safety ===
The 1996–2000 Dodge Grand Caravan received a "Marginal" rating in the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]'s 40&amp;nbsp;mph offset test.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} The structural performance and restraints were graded "Acceptable", but the foot injuries were very high.

In the NHTSA crash tests, it received 4 stars for the driver and front passenger in the frontal-impact. In the side-impact test, it received 5 stars for the driver, and 3 stars for the rear occupant, and resulted in a fuel leak that could cause a fire hazard.

According to EuroNCAP crash test results, the 1999 model Chrysler Voyager did so badly in the frontal impact that it earned no points,&lt;ref name="euroncap.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroncap.com/tests/chrysler_voyager_1999/56.aspx|title=Chrysler Voyager 1999|work=euroncap.com|accessdate=2015-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the worst of the group.{{Cn|date=September 2018}} The body structure became unstable and the steering column was driven back into the driver's chest and head'. The 2007 model Chrysler Voyager fared little better, achieving just 19% in the frontal impact test, with an overall score of 2 stars out of a possible 5.&lt;ref name="www.euroncap.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroncap.com/tests/chrysler_voyager_2007/277.aspx|title=Chrysler Voyager 2007|work=www.euroncap.com|accessdate=2015-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, chest compression measurements on the test dummy 'indicated an unacceptably high risk of serious or fatal injury. As a result, the final star in the adult occupant rating is struck-through'.

Despite the bad results in the EuroNCAP crash tests, statistics from the real world indicate that this is not the whole picture. [[Folksam]] is a Swedish insurance company that in May 2009 published a report on injuries and survivability of 172 car models.  The 88–96 generation got a real world rating of "Average", and the 96-00 generation got a rating called "Safest" (at least 30% safer than the average car.){{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

== Marketing variations ==
Introduced in March 1995 for the 1996 model year&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQhTq18vi7AC&amp;pg=PA300&amp;lpg=PA300&amp;dq=chrysler+ns+may+1992+november+prototype&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Baa1wOSccR&amp;sig=AzR2pxZT2AWQuP-2jLCW3ZGN--0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9GBiUZCpAvSC2gWRk4DoBg&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=chrysler%20ns%20may%201992%20november%20prototype&amp;f=false|title=Riding the Roller Coaster: A History of the Chrysler Corporation – Google Books|date=1991-09-23|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the third-generation Chrysler minivans were marketed by the Chrysler, Dodge, and Plymouth divisions, with the return of the [[Plymouth Voyager]], [[Dodge Caravan]], and [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]].  In a change from the previous two generations, to better distinguish its three divisions, the Plymouth Voyager was marketed as an entry-level minivan, with the Dodge Caravan slotted between the Voyager and the Chrysler Town &amp; Country.    

As before, the Voyager and Caravan were produced in standard and extended-length (Grand) configurations, with the Town &amp; Country introducing a standard-length configuration for the first time.  For the first time, all Chrysler minivans were passenger vans, as the Dodge Caravan C/V cargo van was discontinued.    
[[File:2000 Chrysler Town &amp; Country Limited.png|thumb|2000 Chrysler Town &amp; Country Limited]]

=== Chrysler Town &amp; Country ===
Again positioned as the flagship of the Chrysler minivans, the third-generation Chrysler Town &amp; Country underwent an extensive revision of its model range.  For the first time, a short-wheelbase body was offered, along with multiple trim levels.  As part of the redesign, the model line saw its long-running simulated woodgrain trim (dating to 1965) deleted in favor of body color moldings with chrome exterior trim.  In another change, the Chrysler crystal Pentastar hood ornament was replaced by a medallion-style Chrysler grille badge.

Replacing the LE-trim Voyager/Grand Voyager (in the United States), the base trim was LX (short-wheelbase, SX for 1997-1999) with LXi serving as the top-level trim.  In 1997, the driver-side sliding door became standard on the Town &amp; Country (1996 examples produced without one are very rare).

For 1998, the Town &amp; Country underwent a mid-cycle revision to further differentiate it from its Dodge and Plymouth counterparts, centered around the introduction of a redesigned grille (introducing a "winged" Chrysler badge) and an updated interior.  Above the LXi, the Town &amp; Country Limited made its debut.  For 2000, the short-wheelbase body was discontinued, ending the SX trim.  [[File:2001 Chrysler Grand Voyager LE Automatic 3.3.jpg|thumb|2001 Chrysler Grand Voyager LE (RHD)]]

=== Chrysler Voyager (export) ===
Outside the United States and Canada, Chrysler exported the third-generation minivans to a number of global markets under the Chrysler (Grand) Voyager nameplate.  Using the body and interior of the Dodge Caravan, the Voyager was produced by Saint Louis Assembly in Fenton, Missouri and by Eurostar in Graz, Austria. Despite being discontinued for most markets, a commercial version continued to be offered in the Netherlands under the Dodge Ram Van nameplate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/autohistorian/31839325642 |title=1996 Dodge Ram Van |date=December 30, 2016 |first=Alden |last=Jewell |accessdate=December 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time, the Voyager was produced in right-hand drive, allowing wide sales in Australia and the United Kingdom.  Sharing its V6 engines with its domestic counterpart, the Voyager was also offered with a 2.0L inline-4 (from the Neon, in place of the 2.4L engine), and a 2.5L diesel inline-4.  Along with automatic transmissions, a 5-speed manual transmission was offered (the only third-generation Chrysler minivan produced with a manual transmission).

In some markets (including Brazil and South Korea), Chrysler minivans were offered under the Chrysler Caravan nameplate, using Dodge Caravan bodyshells.[[File:Dodge-Caravan.jpg|thumb|1996 Dodge Caravan (no driver-side sliding door)]]

=== Dodge Caravan ===
In a break from its predecessors, the third-generation Dodge Caravan was marketed distinctly from the Plymouth Voyager, becoming the mid-range model of the Chrysler minivan product line.  The Caravan C/V cargo van was discontinued, with all examples serving as passenger vans.  In place of the Pentastar, Chrysler adopted the Dodge "Ram" hood emblem; the Caravan is the only NS minivan with a hood-mounted emblem.  

As with its predecessor, the Caravan and Grand Caravan used base, SE, LE, and ES trims.  Base and SE/LE trims were fitted with gray bumpers with gray moldings; ES trims (and Sport-package versions) featured body-colored trim.  7-passenger seating was standard, regardless of body length.  For 1999, the driver-side sliding door became offered as an option on all versions of the Caravan.    

For 1999, the Dodge Caravan ES was equipped with an [[Autostick#Chrysler%20Autostick|Autostick gear selector]] for its automatic transmission, a first for a minivan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/first.html|title=Chrysler minivan firsts|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the Caravan is designed with a column-mounted automatic transmission shifter, Autostick is operated via a momentary switch on the gear selector.  [[File:Plymouth Grand Voyager.jpg|thumb|Plymouth Grand Voyager SE]]

=== Plymouth Voyager ===
In a shift from previous minivans, the third-generation Voyager was marketed as the entry-level Chrysler minivan rather than as a direct counterpart of the Dodge Caravan.  While sharing the same bodyshell, the Voyager and Caravan saw significant changes in body trim and feature content.  Distinguished by a dark gray eggcrate grille (a body-color grille became an option in 1998), the Voyager used matte gray bumpers across all trim levels with matte gray side moldings (fog lights were not available as an option).   Before calendar 1996, the NS Voyager was produced with the Pentastar, shifting to the "sailboat" Plymouth grille emblem afterward.  

The Voyager retained the base, SE, and LE trims from its predecessor.  To reduce model overlap, the LE trim was discontinued in the United States (in favor of an expanded Town &amp; Country range).  To allow the Plymouth brand to remain competitive, the Rallye option package was introduced on the SE trim&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure "1996 Plymouth Voyager/Grand Voyager"&lt;/ref&gt;; along with exterior badging, the Rallye offered interior content featured in LE-trim Voyagers and Caravans.  For 1998, the Rallye trim was renamed Expresso.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure "1998 Plymouth Voyager"&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2000, as Chrysler withdrew the Plymouth brand, the Voyager was marketed by both Chrysler and Plymouth.  

== Alternative-fuel vehicles ==
In 1999, Dodge introduced the Caravan EPIC, a fully electric minivan. The EPIC was powered by 28 12-volt NiMH batteries and was capable of traveling up to {{convert|80|mi|km}} on a single charge. The EPIC was sold as a fleet-only lease vehicle. Production of the EPIC was discontinued in 2001. Only a few hundred of these vehicles were produced and sold. After the leases expired they were returned and crushed. Approximately 10 vans remain in private hands today.

== Concept vehicles ==
&lt;p&gt;In 1999, coinciding with the 15th anniversary of Chrysler minivan production, Chrysler unveiled three concept minivans, largely intended to further advance the divisional styling and design of each vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Chrysler Pacifica ===
&lt;p&gt;The [[Chrysler Pacifica (1999 concept vehicle)|Chrysler Pacifica]], derived from the Chrysler Town &amp; Country, was given an exterior and interior restyling.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allcarindex.com/auto-car-model/United-States-Chrysler-Pacifica-Concept-1/|title=Chrysler - Pacifica Concept [1]|website=ACI|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to a full-size conversion van, the Pacifica was given a raised roof for increased headroom, with a full-length skylight. In a 2+2+2 seating layout, the Pacifica was fitted with power-operated middle-row seats (with power-operated footrests).&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  The exterior adapted design elements of the flagship [[Chrysler LHS]] sedan, including a (smaller) version of its grille and modified versions of its headlamps.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2004 to 2008, the Chrysler Pacifica nameplate saw use on a production vehicle, as a CUV derived from the Grand Caravan/Town &amp; Country.  For 2017, the Pacifica nameplate was again revived, used on the current generation of Chrysler-division minivans.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Dodge Caravan R/T ===
&lt;p&gt;As a follow-up to the 1996 Dodge Caravan ESS&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motortrend.com/news/dodge-caravan-ess/|title=Motor Trend {{!}} Car Reviews {{!}} DODGE CARAVAN ESS - FIRST TEST}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the 1999 Dodge Caravan R/T replaced the 3.8L V6 with the 3.5L V6 of the Chrysler 300M, increasing output to 253 hp, paired with the 4-speed AutoStick transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motortrend.com/news/dodge-caravan-2/|title=Motor Trend {{!}} News {{!}} DODGE CARAVAN - DODGE'S CORNER-CARVING CARAVAN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dodge Caravan adapted several styling elements from the Dodge Viper RT/10, including hoodscoops (carried directly over from the Viper), and a redesigned lower fascia that shifted the Dodge "crosshair" grille into the lower bumper (with the addition of foglamps from the Viper).  The interior featured a performance-oriented theme, with brushed aluminum trim for the trim and door panels, with black leather seats and racing-style pedals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2011 to 2016, Dodge produced the Grand Caravan R/T as an trim variant, though the option was largely cosmetic.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Plymouth Voyager XG ===
&lt;p&gt;Derived from the Plymouth Voyager, the Plymouth Voyager XG was a four-seat minivan geared towards active lifestyles of younger drivers.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carstyling.ru/en/car/1999_plymouth_voyager_xg/|title=1999 Plymouth Voyager XG - Concepts|last=Site-Mechanics|website=www.carstyling.ru|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Externally similar to the standard Voyager, the XG was distinguished by its 17-inch wheels (shared with the Plymouth Prowler), and body-color bumpers and grille.  The interior was given a full-length retractable fabric sunroof, with a large removable storage pod placed behind the seats.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Voyager XG featured the powertrain of the export-market Chrysler Voyager, with a 2.5L diesel engine and a 5-speed manual transmission.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

== Awards ==
&lt;p&gt;The new minivans earned unanimous critical acclaim: the Dodge Caravan was the 1996 [[Motor Trend Car of the Year]] (the first and only minivan to ever win the award), the 1996 [[North American Car of the Year]], and the vans were on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 1996 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120724084058/http://www.caranddriver.sg/features/archive/1996_10best_cars-10best_cars "1996 10Best Cars"], retrieved on 2010–08–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caranddriver.sg/features/archive/1997_10best_cars-10best_cars "1997 10Best Cars"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120730194234/http://www.caranddriver.sg/features/archive/1997_10best_cars-10best_cars|date=July 30, 2012}}, retrieved on 2010–08–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The '''RT-platform Chrysler minivans''' are a series of passenger [[minivan]]s marketed by [[Chrysler]] starting in model year 2008, the fifth in six generations of [[Chrysler minivans]]. Depending on the market, these vans were known as the '''Dodge Grand Caravan''', '''Chrysler Town &amp; Country''', '''Chrysler Grand Voyager''', '''Lancia Voyager''' and the '''Volkswagen Routan''', a modified version sold by [[Volkswagen]] in North America. Only long wheelbase models were offered with the [[Dodge Journey]] replacing the short wheelbase model. While most versions were discontinued in 2016 with the launch of the [[Chrysler Pacifica (RU)|Chrysler Pacifica minivan]], the Grand Caravan remained in production.

==Overview==
Chrysler debuted the 2008 model year minivans at the 2007 [[Detroit Auto Show]] &amp;mdash; eliminating the short-wheelbase model. With discontinuation of the short-wheelbase minivans, Dodge offered the [[Dodge Journey|Journey]] on nearly an identical wheelbase and as a [[crossover (automobile)|crossover]] rather than a [[minivan]]. Although the SWB model, which had accounted for half of all sales in Canada,&lt;ref name="CAdriver"&gt;{{cite web|title=Test Drive: 2008 Dodge Grand Caravan Canada "Value Package" |publisher=Autos Canada |first=Jil |last=McIntosh |date=February 25, 2008 |url= http://www.autos.ca/car-test-drives/test-drive-2008-dodge-grand-caravan-canada-value-package/ |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; cost approximately $2,000 less and offered a four-cylinder engine option with improved fuel economy, Chrysler executives stated the SWB Caravan was discontinued to accommodate new features offered in the Grand Caravan, consistent with the demands of the majority of the minivan market.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news|title = Minivan sales slow, hit by gas prices and image |publisher = USAtoday |first=Dee-Ann |last=Durbin |url= https://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2008-06-06-2536673535_x.htm |date=June 6, 2008 |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:'08 Chrysler Town And Country.jpg|thumb|left|2008 Chrysler Town &amp; Country]]

The RT minivans were a completely new design, sharing few components with the previous model. They abandoned the rounded styling introduced on the [[Chrysler minivans (NS)|NS vans]], instead using a more boxy look styled by [[Ralph Gilles]]. New features included standard electronic stability control, the MyGIG entertainment system (a stereo with built in hard drive for recording, storing, and playing music), second and third row video screens, powered second row windows, standard side curtain airbags, and dashboard-mounted transmission controls. Much like its competitors, the [[Toyota Sienna]] and [[Honda Odyssey (North America)|Honda Odyssey]], the Town &amp; Country now featured power windows on the sliding doors and moved the gear shift from the steering column to the center console, in a higher position. Another new feature of this generation was an available rear overhead console which featured LED map lights as well as halo ambient lighting. A new DVD system was also available, which featured dual screens for the rear passengers. SIRIUS Backseat TV was also offered, which featured three channels of children's programming. The ''Stow 'n Go'' seats, carried over from the previous generation, were standard, with a new seating system marketed as ''Swivel 'n Go'' optional on higher end models. In this seating system, two full size second row [[Swivel seat|seats swivel]] to face the third row. A detachable table can be placed between the second and third row seats. The Swivel 'n Go seating system includes the 3rd row seating from the Stow 'n Go system, but not the second row, which must be manually removed from the vehicle. This model was exported as the Dodge Grand Caravan and Chrysler Town &amp; Country to the Philippines, Chrysler Town &amp; Country to Central and South America, and Chrysler Grand Voyager to all other markets.

The '''Volkswagen Routan''' is a seven-seat [[badge engineering|rebadged]] variant of the RT minivans with revised styling, content features and suspension tuning.&lt;ref name="ablog"&gt;{{cite web|title = Chicago 2008: Volkswagen unveils the newish Routan minivan |publisher=Autoblog.com |first=Jeremy |last=Korzeniewski |date=6 February 2008 |url= http://www.autoblog.com/2008/02/06/chicago-2008-volkswagen-unveils-the-newish-routan-minivan |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=2009 Volkswagen Routan |journal=Motor Trend |first=Bob |last=Nagy |url= http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/minivans-vans/112_0811_2009_volkswagen_routan_first_drive/index.html |date=November 2008 |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 Volkswagen Routan - A price-conscious decision over the less practical Touareg |first=Shaun |last=Bailey |date=7 February 2008 |publisher=Road and Track |url= http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-shows/2008-chicago-auto-show/2009-volkswagen-routan?click=main_sr |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufactured alongside the Chrysler and Dodge minivans at [[Windsor Assembly]] and marketed in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, the Routan debuted at the 2008 [[Chicago Auto Show]] and went on sale in the United States in September 2008.&lt;ref name="vwmedia1"/&gt; The Routan's minivan variants include the [[Dodge Caravan]], Ram C/V, [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]], and [[Chrysler Grand Voyager]] (export)—that by 2009 have ranked as the 13th [[List of bestselling vehicle nameplates|bestselling automotive nameplate]] worldwide, with over 12 million sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/m/assembly-plant.php |title=25th Anniversary of the Chrysler Minivan at the Windsor Assembly Plant |year=2009 |first=Daniel |last=Stern |publisher=allparcom |accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Routan marked the start of [[Volkswagen]]'s business strategy to offer additional vehicles specially developed for the U.S. market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.volkswagenag.com/content/vwcorp/info_center/en/publications/2009/03/GB_2008.-bin.acq/qual-BinaryStorageItem.Single.File/Y_2008_e.pdf |title=2008 Annual Report |page=182 |publisher=Volkswagen AG |accessdate=2 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110170744/http://www.volkswagenag.com/content/vwcorp/info_center/en/publications/2009/03/GB_2008.-bin.acq/qual-BinaryStorageItem.Single.File/Y_2008_e.pdf |archive-date=November 10, 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the 2008 model year minivan resulted from a partnership that began in 2005 between Volkswagen and [[DaimlerChrysler]]. Prior to the agreement, Volkswagen had no minivan model for the United States or Canadian markets. The Routan is sold only in North America (U.S., Canada, Mexico).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QUA123NvjZcC&amp;pg=PA285&amp;dq=Routan+Mexico |pages=284–285 |title=Developing International Strategies: Going and Being International for Medium-sized Companies |first=Rudolf |last=Grünig |first2=Dirk |last2=Morschett |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2012 |isbn=9783642247248 |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The automaker's intent with outsourcing production the Routan to Chrysler was to avoid the significant expense of developing its own family-sized minivan.&lt;ref name="HealyUSA"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/09/23/vw-routan-suv-crossblue/2856593/ |title=VW axes Routan van, mulls 7-passenger SUV replacement |first=James R. |last=Healey |newspaper=USA Today |date=23 September 2013 |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; VW announced in an early 2008 projection that the company intended for the Routan and other models to help achieve significant expansion of U.S. sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VW Plans to Triple U.S. Vehicle Sales |publisher=Car &amp; Driver |date=September 2007 |url= http://www.caranddriver.com/news/car_news/vw_plans_to_triple_u_s_vehicle_sales_car_news |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Routan was Volkswagen's first van offered in North America since discontinuation of the [[Volkswagen Transporter (T4)|Volkswagen Eurovan]] in 2003, and is not related to the European-market [[Volkswagen Touran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vander Doelen |first=Chris |title=VW's Routan to roll off Windsor Assembly |newspaper=Windsor Star |date=22 January 2008 |url=http://www.canada.com/windsorstar/news/business/story.html?id=c728f842-dbdf-4a17-a637-88c7b33b8610 |accessdate=2 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182818/http://www.canada.com/windsorstar/news/business/story.html?id=c728f842-dbdf-4a17-a637-88c7b33b8610 |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Routan features a rebranded version of Chrysler's hard drive-based audio and navigation system—marketed by Chrysler as the MyGig system and by Volkswagen as the Joybox, but has neither Chrysler's [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country#Stow'n Go seating|Stow'n Go]] nor [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country#Swivel 'n Go|Swivel'n Go]] seating systems.  Instead, the second row seats in the Routan  feature the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country#Easy-Out Roller Seats|Easy Out Roller Seat system]], but can be modified using Chrysler or Dodge parts to have Stow'n Go or have Swivel'n Go seats installed. Routans as of 2010 offer optional Wi-Fi access, which was also offered in Dodge and Chrysler versions as UConnect Web.

[[Volkswagen Group of America|VW of America]] had projected for the Routan to gain at least five percent of the U.S. minivan market,&lt;ref name="stldispatch"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chrysler-built Routan has VW look |newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch |first=Christopher |last=Boyce |date=7 February 2008 |url= http://business.highbeam.com/435553/article-1G1-174361244/minivan-vw-can-call-its-own-routan-being-built-chrysler |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160310003057/https://business.highbeam.com/435553/article-1G1-174361244/minivan-vw-can-call-its-own-routan-being-built-chrysler |url-status= dead |archive-date= 10 March 2016 |publisher=Highbeam |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 45,000 units of the 700,000 minivans sold currently. In January 2009, VW of America asked Chrysler Canada to stop production of the Routan for the month of February after 29,000 Routans had been shipped to US dealerships. By July 2009, 11,677 units had been sold.&lt;ref name="ablogjan09"&gt;{{cite web|title=Routan Bust? VW asks Chrysler to stop building minivans for February |publisher=Autoblog.com |first=Chris |last=Paukert |date=30 January 2009 |url= http://www.autoblog.com/2009/01/30/routan-bust-vw-asks-chrysler-to-stop-building-minivans-for-febr/ |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Volkswagen halted production of the Routan at Chrysler's Windsor, Ontario, plant, despite having a production contract that ran through 2014. In January 2013, Volkswagen announced there would be no 2013 retail model, but held open the possibility that development may resume with a potential 2014 model. The 2013 Routan was reserved for fleet purchasers, and 2,500 were produced by Chrysler during the calendar year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://media.chrysler.com/newsrelease.do?&amp;searchresult=&amp;id=15234&amp;mid= |title=Chrysler Group LLC December 2013 Production Data |date=17 January 2014 |publisher=Chrysler Group LLC |accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Automotive industry analysts were not surprised by VW's decision to drop the Routan because buyers had no reason for selecting the Routan over the similar Dodge Grand Caravan or the Chrysler Town &amp; Country, and the Routan's base price of nearly $28,000 was far more than the basic $21,000 Grand Caravan, while the Routan's list of equipment was less than included on the upscale Town &amp; Country.&lt;ref name="autotrader"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.autotrader.com/research/article/car-news/206373/2013-vw-routan-canceled.jsp |title=2013 VW Routan Canceled |publisher=autotrader |accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chrysler minivans underwent a mid-cycle refresh for the 2011 model year, which included major changes in both styling and functionality. Changes included restyled exterior and interior with all-new wing logo, standard SafetyTec (including Blind Spot Monitoring and Rear Cross Path Detection), improvement to the Stow n Go seating and storage system, a one-touch fold down feature for easier access to the third row, (The Swivel n' Go seats were dropped) a new super center console and technology, a dual DVD system that can play different media at the same time, SIRIUS Backseat TV which offers three channels of childrens programming, FLO TV featuring 20 channels of live programming, Pentastar V6 (283&amp;nbsp;hp) engine replacing previous 3.8-liter and 3.3-liter V-6 engines, six-speed automatic transmission, a new fuel economizer mode, a new instrument panel and instrument cluster, new Chrysler Brand steering wheel with integrated controls that allow the driver to operate the radio, cruise control, hands-free phone and other vehicle functions while keeping their hands on the wheel; upgraded cloth and leather seating materials; new soft touch door trim, new heating and cooling control system. The suspension was heavily re-tuned, with both Dodge and Chrysler minivans gaining a larger front sway bar and new rear sway bar, increased rear roll center height, adjusted spring rates, a new steering gear, a revised front static camber setting, and lowered ride height. This dramatically improved handling in both the Chrysler and Dodge. Other changes included extra sound insulation, acoustic glass, new seats, softer-touch surfaces, new [[LED]] ambient lighting and center console, and halogen projector headlamps with LED accents. The Chrysler models were adjusted so that instead of competing against equivalent Dodge trim levels, they were above Dodge in trim and features.

All three of the former engine choices were replaced by the new [[Chrysler Pentastar engine|Pentastar]] 3.6-liter V6 with six-speed automatic transmission, now the sole powertrain choice for all models. Interior trim was restyled on both vans, in addition to major exterior revisions highlighted by the new "double-crosshair" grille on the Grand Caravan and a new chrome grille for the Town &amp; Country.

Chrysler Voyagers sold in continental Europe was rebranded as the [[Lancia]] Voyager. The Chrysler-branded variant continued to be sold in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Russia, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore, and China, as Lancia does not have sales operations in those markets.

The Ram Cargo Tradesman, or Ram C/V Tradesman, debuted for the 2012 model year, replacing the Dodge Grand Caravan C/V. It is based on the Dodge Grand Caravan, but with solid metal instead of rear windows and a flat load space with {{convert|144.4|cuft|L}} of interior storage, and a {{convert|1800|lb|abbr=on}}. cargo payload plus a towing capability of up to {{convert|3600|lb|abbr=on}}. The Ram C/V is offered with a 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 engine and 6-speed automatic transmission.&lt;ref name="test2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://carscoop.blogspot.com/2011/03/new-ram-cargo-van-is-2012-dodge-caravan.html |title=New Ram Cargo Van is a 2012 Dodge Caravan for the Pro |publisher=Carscoop |date=March 8, 2011 |accessdate=May 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222214420/http://carscoop.blogspot.com/2011/03/new-ram-cargo-van-is-2012-dodge-caravan.html |archive-date=December 22, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The C/V Tradesman was discontinued after the 2015 model year in favor of the [[Fiat Doblò#Ram ProMaster City|ProMaster City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ram C/V Tradesman Official Site|url=http://www.ramtrucks.com/en/ram_cv/|publisher=Ram Trucks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety===
In the U.S. the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]'s (NHTSA) New Car Assessment Program crash testing, the 2010 Dodge Grand Caravan achieved a five star (top safety) rating in several categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safercar.gov/portal/site/safercar/ |title=2010 Chrysler minivan US NCAP safety ratings |work=NHTSA www.Safercar.gov |accessdate=June 23, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522231124/http://www.safercar.gov/portal/site/safercar/ |archivedate=May 22, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Powertrains===
The 2.4&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Chrysler Neon engine#2.4 and 2.4 Turbo|EDZ]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] was dropped, with the 3.3&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.3|EGA]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] standard. The 3.8&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.8|EGH]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] engine was optional on mid level models, with a [[Chrysler SOHC V6 engine|4.0L SOHC V6]] engine optional as the top level engine. A 2.8 L ''[[List of VM Motori engines#R 428 DOHC|RA428]]'' I4 diesel was available on export models, while the 3.3L wasn't offered in Europe. The 3.3L got a 4 speed [[Ultradrive]] [[automatic transmission]], while all the other engines came with a new 6 speed [[Ultradrive#62TE|62TE]] automatic transmission. In 2011, the 3.3L, 3.8L and 4.0L engines were all dropped, replaced with the ''[[Chrysler Pentastar engine|Pentastar]]'' 3.6 L V6, which came with the 62TE transmission.

Automotive news reported that, from January to October in 2010, Dodge sold about a third of its 2010 Grand Caravans to rental fleets. The number of returned ex-rental 2010 Grand Caravan to the market jumped fourfold between July to October, depressing prices of used 2009 and 2010 Dodge minivans by as much as 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20101115/RETAIL04/311159986/1251 |title=High fleet sales rates take toll |publisher=Automotive News |date=November 15, 2010 |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future of the Dodge Grand Caravan ==

With the all-new 2017 [[Chrysler Pacifica]] introduced to replace the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]], the [[Dodge Grand Caravan]] was due to be discontinued after the 2016 [[model year]]. However, it was later announced that the [[Grand Caravan]] would be sold alongside the [[Chrysler Pacifica]] unchanged from the 2016 model, with a simplified model lineup.

At the 2018 [[North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], [[Fiat]] CEO [[Sergio Marchionne]] said there may be a successor to the current [[Dodge Grand Caravan]], which would be based on the [[Chrysler Pacifica]], saying that the [[Grand Caravan]] successor would be "a Caravan-like vehicle".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.allpar.com/news/2018/01/future-of-the-caravan-sergio-semi-confirms-the-rumors-39345&lt;/ref&gt;

Marchionne is quoted as saying, "The replacement of the [[Dodge Caravan|Caravan]] will be a [[Dodge Caravan|Caravan]]-like vehicle. I need another minivan. It's going to be in line with the Pacifica architecture".

[[Dodge]] has announced that the Grand Caravan will be discontinued in May 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dodge Grand Caravan Production Coming to an End|publisher=Car and Driver|first=Colin|last=Beresford|date=February 28, 2020|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a31156055/dodge-grand-caravan-end-production/|accessdate=February 28, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its replacement will be the [[Chrysler Voyager]], which is an entry-level version of the [[Chrysler Pacifica]] minivan, and will offer similar pricing and features to its Grand Caravan predecessor. For its final [[model year]], the Grand Caravan will be offered in three trim levels: base '''SE''', midlevel '''SE Plus''', and range-topping '''SXT'''. The previous '''GT''' trim, a fleet-exclusive model, has been dropped for the 2020 [[model year]]. For 2020, the midlevel '''SE Plus''' receives standard "Super Stow-'n'-Go" second-row bucket seats and in-floor storage bin, a standard eight-way power front driver's seat, a black interior with "Cranberry Wine" stitching, and an available '''Blacktop Package'''. The base '''SE''' trim no longer offers aluminum-alloy wheels as an option. A compact spare tire and wheel is now optional equipment on all trim levels. &lt;ref&gt;https://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=21001&amp;mid=58&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dodge Viper''' was a [[sports car]] manufactured by [[Dodge]] ([[Street &amp; Racing Technology|SRT]] for 2013 and 2014), a division of American car manufacturer [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles|FCA US LLC]] from 1991 through 2017, having taken a brief hiatus in 2007 and from 2010&amp;ndash;2013. Production of the two-seat sports car began at [[Mack Avenue Engine Complex|New Mack Assembly Plant]] in 1991 and moved to [[Conner Avenue Assembly|Conner Avenue Assembly Plant]] in October 1995.

Although [[Chrysler]] considered ending production because of serious financial problems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blogs.insideline.com/straightline/2010/06/mercedes-benz-sls-started-out-as-the-next-generation-dodge-viper.html |title=Mercedes-Benz SLS Started Out as the Next-Generation Dodge Viper |first=Ed |last=Hellwig |date=June 16, 2010 |publisher=insideline |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110916014339/http://blogs.insideline.com/straightline/2010/06/mercedes-benz-sls-started-out-as-the-next-generation-dodge-viper.html |archivedate=September 16, 2011 |accessdate=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blogs.insideline.com/straightline/2010/07/dodge-viper-production-ends.html |title=Dodge Viper Production Ends |first=Dan |last=Emunds |date=July 1, 2010 |publisher=insideline |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111009032931/http://blogs.insideline.com/straightline/2010/07/dodge-viper-production-ends.html |archivedate=October 9, 2011 |accessdate=January 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; on September 14, 2010, the then chief executive [[Sergio Marchionne]] announced and previewed a new model of the Viper for 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baudette |first=Neal E.|title=To Counter Slump, Chrysler Plans New-Model Barrage|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=September 15, 2010|last2=Bennett |first2=Jeff|page=B3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Viper was named number 10 on the "Most American Cars" list, meaning 75% or more of its parts are manufactured in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everythingdodge.com/blog/viper-makes-the-most-american-list |title=Viper makes the "Most American Cars" list |date=September 7, 2014 |publisher=everything dodge.com |access-date =January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development history==
The Viper was initially conceived in late 1988 at Chrysler's Advanced Design Studios. The following February, Chrysler president [[Bob Lutz (businessman)|Bob Lutz]] suggested to [[Tom Gale (designer)|Tom Gale]] at Chrysler Design Center that the company should consider producing a modern [[AC Cobra|Cobra]], and a [[Clay modeling|clay model]] was presented to Lutz a few months later. Produced in [[sheet metal]] by Metalcrafters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theautochannel.com/vehicles/coll/sci/112metal.html |title=The American Carrozzeria |first=Michael |last=Lamm |publisher=The Auto Channel |accessdate=May 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the car appeared as a [[concept car|concept]] at the [[North American International Auto Show]] in 1989. Public reaction was so enthusiastic that chief engineer Roy Sjoberg was directed to develop it as a standard [[production vehicle]].

Sjoberg selected 85 engineers to be "Team Viper", with development beginning in March 1989. The team asked the then-Chrysler subsidiary [[Lamborghini]] to cast a prototype aluminum block for the sports car to use in May. The production body was completed in fall 1989, with a [[chassis]] prototype running in December. Though a [[V8 engine]] was first used in the [[Development mule|test mule]], the V10 engine, which the production car was meant to use, was ready in February 1990. Official approval from Chrysler chairman [[Lee Iacocca]] came in May 1990. One year later, [[Carroll Shelby]] piloted a [[pre-production car]] as the [[Safety car|pace vehicle]] in the [[Indianapolis 500]] race. In November 1991, the car was released to reviewers with the first [[retail]] shipments beginning in January 1992.

The first prototype was tested in January 1989. It debuted in 1991 with two [[Pre-production car|pre-production models]] as the [[Safety car|pace car]] for the [[Indianapolis 500]] when Dodge was forced to substitute it in place of the Japanese-built [[Dodge Stealth]] because of complaints from the [[United Auto Workers]], and went on sale in January 1992 as the ''RT/10 [[Roadster (automobile)|Roadster]]''.

[[Lamborghini]] (then owned by [[Chrysler|Chrysler Corporation]]) helped with the design of the [[V10 engine]] for the Viper, which was based on the [[Chrysler LA engine|Chrysler's LA]] [[V8 engine]]. A major contributor to the Viper since the beginning was Dick Winkles, the chief power engineer, who had spent time in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2dRqgSuHAjgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA296#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Car: The Definitive Visual History of the Automobile|date=2011|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780756689384|page=296|language=en|accessdate=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally engineered to be a performance car, the Viper contained no exterior-mounted door handles or key cylinders and no [[air conditioning]] (however, this was added as an option in later models, and [[climate control]]s featured a "snowflake" icon, which indicated a potential setting for the A/C). The roof was made from [[canvas]], and the windows were made from vinyl and used zippers to open and close, much like the [[Jeep Wrangler (YJ)|Jeep Wrangler]]. However, the Viper was still equipped with some domestic features, including manually-adjustable sport leather-trimmed [[bucket seat]]s with lumbar support, an [[Vehicle audio|AM-FM stereo cassette player]] with clock and [[high fidelity]] sound system, and interior carpeting. Aluminium [[alloy wheels]] were larger in diameter due to the larger [[brake]]s. A lightweight [[fiberglass]] [[Hardtop|hard roof]] option on later models was also available to cover the canvas soft roof, and was shipped with each new car. There were also no [[airbags]], in the interest of weight reduction. Adjustable performance [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] was also an available option for most Vipers.

=== {{anchor|second}} Second generation (SR II, 1996–2002) ===
{{Main|Dodge Viper (SR II)}}
[[File:Pair of Vipers - Flickr - Supermac1961.jpg|thumb|Dodge Viper GTS, which was introduced as a new model for the second generation of the Viper]]
Although the 1996 [[model year]] is the beginning of the second generation, in the Viper community, the 1996 model of the RT/10 is sometimes referred to as "Generation 1.5" since it saw the carryover of many first-generation parts during the model year while transitioning to second-generation parts. The [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]] relocated the exposed side [[exhaust pipe]]s to a single [[muffler]] at the rear exiting via two large central [[tailpipe]]s during the middle of the model year, which reduced back pressure, and therefore increased the power to {{convert|415|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. [[Torque]] would also increase by {{convert|23|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|488|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. A removable [[hardtop]] was now available along with a sliding glass window. Some steel [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] components were replaced by aluminum, resulting in a {{convert|60|lb|abbr=on}} weight reduction.&lt;ref name="edmunds.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/dodge/viper/history.html|title=Dodge Viper History|work=Edmunds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the 1996 model year, Dodge introduced the Viper GTS, a new [[coupé]] version of the Viper RT/10. Dubbed the “double bubble”, the roof featured slightly raised sections that looked like bubbles to accommodate the usage of helmets and taking design cues from the [[Shelby Daytona]] designed by [[Pete Brock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shelby-dodge.com/viper.html |title=Viper |publisher=Shelby-dodge.com |date= |accessdate=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 90% of the GTS was new in comparison to the RT/10 despite similar looks. The GTS would come with the same {{convert|7990|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} [[Viper engine|V10]] but power would be increased to {{convert|450|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 5,200 rpm and {{convert|490|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 3,700 rpm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1996 GTS would be the first Viper to be equipped with [[airbag]]s and also included [[air conditioning]], [[power window]]s and [[power door locks]] as standard equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/viphist.htm|title=The Original Dodge Viper: 1992-2002 including RT/10 and GTS|work=allpar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Viper GTS would be chosen as the [[pace car]] for the [[1996 Indianapolis 500]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theviperstore.com/Information_Viper_Gen2_1997-2002_page_3.htm|title=Dodge Viper RT-10 and GTS, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 Generation 2 Information &amp; Statistics|work=theviperstore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minor updates would continue in 1997 and 1998. In 1997, the RT/10 would receive a power increase to 450&amp;nbsp;hp along with air-bags and power windows. In 1998, both of the versions of the Viper were equipped with second-generation air bags, revised [[exhaust manifold]]s (saving {{convert|24|lb|0|abbr=on}} over the previous cast iron components) along with a revised [[camshaft]].

In 1998, the GT2 Commemorative Edition was released. With the FIA GT2 Team and Driver series wins in October 1997, Team Viper set forth with the creation of a unique Viper called the GT2 Commemorative Edition. There would be 100 offered through the top Dodge Viper dealers.

The team started working on the concept in November 1997 with design concept approve in January 1998, prototype parts in February 1998, pricing approval of $85,200 in April 1998, and production from June 16 to July 7, 1998. The vehicles were the first to be built in VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) sequential order with the first having 001 as its last three on the VIN and the last being 100.

The GT2 exterior is best known for its white with blue stripes paint, large rear wing, front dive planes and splitter, side sills, American flag, BBS rims, and GTS-R badging. Its this badging that causes many to refer to the vehicle as the GTS-R. However, the GTS-R was the race version of the Viper and not street legal.

The GT2 interior is best known for the blue accent trim, Oreca 5-point racing harness, and the center dash plaque with the vehicles unique production number.

The GT2 power increased by 10 horsepower to 460 HP with the use of K&amp;N air filter and smooth tubes connecting the filter to the intake manifold. Torque increased by 10 to 500 foot pounds.

Of the 100 number vehicles, number 100 was keep by the Chrysler museum until it was later sold into private ownership. Number 051 was given to Oreca Team drive Olivier Beretta. However, due to Monaco's import regulations, Olivier was unable to take delivery. The vehicle was later sold at Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale's auction and is in private hands. Number 052 was given to Oreca Team driver Justin Bell. He kept the vehicle for several years before being sold into private hands.

The GT2 is regarded as the pinnacle of the Gen II (Generation Two) GTS Viper coupe collectability.

Any reference to the GT2 being built to meet any homologation effort are inaccurate.

In 1999, ACR performance package was released.  With the increase of Viper owner's "tracking" their vehicles, Team Viper created a track ready version of the GTS.

The ACR used the same K&amp;N air filter and smooth tubes from the GT2 for the power gains along with the BBS rims.  A new 5-point harness with the ACR logo was installed for both the driver and passenger.  For 1999, Koni adjustable shocks were installed and changed to Dynamics later in the 2000 model year.  Lastly, the spring rates were increased.  The vehicle could be painted in solid color or with stripes with the color choices changing yearly.  The ACR came standard with air conditioning and radio deleted, but could be added back in as a $10,000 option.  A small amount were produced yearly that were AC and radio delete.

In 2000, the Dodge Viper was updated to lighter [[hypereutectic]] [[piston]]s and received factory frame improvements. While the hypereutectic pistons provided less expansion, the [[forged]] pistons were preferred by customers for the [[supercharged]] and [[turbocharged]] aftermarket packages. TSB ([[Technical Service Bulletin]]) recalls (998 and 999) were done at local dealerships to repair the 1996 to 1999 Viper frames by adding gussets with rivets near the steering box. 2001 saw the addition of [[Anti-lock braking system]].

2002 would be the final year of the second generation of the Viper. Dodge would build 360 “Final Edition” cars (326 coupés and 34 ACR editions)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2010/04/06/dodge-slithers-out-new-2010-viper-final-edition/|title=Dodge slithers out new 2010 Viper Final Edition models|author=Jeremy Korzeniewski|work=Autoblog}}&lt;/ref&gt; to commemorate the final year. These models are painted red with white [[Racing stripe|stripes]], paying tribute to the famous race-winning [[Oreca]] cars. The RT/10 was replaced by the SRT-10 roadster in 2003, and the GTS was replaced in 2006 by the SRT-10 coupé.

Colors would vary throughout the second generation. Dodge would offer three or four colors per model year. Some colors such as steel gray were only offered for one model year (MY2000) while other colors such as red were offered during the entire second generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theviperstore.com/Viper_Paint_Codes.htm|title=Dodge Viper Paint Codes and factory Colors information|work=theviperstore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Interior colors and wheel options would also vary throughout the second generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dodgeviperhistoricalsociety.com/build_info.htm|title=Dodge Viper Historical Society, Build Info|work=dodgeviperhistoricalsociety.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cobalt blue colour of the Dodge Viper GTS seen in the [[Viper (TV series)]] was exclusively available to the series.

Stripes would be an option beginning in 1996. The GTS stripes were larger, fuller stripes than the stripes offered on the 96 RT/10. The GTS had twin stripes (8 inches wide with a 4-inch gap in between) that ran from the front bumper all the way through the rear bumper. 1996 was the only model year in which the stripes would run through the rear [[license plate]] area. Stripes on later models would run from front to rear but did not run through the rear license plate area.

The Dodge Viper underwent a major redesign in 2002, courtesy of DaimlerChrysler's [[Street and Racing Technology]] group, taking cues from the Dodge Viper GTS-R concept presented in 2000. The new Viper SRT-10, which replaced both the GTS and the RT/10, was heavily restyled with sharp, angled bodywork. The engine's displacement was increased to {{convert|8285|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}, which, with other upgrades, increased the maximum power output to {{convert|500|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,600 rpm and {{convert|525|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,200 rpm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2003-dodge-viper-srt-10-first-drive-review|title=2003 Dodge Viper SRT-10|date=May 2002|first=Barry|last=Winfield|publisher=[[Car &amp; Driver]]|access-date=September 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the power increase, the engine weight was reduced to about {{convert|500|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. The chassis was also improved, becoming more rigid and weighing approximately {{convert|80|lb|kg|abbr=on}} less than the previous model. An even lighter and stronger chassis was planned, but was abandoned because of cost. The initial model introduced was a convertible. In 2004, Dodge introduced a limited-edition Mamba package; Mamba-edition cars featured black interiors, with red stitching and trim, price increased by about $3,000. 200 cars with the Mamba package  were produced.

The Viper SRT-10 Coupé was introduced at the 2005 [[Detroit Auto Show]] as a 2006 model. It shares many of its body panels with the convertible, but borrows its side and rear styling from the Competition Coupé concept. The coupé looks much like the previous Viper GTS and retains the "double-bubble" roof shape of the original along with the original GTS' tail lights, as well as offering the original GTS Blue with white stripes paint scheme on the initial run of First Edition cars like the original Viper coupé. The engine is [[Horsepower#Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE]]-certified to produce a maximum power output of {{convert|510|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,600 rpm and {{convert|535|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,200 rpm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/viper/2006/2006-dodge-viper-srt10-coupe/|title=ROAD TEST: 2006 DODGE VIPER SRT10 COUPE|date=January 3, 2006|first=Matt|last=Stone|publisher=MotorTrend|access-date=September 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the original coupé, the chassis was not modified.

No cars were produced for the 2007 model year; instead, Chrysler extended production of the 2006 model while preparing the updated 2008 model.

In 2008, with the introduction of the {{cvt|8382|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} [[V10 engine]], the power output was raised to {{convert|600 or 608|PS|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6,100 rpm and {{convert|560|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 5,000 rpm. The engine also received better flowing heads with larger valves, Mechadyne cam-in-cam [[variable valve timing]] on the exhaust cam lobes, and dual electronic [[Throttle#Throttle body|throttle bodies]].&lt;ref name="viper505"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.automobilemag.com/am/2006/dodge/viper/specifications.html |title=2006 Dodge Viper Specifications |accessdate=September 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="viper510"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dodge.com/bridge/vehsuite.html?app=vehiclespecs&amp;family=viper&amp;model=Technical&amp;zipcode=10101&amp;year=2008 |title=Dodge Specs &amp; Upgrades [2008 Viper] |accessdate=May 2, 2008 |publisher=Chrysler}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rev limit could be increased by 300&amp;nbsp;rpm due to the improved [[valvetrain]] stability from both the new [[camshaft]] profiles and [[Poppet valve#Operation|valve-springs]]. The engine was developed with some external assistance from [[McLaren Automotive]] and [[Ricardo Consulting Engineers]]. [[Electronic control unit|Electronic engine control]] was developed by [[Continental AG]]; the controller can monitor the [[crankshaft]] and [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] position up to six times during each firing and has 10 times more processing power than the previous unit.

Changes outside of the engine were less extreme, but a distinction between the third and fourth generation of the Viper is the vented engine cover. The [[Borg-Warner T-56 transmission|Tremec T56 transmission]] was replaced with a new [[Tremec TR-6060 transmission|Tremec TR6060]] with triple first-gear [[Synchronizer (automotive)|synchronizers]] and doubles for higher gears. The [[Dana 44|Dana M44-4]] [[rear axle]] from the 2003–2006 model now had a [[GKN]] ViscoLok speed-sensing [[limited-slip differential]] that greatly helps the tires in getting grip under [[acceleration]]. Another performance upgrade was the removal of [[run-flat tire]]s; the new [[Michelin]] Pilot Sport 2 tires increased grip and driver feedback and, along with revised [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] (springs, [[anti-roll bar]]s, and shock valving), made the Viper more neutral in cornering.

{{Citation needed span|The modifications made to the 2008 [[model year]] car were enough for [[Chrysler]] to make it distinct from the first SRT-10, and the 2008 model became known as Gen IV,|date=February 2009}} just in time for release with [[Chevrolet]]'s {{convert|638|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Corvette ZR1]]. Another notable change was the reworked [[exhaust system]]; previous third-generation cars had their exhaust crossover under the seats which resulted in a large amount of heat going into the cockpit, which was done initially to help improve the car's exhaust note, since the first two generations of the Viper, which had no crossover, were criticized for their lackluster exhaust notes. The car now featured a new exhaust system with no crossover, reducing the heat that entered the cockpit.

The electrical system was completely revised for 2008. Changes included a 180-amp [[Alternator (automotive)|alternator]], twin electric [[cooling fan]]s, electronic [[throttle]]s, and completely new VENOM [[engine management system]]. CAN bus architecture had been combined with pre-existing systems to allow for regulatory compliance. The fuel system was upgraded to include a higher-capacity [[fuel pump]] and filtration system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= First Look: 2008 Dodge Viper Coupe and Convertible |url= http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/exotic/112_0702_2008_dodge_viper/engine.html |publisher=Motor Trend |accessdate=June 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Viper ACR made a return for the ZB II generation and was put through its paces at the [[Nürburgring]] clocking in a record time of 7:22.1. Kuno Wittmer piloted a street legal 2010 Dodge Viper ACR to a record lap of 1:59.995 at [[Miller Motorsports Park]] in [[Tooele, Utah]], on Monday, April 11, breaking the 2-minute mark for the first time in a production car on the 3.048-mile Outer Course configuration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.topspeed.com/cars/dodge/2008-2010-dodge-viper-srt10-acr-ar46976.html|title=2008 - 2010 Dodge Viper SRT10 ACR Review at Top Speed|work=Top Speed|access-date=May 7, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 4, 2009, Dodge Brand President and CEO [[Ralph Gilles]] had announced that the Viper would end production in the summer of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.autotropolis.com/auto-industry-news/dodge-car-brand-ceo-confirms-end-of-dodge-viper-production.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720062559/http://www.autotropolis.com/auto-news/dodge-car-brand-ceo-confirms-end-of-dodge-viper-production.html | archivedate=July 20, 2011 | title=Dodge Car Brand CEO Confirms End of Viper Production | last=Ross |first=Jeffrey N. | publisher=Autotropolis.com | date=November 4, 2009 | accessdate=November 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There would be no 2011 model year Viper produced. Quotes from the Detroit News from SRT CEO Ralph Gilles that hint to the future of the brand included:
* "The new Viper is not based on anything else."
* "The Viper cabin is very rearward and the hood is very long. Few cars in the industry are designed with those proportions anymore."
* "I want the new Viper to be a more forgiving car to drive and accessible to more people. We've never had stability control on a high-performance car, which is about to happen on the new car."

The Viper was also on display for one night only in Salt Lake City, UT at the 11th Viper Owners Invitational or VOI 11 from {{Start date|2010|09|30}} to {{Start date|2010|10|03}}. Ralph Gilles was present, gathering feedback from the owners themselves on new, exterior design of the snake. The Generation-5 badge was unveiled as well at this event on each dining table in the hall.

In Autumn of 2011, Ralph Gilles announced that the next generation of the Viper would debut at the [[New York Auto Show#2012|New York Auto Show]] in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viperclub.org/news/news.php?displayType=article&amp;articleID=34 |title=Viper Club of America: 2013 SRT Viper Debut Set |accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preliminary specifications include the following:

* All-aluminum {{convert|8382|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} V10 engine producing {{convert|640|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 6,150 rpm and {{convert|600|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,950 rpm.
* Tremec TR6060 six-speed manual transmission with final drive ratio 3.55, 50 percent improvement in torsional stiffness over previous model.
* Electronic stability control, traction control, 4-channel anti-lock brake system (ABS), carbon fiber and aluminum skin with 0.364 drag coefficient (Cd), Pirelli P Zero Z-rated tires, 4-piston Brembo brakes with fixed-aluminum calipers with vented 355x32mm diameter rotors*
* 20&amp;nbsp;mm lower seating position, 7-inch full-color customizable instrument cluster, Uconnect RA3 or RA4 Access in-vehicle connectivity system with optional SiriusXM Travel Link and a Harman Kardon audio system.
* Bi-xenon projector headlamps with white light-emitting diode (LED) daytime running lamps and LED turn signals, LED taillamps with integrating stop-and-turn illumination and snakeskin texture lens.
* A maximum speed of 208&amp;nbsp;mph (332&amp;nbsp;km/h) and a 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph acceleration time of 3.50 seconds.

The only notable change for the 2014 model year was the addition of a third traction control mode for improved rain performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ireson |first=Nelson |url=http://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/dodge_viper_2014 |title=2014 Dodge Viper SRT Review, Ratings, Specs, Prices, and Photos |publisher=The Car Connection |date=August 8, 2014 |accessdate=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sales of the Viper for 2013 and 2014 were poor. In October 2013, the Viper production was reduced by 1/3 due to low sales and growing inventory. In April 2014, production ceased for over two months due to slow sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/srt-viper-production-halted-amid-slow-sales |title=SRT Viper production halted amid slow sales |publisher=Autoweek |date=March 19, 2014 |accessdate=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dodge addressed the issue by reducing the price of unsold 2014 models by US$15,000 and announced the 2015 models would carry the new, lower price tag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torquenews.com/106/2015-dodge-viper-production-resume-booming-sales |title=2015 Dodge Viper Production to Resume on Booming Sales |publisher=Torque News |date=October 28, 2014 |accessdate=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the SRT Viper was renamed the Dodge Viper and the engine received an extra 5&amp;nbsp;hp, raising the maximum power output to {{cvt|645|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, resulting in the improvement of highway fuel economy to 20mpg.

The SRT Viper has made several video game appearances in the ''[[Forza Motorsport]]'' franchise in both the road version and the race-spec GTS-R Model, as does in the ''[[Forza Horizon (series)|Horizon]]'' titles (where only the road-going GTS is in those installments and not the GTS-R), ''[[Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2012 video game)|Need For Speed: Most Wanted]]'' (2012), [[Need for Speed Rivals|''Need for Speed: Rivals'']] in which the GTS variant is in cop form and the Time Attack (TA) being a racer as a pre-order exclusive, ''[[Need For Speed: No Limits]]'', ''[[Need for Speed (2015 video game)|Need for Speed]]'', ''[[Gran Turismo 6]]'' in both the standard GTS and the launch edition models in the game, ''[[Real Racing 3]]'', ''[[Driveclub]]'' as one of the DLC cars in the Downforce expansion pack, and ''[[Gran Turismo Sport]]'' with both the road-going GTS and the GT3-R.&lt;ref name="Mike Connor"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Connor |url=http://www.motortrend.com/news/the-dodge-viper-is-being-axed-because-it-cant-fit-curtain-airbags/?sm_id=social_aumomotortrendhub_MotorTrend_20160116_57322616&amp;adbid=688284564255473665&amp;adbpl=tw&amp;adbpr=25383000 |title=Dodge Viper Axed Because it Can't Fit Curtain Airbags |publisher=Motortrend.com |date=January 13, 2016 |accessdate=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== European market ==
The first generation, phase II SRT Vipers were exported to Europe, where they were sold as Chryslers.

The second generation, phase I ZB Viper was being sold in Europe during 2005–2006, the first model to be sold as a Dodge, as part of Chrysler's new sales strategy for the European market. In the United Kingdom it is referred to as a '''Viper''', but was sold as the '''Dodge SRT-10''', as the Viper name is a registered trademark in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evo.co.uk/carreviews/evocarreviews/52255/dodge_srt10.html |title=Dodge SRT-10 Car Reviews |publisher=evo |date=November 24, 2004 |accessdate=September 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prodrive]] currently handles the importation and modification of Vipers to meet European laws.

=== Road packages ===
==== Viper ACR ====
'''SR II:'''
[[File:Dodge Viper GTS (9402840088).jpg|thumb|right|The ACR was an optional Package available to the 1999 Viper GTS]]
The American Club Racing (ACR) variant was first introduced as a package on the 1999 Viper GTS (Phase SR II).

The package included suspension enhancements and lightweight components focused on maximizing performance in road racing and autocross environments. Weight was reduced by over {{convert|50|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} achieved by stripping the interior of its luxuries and removing other non-essential items such as the fog lamps (replacing them with brake ducts). The new stiffer, adjustable suspension removed another {{convert|14|lb| kg|0|abbr=on}}. The package also included an "ACR" badge and 20-spoke [[BBS Kraftfahrzeugtechnik|BBS]] wheels. Power output was increased to {{cvt|460|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,200 rpm and {{cvt|500|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 3,700 rpm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1999/685355/dodge_viper_gts_acr.html|website=automobile-catalog.com|title=1999 Dodge Viper GTS ACR|accessdate=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ZB II:''' 
[[File:09 Dodge Viper ACR (6171256180).jpg|thumb|right|Dodge Viper ACR (Phase ZB II)]]
[[File:Viper ACR Engine.jpg|thumb|The 8.4-liter V10 engine of the Viper ACR (Phase ZB II)]]
[[File:Viper ACR.jpg|thumb|right|Front view of the Viper ACR (Phase ZB II) with bonnet open]]
The ACR made a come back to the Viper line-up after the 2008 model year. Its upgrades were more drastic than the original, including street-legal racing tires (Michelin Pilot Sport Cups which Michelin describes as "Ultra-High Performance Sport tires"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michelinman.com/tire-selector/category/ultra-high-performance-sport/pilot-sport-cup/tire-details|title=Pilot Sport Cup|last=|first=|year=2014|website=|publisher=Michelin|accessdate=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; two-piece brake rotors, adjustable suspension, and significant aerodynamic enhancements that included a front splitter, canards and a carbon fiber adjustable rear wing. The engine received no modifications, so power and torque remain at {{cvt|600|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{cvt|560|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} as in the standard SRT-10. The ACR is street-legal, and is similar to the MOPAR Viper that Dodge displayed at various auto shows. Weight was also decreased by {{convert|40|lb|kg|abbr=on}} by using the "Hardcore Package", that deletes the A/C, radio, speakers, amplifier, trunk carpet, hood pad and tire-inflator. Its aerodynamic upgrades produce up to 1,000 pounds (4.45 [[kilonewton|kN]]) of downforce at {{convert|150|mph|0|abbr=on}}, or roughly 10 times the downforce the standard Viper SRT-10 can produce at the same speed. The interior was upgraded only by the addition of a beacon-tripped lap timer (Hardcore Edition Only).

The Viper ACR was built alongside the standard SRT-10 at the Conner Avenue plant in Detroit. The aerodynamic components were produced by Plasan Carbon Composites and assembled to the vehicle by Prefix Corporation located in Rochester Hills, Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prefix.com/Announcements/|title=04/28/2008 – Prefix Delivers First Viper ACR|publisher=Prefix|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080801083751/http://www.prefix.com/Announcements|archivedate=August 1, 2008|accessdate=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 14, 2011, on the [[Nürburgring|Nürburgring Nordschleife]], a 2010 Dodge Viper SRT10 ACR completed the sixth fastest production, street-legal car lap ever recorded with a 7:12.13 elapsed time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Dodge Viper SRT10 ACR Reclaims Production Car Lap Record at Nurburgring With 7:12.13|date=September 27, 2011|publisher=PRNewswire|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dodge-viper-srt10-acr-reclaims-production-car-lap-record-at-nurburgring-with-71213-130633168.html|author=Chrysler Group LLC|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysler's press release claimed a new production car lap record, although [[List of Nürburgring Nordschleife lap times#Production, street-legal vehicles|three faster laps]] had been recorded more than two years earlier, albeit by very specialized low production vehicles.

'''VX I:'''
[[File:2016 Dodge SRT Viper ACR.jpg|thumb|2016 Dodge Viper ACR (Phase VX I)]]
At SEMA 2014, Dodge presented a Viper ACR concept car based on the new VX I platform. After many rumors and speculations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everythingdodge.com/blog/viper-acr-returning-for-2016|title= Viper ACR will be returning for 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the car was eventually introduced in 2015 for the 2016 model year. The base price of the 2016 ACR was US$121,395 in the United States and CA$159,995 in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2016-dodge-viper-acr-official-photos-and-info-news|title=2016 Dodge Viper ACR Has More Wing, More Adjustability than You Can Rattle a Snake At - Official Photos and Info|access-date=April 4, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 Dodge Viper ACR came installed with an all-new aerodynamic body kit made from carbon fiber, that included a new front splitter and a fixed carbon fiber rear wing, altogether producing a total of {{convert|680.5|kg|lbs|0|abbr=on}} of downforce at corners. The {{convert|8382|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} [[Viper engine|Viper V10 engine]] generated the same power output {{convert|645|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 6,200 rpm and {{convert|600|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 5,000 rpm as in all other Viper trims. The brakes were from [[Brembo]], with discs and calipers built specifically for the car. The discs were now [[carbon ceramic]], a first for the Viper series. The braking system contains {{convert|391|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} discs with 6-piston calipers up front, and {{convert|360|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} discs with 4-piston calipers down the rear. The tires were from [[Kumho Tire|Kumho]], using a set of tires called the Kumho Ecsta V720 ACR, a variant of the V720 specifically built for the ACR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tirerack.com/tires/BigPic.jsp?tireMake=Kumho&amp;tireModel=Ecsta+V720+ACR&amp;sidewall=Blackwall|title=SuperView of the Kumho Ecsta V720 ACR|website=www.tirerack.com|language=en|access-date=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front tires are P295/25R19Z, slightly smaller than the regular Viper, and P355/30R19Z at the rear. Suspension system is manufactured by [[ThyssenKrupp|Bilstein]], which has 10 settings for rebound and compression tuning for the dampers.

The options for the car are very diverse, like all 
of the other Viper trims. One example is the ACR Extreme Aero Package, which was the same package used to help the car break a total of 14 track lap records.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fastestlaps.com/articles/dodge-viper-acr-goes-ham-on-13-tracks-spanks-porsche-918|title=Dodge Viper ACR goes "HAM" on 14 tracks, "spanks" Porsche 918 - FastestLaps.com|website=fastestlaps.com|language=en-US|access-date=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The package included the addition of a removable extended front splitter extension, a new adjustable dual-element rear wing, four dive planes, six removable diffuser strakes, removable brake ducts, and removable hood louvers, and if removed, will reveal a hood gap. This helped the car produce an extra {{convert|227|kg|lbs|0|abbr=on}} of downforce at corners, for a total of {{convert|907|kg|lbs|0|abbr=on}}. With this package, the top speed was reduced at {{convert|177|mph|kph|abbr=on|0}} instead of {{convert|191|mph|kph|abbr=on|0}} because of the massive downforce produced by the car. At top speed, the car produces {{convert|799.5|kg|lbs|abbr=on|0}} of downforce, the most of any production car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbuzz.com/m/article.aspx?Id=33636|title=These Are The Things Most People Don't Know About The Hypercar Killing Dodge Viper ACR|publisher=CarBuzz|access-date=May 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, the ACR gained a 7:01.67 laptime at the Nürburgring Nordscheleife with the Extreme Aero Package, which was run by SRT, and lapped by their test driver [[Dominik Farnbacher]]. Unfortunately, the lap was unofficial according to SRT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://horsepowerkings.com/rumor-did-the-2016-viper-acr-crack-off-a-701-67-nurburgring-lap-time-back-in-october/|title=The 2016 Viper ACR cracked off a 7:01.67 Nurburgring lap time back in October|date=November 3, 2015|work=HorsepowerKings.com|access-date=April 4, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A crowdfund attempt started by volunteer Russ Oasis in 2017 on the [[GoFundMe]] funding platform began collecting funds to reclaim the lap record on the Nürburgring. Crowdfunding ended up being as high as $198,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/news/a32347/dodge-viper-nurburgring-record-gofundme/|title=Viper Owners Are Crowdfunding One Last Attempt at a Nurburgring World Record|date=January 19, 2017|work=Road &amp; Track|access-date=April 4, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gofundme.com/take-back-the-ring-record|title=GoFundMe - Take Back The Ring Record|last=|first=|date=|website=gofundme.com|language=en-US|access-date=April 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually found himself supported by 377 people, and sponsorship and assistance from [[Kumho Tire]] (tire supplier), Prefix Performance (formally known as Arrow Performance) (logistics and parts supplier), [[Viper Exchange Racing|ViperExchange]] (car loaners), and Fox Pro Films (lap filming). SRT test driver, racing driver, and former Nürburgring record holder [[Dominik Farnbacher]] returned to the track to help the group retake the record.

Despite the failure of surpassing the Huracán Performante, the team was still able to make the Viper ACR the fastest American, rear-wheel driven (with no additional assistance), and manual transmission equipped car to go around the track. Their lap time also brought the car to [[List of Nürburgring Nordschleife lap times|fifth position for street legal vehicles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/motorsports/a12159736/dodge-viper-acr-sets-7013-lap-time-in-final-nurburgring-lap/|title=Dodge Viper ACR Sets 7:01.3 Lap Time in Final Nurburgring Attempt|date=September 1, 2017|work=Road &amp; Track|access-date=September 3, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Viper GTC (Phase VX I only) ====
The GTC model was introduced in 2015, and was only featured in the VX I phase Vipers.

The 2015&amp;ndash;2017 Dodge Viper GTC had a customization program that offered 8,000 colors and 24,000 hand-painted stripes, 10 wheel choices, 16 interior trims, 6 aero options, and an undisclosed amount of standalone options to choose from. There are a total of 25 million possible build combinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drivesrt.com/2015/viper/1of1/|title=Dodge Viper GTC 1 of 1 Program {{!}} driveSRT|website=SRT|language=en|access-date=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/news/a24705/2015-dodge-viper-gtc-is-customizable-expensive/|title=Dodge Viper GTC offers 8,000 colors, 24,000 stripes|date=January 8, 2015|work=Road &amp; Track|access-date=May 14, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2015/01/08/2015-dodge-viper-gtc-1-of-1-free-customs/|title=2015 Dodge Viper GTC available in 25 million no-cost combos with 1 Of 1 bespoke program|date=January 8, 2015|publisher=Autoblog.com|author=Login|accessdate=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordering a GTC enrolled a customer in a unique VIP program called Viper Concierge, which according to Dodge, "offers an exclusive point of contact throughout the custom Viper build process." The Concierge process started with the ordering stage, which included Dodge sending customers a paint chip confirming the owner's choice. Shortly thereafter, Dodge sent buyers a 1:18-scale "speed-form" replica in their chosen custom colors, to confirm or deny the build. Once the buyer's color and option selection is locked-in, that car becomes a one-of-one Viper for that year – no other buyer would be permitted to build a Viper to the same specifications.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Viper TA (phase VX I only) ====
[[File:Yellow SRT Viper GTS at NAIAS 2013 01.jpg|thumb|SRT Viper TA at the New York International Auto Show]]
[[File:Yellow SRT Viper GTS at NAIAS 2013 02.jpg|thumb|right|Rear View]]
The '''T'''ime '''A'''ttack (TA) model was introduced in 2013 and was only been featured in the VX I phase Vipers.

The TA model had two variants, 1.0 and 2.0, each variant different from the other. The number of 2015&amp;ndash;2017 TA package 1.0 and 2.0 cars produced is unknown but the numbers are relatively low. To add to the confusion, the full TA 1.0 or 2.0 package could be added to the GTC one of one configuration. Also, besides the original run of 2014 TA 1.0 with the production number being stated as xx/33 (or xx/93 for the orange TA 1.0). The TAs built from 2015 to 2017 were numbered in sequence. For example, #11 was built in 2015 and #22 in 2016.

The 1.0 was sold by SRT and was made as a small enhancement for the Viper GTS.

Power stays the same as the standard car, {{convert|645|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|600|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}, but the top speed drops to {{convert|193|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}} because of the car's aerodynamic additions.&lt;ref name="caranddriver.com"&gt;2014 SRT Viper TA First Drive – Review – Car and Driver: [http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2014-srt-viper-ta-first-drive-review 2014 SRT Viper TA First Drive – Review – Car and Driver], accessdate: 20. tammikuuta 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The car now has the addition of the Advanced Aerodynamic Package (two-piece front corner splitters and a rear decklid spoiler made from carbon fiber), lightweight Sidewinder II wheels finished in matte-black, [[Pirelli]] P Zero Corsa tires, two-mode (Street and Race) [[ThyssenKrupp|Bilstein]] DampTronic suspension adapted from the GTS, but with firmer levels of damping and a smaller spread between modes, shock dampers, increased spring rates and thicker anti-roll bars, carbon fiber underhood X-brace (instead of the aluminium brace in all other models), carbon fiber rear tail light applique from the Exterior Carbon Fiber Accent Package, two-piece Brembo brake rotors with wider brake annulus, black-anodized [[Brembo]] brake calipers painted with the Viper logo in TA Orange, TA logos behind both front wheels and a Stryker decal instead of the standard badge on the hood (TA Orange on the Venom Black cars, black on the TA Orange and Venom White cars), black interior with TA Orange accent stitching on the ballistic cloth seats, instrument panel &amp; cowl, center stack, console, hand brake, shifter boot, and door panels. The aerodynamic package adds 200 pounds (90.72&amp;nbsp;kg) of downforce at 100&amp;nbsp;mph (160.93&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref name="caranddriver.com" /&gt; The car's mileage is 12 [[Miles per gallon|mpg]] in city, and 19 mpg on the highway.

On March 18, 2013 ''Motor Trend'' tested the SRT Viper TA in [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca]], setting the production car lap record in 1:33.62, besting the previous lap time holder [[Chevrolet Corvette C6 ZR1|Chevrolet Corvette ZR1]]'s 1:33.70.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Motor Trend Channel|title=New SRT Viper TA Strikes Back! - Ignition Episode 58|date=March 18, 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLa3l_UX77c|accessdate=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with the release of the TA 2.0, the 1.0 was still available as a package.

The TA edition returned for the 2015 model year called the TA 2.0 (but the TA 1.0 was still available up to and including the last model year, 2017). This model was sold by Dodge.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gearheads.org/dodge-decide-to-upgrade-to-the-dodge-viper-ta-2-0/|title=Dodge Decide To Upgrade To The Dodge Viper TA 2.0|date=February 27, 2015|work=GearHeads.org|access-date=May 14, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2.0 part of the moniker refers to the updated aero package, which incorporates a bigger rear wing, new front dive planes, and a new carbon-fiber front splitter. The package improves downforce to 400 pounds at 150&amp;nbsp;mph versus the 2014 Viper TA's 278 pounds at 150&amp;nbsp;mph. The internal parts have also been improved, with a much better suspension setup, new two-piece [[Brembo]] rotors, and improved shocks, dampers, springs, and stabilizer bars. The car also has an improved X-brace.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The car's power output also stays the same like the 1.0. However, the data is based on the Dodge version of the Viper, not the SRT version. Unlike the 1.0, the car is able to keep the {{convert|206|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}} top speed. The car's mileage is improved in the 2.0 version, with 13 mpg in city, and 20 mpg on the highway.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Homologation editions ===

[[File:Dodge Viper GTS -R.jpg|thumb|Chrysler Viper GT2 road car]]
In order to meet [[FIA]] [[homologation (motorsport)|homologation]] requirements, as well as to celebrate Chrysler winning the [[1997 FIA GT Championship season|1997 FIA GT2 class championship]], 100 modified Viper GT2 Championship Edition [[Street-legal vehicle|street-legal]] cars were sold.  These upgraded GTS cars were rated at 460&amp;nbsp;hp (343&amp;nbsp;kW) and 500 [[lb·ft]] (678 N·m) of [[torque]]. They had bodywork with similar appearance to the GTS-R, with the same color scheme, aerodynamics package, and visual options, in order to publicize the Viper's achievement in the [[FIA GT Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/vipacr.htm|title=special Dodge Vipers – Viper GT2 and ACR|publisher=Allpar.com|accessdate=September 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Racing editions ===

==== Viper ACR-X ====
To commemorate the end of the Phase ZB II Viper and mend the gap from the car's production end until the release of the new car, Dodge offered an improved version of the ACR specifically designed to run in the Dodge Viper Cup Series. This car, named Viper ACR-X, added to the basic ACR {{convert|40|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, a new set of downforce-enhancing front canards, long tube headers from American Racing Headers, and new materials that, along with a stripped interior, reduced weight to {{convert|3300|lb||0|abbr=on}}. It is a purpose-built race car, and is not street-legal. According to Dodge, the car beat the regular record-holding ACR around [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca]] by about three seconds (1:33.9 to 1:31). Price increased by US$12,000, to $110,000. Production was planned for the spring of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wot.motortrend.com/6584953/auto-news/dodge-reveals-viper-srt10-acr-x-turn-key-racer-hits-tracks-next-summer/index.html|title=Dodge Reveals Viper SRT10 ACR-X Turn-Key Racer; Hits Tracks Next Summer|last=Batt|first=Ron|date=December 10, 2009|accessdate=December 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 17, the Viper ACR-X's [[Nürburgring]] lap record is 7:03.058, a full 9.072 seconds faster than the regular ACR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/02/22/srts-race-only-viper-acr-x-laps-nurburgring-in-7-03-058/|title=SRT's race-only Viper ACR-X laps Nürburgring in 7:03.058|last=Phillips|first=Drew|date=February 22, 2012|accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Alfa Romeo Giulia TZ|l1=Alfa Romeo TZ3 Stradale}}
The '''[[Alfa Romeo Giulia TZ#TZ3|Alfa Romeo Zagato TZ3 Stradale]]''' is the road version of the TZ3 manufactured by [[Alfa Romeo]] and designed by [[Zagato]].

The TZ3 Stradale is the fourth model in Zagato's TZ line and serves as Zagato's tribute to the 100th anniversary of Alfa Romeo. The car itself is based on the Viper ACR-X but with a new [[carbon fiber]] body. As planned, only 9 vehicles were built. Not only is the chassis and powertrain from the ZB II Viper, but the interior remains mostly the same as well.&lt;ref name="tz3zagato"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.autoultimate.com/2218/video-dodge-viper-acr-alfa-romeos-body-zagato-tz3-stradale-2/ |title=A Dodge Viper ACR inside the Alfa Romeo's body, Zagato TZ3 Stradale |publisher=autoultimate |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507151520/http://www.autoultimate.com/2218/video-dodge-viper-acr-alfa-romeos-body-zagato-tz3-stradale-2/ |archivedate=May 7, 2011 |accessdate=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bristol Fighter ===
{{Main|Bristol Fighter (automobile)|l1=Bristol Fighter}}
The '''[[Bristol Fighter (car)|Bristol Fighter]]''' is an English sports car by [[Bristol Cars]], and is the first sports car made in 40 years after the company was revived.

The car shares many components with the Viper, including the 8.4L V10 engine, that produces {{convert|525|hp|kW PS|abbr=on|0}} in the regular trim, and {{convert|628|hp|kW PS|abbr=on|0}} in the S trim. The weight of the car is {{convert|1600|kg|lbs|abbr=on|0}}. The power is delivered to the rear wheels through a 6-speed [[manual transmission]], which is also Viper-derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/first-drives/bristol-fighter-v10-s-first-drive-review|title=Bristol Fighter V10 S first drive review|publisher=Autocar|access-date=May 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only 13 cars were ever produced from its 2004&amp;ndash;2011 production run.

=== Devon GTX ===
{{Main|Devon Motorworks|l1=Devon GTX}}
The '''[[Devon Motorworks|Devon GTX]]''' is an American sports car manufactured [[Devon Motorworks]], which was intended to enter production but was denied by [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles|Chrysler]] since it didn't reach the construction goal of US$10 million, which meant the car remained a concept.

The GTX is based almost entirely on the Viper, albeit with a few changes. The exhaust system has been changed into Devon's own stainless steel variant, along with a revised intake system, a new one-piece carbon fiber [[superstructure]], carbon fiber body panels, new cast-aluminum unequal-length front and rear suspension wishbones, new coil-over shocks, and StopTech race-inspired aftermarket brakes. The GTX was also intended to produce {{convert|650|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 6,100 rpm from the Viper-derived 8.4-liter V10 engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.motortrend.com/news/2010-devon-gtx-first-look/|title=2010 Devon GTX - First look and photos of the Devon GTX supercar - Motor Trend|date=August 24, 2009|work=Motor Trend|access-date=May 9, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prefix Viper Medusa Roadster ===
The '''Prefix Viper Medusa Roadster''' is a convertible conversion package available for the VX I generation Viper.

Prefix unveiled the Viper Medusa Roadster at a private event at their Prefix Coatings facility in Auburn Hills, Michigan on July 19, 2014. Created under their latest division named Prefix Performance, the Medusa is a conversion of the VX I Viper that was never offered as a roadster. The initial run was limited to 10 custom numbered vehicles at a price of $35,000 on top of the price of the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lingeman|first1=Jake|title=Prefix Unveils Drop-Top Viper|journal=Autoweek |date=August 4, 2014|volume=64|issue=16|page=6|issn=0192-9674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== VLF Force 1 V10 ===
{{Main|VLF Force 1}}
The '''[[VLF Force 1]]''' is a premium sports car manufactured by [[VLF Automotive]], a company formed by [[Bob Lutz (businessman)|Bob Lutz]] and Gilbert Villareal, who were later joined by [[Henrik Fisker]] as lead designer.

The Force 1 is heavily based on the Dodge Viper, using its chassis and [[Viper engine|engine]], and also has a similar design language. The car's Viper-derived V10 engine generates {{convert|745|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}. According to the company, it can accelerate from {{convert|0-60|mph|kph|abbr=on}} in a 3.0 seconds and can attain a maximum speed of {{convert|218|mph|kph|abbr=on}}.

== Concept vehicles ==
=== Viper GTS-R Concept ===
[[File:2000 Dodge Viper GTS-R Concept (31740152596).jpg|thumb|Dodge Viper Competition Coupé at the Chrysler Museum]] 
Ten years after the first Viper Concept was revealed, the 2000 GTS-R concept was shown. Osamu Shikado was responsible for the vehicle's exterior which is 3&amp;nbsp;inches lower and 2&amp;nbsp;inches wider than the production Viper at the time. Shikado used race inspired lines with an aggressive stance. Most of these design cues were adapted to the 2003 ZB I generation Viper along with the interior. These included a higher belt line, a side gill, 'bump-up' rear fender shape, and a more defined side crease. Viewed from above, the front-to-rear stripe now is tapered.

Unlike most concepts, the 2000 Viper Concept was made as a complete car. It features a complete functional interior with air conditioning, adjustable pedals, and a premium sounds system. Only one was ever made featuring a dry-sump V10 engine producing {{cvt|500|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, fifty more than the then outgoing model, and {{cvt|500|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The body is a single moulded carbon-fiber shell, with some subtle changes compared with the then outgoing model. An inch and a half has been taken out between the sill and the roof, which together with a chassis sitting two inches lower, gives the car a lower profile. Three inches have been added to the wheelbase and two inches to the track. The doors have also been lengthened, which combined with the longer wheelbase makes entry and exit from the car easier. Brakes are 14-inch ventilated discs with four-piston calipers. The front has the 19-inch wheels with P285/30 ZR Goodyear tires up and 20-inch rear wheels with P335/30 ZR tires.

=== Mopar Concept Coupé ===
[[File:Viper Mopar.JPG|right|thumb|"Mopar Concept Coupé" Viper at the 2007 [[Detroit Auto Show]]]]
A prototype 2008 [[Mopar]] Viper coupé, with {{convert|675|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, appeared at the [[North American International Auto Show#2007|2007 North American International Auto Show]], but was not planned for production. The concept appeared to have been a sneak peek at the then upcoming ZB II Viper ACR. Performance parts from this car are sold by [[Mopar]].

=== SRT-10 Carbon ===
For the 2003 [[SEMA#2003|SEMA]] show, Chrysler displayed a highly tuned Viper SRT-10 in coupé body style. The vehicle's name comes from the carbon fiber used to reduce the weight by 150&amp;nbsp;lbs bringing the total to  3,200&amp;nbsp;lbs. However, even more significant were the engine modifications, which increased power to {{cvt|625|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}; no torque or RPM figures were given. Along with the carbon fiber hardtop, a front splitter and rear wing were added; however those parts were not nearly as significant as those on the later SRT-10 ACR, and no downforce/drag information was provided to show that they were even functional. The car was only a concept.

This car was used as a test mule for the development for the Generation V SRT Viper. The car is no longer a show car, and most of its specialty parts were taken off during development for the new Generation V SRT Viper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.insideline.com/dodge/viper/2003-sema-dodge-viper-srt-10-carbon.html |title=Dodge Viper SRT-10 Carbon |first=Ron |last=Batt |date=September 15, 2009 |publisher=insideline |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101208153606/http://www.insideline.com/dodge/viper/2003-sema-dodge-viper-srt-10-carbon.html |archivedate=December 8, 2010 |accessdate=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Firepower ===
{{Main|Chrysler Firepower}}
The [[Chrysler Firepower]] was a grand touring concept based on the Viper chassis that would have been equipped with the Hemi [[V8 engine]] coupled with an [[automatic transmission]]. Price would have been slightly lower than other models.

=== Copperhead ===
{{Main|Dodge Copperhead}}
[[File:Walter P. Chrysler Museum DSC01045 (30965410903).jpg|thumb|[[Dodge Copperhead]]]]
[[File:1997 Dodge Copperhead Concept (31904299905).jpg|thumb|rear view]]
The [[Dodge Copperhead]] was a concept car based on the Viper platform that was intended as a cheaper, more agile car. It was powered by Chrysler's 2.7&amp;nbsp;L [[Chrysler LH engine|LH]] V6 engine instead of the Viper's V10, which produced {{convert|220|hp|kW PS|abbr=on|0}}. It never reached production. Dodge produced a limited-production Copperhead Edition Dodge Viper, with copper-colored paint similar to the concept car and other changes.

=== SEMA Concept ===

The SEMA concept car is a version of 2013 SRT Viper coupe demonstrating Mopar products for SRT Viper. Changes include yellow body colour, carbon fiber parts at underhood, exposed carbon fiber performance cross X-Brace trimmed in a satin finish, a decal-cut Viper "Stryker" logo in the center of X-Brace, engine cover in carbon fiber and aluminum with the SRT logo, prototype aluminum oil filler cap with the SRT logo, a carbon fiber aero package, Mopar coil springs, full black interior with yellow accents, Sabelt hard-shell seats with a six-point safety harness, seat edging in black Katzkin leather with yellow accents in the perforations, Mopar billet aluminum shift knob, billet aluminum HVAC bezels and controls, carbon fiber bulkhead satchel with a universal integrated quick-release camera mount, polished chrome door-sill guards with the Viper logo, race-inspired sand-blasted aluminum Mopar bright pedal kit with the Viper logo etched in the pedals, footrest pedal with "Stryker" logo, optional "Track Pack" wheels finished in hyperblack, a front tow hook and an LED fog lamp kit.

The vehicle was unveiled in the 2012 [[SEMA#2012|SEMA]] show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/10/12/chrysler-previews-sema-showcars/|title=Chrysler previews SEMA showcars}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chrysler-group-llc-reveals-custom-vehicles-headed-for-2012-sema-show-173885081.html|title=Chrysler Group LLC Reveals Custom Vehicles Headed for 2012 SEMA Show}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media ==

=== Viper Television Series (1994–1998) ===
{{Main|Viper (TV series)}}

Chrysler launched a TV series called [[Viper (TV series)|Viper]] in 1994 to serve as a promotional tool for the Viper. The show ran until 1998 with 1 NBC season and 3 syndicated follow-up seasons. Viper is a TV series about a special task force set up by the federal government to fight crime in the fictional city of Metro City, California that is perpetually under siege from one crime wave after another. The weapon used by this task force is a grey assault vehicle known as ''The Defender'' that masquerades as a Dodge Viper RT/10 roadster (and later, the Viper GTS coupe). The series takes place in "the near future". The primary brand of vehicles driven in the show were Chrysler or subsidiary companies. The series ran on NBC for one season in 1994 before being revived two years later for three more seasons of first-run syndication. Reruns of the series have appeared on Sci-Fi Channel and USA Network.

The Viper Defender "star car" was designed by Chrysler Corporation engineers unlike most Hollywood Film/TV cars that are usually customized by film picture designers. The car was built on a heavily modified RT/10 Chassis and is a completely functional prototype. Only 14 Defenders were made. The exterior design of the car was produced by Chrysler stylist Steve Ferrerio.

The Defender is a fictional assault vehicle that is said to be a highly sophisticated vehicle (contrary to the normal Viper's spartan nature) that can, at the flick of a switch, transform from a red RT/10 (later a blue GTS) into a grey/silver weaponized armored coupe.

=== Phase SR II ===
{{Main|Chrysler Viper GTS-R}}
In 1996, a race car based on the Viper was built, and was called the Chrysler Viper GTS-R (in American races, was named the Dodge Viper GTS-R). The construction was done by [[Chrysler]] and by the teams [[Reynard Motorsport]] and [[Oreca]]. The numbers the car used were vast, with numbers like #91, #51, #2, #92, and #52.

The car was unveiled in 1996 at the [[IMSA GT Championship]], with the team Canaska Southwind, which competed in the GTS-1 class, the highest for GTS classes. Its first race was at the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] and managed to finish at the 29th position, but fortunately the team would improve greatly, finishing 12th position in the [[12 Hours of Sebring]]. The car wasn't able to reach much further however, which meant the team had to switch to GTS-2. [[Oreca]] had planned for racing in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] with their own GTS-R.

Both teams appeared at the [[1996 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] each with two entries.  Three of those four cars managed to finish with Canaska Southwind earning the best result in tenth place.  The two teams returned to their respective series afterwards. Oreca finished the year with three races in the [[BPR Global GT Series]] getting an eighth place at [[Brands Hatch]], ninth at [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa]], and sixth at [[Circuit Paul Armagnac|Nogaro]]. Canaska Southwind concluded the season by finishing second in class at [[Mosport]] and sixth overall.

For the later years 1999 and 2000, the efforts made by Oreca had expanded, racing in both the [[ALMS]] and [[FIA GT Championship]] respectively, earning them nine wins, and one by the racing team [[Paul Belmondo]]. Another team named Chamberlain had improved to finish second overall in the FIA GT. Back at ALMS, Oreca had taken the title, with six wins. Later at Le Mans, Oreca would go on to win their second consecutive win, with the top six positions in every class being taken by various GTS-Rs. The GTS-R had made its first appearance in the [[FFSA GT Championship]], and saw the first overall win for [[Zakspeed]] in the [[24 Hours Nürburgring|24 Hours of Nürburgring]]. Oreca left the FIA GT in 1999 to focus on ALMS, leaving the privateers to race there, and got 11 races out of it for Oreca. They did lose to the then-new [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]] factory racing team, but still won the championship. Back at the FIA GT, the Viper racing teams won four races, but were outrun by the [[Lister Storm]] racing teams, with them winning five races for them. This let them settle for second and third. In the FFSA, the three teams DDO, ART, and MMI teams would win a total of eight victories.

The Oreca racing team had left competition to focus on [[Le Mans Prototype]] racing for 2001. The rest of the teams left at later years, and the Viper GTS-R began fading by 2004, then left completely by 2010.

In 2006, a modified Dodge Viper GTS-ACR driven by Greg Crick under the team Crickcars.com entered the [[Australian GT Championship]] and won it, with 713 points in total.

=== Phase ZB I ===

A new race car called the Viper Competition Coupe took the GTS-R's place for the second phase. The Viper Competition Coupe had the same 8.3-liter V10 engine as the road legal Viper, but increased power to {{convert|520|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|540|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.&lt;ref name="SRT Heritage"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.drivesrt.com/racing/heritage/viper-competition-coupe/ | title = Viper Competition Coupe | publisher = Street &amp; Racing Technology | accessdate = May 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Competition Coupe had a carbon fiber composite body on a tubular steel frame with no interior trim and an [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]]-legal roll cage.  The exterior design of the Competition Coupe was based on the Viper GTS-R concept from 2000. Modifications to the mechanicals of the Viper included a 27-gallon fuel cell, differential cooler, ducted brakes, improved driver and engine cooling, trap door oil pan, low-inertia flywheel, an improved double-wishbone suspension system, new spherical bearing control arm attachments, two-way adjustable coil over dampers, and a driver-adjustable blade-type rear anti-roll bar. The anti-lock braking system added a distribution control system.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/cars/viper/competition-coupe.html|title=2003 Dodge Viper Competition Coupe: Racing Only|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=May 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial price of the car is around $100,000.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The Viper Competition Coupe was initially built for use in the Viper Challenge Championship one-make series starting in 2003.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Competition Coupe was later adapted for use in the [[Group GT3]] instituted by the FIA, allowing its use in a variety of series in Europe and North America. French racing team [[Oreca]] made further modifications to the car, to allow it to race in Group GT2. Privateer teams used these cars to compete for certain series, with Racing Box in Europe for the [[International GT Open]] and Woodhouse Racing and Primetime Race Group in the United States carrying out independent programs in the [[American Le Mans Series]].

=== Phase VX I ===

==== SRT Viper GTS-R ====
[[File:2013 SRT Viper GTR-R.JPG|thumb|An SRT Viper GTS-R performing in the 24 Hours of Le Mans|220x220px]]

The GTS-R returned in competition, but this time as an [[LM GTE]] class race car and instead, was constructed and designed by SRT Motorsports and [[Riley Technologies]]. It includes Michelin GT tires. The car retained the number #91 but had a new number for it called #93.

The vehicle was unveiled at the 2012 New York Auto Show, and it made its racing debut at the [[2012 Mid-Ohio Sports Car Challenge]] where two GTS-Rs, driven by Kuno Wittmer and [[Dominik Farnbacher]] with car #91, and [[Marc Goossens]] and [[Tommy Kendall]] with car #93, finished 10th and 12th in the GT class, which was 23rd and 25th overall.

The racing team entering 2012 [[ALMS]] included Dominik Farnbacher, Marc Goossens, [[Ryan Hunter-Reay]], Tommy Kendall, [[Jonathan Bomarito]], and Kuno Wittmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/04/05/2013-srt-viper-gts-r-alms-2012-new%20york/|title=2013 SRT Viper coils up to take a bite out of ALMS with GTS-R competition model|last=Joseph|first=Noah|date=April 5, 2012|publisher=autoblog|accessdate=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two GTS-Rs of SRT Motorsports finished 3rd in the GT class championship. The car made its debut at the [[Le Mans 24 Hours]] in [[2013 24 Hours of Le Mans|2013]], where it finished eighth in class and 24th overall.&lt;ref name="lm24"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wot.motortrend.com/1403_srt_viper_pulls_out_of_le_mans.html|title=SRT Viper Pulls-Out of Le Mans|last=Seabaugh|first=Christian|date=March 25, 2014|publisher=Motor Trend|accessdate=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, with the ALMS folding and merging with the Rolex Sports Car Series, SRT soon entered the [[TUDOR United SportsCar Championship]] GTLM class. In the opening round, the [[2014 24 Hours of Daytona]], SRT took 3rd and 6th in class (12th and 27th overall, completing 675 and 653 laps respectively). Both cars were repainted at Watkins Glen in the red and white livery used in the late 1990s to early 2000s. The No. 93 Viper won class at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] Brickyard Grand Prix in July 2014, after both cars took podium positions in the previous races at The Glen and Mosport.

In March 2014, Chrysler announced that it was withdrawing the Vipers from the [[2014 24 Hours of Le Mans]].&lt;ref name="lm24" /&gt; The Vipers ended the season at [[Petit Le Mans]] with a team championship and driver's championship by Kuno Wittmer. Following the end of the 2014 season, Chrysler discontinued the factory program by SRT Motorsports.

==== SRT Viper GT3-R ====
[[File:Cameron Lawrence - Riley Viper - Daytona January 2015.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Riley Technologies|Riley Motorsports]] Dodge SRT Viper GT3-R being driven by Al Carter, [[Cameron Lawrence (racing driver)|Cameron Lawrence]], [[Dominik Farnbacher]] and Kuno Wittmer.]]

The Viper GT3-R was made available for race teams in the later half of 2013 at an estimated cost of $459,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/srt-viper-gt3-r/28007/|title=SRT releases $460,000 Viper GT3-R race car}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car shares many technologies with the GTE race car but it is built to [[Group GT3]] regulations.

The GT3 car was jointly developed by SRT Motorsports and [[Riley Technologies]] and the car features the same 8.4 L engine from the road car and is capable of producing {{cvt|680|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} unrestricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drivesrt.com/racing/viper-gt3r/|title=SRT Viper GT3-R}}&lt;/ref&gt; However actual output will be near to {{cvt|600|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} due to balance of performance employed in GT3 championships. The car weighs in at 1,295&amp;nbsp;kg (2855&amp;nbsp;lbs) which is inside the 1,300&amp;nbsp;kg limit for GT3 cars.

The first win for the GT3-R spec Viper came on July 13, 2014 in the Tudor [[United SportsCar Championship]] at [[Mosport]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imsa.com/sites/default/files/race_result_files/TUDOR%20Championship%20CTMP%20Race%20Official.pdf|title=Race Result Mosport|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105192716/http://www.imsa.com/sites/default/files/race_result_files/TUDOR%20Championship%20CTMP%20Race%20Official.pdf|archivedate=November 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a win in the [[Pirelli World Challenge]] at the [[Streets of Toronto]] in the second race on July 20, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-challenge.com/news/series-news/item/2605-canadian-double-as-wittmer-wilkins-score-gt-gts-home-wins-in-toronto-mills-wins-gt-a.html|title=Canadian Double as Wittmer, Wilkins Score GT, GTS Home Wins in Toronto; Mills Wins GT-A}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dutch Supercar Challenge]] squad Team RaceArt won the 2014 and 2015 Super GT class championship in a Viper GT3-R.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supercarchallenge.nl/nl/kelvin_snoeks_wint_gt-race_op_zondag_team_raceart_met_van_der_zwaan_de_graaff_grouwels_kampioen.html|title=Kelvin Snoeks Wins GT Race On Sunday, Team RaceArt With Van Der Zwaan/De Graaff/Grouwels Champion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Official lap records ==
Since the debut of the ACR series, the ACR has been setting records all around the world, with most of them in the US. 28 of the 29 lap records have each been set by the ACR, with the last one made by the TA 1.0.

=== Phase SR II lap times ===
The first Viper ACR (Phase SR II) had only set just one lap record, in Willow Springs. This particular lap time was taken in 2008, in which it didn't make the fastest overall lap. The car did, however, achieve the fastest lap time for a 1990s car.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fastestlaps.com/tests/1a3vfzk780rh|title=Dodge Viper ACR laptime at Willow Springs |website=FastestLaps.com|language=en-US|access-date=September 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phase VX I lap times ===
In 2016, albeit Dodge and many other reports say the Viper ACR (Phase VX I) set 13 lap records, the ACR actually set a total of 14 lap records around the world, with all but one in the United States. All lap records made in US tracks are certified by the [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]], making it the most lap records held for a Viper, and more memorably, the current world record holder for it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This number became 15 after a crowdfunded lap record attempt in the [[Nürburgring|Nürburgring Nordschleife]], which is also the only lap record outside of the United States, where the car never took first overall, but became the fastest American, rear-wheel driven (with no additional assistance), and manual transmission car to ever lap the track.

The lap times are all set by American racing driver [[Randy Pobst]], making two of the 15 lap records, German racing driver [[Lance David Arnold]], making one of the 15, and SRT driver Chris Winkler, who made the other 12 of the 15 records.

The '''Dodge Fast Four''' was a model made by [[Dodge]] from 1927-1928. It came in two types, series 128 and 129.&lt;ref name=KIMES&gt;{{cite book|last=Kimes|first=Beverly|title=standard catalog of American Cars 1805-1942|year=1996|publisher=Krause publications|isbn=0-87341-428-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, the Dodge Fast Four was the new mid-level car from Dodge. The Fast Four looked similar to earlier 4-cylinder Dodges, but, the body was more rounded. Standard equipment included a speedometer, an ammeter, a tool kit, and a headlight dimmer.&lt;ref name=KIMES/&gt; Optional items included things like a rear bumper, a [[Motometer]], a heater, and windshield wipers. The only real difference between the 128 and the 129 was that the 128 had 19" wheels, while the 129 had 21" wheels.&lt;ref name=KIMES/&gt;

The '''Ram pickup''' (formerly the '''Dodge Ram pickup''') is a full-size [[pickup truck]] manufactured by [[Chrysler |FCA US LLC]] (formerly Chrysler Group LLC) and marketed from 2011 onwards under the '''[[Ram Trucks]]''' brand. The current [[Ram Pickup (fifth generation)|'''fifth-generation Ram''']] debuted at the [[North American International Auto Show#2018|2018 North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]], Michigan in January of that year.

Previously, Ram was part of the [[Dodge]] line of light trucks. The name ''Ram'' was first used in 1981 Dodge Trucks following the retiring and rebadging of the [[Dodge D Series]] pickup trucks as well as B-series vans, though the company had used a ram's-head hood ornament on some trucks as early as 1933.&lt;ref name="ED-DRG" /&gt;

Ram trucks have been named ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Car of the Year| Truck of the Year]] seven times; the second-generation Ram won the award in 1994, the third-generation Ram ''Heavy Duty'' won the award in 2003, the fourth-generation Ram Heavy Duty won in 2010 and the fourth-generation Ram 1500 won in 2013 and 2014, and the current [[Ram Pickup (fifth generation)|fifth-generation]] Ram 1500 won in 2019 and 2020.

The first-generation Ram trucks and vans introduced in 1981 featured a Ram hood ornament first used on Dodge vehicles from 1932 to 1954.&lt;ref name="ED-DRG"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dodge Ram - Generations |url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=46028 |publisher=Edmunds.com |first=John |last=DiPietro |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080801102809/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId%3D46028 |archivedate=2008-08-01 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all of the first-generation trucks have this ornament and is most commonly seen on [[four-wheel-drive]] models. Dodge kept the previous generation's model designations: "D" or ''Ram'' indicated [[two-wheel drive]] while "W" or ''Power Ram'' indicated [[four-wheel drive]]. Just like [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], Dodge used 150 to indicate a half-ton truck, 250 for a three-quarter-ton truck, and 350 for a one-ton truck. The truck models were offered in standard cab, "Club" extended cab, and crew cab configurations. They also were offered along with {{convert|6.5|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|8|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} bed lengths and "Utiline" and "Sweptline" styled boxes along with standard boxes. Externally, the first-generation Rams were facelifted versions of the previous generation Dodge D-Series pickups introduced in 1972. The new model introduced larger wraparound [[Automotive lighting|tail lamps]], dual rectangular [[headlamp]]s, and squared-off body lines. Engine choices were pared down to the [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine|225 Slant-6]] and [[Chrysler LA engine#318 V8|318]] and [[Chrysler LA engine#360 V8|360 V8s]]. The interior was updated and included a new bench seat and a completely new dashboard and instrument cluster with an optional three-pod design - a speedometer in the center, with the two side pods containing an ammeter on the top left, a temperature gauge bottom left, a fuel gauge on the top right and an oil pressure gauge bottom right. Models without the full gauge package had only indicator lights in the place of the temperature and oil pressure gauges. Among the options offered on the Ram were front bumper guards, a sliding rear cab window, air-conditioning, cruise control, tilt steering column, power door locks and windows, AM/FM stereo with cassette tape player, styled road wheels, aluminum turbine-style mag wheels, special paint and stripe packages, two-tone paint, and a plow package for four-wheel-drive models (referred to as the Sno Commander).

The "Club Cab" was dropped from the lineup after 1982, but Dodge kept the tooling and re-introduced nearly a decade later in the 1991 models. The four-door crew cab and Utiline beds were dropped after the 1985 model year, to make room on the assembly line for the upcoming 1987 [[Dodge Dakota]], and were never reintroduced in this generation.

Basic Ram 100 models were reintroduced for 1984, replacing the previous "Miser" trim level available on the Ram 150. A "Ram-Trac" shift-on-the-fly transfer case was added for the 1985 Power Rams, and both the crew cab and Utiline flared bed were dropped for 1986. In 1988 the Slant-6 engine was replaced by a {{convert|3.9|L|cuin|abbr=on}} [[Fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[Chrysler LA engine#239 V6|V6]] engine. The {{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} engine also received [[electronic fuel injection]] in 1988. Because of a new computer controlled fuel injection, ignition and ABS system, more vehicle information needed to be displayed through any warning or notification lights; so inside the cab where a small compartment was once located on the dash, a new "message center" with four small rectangular light spots, contained the [[check engine light]] and other [[Tell-tale (automotive)|tell-tales]] including one for the parking brake and the [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] if the truck was so equipped. The message center later included "Wait to Start" and "Water in Fuel" lights on diesel models. Diagnostic fault codes were stored in the computer's memory, and cycling the ignition key three times would allow the computer to flash the trouble codes through the check-engine light for diagnosis of some problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/fix/80s-codes.html |title=Retrieving fault codes |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rear [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] became standard equipment in 1989.

The Ram 100 model designation was dropped and these models folded back into the 150 range for 1990, due to the introduction and sales success of the [[Dodge Dakota]] pickup. Additionally, the instrument cluster was slightly revised; the [[ammeter]] was replaced by a [[voltmeter]] while maintaining the 3-pod arrangement of the speedometer and gauges. Also in 1990, Dodge reintroduced the Club Cab, equipped with fold-out jump seats for the 1991-1993 models. Entry was made through the passenger or driver's doors, as there were no rear doors for this configuration.

These trucks, though popular with fleets, sold poorly compared to the [[Ford F-Series]] and the [[Chevrolet C/K|General Motors C/K Trucks]], with just under 100,000 units sold most years of their production. Part of this was due to the dated cab and chassis design which had been in production since 1972, there was no powerful diesel option until 1989, and there was no big-block gas V8 option. Additionally, the interior had been given few updates since 1981.

===Engines &amp; transmissions===
For 1989, the 5.9&amp;nbsp;L V8 received throttle-body [[fuel injection]] for a 20&amp;nbsp;hp (15&amp;nbsp;kW) gain. Additionally, Dodge introduced a new [[Torqueflite|overdrive automatic transmission]] for reduced fuel consumption. This light-duty transmission was designated the A500, and was offered with the 3.9&amp;nbsp;L V6 and 5.2&amp;nbsp;L V8. An "O/D Off" pushbutton switch to lock out the overdrive 4th gear was added to the message center. The [[TorqueFlite#A727 .2836RH.2F37RH.29|A727 automatic]] saw continued use for some 5.2&amp;nbsp;L engines, all 5.9&amp;nbsp;L engines, and heavy-duty applications.

The grille was redesigned for 1991 but kept the large rectangular [[headlamp]]s and crossbar appearance. The engines were substantially [[Chrysler LA engine|upgraded]] for 1992 (3.9&amp;nbsp;L and 5.2&amp;nbsp;L) 1993 and 1994 (5.9&amp;nbsp;L) with multi-port fuel injection, new manifolds, and higher-compression cylinder heads for noticeably higher output. These newly-revised engines were marketed under the "Magnum" name. A heavy-duty automatic transmission with overdrive called the [[TorqueFlite#A518 .2846RH.2F46RE.29|A518]] was offered with the 5.2&amp;nbsp;L and 5.9&amp;nbsp;L engines. As part of Chrysler's overhaul of corporate transmission nomenclature, the A500 and A518 were redesignated 42RH and 46RH, respectively, in 1992. The initial "4" signified a 4-speed transmission, the second digit identified the transmission's relative torque capacity, the letter "R" in the third position denoted a rear-wheel-drive transmission, and the final letter "H" signified hydraulic shift control. The 3-speed automatic remained available; the A727 was redesignated 36RH, and the A904, A998, and A999 became the 30RH, 31RH, and 32RH, respectively.

====5.9 Cummins====
[[File:1993 Dodge Ram W250 Club Cab 4x4 Cummins td.jpg|thumb|1993 W250 Club Cab]]
A [[Cummins B Series engine]] was also added to the engine lineup in 1989.&lt;ref name="AllparCummins"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/mopar/cummins-diesel.html |title=Cummins 5.9-liter and 6.7-liter inline six-cylinder diesel engines |publisher=Allpar.com |date= |accessdate=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, Dodge saw sales increase. The Cummins was coupled with a heavier-duty version of the [[TorqueFlite#A727|A727 automatic]] or a 5-speed [[manual transmission]] and is available on 250 and 350 pickups and pickup-based chassis-cab trucks. This diesel engine option was different from the optional diesels in Ford and GM trucks. The Cummins features direct injection, whereas the Ford and GM diesels feature [[indirect injection]]; this also means that the Cummins does not have to rely on [[glowplug]]s. The Cummins is a [[straight-six engine]], whereas the GM and Ford diesel engines are V8 engines. Additionally, the Cummins is [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]], while the [[Detroit Diesel V8 engine|6.2&amp;nbsp;L GM/DDC]] and [[International Harvester IDI|7.3 IDI Ford/IH]] are [[naturally aspirated]].&lt;ref name="AllparCummins"/&gt;

Pre-1994 Cummins-engined Dodge pickups are often termed a "First-Gen Cummins".

This was not the first engine to appear in Dodge pickup trucks as a diesel option. The 1978 and 1979 D-Series models were available with a Mitsubishi naturally-aspirated diesel, but it was seldom ordered.&lt;ref name="AllparCummins"/&gt;

In the middle of 1991, Dodge started using 350 frames in Ram 250 diesels, club cabs and crew cabs.&lt;ref&gt;http://1stgen.org/viewtopic.php?t=5143&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Prospector''' - Prospector was a package available throughout the 1980s that usually included a different fuel tank, cloth seat and carpeting. In the late 80s, a light package as well as the large 6x9 mirrors were added to the list of options. This trim package was carried on until the redesign in 1994.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The second-generation Ram began development in 1986. The original concept, dubbed the "Louisville Slugger" by Chrysler's Advanced Packaging Studio, was to be a modular platform that would accommodate a full-size truck and full-size van, which would have provided a roomy cab and cargo bed.&lt;ref name="Jalopnik"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://jalopnik.com/the-original-design-for-the-second-gen-dodge-ram-was-a-1825251176 |title=The Original Design For The Second-Gen Dodge Ram Was A Styling Disaster |author=Westbrook, Justin T. |work=Jalopnik |date=August 13, 2018 |accessdate=November 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modular design was scrapped in 1987 and was replaced with a more conventional truck design when the design was moved to the [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] design studio.&lt;ref name="Jalopnik"/&gt; The more conventional design, dubbed "Phoenix", was originally scheduled for a 1991 production; when Bob Lutz showed it to the new styling designers, chief designer Phillip E. Payne told him, "It looks like nothing more than a rehash of everybody else's truck." At that, Lutz told him he had six months to come up with something better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autosofinterest.com/2012/07/21/design-notes-1994-dodge-ram-truck/ |title=Design Notes: 1994 Dodge Ram Truck |publisher=Autos of Interest |date=2012-07-21 |accessdate=2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exterior styling of the truck that was eventually released was the result of design concepts by Payne during 1988-1990. A review by the Dodge pick-up truck studio designers felt that modern pick-ups looked "too flat and sedan-like", while the [[Studebaker E-series truck|early 1950s Studebaker pick-up]] and the [[semi-trailer truck]]s had just the right "macho" look to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=29&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;S1=%22dodge+ram%22&amp;OS=%22dodge+ram%22&amp;RS=%22dodge+ram%22 |title=U.S. Patent D396,828 - Body Styling of 1994 Dodge Ram |publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office |date=August 11, 1998 |accessdate=2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design featured a [[big rig|big-rig]]-looking front end and a large grille that was deemed risky at its introduction, but ultimately proved popular with consumers.&lt;ref name="Truckoftheyear"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/ram-1500/1994/1994-dodge-ram-1500-laramie-slt/ |title=1994 Dodge Ram 1500 Laramie SLT - Long-Term Wrap-Up |author=Killeen, Scott |work=Motor Trend |date=February 1, 1996 |accessdate=February 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Making its debut on January 5, 1993 at the [[North American International Auto Show]] and going on sale on October 1, 1993, the redesigned 1994 Ram was a sales success and was named "[[Motor Trend Car of the Year|Truck of the Year]]" by ''[[Motor Trend]]'' in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/06/business/company-news-new-pickup-is-displayed-by-chrysler.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Truckoftheyear"/&gt; Sales increased from 95,542 units in 1993 to 232,092 in 1994, 410,000 in 1995, and 411,000 by 1996. That year, it was prominently featured as the hero vehicle in the film ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1996/06/01/reels-and-reels-of-wheels/cf2cbd8b-c945-47ac-9c31-3e970910fca7/?noredirect=on |title=Reels and Reels of Wheels |first=Warren |last=Brown |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 1, 1996 |accessdate=April 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.motorious.com/articles/news/315749/twister-replica-dodge-ram-sure-to-kick-up-a-storm-at-auction |title=Twister Replica Dodge Ram Sure To Kick Up A Storm At Auction |first=Tyler |last=Heatley |website=Motorious |date=March 28, 2019 |accessdate=April 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales of this generation peaked at just over 400,000 in 1999 before declining against the redesigned [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors|GM]] trucks. By 2001, Ram sales figures were below those of Ford and Chevy trucks.

Engine offerings continued over from the first-generation Ram and were the 3.9&amp;nbsp;L V6, 5.2&amp;nbsp;L V8, 5.9&amp;nbsp;L V8, and 5.9&amp;nbsp;L [[Straight-six engine|I6]] Cummins turbo diesel. Added to the line up was a new 488 cubic inch 8.0L V10 engine designed as an alternative for those who wanted superior pulling power but did not want a diesel. The new [[V10 engine|V10]] and Cummins turbo diesel could only be had in the 2500 and higher designation models. Models were now the 1500 half-ton, 2500 three-quarter-ton, and 3500 dual-rear-wheel one-ton in both 2- and 4-wheel drive. 1500 Rams offered both 6.5- and 8-foot (2 and 2.4 m, respectively) boxes. 2500 Rams offered {{convert|6.5|ft|m|adj=on}} boxes with club or quad Cabs.

Dodge offered the 2500 series in two different gross-vehicle-weight ratings for the first few years, but this was later dropped. The purpose of the difference between the light-duty and heavy-duty 2500 trucks was for the heavy-duty 2500 to take the place of the discontinued one-ton single-rear-wheel trucks. Rear axles for the light-duty 2500 trucks were [[Axle#Full-floating vs semi-floating|semi-floating]], while the heavy-duty 2500 rear axles were [[Axle#Full-floating vs semi-floating|full-floating]].

On the inside, special attention was paid to in-cab storage features, with a large glovebox, a center armrest storage area, and extra storage space behind the seat. The dash and gauge cluster were a far cry from the previous model Ram and were far more modern as well. A redesign of the dashboard and instrument cluster was introduced in 1998 along with the introduction of the quad cab, and rounded black plastic side-view mirrors replaced the previous rectangular design.

===1998 updates===
In 1998, Dodge introduced the "Quad Cab", which uses smaller, [[suicide doors]] directly behind the main doors. This was offered as an option on the "Club Cab" for this model year. Other changes for 1998 included rounded mirrors replacing the classic square ones, a revised interior, dual airbags, a chime replacing the buzzer for seat belts/door ajar/headlights/ and a digital [[odometer]]. The [[OBD II]] System was also standard, with a computer port near the driver's-side footwell and a code-checking system via the new digital [[odometer]] readout.

In late 1998 Dodge introduced a revised front end for the 1999 model year Sport models with a restyled bumper, quad-beam clear-lens [[headlamp]]s, and body-color grille. A 6-speed manual transmission was made optional for diesel variants in late 2000 for the 2001 model year. A small percentage of the diesel engines for 1999 and 2000 model years were subject to problems within the water jackets and fuel injectors. The most problematic was the "53" stamped engine block which had a defect that would cause fracturing in the structure of the block itself. The 2000 models became optional with heated leather seats. The braking system was upgraded to dual-piston calipers in the front. An Offroad Edition was offered as a package with a 2-inch lift accomplished with stiffer front springs and rear lift blocks, unique 17x8 wheels, 275/70/17 all terrain tires, 4.10 gears, trussed Dana 44 in the front, limited slip differential, and skid plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pickuptrucks.com/html/ram1.html |title=200 Dodge Ram specifications |publisher=pickuptrucks.com |accessdate=January 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Offroad Edition models are also distinguishable with an additional decal on the tailgate under the 4x4 decal that says "Offroad."

Although Dodge introduced a new Ram 1500 for 2002, the old second-generation style Ram was carried over for the 2002 model year heavy-duty 2500 and 3500 trucks. The new third-generation Ram would not appear in the 2500/3500 variants until 2003. Part of this delay was due to the then new 5.7&amp;nbsp;L Hemi engine not being ready for production.

====Mexico====
{{main|Dodge Ramcharger}}
Unencumbered by CAFE ([[Corporate average fuel economy]]) restrictions, DaimlerChrysler's Mexican subsidiary developed a three-door wagon version of the Ram, called the [[Dodge Ramcharger|Ram Charger]] as was its predecessor. It first appeared in 1998 but was never available in the United States.&lt;ref name=SS03&gt;{{cite book | ref = SS03 | title = Katalog Samochody Świata 2003 | trans-title = World Car Catalogue 2003 | editor-first = Eligiusz | editor-last = Mazur | publisher = Print Shops Prego - Polska Sp. z o.o. | location = Warsaw, Poland | page = 217 | date = 2002 | issn = 1234-8198 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drivetrain===

====Transmissions====
Transmissions for the Ram
*[[TorqueFlite|A500/42RH-RE]] lower geared light duty applications found behind the 3.9 L V6
*[[TorqueFlite|A518/46RH-RE]] for more heavy duty applications found behind the 5.2 L and 5.9 L V8 engines.
*[[TorqueFlite|A618/47RH-RE]] for heavy duty use behind the V10 gasoline and Cummins diesel engines. The 47RH was used in 1994 and 1995 model years, while the 47RE was used from 1996 through 2002.
[[New Venture Gear 3500 transmission|NV3500]] was offered in 1500 Rams and light-duty 2500 Rams.
[[New Venture Gear 4500 transmission|NV4500]] was standard in 2500 and 3500 trucks; the NV4500HD for V10 and diesel models (''except the uncommon, light-duty 2500 rams'').
A [[New Venture Gear 5600 transmission|NV5600]] was offered in 1999 and 2000 Rams and was the only transmission offered behind the High Output diesel in 2001 and 2002.

====Transfer cases====
There were a total of five [[transfer case]]s available for the four-wheel-drive Ram. All are part-time and have a low range of 2.72:1. The 1500 featured a NP231 and NP231HD. The NP241 was standard on V8 2500 Rams. The 2500 and 3500 V10 and diesel featured a NP241DLD from 1993 to 1997. In 1997 the NP241DHD became an option for 2500 Rams and was standard on 3500 Rams from 1998 to 2002.

====Axles====
The Dodge Ram features a wide variety of axles. For the front axle of 4x4 Rams, a [[Dana 44]] was used on all 1500 Rams and the early (light-duty) 2500 Rams. However, most of the 2500 and all 3500 Rams use [[Dana 60]] front axles. The 1500 Rams and some early light duty 2500 Rams used a 9.25 Chrysler (Spicer) axle in the rear. A [[Dana 60]] rear axle was used on heavy duty 2500 V8 Rams. A [[Dana 70]] rear axle was used in 2500 Rams with a V10 or a Diesel/Automatic transmission combination. A [[Dana 80]] rear axle was used on 2500 Rams with a manual transmission and V10/diesel engine combination. Every 3500 Ram was made with a Dana 80. The front drive axles in these Rams were unique in the fact they did not have [[locking hubs]], but featured a [[center axle disconnect]]. The 2002 2500 and 3500 Rams saw the eventual phase out of the Center axle disconnect, in favor of front axles that were permanently locked in. Dodge continued to include front axles like this for their 2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500 trucks until 2013 models.

===Engines===
A [[natural gas|natural-gas-powered]] engine debuted for 1995 but was not popular and was only used in fleet vehicles on a very limited production run. The [[Cummins B Series engine]] was switched from the 12-valve to the 24-valve (ISB) version in the middle of the 1998 model-year Dodge Rams due to emissions regulations. The ISB featured a new computer-controlled electronic injection pump and 24-valve head design.

===Special editions===
*'''Limited Edition Indy Pace and SS/T Package''' - The Dodge Ram Indy Pace Truck was available in 1996. It included longitudinal stripes similar to those on the Dodge Viper along with an optional door sticker stating "Official Truck of the 80th Indianapolis 500". These trucks had a {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} engine with upgraded exhaust and {{convert|15|hp|abbr=on}} more power. These also included {{convert|17|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheels with Goodyear Eagle II 275/60R-17 tires. The SS/T (Super Sport Truck) version was available from 1997 to 1998 and included all the same upgrades except the door sticker. The SS/T also had "SS/T" designed into the stripe on both the hood and tailgate. The Indy Trucks were available only in blue with white stripes. The SS/Ts were available in white/blue, red/silver, black/silver, and green/silver. All include a specialty sticker on the inner door stating, "Built with pride in the U.S.A." A real Pace truck is a metal plate on the driver's side frame rail, with a raised number 19 on it. However, the SS/Ts do not have this.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
*'''High Output''' - The Ram trucks started offering a diesel High Output package for 2001 models. 2001/2002 H.O. engines were rated 10 horsepower higher than the standard engine.
*'''Off-Road Edition''' - The Dodge Ram 1500 SLT Off-Road "Edition" (package)&lt;ref name="Geno's Garage"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dodge Ram Pickup Info |url=http://dodgeram.info/2001/models/1500.html |website=DodgeRam.info |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was available in the latter portion of the second generation. It included 17" alloy wheels (1 inch larger than the standard 16"), added 4X4 transfer case skid plate, 4.10 rear axle gear ratio, limited-slip rear differential, heated dual-power side mirrors, fog lamps, and tow hooks in the front mounted to the frame.

In development from 1996 (styling by Cliff Wilkins finalized in 1998), the third-generation Ram was unveiled on February 7, 2001 at the [[Chicago Auto Show|2001 Chicago Auto Show]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2001/feb/07/news/hw-21967 |title=2002 Dodge Ram Gets a Dose of Steroids - lattices |newspaper=LA Times |first=John |last=O'Dell |date=2001-02-07 |accessdate=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and debuted for 2002 model year on 1500 models and 2003 on 2500 and 3500 models. This was a major update including an all new frame, suspension, powertrains, interiors, and sheet metal. The crew cab models for this generation were actually Quad Cab trucks that had conventional-opening rear doors. The four-wheel-drive light trucks (1500 series) lost their [[live axle]]s in favor of an [[independent suspension|independent front suspension]], but the 2500 and 3500 series retained the live axles for maximum longevity and durability; rear-wheel-drive 2500 &amp; 3500 had class-exclusive rack and pinion steering for their independent front suspension (the 1500 also received rack and pinion steering for the first time). This body style drew heavily from the previous generation.

The redesigned trucks bolstered sales, with 400,000 sold during 2001-2002 and nearly 450,000 sold during 2002-2003, a new high point for the Ram name. At the same time, both [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors|GM]] trucks were increasing in sales from a 2001 peak over 850,000 to the 900,000 range. But with 400,543 Rams sold that year, the Ram's sales could not keep up with the eleventh-generation [[Ford F-Series eleventh generation|F-150]] in 2004.

===2006 Facelift===

[[File:2006-2008 Dodge Ram 1500 -- 03-16-2012.JPG|thumb|left|2006–2008 Dodge Ram 1500 Quad Cab]]

The Dodge Ram was updated for the 2006 model year. One notable addition was the "Mega Cab", featuring a {{convert|6.25|ft|m|0|adj=on}} cargo box and {{convert|22|in|0|abbr=}} of extra cab space, allowing seating for six with rear recliners, a full screen mapping in-dash navigation system became an option, and the [[headlamp]]s were redesigned to a more modern design.

For 2006, the [[steering wheel]] design was changed to one from the [[Dodge Dakota]] and [[Dodge Durango]]. [[Bluetooth]] [[U Connect]] was now available as an option, and a front facelift was given to all Ram models. [[SIRIUS Satellite Radio]] was available, as well was a rear seat [[DVD]] entertainment system with wireless [[headphones]]. The [[Street and Racing Technology|SRT]] model, with the 8.3&amp;nbsp;L [[V10 engine]] from the [[Dodge Viper]] SRT/10, was discontinued after the 2006 [[model year]].

For 2007, Dodge changed the tail lights.

===Chassis Cab===
In 2007, a 3500 Chassis Cab model was introduced with industry-standard rear frame width and wiring to accommodate outfitters. In addition to the {{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}, a [[Cummins]] {{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[diesel engine|diesel]] rated at {{convert|350|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|650|lbft|0|abbr=on}} was also available. Automatic transmissions used were the [[Chrysler RFE transmission|545RFE]] with the {{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} and the [[List of Aisin transmissions|AS68RC]] with the {{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The G56 transmission was the only manual transmission offered.

For 2008, Dodge introduced two more Chassis Cab models, the 4500 and 5500. These were [[Truck classification#Class 4|Class-4]] and [[Truck classification#Class 5|Class-5]] trucks with a gross weight of {{convert|16500|lb|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|19500|lb|0|abbr=on}}, respectively. Both trucks came equipped with the same version of the [[Cummins]] {{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[diesel engine|diesel]] as the 3500 chassis-cab model. [[Sterling Trucks|Sterling]], who worked with Dodge in development, had their own version, called the [[Sterling Bullet]] with a unique grille. Sterling is a division of [[Freightliner LLC]] which, like Dodge, was owned by the former [[DaimlerChrysler]]. [[Sterling Trucks]] was licensed to sell Dodge Ram 4500 series trucks as the Sterling Bullet. When the [[Sterling Trucks|Sterling]] brand was phased out by [[Chrysler Corporation]], the Bullet was discontinued.

Models built after January 1, 2007 offered a new 6.7 L Cummins turbo diesel introduced as an option in 2500/3500 models replacing the 5.9 L. It produced {{convert|350|hp||0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|650|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. Unlike the 5.9 L which was backed by the 4-speed [[TorqueFlite|48RE]] Transmission, the 6.7 L was equipped with the new 6-speed [[Chrysler RFE transmission|68RFE]] transmission.

2005 was the last year for the first version of the {{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} Hemi V8. 2006 half-ton models offered the [[Multi-Displacement System]] Hemi V8 engine that also became available in Chrysler and Dodge sedans. This engine featured the same performance but had a cylinder-deactivating feature enabled under light loads to increase fuel economy by 3 MPG city and 4 MPG hwy. This new Hemi still delivered {{convert|345|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|375|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}.

===Axles===
For the 2003 model year, AAM axles replaced the Dana Corp axles. In the front all 2500 and 3500 trucks were 9.25-inch with 33 spline axles. The rear options for the 2500 and 3500 were the AAM (often referred to as "corporate") [[10.5" Corporate 14 Bolt Differential#10.5 AAM|10.5]]" and [[10.5" Corporate 14 Bolt Differential#11.5 AAM|11.5]]". Rear axle shafts are 30 spline. The rear 11.5" has a gear ratio "carrier split" at 3.73 and numerically higher, but the General Motors AAM axles used a different carrier spacing preventing installation of a Chrysler carrier into some GM axles, but the GM carrier can be installed in the Chrysler axle if a ring gear spacer is installed. Strength is similar to their earlier Dana 70 and 80 counterparts. Direct comparisons are difficult as the axles are made with completely different [[metallurgy]].

===Special editions===
* '''HemiSport''' - The HemiSport Edition was the Quad Cab version of the Rumble Bee, and was introduced in 2004. It was available in black, red, or silver, and with either rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. It was equipped similarly to the Rumble Bee, but without the number plaque. The HemiSport was discontinued for 2006.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
* '''Dodge Ram VTS Concept''' - This concept from Dodge was meant to be a design study highly inspired by Viper GTS-inspired bumpers, mirrors, 17-inch wheels, Blue Paint, dual white stripes and Viper GTS sourced 415&amp;nbsp;bhp V10. VTS was vital in the development of 500&amp;nbsp;bhp Ram SRT-10 that were built from 2004 to 2006.&lt;ref name="thecarwallpapers.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecarwallpapers.com/history-dodge-ram-1|title=The History of Dodge Ram - Part 1|publisher=theCARwallpapers.com | accessdate=2013-09-29|work=thecarwallpapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Dodge Ram SRT 10]]''' - This is a regular or quad-cab body with the [[Dodge Viper]]'s [[Chrysler LA engine#8.0 Viper V10|V10 engine]] 8.3L, 22" wheels and [[Pirelli]] tires, lowered suspension, bucket seats, body modifications, and a spoiler. The 2004 version was available only in a single cab with a 6-speed [[manual transmission]] and a [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] shifter. For 2005, Dodge released a Quad Cab version of the Viper-V10-powered truck with a modified 48RE four-speed automatic transmission from the Ram with the Cummins turbodiesel engine. In 2004, the truck held the Guinness World Record for "World's Fastest Production Pickup Truck" with a speed of 154.587&amp;nbsp;mph (247.3&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trucks.about.com/cs/2004dodgetrucks/a/gaughn_srt10.htm |title=Dodge Ram SRT-10 is World's Fastest Production Truck |work=About.com: Trucks |accessdate=2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This record stood until overtaken by the Australian [[HSV Maloo]] R8, a sport utility coupe, in May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.hspn.com/articles/519/1/HSV-sets-new-World-Land-Speed-Record-for-PickupUtility-Truck/Page1.html |title=HSV sets new World Land Speed Record for Pickup/Utility truck |date=June 28, 2006 |work=HSPN News |accessdate=2010-05-12 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116142535/http://news.hspn.com/articles/519/1/HSV-sets-new-World-Land-Speed-Record-for-PickupUtility-Truck/Page1.html |archivedate=2014-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; SRT-10 production ended on June 30, 2006.
* '''[[Dodge Power Wagon#|Power Wagon]]''' - This model, introduced for 2005, is an off-road focused version of the Ram. The name is drawn from Dodge's line of 4-wheel-drive trucks made from the early 1940s through the 1980s. It comes with the {{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[Chrysler Hemi engine#5.7|Hemi]] engine,(changed to the 6.4L hemi model year 2014 to present) electronic locking differentials, electronic disconnecting front sway bar, 285/70R17 off-road tires mounted on power wagon specific 17" wheels with dual safety beads, factory lift springs with power wagon specific spring rates, fender flares, full under body skid plates, "Power Wagon" nameplates instead of the standard Ram badging, and a 12,000 pound winch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.4wdandsportutility.com/features/0807_4wd_dodge_ram_power_wagon_off_road_truck/index.html |title=Dodge Power Wagon - Off Road Truck |journal=4 Wheel Drive &amp; Sport Utility Magazine |date=August 2007 |accessdate=2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This truck was built on the 2500 platform.

[[File:2005 Dodge Ram Rumble Bee.jpg|thumb|right|2005 Dodge Ram Rumble Bee]]
* '''Rumble Bee''' - The Rumble Bee package is a limited sport-truck version of the Ram. It was available only on regular-cab/short-box pickups; however, some other versions of the Ram were modified to look like Rumble Bees. It includes lower body cladding, 20" wheels, a hood scoop, and an SLT interior specially trimmed with yellow dashboard and door panel inserts and a serialized number plate. On the rear of the box is a stripe with a "Rumble Bee" emblem, similar to that of the [[Dodge Super Bee|Super Bee]]. All Rumble Bees are either black with "solar yellow" trim or yellow with black trim.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} 4,858 were produced in 2004, and 5,174 in 2005.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}
* '''HemiGTX''' - The Hemi GTX package is a limited sport-truck version of the Ram. Introduced in 2004 and only made in 2004 and 2005, these were customized by LA West of Indiana as ordered from dealers, adding an additional $8,300.50 in sticker price. It was available on regular-cab/short-box and quad-cab/short-box pickups and include a custom overall paint from Mopar's Impact colors from the 1970s (this includes Hemi Orange, Plum Crazy Purple, Sublime Green, and Banana Yellow). 20" American Racing Motto chrome wheels, a new cowl "blacked-out" hood, and a specially trimmed leather 2-tone interior including a serialized number plate on the driver's-side doorjamb were offered. On the sides is a "hockey-stick" stripe with "HEMI GTX" that extended from the hood to the rear of the box. The air box was also painted to match the body color, and a color-matched steering wheel was added as well. They were only 433 produced in 2004 and roughly the same number in 2005. A certificate of authenticity was given to all original owners.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
[[File:'02-'05 Dodge Ram Daytona Crew Cab 1500.JPG|thumb|2005 Dodge Ram Daytona]]
* '''Daytona''' - Introduced for 2005, the Ram Daytona was a new sport-truck edition of the Ram. It was available as a 5.7-liter Hemi V8 in Regular or Quad-Cab styles and featured lower-body cladding, 20-inch chrome wheels, SRT-10 hood, Borla dual exhaust, serialized number plate, and a tall rear spoiler reminiscent of the 1969 [[Dodge Charger Daytona]]. The Daytonas had a black body stripe to match the rear spoiler and came in silver or "Go Mango" paint (a metallic orange color reminiscent of the Dodge's "high impact" colors from the 1960s and 1970s) with matching interior trim. The Dodge Ram Daytona had a 3.92 ratio rear end, the same rear end as the Dodge Ram Rumble Bee. Several exterior items were unique to the Daytona package (such as the gas door and dual side exit exhaust tips) which made it different from other equipment packages. It was equipped with {{convert|20|in|mm|adj=on}} [[chrome plating|chrome]] wheels and performance tires. Replacing the standard hood is one with a non-functional [[hood scoop]]. The most noticeable feature is the large [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] which is attached at the rear of the cargo box. The {{convert|11|in|mm|adj=on}} spoiler lined up with the flat black stripe that ran along the back of the bed side with the word 'Daytona' written in the middle. This spoiler is reminiscent of the 1969 [[Dodge Charger Daytona]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
*'''Contractor's Special hybrid''' - Dodge announced a [[hybrid car|hybrid]] version of the Ram, dubbed the ''Contractor's Special'', in 2003. However, the schedule for delivery slipped as Dodge backed away from the vehicle. The hybrid Ram was available only for fleet purchasers (if at all) and did not enter mass production. It offered an [[alternating current|AC]] electrical outlet panel for running an entire job site worth of power tools, but the through-the-road method of balancing the gas engine and electric motor reportedly did not work as desired. Dodge has announced that it would use a hybrid transmission developed jointly with [[General Motors]] and [[BMW]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/ram/special-rams.html |title=Specialty Dodge Rams |work=Allpar |accessdate=2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''NightRunner''' - 400 of these were assembled from January 2006 to December 2006 (200 Single-cab and 200 Quad-cab). The Limited Edition NightRunner trim includes Brilliant Black Paint, 22-inch (510&amp;nbsp;mm) black chrome wheels, black chrome grill, the 8.3L Viper engine, dark shaded headlamps, NightRunner graphics on the sides of the rear bed, Piano black dash and a numeroted plate below the climate controls. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The fourth generation Dodge Ram was introduced at the 2008 [[North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]].&lt;ref name=Vlasic&gt;{{cite news|first=Bill |last=Vlasic |date=January 14, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/14/business/14truck.html |title=Ford and Chrysler Unveil Their Redesigned Pickups |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=April 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This latest generation was sold as the 2009 Dodge Ram 1500 starting in Fall 2008. The 2500, 3500, 4500 and 5500 models were later added to the lineup. In 2010, the [[Ram Trucks]] brand was separated from [[Dodge]].

[[Chrysler LLC]] attempted to keep the Ram competitive in the market through various developments for the 2009 model, including a new four-door cab style offering, new suspension, a new [[hemi engine]] option, and the Rambox, a new storage system that allows secure storage inside the truck's bed walls. Later models have the Rambox system tied in with the [[remote keyless system]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ihs.com/products/global-insight/industry-economic-report.aspx?ID=106597245&amp;pu=1&amp;rd=globalinsight_com |title=NAIAS 2008: Pick-Up Trucks Debut Amid Green Technologies |first=Candida |last=Scott |first2=Roger |last2=Kranenburg |first3=Deborah |last3=Mann |first4=Andrew |last4=Day|publisher=Global Insight |date=January 14, 2008 |accessdate=April 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Class exclusive manual transmission===
[[File:2011 Dodge Power Wagon.jpg|thumb|left|2011 Ram [[Power Wagon]]]]

Since 2011, Ram trucks are marketed as having "class-exclusive" [[manual transmission]]s. This is because the competitors stopped making manual transmissions available in the domestic market. [[Chevrolet Silverado]] trucks discontinued the option of a manual transmission after model year 2006. [[Ford Super Duty]] trucks discontinued the option of a manual transmission after model year 2010. This applies to [[Truck classification#Class 2|Class 2]], [[Truck classification#Class 3|Class 3]], [[Truck classification#Class 4|Class 4]] and [[Truck classification#Class 5|Class 5]] trucks. 2011 and 2012 models make {{convert|350|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|610|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. Horsepower remained the same for 2013 models, torque however, was increased to {{convert|660|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. Engine output remained the same for 2014 models.

===Cab options===
[[File:2012 Ram 1500 SLT Quad Cab 5.7L rear 4.12.19.jpg|thumb|left|2012 Dodge Ram 1500 Big Horn Quad Cab (rear)]]

The Mega Cab option was deleted on the 1500 model, replaced by a true four-door [[crew cab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/autoshows/14499/2009-dodge-ram.html |title=2009 Dodge Ram - Auto Shows |journal=Car and Driver |date=January 2008 |first=Mark |last=Gillies |accessdate=April 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cab options are [[regular cab]] and Quad Cab. The Mega Cab option remains on the heavy-duty models, along with crew cab. Improvements made from the previous generation mean the rear seats are now able to recline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://trucks.about.com/od/2006truckintrosspecs/ss/06_ram_megacab_5.htm |title=2006 Dodge Ram Mega Cab Review |author=Colin Hefferon |accessdate=2014-04-04 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407070929/http://trucks.about.com/od/2006truckintrosspecs/ss/06_ram_megacab_5.htm |archivedate=2014-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Handling===
A coil spring five-link rear suspension replaces the leaf-springs for the 1500.

===Payload capacities===
The 2009 model's towing capacity was originally rated at {{convert|9100|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} for 2WD Ram 1500 with regular cab, long-bed, 5.7&amp;nbsp;L Hemi engine, 3.92 differential and 17-inch wheels, but the rating increased to {{convert|10450|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} without changing the setup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.autoblog.com/2009/07/29/dodge-increases-towing-capacity-of-2010-ram-on-paper-no-hardwar/ |title=Dodge increases towing capacity of 2010 Ram on paper with no hardware changes |date=July 29, 2009 |work=Autoblog.com |accessdate=2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2010 model, payload was increased by {{convert|50|lb|kg||abbr=on}} to {{convert|1900|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} for the regular cab 2WD model with the 3.7 liter V6 engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.pickuptrucks.com/2009/07/2010-dodge-ram-1500-towing-rating-increases-to-10450-pounds.html |title=Update 1: 2010 Dodge Ram 1500 Towing Rating Increases |date=July 28, 2009 |work=PickupTruck.com |accessdate=2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towing capacity for the regular cab Ram 1500 with 3.21 differential is rated at {{convert|6100|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} with 17-inch wheels and {{convert|5900|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} with 19-inch wheels. Crew Cab and Quad Cab models are rated at {{convert|5700|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|5800|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} respectively.

Gross Combined Weight Ratings is {{convert|11000|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} for all Ram 1500s with 3.21 axles; max {{convert|15500|lb|kg||abbr=on}} for 2WD Ram 1500 with long bed, 5.7&amp;nbsp;L hemi engine, and a 3.92 differential.

===Heavy Duty Chassis Cabs===
[[File:2011 Ram 3500 chassis cab -- 12-31-2010.jpg|thumb|left|2011 Ram 3500 chassis cab]]
[[File:2011RAM55004x4.jpg|thumb|left|A late model, 2011 Ram 5500 truck]]
Chassis Cab versions were made for the Ram 3500, 4500, and 5500 models. The 3500 Heavy Duty model was unveiled at the 2009 [[Chicago Auto Show]].

Engine choices include 5.7&amp;nbsp;L Hemi V8 rated at {{convert|383|bhp|kW||abbr=on}} at 5,600 rpm and {{convert|542|Nm|lbft||abbr=on}} at 4,000 rpm for Ram 3500, 6.7 l Cummins turbo diesel rated at {{convert|350|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 3,013 rpm and {{convert|880|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 1,500 rpm for Ram 3500 (optional), 4500, 5500. Late-model 2011 diesel trucks were up-rated to {{convert|800|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.

Transmission choices included a standard 6-speed manual or optional 6-speed [[Aisin]] automatic. Both transmissions support the Power Takeoff option.

The 3500 model has regular or crew cab, single-rear-wheel or dual-rear-wheel. Four cab-axle lengths (60, 84, 108 and 120&amp;nbsp;inches) for 4500/5500 or two cab-axle lengths (60 and 84&amp;nbsp;inches) for 3500, and three trim levels (ST, SLT and Laramie).

The Ram 3500 has three axle ratios (3.42, 3.73 and 4.10) and 17-inch wheels. Ram 4500/5500 has three axle ratios (4.10, 4.44 and 4.88) and 19.5-inch wheels. The 4500/5500 Rams rear axle is a [[Dana S 110]]. The front axle on 4x4 models is manufactured by [[Magna International|Magna]], while 2-wheel-drive models just have a solid, non-drive axle.

====Concept truck====
The Ram concept truck "Long Hauler" from 2012 is based mostly on existing Ram truck parts. The powertrain, frame and wheels are all components of the Ram 5500 Chassis Cab. It is a "Mega Cab" optional on the lighter Rams. The [[Gross combined weight rating|GCWR]] for this truck is 37,500&amp;nbsp;lb and the weight of the truck is 9,300&amp;nbsp;lb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/cars/concepts/ram/long-hauler.html|title=Long Hauler |accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013 changes===
[[File:Ram 1500 DS Crew Cab facelift 01 China 2014-04-24.jpg|thumb|2013 Ram 1500]]
[[File:Ram 1500 DS Crew Cab facelift 02 China 2014-04-24.jpg|thumb|2013 Ram 1500]]

The 1500 gets a minor restyling. It features new front fascia, optional projector beam halogen headlamps with [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] turn signals/parking lamps, wheels and interior, where the "DODGE" name was removed from the dashboard and replaced with "RAM".

All models offered for 2012 continue to be available for 2013 with the addition of a new trim, the Laramie, Longhorn, Limited. (Tradesman, Express, SLT, Big Horn, Lone Star, Sport, R/T, Laramie, and Laramie Longhorn). The Rambox cargo management system continues to be available on most models for 2013. For 2013, the base ST model becomes the Tradesman model.

2013 models have revised engine and transmission options. The 3.7&amp;nbsp;L V6 is discontinued, and the 4.7&amp;nbsp;L V8 equipped with the 6-speed 65RFE Automatic takes its place as the new base engine, still producing {{convert|310|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|330|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. New to the lineup is Chrysler's corporate 3.6&amp;nbsp;L Pentastar V6, coupled to the new [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] 8-speed Torqueflite8 Automatic. It achieves best in class fuel efficiency and makes {{convert|305|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|269|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}. The Pentastar/ZF 8-speed is optional. Due to a new electric power steering system, the 5.7&amp;nbsp;L HEMI V8 no longer has a power steering pump, and gains 5 horsepower, now making {{convert|395|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|410|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. It is still available with the 65RFE 6-speed Automatic, with the new 8-speed Torqueflite8 Automatic optional.

[[Air suspension]] is optional for 2013 models, offering four ride height settings. [[Electronic stability control]] becomes standard on 2500 and 3500 models. For 2013, the Ram is also the first North American pickup truck to offer [[Smart key|keyless ignition]].

New infotainment systems are available for the RAM 1500 for 2013:

The base U Connect 3.0 (RA1) radio includes an AM/FM radio, Radio Data System (RDS), a monochrome LCD display screen, a 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input jack, and a single USB port for charging purposes only.

The "up-level" U Connect 5.0BT (RA2) radio adds a full-color, 5.0-inch color touch-screen display, voice control for phone, a microSD card slot, Bluetooth for phone and A2DP wireless stereo audio streaming capabilities, and vehicle customization options on-screen.

The "top-of-the-line" radios are the U Connect ACCESS 8.4A (RA3) and U Connect ACCESS 8.4AN (RA4). These radios add a full-color, 8.4-inch color touch-screen display, full voice control, [[SiriusXM]] satellite radio, the U Connect ACCESS System, featuring roadside assistance and 9-1-1 emergency call buttons on the rear-view mirror, mobile app compatibility, remote USB ports for integration of compatible devices, enhanced in-vehicle customization options, automatic notification of airbag deployment, concierge services, remote control via an app installed on a compatible [[smartphone]], and the ability to add GPS navigation from [[Garmin]] for vehicles not equipped with the option from the factory (it is activated by a dealership for a fee, however, does not include SiriusXM Travel Link or 3D mapping). The U Connect ACCESS 8.4AN (RA4) adds GPS navigation from Garmin, [[HD Radio]] SiriusXM Travel Link, 3D mapping, and enhanced mobile app compatibility. The system also includes a built-in [[3G]] internet router, allowing for wireless connection to the internet while the vehicle is parked with a monthly service subscription. The system can also be updated to add additional features that will be available in the future via a USB stick inserted into one of the remote USB ports. Remote steering wheel-mounted controls are also included with this system.

Options such as a CD Player (mounted in the center console of the vehicle), SiriusXM satellite radio  and a Rearview Backup Camera can be added to any radio.

====3500====
The 2013 models move up to an 18-inch standard wheel, with 18-inch [[Forging|forged]] [[Alcoa]] wheels as an option. 3500 models offer a High Output package for the diesel. The rear [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] ring gear is increased from 11.5 inches, to 11.8 inches on H.O. trucks. The 11.8 axle cover doubles as a [[heat sink]].

====4x4====
Ram, once again, put the [[Center axle disconnect]] in 3500 4x4 models. 2500 Ram trucks did not have a CAD system until 2014 models. Ram claims this technology to improve fuel efficiency by 1 MPG, although [[EPA]] tests do not include class 2 and class 3 trucks in the [[Miles per gallon|MPG]]/fuel efficiency tests. The 4x4 saw additional changes with the [[transfer case]] now being made by [[BorgWarner]] instead of [[New Venture Gear]].

====High Fuel Efficiency====
A new model offered for the 2013 Ram is the HFE (High Fuel Efficiency). Based on the SLT model, the HFE offers 18/25 [[Miles per gallon|MPG]] out of its [[Pentastar]] V6 engine and eight-speed [[ZF 8HP transmission|Torque-Flite]] [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], which has nothing in common with the original Chrysler built [[TorqueFlite]]. It is available only in the six-foot bed, two-door, regular cab model with two-wheel-drive only. Standard features include a 220 amp [[Alternator#Automotive alternators|alternator]] and an 800 amp battery to assist with the [[Start-stop system]]. 3.21:1 axle gearing is also standard.

===2014 changes===
[[File:2014RAM3500.jpg|thumb|2014 Ram 3500 crew cab, 4×4, DRW]]
The option of [[air suspension]] became available on the rear of 2014 model year 2500 and 3500 pick up trucks. 1500 models added the option of an [[List of VM Motori engines#A 630 DOHC|Eco-Diesel V6]]. 2500 models now feature coil spring suspension, instead of leaf spring. The cast iron, flex fuel, 4.7 V8 [[Chrysler PowerTech engine]] was discontinued, ending Corsair engine production, leaving the Ram 1500 with two engine choices. The aluminum, flex fuel 3.6 V6 [[Pentastar]] is now the base engine, along with the 8-speed [[ZF 8HP transmission|Torque-Flite]] [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]. The 3.6&amp;nbsp;L Pentastar V6 was available on Laramie and Longhorn trims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Mark|title=Ram Will Offer Pentastar V6 in Top Trim Levels|url= http://news.pickuptrucks.com/2014/03/ram-will-offer-pentastar-v-6-in-top-trim-levels.html |work=pickuptrucks.com |accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ram heavy-duty series of trucks (2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500) received a new interior design and revised exterior styling from the Ram 1500, which was restyled in 2013.

===2016 changes===
[[File:Rebel1.jpg|thumb|2016 Ram Rebel]]
For 2016, the all-new Ram 1500 '''Rebel''' debuted, offering off-road suspension with a {{convert|1.0|in|cm|1}} higher ride height, larger tires, and a unique interior to add to the Ram 1500 '''Big Horn''' and '''Lone Star''' trim levels. It features a unique blacked-out grille with [[Powder coating|powder coated]] front bumper and exclusive aluminum hood, [[skid plate]]s, and [[Towing|tow hooks]].&lt;ref name=RebelPR&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-2015-ram-1500-rebel-makes-a-statement-300018786.html |title=New 2015 Ram 1500 Rebel Makes a Statement |author= |date=13 January 2015 |website= |publisher=PR Newswire Association LLC |accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is available with either a {{convert|305|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|269|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} 3.6&amp;nbsp;L [[Pentastar]] VVT FlexFuel-Capable V6 engine or a {{convert|395|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|410|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} 5.7&amp;nbsp;L [[HEMI]] V8 engine.&lt;ref name=WilliamsCT&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/automotive/sc-2016-ram-rebel-autoreview-1224-20151218-story.html |title=2016 Ram Rebel yells for off-road adventure |author=Casey Williams |date=21 December 2015 |newspaper=The Chicago Tribune |accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four-wheel drive is available with either powertrain, but the two-wheel drive model is V8-only. The sole body configuration offered is a crew cab with a short pickup bed.&lt;ref name=RebelPR/&gt;

'''SLT''' models of all Ram trucks now receive the U Connect 5.0BT (RA2) touch-screen radio as standard equipment, adding steering wheel-mounted remote phone controls, [[Bluetooth]] hands-free calling and wireless audio streaming, [[SiriusXM]] Satellite Radio, a USB port and 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm auxiliary input jack, Radio Data System (RDS), voice control, in-radio vehicle customization, and a full-color five-inch LCD touch-screen display. This was previously a $495.00 option on the Ram '''SLT'''.

===2017 changes===
For 2017, the Ram 1500 Laramie Longhorn and Limited trims received the new RAM front grille and "RAM" emblem across the rear tailgate that debuted on the 2016 RAM 1500 Rebel.

In mid-2017, the RAM 1500's 3.0&amp;nbsp;L [[EcoDiesel]] V6 turbodiesel engine, produced by [[VM Motori]], was dropped in mid-2017 in response to emissions cheating allegations. The engine will be re-introduced in early 2018, as re-certification by the [[EPA]] has been obtained.

The 1500 SLT model loses the U Connect ACCESS 8.4 infotainment system (RA3) option, leaving the U Connect 5.0BT (RA2) radio as the only radio option. However. all Ram heavy-duty (2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500) SLT models will still offer the U Connect ACCESS 8.4 infotainment system (RA3) as an option.

The Rebel trim level of the Ram 1500 gains the previously-optional U Connect ACCESS 8.4A infotainment system as standard equipment, as do the Big Horn and Lone Star trim levels. A Rebel Black Edition Package is available that adds black accents to the Rebel.

The Laramie trim level of the Ram 1500, 2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500 gets a standard nine-speaker, 506-watt [[Alpine Electronics|Alpine]] 7.1-channel surround-sound premium audio system as standard equipment.

Three new special edition trim levels debut for 2017 for the Ram 1500 model:

* The Lone Star Silver Edition, available exclusively at Ram dealerships in [[Texas]] and based on the Texas-only Lone Star trim level, adds additional chrome trim pieces to the trim level. It debuted at the 2016 [[Texas State Fair]].
* The Lone Star Yellow Rose Edition, also available exclusively at Ram dealerships in Texas and also based on the Texas-only Lone Star trim level, is available only in a model-exclusive Stinger Yellow Clear Coat exterior paint color. It debuted at the 2016 Texas State Fair.
* The Night Edition, available at Ram dealerships nationwide, is based on the Sport trim level, and adds black-finished emblems, twenty-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, front grille, door handles, and emblems to the model.

There is also a new Off-Road Package available for all Ram 2500 models (aside from the Power Wagon trim level, which includes the package as standard equipment), and includes unique pickup bedside graphics, off-road suspension, front tow hooks, and the protection package.

The mid-level SLT trim level of the RAM 1500 is no longer available to retail customers, as it is now a lesser-equipped model reserved exclusively for fleet customers. However, the SLT trim level still remains for the Ram 2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500 models, and are still available to retail customers. However, retail customers wanting SLT features such as chrome front and rear bumpers and front grille, seventeen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, power windows and door locks with keyless entry, the U Connect 5.0BT (RA2) touch-screen radio, cloth seating surfaces, [[SiriusXM]] [[Satellite Radio]], a rear-view backup camera system, and floor carpeting, can still opt for the Chrome Appearance and Popular Equipment Packages on the Tradesman model.

For customers wanting a less expensive [[Bluetooth]] option for the Ram truck, a new U Connect 3.0BT (RA2) radio is available for an additional $200.00, which includes an A/M-F/M radio and SiriusXM Satellite Radio tuner, Radio Data System (RDS), U Connect Bluetooth hands-free phone system with audio streaming and voice command, steering wheel-mounted remote voice command controls, a USB port and 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm auxiliary audio input jack, and a three-inch (3.0") monochrome LCD display screen. This radio option is available for the Tradesman trim level of all Ram trucks, and the Express trim level of the Ram 1500, and is included as part of a Popular Equipment Package on the latter model. Previously, customers wanting Bluetooth on a Ram Tradesman or Ram 1500 Express would have to upgrade to the U Connect 5.0BT (RA2) touch-screen radio, which would add the same features as described above, as well as onscreen vehicle customization via the radio, and a full five-inch (5.0") color touch-screen display, and cost an additional $495.00. In order to do this, the customer would also have to select the Popular Equipment Package on both models.

The RAM 2500 Power Wagon returned with a 6.4&amp;nbsp;L [[HEMI]] gasoline V8 engine, a unique graphics package (delete option), black front grille, door handles, larger tires and black aluminum-alloy wheels, and the Off-Road Package. The Power Wagon Package is also available for the Ram 2500 Tradesman trim level, and also adds the 6.4L HEMI gasoline V8 engine.

===2018 changes===
Changes to the Ram for 2018 included the addition of [[HD Radio]] to all U Connect 8.4 infotainment systems, as well as a new [[4G]] [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] wireless hot-spot provided by [[AT&amp;T Wireless]], an AT&amp;T Wireless 4G LTE in-vehicle modem (both the AT&amp;T Wireless 4G LTE modem and 4G LTE mobile hot-spot replace the [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] [[3G]] [[CDMA]] modem and 3G CDMA mobile hot-spot offered on previous Ram models), [[Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]] smartphone integration for the U Connect 8.4 infotainment systems, and the SiriusXM Guardian service replacing the U Connect ACCESS service offered on previous RAM models for the U Connect 8.4 infotainment systems. In addition, all U Connect 8.4 infotainment systems get a new [[User Interface]] design for easier navigation of menus and applications.

The [[VM Motori]]-produced 3.0&amp;nbsp;L [[EcoDiesel]] V6 turbodiesel engine returned in early 2018 for the RAM 1500, as it has been re-certified by the [[EPA]] after allegations of emissions cheating in 2017.

Most upper trim levels of the RAM 1500 (Sport, Rebel, Laramie Longhorn, and Limited) get the new RAM front grille introduced for 2016, as well as a large 'RAM' emblem on the rear tailgate. Lower to mid trim levels of the RAM 1500 (Tradesman, Express, Big Horn, Lone Star, and Laramie) retain the standard RAM "Cross-Hair" front grille.

The Night Edition and Lone Star Silver Edition trim levels were continued.

For 2018, there are two new special editions:
* The Harvest Edition (also available on the Ram 2500 and 3500), are based on the Big Horn and Lone Star models. Available in only four paint colors, two of which are unique to the Harvest Edition (Case IH Red, New Holland Blue, two-tone Black Clear Coat and Bright Silver Metallic, or Bright White Clear Coat). Aimed at farmers, the Harvest Edition adds features that are otherwise optional on the Big Horn and Lone Star, such as seventeen-inch chrome-clad aluminum-alloy wheels with all-terrain tires on 4X4 models, the U Connect 8.4 infotainment system with GPS navigation, [[SiriusXM]] Travel Link with five years of service included and one year of SiriusXM Guardian service, a trailer tow package with integrated trailer brake control, rear-mounted tow hitch, and trailer tow side mirrors. Also included are front bucket seats with power front driver's seat trimmed in premium cloth, chrome side steps, chrome side mirror covers, chrome door handles, and chrome front tow hooks. It is available as either a Quad Cab or a Crew Cab.
* The Laramie Longhorn Southfork Edition Package, available on 1500, 2500, and 3500 Laramie Longhorn models, adds even more luxury features to the already luxurious truck, such as unique twenty-inch polished aluminum-alloy wheels, unique real wood interior trim, and a unique two-tone blue-and-beige interior color scheme.

===2019 changes===

For 2019, the current fourth-generation Ram 1500 will be sold alongside its successor, the fifth-generation Ram 1500. Virtually identical to 2018 models, 2019 trucks will be given a new name, '''Ram 1500 Classic''', to distinguish them from their all-new fifth-generation successors. The Ram 1500 Classic will offer a 2-Door Regular Cab model, whereas the fifth-generation Ram 1500 will not. In addition, Quad and Crew Cab models are also expected to be offered.&lt;ref name="allpar.com"/&gt;

In addition, the current-generation '''Ram 2500''', '''Ram 3500''', and '''Ram 3500/4500/5500 Chassis Cab''' models will be redesigned for the 2019 [[model year]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.autoblog.com/2019/01/14/2019-ram-heavy-duty-revamp-1000-lb-ft-cummins/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production===
The Ram 1500, Ram Mega Cab, Ram 2500/3500, DX Chassis Cab (Mexico Market), Ram 4500/5500 are assembled at FCA's Saltillo Assembly Plant in Coahuila, Mexico; the Ram 1500 (DT) is assembled at [[Sterling Heights Assembly]] (SHAP) in [[Sterling Heights, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chrysler Group LLC Manufacturing Operations |url= http://www.media.chrysler.com/newsrelease.do?id=9117&amp;mid=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ram 1500 (DS) was previously assembled at [[Warren Truck Assembly]] in [[Warren, Michigan]].

===Plug-in hybrid===
A two-mode [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] version was planned to begin production in 2010, but Chrysler decided to cancel it in favor of a smaller test fleet of 140 [[plug-in hybrid]] (PHEV) Rams developed with support from a {{USD|48}} million grant from the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] financed through the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]].

[[File:Ram Pickup plug-in hybrid WAS 2011 1199.JPG|thumb|The Ram 1500 pickup PHEV was introduced at the 2011 [[Washington Auto Show]] in Washington, DC.]]
The Ram 1500 PHEV demonstrator has a 345&amp;nbsp;hp 5.7L [[Hemi]] V8 gasoline engine mated to a two-mode hybrid transmission and a 12.9 [[kWh]] 355V [[lithium-ion battery]] from [[Electrovaya]].

===Issues===
====Fire incident, Hybrid, 2012====
{{See also|Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents}}
In September 2012, Chrysler temporarily suspended the demonstration program. All 109 Ram 1500 Plug-in Hybrids and 23 [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country#Town &amp; Country Plug-in hybrid|Chrysler Town &amp; Country plug-in hybrid]]s deployed by the program were recalled due to damage sustained by three separate pickup trucks when their 12.9 [[kWh]] battery packs overheated. The carmaker plans to upgrade the battery packs with cells that use a different lithium-ion chemistry before the vehicles go back into service. Chrysler explained that no one was injured from any of the incidents, and the vehicles were not occupied at the time, nor any of the minivans were involved in any incident, but they were withdrawn as a precaution. The demonstration is a program jointly funded by Chrysler and the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] that includes the first-ever factory-produced vehicles capable of reverse power flow. The experimental system would allow fleet operators to use their plug-in hybrids to supply electricity for a building during a power outage, reduce power usage when electric rates are high or even sell electricity back to their utility company.&lt;ref name=Chrysler&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1079368_chrysler-yanks-plug-in-hybrid-test-fleet-off-roads-will-replace-batteries|title=Chrysler Yanks Plug-In Hybrid Test Fleet Off Roads, Will Replace Batteries|first=John |last=Voelcker |publisher=Green Car Reports |date=2012-09-24|accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20120924/AUTO0101/209240429 |title=Chrysler halts tests on plug-in hybrid fleet after batteries overheat |first=Bryce G. |last=Hoffman |newspaper=The Detroit News |date=2012-09-24 |accessdate=2012-09-30 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company reported that the demonstration fleet had collectively accumulated 1.3 million miles (2.1 million km) before the vehicles were recalled.

====Remote Control, Software, Uconnect Entertainment System, 2015====
Charlie Miller, security researcher for Twitter and former NSA hacker, and Chris Valasek, director of vehicle security research at the consultancy [[IOActive]], showed how a Jeep Cherokee can be remote controlled. FCA recalled 1.4 Mio cars of various brand with the Uconnect entertainment system on board.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/ Hackers Remotely Kill a Jeep on the Highway—With Me in It], Andy Greenberg, Wired, 2015-07-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

It received a 5-star frontal crash test rating from the NHTSA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.safercar.gov/portal/site/safercar/menuitem.db847bd57e3dc1f885dfc38c35a67789/?vgnextoid=c95df2905bf54110VgnVCM1000002fd17898RCRD |title=2009 Dodge Ram 1500 Regular Cab |work=SaferCar.gov |accessdate=2009-07-19 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012005034/http://www.safercar.gov/portal/site/safercar/menuitem.db847bd57e3dc1f885dfc38c35a67789/?vgnextoid=c95df2905bf54110VgnVCM1000002fd17898RCRD |archivedate=2008-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; however under later testing methods it received an overall 3-star rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/5-Star+Safety+Ratings/2011-Newer+Vehicles/Vehicle-Detail?vehicleId=6592 |title=2012 Ram 1500 Regular PU/RC 4WD &amp;#124; Safercar - NHTSA |publisher=Safercar.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the side-pole test it was given a single star rating, because of excessive forces to the thoracic region. While the Ram 1500 features standard side-curtain airbags it does not include [[side torso airbag]]s. The vehicle was redesigned and retested, and received a 5-star rating.

The [[Ram Pickup (fifth generation)|fifth-generation Ram]] made its debut at the [[North American International Auto Show#2018|2018 North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] on January 15, 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.ramtrucks.com/2019/ram-1500.html | title=All-New 2019 Ram 1500 – More Space. More Storage. More Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; while its HD version made its debut at the same show on January 14, 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=20518&amp;mid=1|title=New 2019 Ram Heavy Duty is the Benchmark for Performance, Capability, Technology and Luxury|last=|first=|date=|website=FCA North America|archive-url=|archive-date=January 14, 2019|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2019 Ram 1500 will reach Ram Truck dealers in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2018 as an early 2019 [[model year]] vehicle. The starting manufacturer's suggested retail price will be $31,695 plus $1,645 destination fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=18753&amp;fIId=18914&amp;mid=70 | title=FCA US Media - Press Kit: 2019 Ram 1500:Ram Announces Pricing of All-new 2019 Ram 1500 Pickup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2019 Ram 1500 pickup truck will offer just seven trim levels, compared to the previous 11 different trim levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.pickuptrucks.com/2018/01/2019-ram-1500-gets-simplified-trim-lineup.html 2019 Ram 1500 Gets Simplified Trim Lineup]. ''pickuptrucks.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World markets==
As of 2016, Ram trucks are available in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Angola, Europe, and several Middle Eastern countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Find your country - Site Locator - Ram Trucks|url = http://www.ramtrucks.com/crossbrand/intl_site_locator/|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ram trucks officially sold in many Latin American countries are outfitted with [[World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations|UNECE WP.29]] lighting equipments, including the taillights with separate amber turn signal indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FOTOS - RAM 1500|url = http://www.ram.com.ar/images/full/02.jpg|url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160306060222/http://www.ram.com.ar/images/full/02.jpg|archivedate = 2016-03-06|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No right-hand-drive version has been built for the United Kingdom, South Africa, and other countries where the rule of road is on the left. In 2016, FCA via the Ateco(ASV) group commenced selling the Ram 2500 and 3500 in Australia and the Ram 1500 in 2018. These are [http://www.carsguide.com.au/car-reviews/2016-asv-ram-2500-laramie-review-first-drive-39681 converted] to right hand drive in Australia before sale. Pricing commences from $80,000AUD (approx US$54,000 as of 28/08/19) for the 1500.

Ram trucks are provided for the European market by the Swiss company AutoGlobal Trade in cooperation with FCA. Germany and Scandinavian countries are some of the largest European markets for the Ram. A thriving cottage industry in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom has imported and converted Ram trucks to right-hand-drive and to meet the local regulations, being more common in Australia since LHD cars less than 30 years old (or 15 years old if registered in Western Australia) cannot be legally driven on Australian public roads unless they are granted a diplomatic or a research and development exception to the rule. In the United Kingdom there is no such restriction, so a stock LHD Ram (or any other LHD vehicle) is not required to undergo the costly and time-consuming process of an RHD conversion in order to be compliant with EU regulations.

[[Dodge]], an [[United States|American]] [[automobile]] [[brand]], produced three separate vehicles with the name '''Dodge Charger Daytona''', all of which were modified [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Dodge Charger]]s. The name is taken from [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], which was an early center for auto racing and still hosts the [[Daytona 500]], one of [[NASCAR]]'s premier events. The first use of the Daytona name on a car was on a version of the [[Studebaker Lark]]. The Daytona was the performance model of the compact Lark and it was produced from 1963–1966. The Dodge Charger was made to beat the competition in NASCAR, Americas Premier Racing Series.

With the racing failure of the previous limited edition 1968 [[Dodge Charger 500]] in [[NASCAR]] and Plymouth's superstar [[Richard Petty]] leaving them for [[Ford]], the 1969 Dodge Charger Daytona was created. It was intended to be a high-performance, limited-edition version of the [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Dodge Charger]] produced in the summer of 1969 for the sole purpose of winning high-profile NASCAR races. It won its first race, the inaugural [[Good Sam Club 500|Talladega 500]], in the fall, although the top names had left the track on Saturday in a boycott of the race. [[Buddy Baker]], in the No. 88 Chrysler Engineering Dodge Charger Daytona, was the first driver in NASCAR history to break the {{convert|200|mph|0|abbr=on}} mark, on March 24, 1970, at Talladega. The 1969 Dodge Daytona won two races in 1969 and another four in 1970 for a total of six. Its successor, the 1970 [[Plymouth Superbird]], won eight races - all in 1970. Dodge Daytonas also won on the USAC and ARCA race circuits. They set numerous race and pole records.

One of the four famous [[Aero Warriors|aero-cars]], the Dodge Daytona had featured special body modifications that included a {{convert|23|in|mm|adj=mid|-tall|0}} stabilizer wing on the rear deck, a special sheet-metal "nose cone" that replaced the traditional upright front [[Grille (car)|grille]], a flush rear backlight (rear window area), a 'window cap' to cover the original Charger's recessed rear window, specific front [[Fender (vehicle)|fenders]] and [[Hood (car)|hood]] that were modeled after the upcoming 1970 Charger, [[stainless steel]] A-[[Pillar (car)|pillar]] covers and fender mounted cooling scoops. The Daytona was built on the 1969 Charger's R/T trim specifications, meaning that it carried a heavy-duty [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] and [[brake]] setup and was equipped with a [[Chrysler B engine#440|{{convert|440|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Magnum engine]] as standard. Of special note to collectors is the optional [[Chrysler Hemi engine|{{convert|426| CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Hemi]] [[V8 engine]], which only 70 of the 503 Daytonas carried. It had a corporate cousin in the "one year-only" 1970 [[Plymouth Superbird]] and with help of Chrysler's missile engineers, the Charger Daytona was born.

The "Winged Warriors", as they were affectionately known,{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} did not compete for long in NASCAR's top Cup series. On the next season of NASCAR, the executives ban aero specs on cars with engines bigger than 300 Cubic inches. Because of their exceptional speed and performance, NASCAR subsequently changed the rule book, effectively banning all four of the Aero Cars from Dodge, Ford, Mercury, and Plymouth from competition by the end of 1970. See also [[Plymouth Superbird]], [[Ford Torino Talladega]] and [[Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II]] for additional information about the aero cars.

The Dodge Daytona is now a very valuable collectible, with 440-powered Daytonas reaching into six-figure territory and 426 hemi-engined cars passing the $900,000.00 mark.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The "Super Charger IV EL", which looked like a roadster prototype spin-off of the Charger Daytona minus the roof and [[Spoiler (car)|spoiler]], is seen as a pimp-mobile in the 1974 film ''[[Truck Turner]]''. The car was actually a Charger show car, with a front end of a Daytona mounted onto it. Foot note: These 503 cars were actually Charger 500's as they rolled of the assembly line. Dodge shipped them to an offsite fabricator (not employees of Dodge), who transformed these by mounting the wing, supports in trunk and the front nose cone. Any report of these being made on the manufacturer assembly line is inaccurate.

==1975–1977==
For 1975–77, the Daytona name returned on the Charger, which by this time was a re-badged [[Chrysler Cordoba]].  The Daytona package of this era, was a 2-tone stripe-and-decal appearance package. A 400 c.i. big block engine could be ordered as the 318 was standard. In addition some models (very few) were equipped with a tachometer. All Daytonas came with torsion bar heavy duty suspension. And to compete against the Cordoba, they could be ordered with luxury appointments.  
Although this car was a product of the times, this was the true 1st daytona produced on the assembly line. The winged cars were actually charger 500's sent to a custom fabrication business called Creative Industries, for installation of the wing, supports and  the nose cone. Cars of this era are extremely rare as their numbers were very low and the automakers were buying cheap steel from overseas.  A Good number of these cars were junked due to rust issues.
These cars like their predecessor were slow to move off showroom floors. Not because of their appearance, but because of heavy, gas guzzling cars of the time. With gas prices increasing, America was looking for more economical cars.

The [[Dodge Charger (LX)|Dodge Charger]] was reintroduced for 2006 with a limited production '''Dodge Charger Daytona''' package that included a sportier interior, classic high impact exterior colors, a rear spoiler, a front chin spoiler, a blacked out grille surround, rear quarter panel striping reading "DAYTONA" on either side, a blackout vinyl between the taillights on the decklid, and a black vinyl on the hood with the word "HEMI" cut out twice. Heritage R/T badges replaced the Stock R/T's chrome badges. A performance suspension with load-leveling rear shocks was also standard, as well as unique wheels. 2006 wheels were the stock R/T 18" wheels with charcoal grey painted pockets, and lower profile wider tires. 2007 to 2009 wheels are 20" chrome clad wheels. In 2008, the rear quarter panel stripes were removed, and replaced with a strobe stripe on the lower portions of the doors that reads "DAYTONA" towards the front of the stripe. The hood decal was also modified. The 2006–2008 Daytona gains {{Convert|10|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} over the standard Charger R/T via a freer flowing exhaust system featuring a single pass center muffler, and a larger diameter stock air cleaner giving it 350&amp;nbsp;hp. The car also had unique engine management software that removed the stock R/T speed limiter.  The 2009 features the new Variable Camshaft Timing HEMI, producing {{Convert|368|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.  These are the First Daytona's to wear a badge listing the number it was produced out of total production numbers

The Stone White version is the car that wasn't supposed to be. Only at the end of production run,
due to slow sales, executives decided to make a very limited edition of the Daytona. With the house market collapse taking place people were losing everything as their home loans were more than their houses. The Economy was in the tank.  But even as this was happening Chrysler launched this car, and until 2017 release was the most expensive.

The 2013 Dodge Charger Daytona debuted at the 2012 Los Angeles International Auto Show as the re-introduction of the legendary Dodge Charger Daytona. Available in Charger R/T and Charger R/T Road &amp; Track trim levels, the 2013 Dodge Charger Daytona brought back the unique style of the historic Daytona package with all the modern performance and technology offered in the 2013 Charger line-up. Only 3,000 units of the Daytona were produced in this limited-production run.

"With its 370-horsepower HEMI V-8, rear-wheel drive and iconic design, the 2013 Dodge Charger is a modern-day muscle car, and the new Dodge Charger Daytona takes it to a new level by paying homage to the historic 'Daytona' nameplate," said Reid Bigland, President and CEO, Dodge Brand. "It starts with a legendary HEMI underfoot and one-of-a-kind interior and exterior styling enhancements that perfectly combine heritage, performance and value, starting under $33,000 MSRP."

Available in a unique color palette of Daytona Blue, Bright White, Billet Silver, Pitch Black, or purple the Daytona package featured special dark trim that built upon the Charger's iconic muscle car design. Satin Black adorned the front crosshair grille with heritage "R/T" badge, the custom vinyl hood graphic, roof wrap, rear R/T spoiler and the "DAYTONA" graphic on the rear quarter panels. It featured exclusive 20-inch five-spoke polished aluminum wheels with Gloss Black painted pockets.

Models also included a 'Daytona Blue' engine cover, performance 3.06 rear axle ratio, high-speed engine controller, paddle shifters with sport mode and performance steering and suspension.

The Dodge Charger Daytona's interior on the Road &amp; Track featured unique black performance Nappa leather and suede heated and ventilated seats with Daytona Blue stitching and piping. Similarly, the Daytona on the R/T offered the same appearance in a custom sport cloth seat. "DAYTONA" was embroidered in blue into the upper front seat backs. Unique dark brushed aluminum trim surrounded the 8.4-inch Uconnect Touch screen and gauges on the instrument panel, as well as the trim around the shifter and cup holders on the center console. Finishing touches included a Mopar bright pedal kit, a 552-watt 10-speaker Beats Audio System, and a special numbered "DAYTONA" badge on the instrument panel that featured the build number of that specific Dodge Charger Daytona model.

The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) was $32,990 for R/T and $36,495 for R/T Road &amp; Track Daytona models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netcarshow.com/dodge/2013-charger_daytona/|title=Dodge Charger Daytona|work=NetCarShow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new 2017 Dodge Charger Daytona and Daytona 392 was unveiled in August 2016. It features a choice of either a 5.7 Liter or 6.4 Liter V8. The Daytona and Daytona 392 trim will also include the upgrades from the Super Track Pack(Sport Suspension, Custom Brake linings, and Goodyear Eagle F1 Tires).

==In popular culture==
A Daytona appeared in the 2013 film ''[[Fast &amp; Furious 6]]'', driven by the character Dominic Torretto ([[Vin Diesel]]). In the film, it is said to have been an original 1969 model that had been modified into a pro touring super car, and is heavily damaged in the film's climax. The vehicles used in filming were actually standard model Chargers, modified to resemble the Daytona. To perform the driving stunts in the film, the cars were fitted with [[Chevrolet]] racing engines, most likely the 572 cid and Brembo racing brakes. 

The Daytona also appeared in the 2001 film ''[[Joe Dirt]]'', where it is driven by the titular character. The vehicle in the film is run down and damaged, sporting only one working light and with mismatched paint on its body. Joe Dirt accidentally damages it further by driving the car into a parking lot as a barrier is coming down, removing the vehicle's spoiler in the process.

A blue model appears in the music video for the 1996 [[Spice Girls]] single "[[Say You'll Be There]]".

A Daytona appears in the 2009 video game [[Left 4 Dead 2]]. The Daytona, driven by the fictional Jimmy Gibbs Jr., is taken by the survivors to drive to [[New Orleans]]. However, a blocked freeway seen at the start of Dark Carnival forces the survivors to ditch the car.

There have been several different production variants of Chargers, built on three different platforms and sizes. In the United States, the Charger nameplate has been used on [[Subcompact car|subcompact]] hatchbacks, [[Full-size car|full-size]] sedans, [[muscle car]]s, and [[Personal luxury car|personal luxury]] coupes. The current version is a four-door sedan.

==Charger models==
The three main iterations of Dodge Chargers were a [[mid-size]] [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|(B-body)]] two-door car (1966–78), a [[subcompact]] [[Dodge Charger (L-body)|(L-body)]] car (1983–87), and the [[Dodge Charger (LX)|(LX)]] [[full-size]] [[Automobile platform|platform]] four-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedans]] built since 2006.

The name was also carried by a [[Dodge Charger (1999 concept)|1999 concept car]] that differed substantially from the Charger eventually placed into production for the 2006 [[Model year#USA|model year]]. A similar name plate, the [[Dodge Ramcharger|Ramcharger]], was used for the truck-type vehicle.

The name Charger was also used in [[Brazil]] as a [[Performance car|performance model]] based on the [[Dodge Dart|Dart]] (A-Body) (1971–80).

==First generation: 1966–1967==

{{Main|Dodge Charger (B-body)#First generation}}
The Dodge Charger was introduced during the 1966 model year. It featured a two-door [[fastback]] body design and a four bucket seat interior. The intermediate-sized Charger shared components with the [[Dodge Coronet|Coronet]] that also used the [[Chrysler B platform]]. The base engine was a {{convert|318|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with a three speed manual. Larger and more powerful engines were also available. Sales were low.

==Second generation: 1968–1970==

[[File:1969 Dodge Charger (21572136732).jpg|thumb|1969 Dodge Charger]]
[[File:1970 Dodge Charger.jpg|thumb|left|1970 Dodge Charger]]
The Charger was redesigned for 1968, and an initial 35,000 units were slated for production. The demand was high and 96,100 Dodge Chargers were actually produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vehicle Profile: 1968 Dodge Charger |url= https://journal.classiccars.com/2013/07/01/1968-dodge-charger/ |website=The ClassicCars.com Journal |accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the [[Chrysler B platform]], the model years received various cosmetic changes to the exterior and interior including: an undivided grill, rounded tail lights, and hidden headlights. The powertrains were the same as the ones used in the 1967 Charger. The model was not successful in [[stock car]] racing such as [[NASCAR]]. A more aerodynamic shape formed the Charger 500 model that became the basis for the 1969 [[Dodge Charger Daytona]].

==Third generation: 1971–1974==

[[File:Dodge.383.magnum-black.front.view-sstvwf.JPG|thumb|left|1971 Dodge Charger]]
[[File:1973 Charger side.jpg|thumb|right|1973 Dodge Charger]]
The third generation Charger was introduced for the 1971 model year. Chrysler's B platform was modified to meet new emissions and safety regulations. Available in six different packages with cosmetic changes that include: a split grill, semi fastback rear window, and a ducktail spoiler. The 1973 and 1974 Chargers were very similar to the 1971 with minor differences in the grill and headlamps. The increase in sales was mostly due to the elimination of the Dodge Coronet, which meant Dodge offered the two-door intermediate-size body style only as the Charger.

==Fourth generation: 1975–1978==
{{Main|Dodge Charger (B-body)#Fourth generation}}
[[File:'75 Dodge Charger (Les chauds vendredis '11).JPG|thumb|1975 Dodge Charger]]
The 1975 model year Charger continued as a B body car and was restyled. The new Charger was Dodge's attempt at moving the model into the growing [[personal luxury car]] market segment.  Dodge expanded its presence in the personal luxury car market in 1978 when it produced two cars in the same class, the Charger and the [[Dodge Magnum]]. During the years this car was offered, a Daytona model was offered, featuring stripes that ran along the length of the car.

==Fifth generation: 1982–1987==
[[File:1987shelby.jpg|thumb|right|1987 Dodge Charger "Shelby Edition"]]
{{main|Dodge Charger (L-body)}}
The Charger returned in 1981½ as a subcompact hatchback coupe with [[Front-wheel drive|front-wheel-drive]], and a five-speed manual or three-speed automatic transmission. This economy-type model was similar to the [[Dodge Omni 024]], but with a slightly larger engine. The Charger was available with the [[Naturally aspirated engine|NA]] 2.2l [[SOHC]] or a turbocharged 2.2l SOHC engine.  The turbo was available only with the manual transmission, unlike in the Dodge Daytona. A Shelby Charger was offered starting in 1983, with a turbo version available in 1984 producing {{convert|148|hp}} at 5600&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|160|lbft}} of torque at 3200&amp;nbsp;rpm. The engine was not intercooled and used a small t3 Garrett turbo. In 1985, the electronics were updated but power output was the same. In 1986, the electronics were further updated.

[[File:'09-'10 Dodge Charger -- Rear.jpg|thumb|right|2009–2010 Dodge Charger]]
Dodge reintroduced the Charger in 2005 for the 2006 model year in a new form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.edmunds.com/dodge/charger/history/ |title=Dodge Charger History - Sixth Generation: 2006 to Present |publisher=Edmunds |accessdate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This generation was available only as a four-door sedan using the [[Chrysler LX platform]]  The design was intended to be reminiscent of the Chargers of the 1960s and 1970s and the taillights harkened back to that era, as did the new stamped hood and side panels.  This generation was available with a V6 and V8 engine options coupled to automatic transmissions, as well as all-wheel drive (AWD).

In its inaugural year, the Dodge Charger was available in SE, SXT, R/T, R/T with Road/Track Performance Group, Police, and Daytona R/T versions. The basic SE model included a 2.7 L V6 engine, 5-speed automatic transmission with "AutoStick" manual shifting feature, 17-inch wheels, air conditioning, all-speed traction control, as well as ABS and electronic stability control, a CD player, tilt and telescoping steering column, power locks/mirrors/windows, and remote keyless entry. Additional features and trims were available including the Charger R/T with a 5.7 L Hemi V8 mated to a 5-speed automatic transmission. A multiple-displacement system that allows it to save fuel by running on only four cylinders when cruising was also featured in the V8.

Performance was focus of the Charger SRT8 equipped with a 6.1 L Hemi engine mated to a 5-speed automatic, as well as conveniences such as an eight-way power front passenger seat, automatic climate control, special grille and rear spoiler, body-color interior trim, special front fascia and engine cover, larger exhaust tips, performance steering gear, heated front seats with perforated suede inserts, power-adjustable pedals, and special colors and exterior trim. Optional was a Road/Track package with 10 additional horsepower, GPS navigation system, 322-watt audio system, sunroof, and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system and radio

==Seventh generation (LD): 2011–present==
[[File:Dodge Charger SXT Plus 2014 (100th Anniversary).jpg|thumb|2014 Dodge Charger SXT Plus - 100th Anniversary Edition]]
{{Main|Dodge Charger (LX/LD)}}
The Dodge Charger received an improved interior and new exterior styling for 2011. This included new side scoops along both front and rear doors, as well as more angular headlights, aggressive new grille styling, and a more defined and aerodynamic shape overall. Most notably, the rear end adopted a more modern wrap around LED tail light spanning across nearly the entire length of the trunk. Driver visibility was improved by more than 15% addressing complaints from previous years. The side and rear styling cues are reminiscent of the 1968-1970 models.

Base performance was increased, with the 3.5L 250&amp;nbsp;bhp V6 engine being replaced with a [[Chrysler Pentastar engine#3.6L|Pentastar]] 3.6L producing 292&amp;nbsp;bhp (218&amp;nbsp;kW; 296 PS) at 6350 rpm and 260&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (353 N·m) at 4800 rpm. The 4-speed automatic transmission was replaced with the 5-speed A580 auto.&lt;ref name="36techSPECS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.media.chrysler.com/newsrelease.do?id=9735&amp;mid=261 |title=All-new 3.6-litre V-6 Technical Specifications |accessdate=August 29, 2010 |date=June 20, 2010 |work= |publisher=Chrysler LLC. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="36techSPECS2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.media.chrysler.com/dcxms/assets/specs/Pentastar_engine_spec.pdf |title=3.6-litre V-6 General Specifications |accessdate=February 15, 2011 |date=February 15, 2011 |publisher=Chrysler LLC. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708152126/http://www.media.chrysler.com/dcxms/assets/specs/Pentastar_engine_spec.pdf |archivedate=July 8, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SRT-8 was not produced for the 2011 model year.

The 2012 year brought a new 8-speed automatic transmission to the V-6 model. This year also saw the return of the SRT-8 to the model lineup. AWD was also added to the V6, making AWD available on all but the SRT-8 model. 
[[File:2015 Dodge Charger SRT 392 with Scat Pack.JPG|left|thumb|2015 facelift, front 1/4]]
For the 2012 – 2018 years, the Super Bee platform (Later called Scat Pack 15+) was available, making use of features seen in regular SRT-8 models with accessories and badges reminiscent of the 60s and 70s muscle car. These included a 6.4L engine with 470 HP, four piston Brembo calipers, slotted rotors, paddle shifters, SRT launch features (such as 0-60 timing, Live G-Force readings, and ¼ and ⅛ mile drag timers), custom seat embroidery, and more.

The 2017 model had an upgrade to the 8.4 nav/display system and was restyled due to issues with the previous system.

For 2015, the Charger received significant exterior styling updates. Most notably, the new front end which featured new [[LED]] lights and a more aerodynamic nose that was less angled and featured a noticeable curve around the headlight housing. Suspensions, interior, and brakes were also redesigned. 

All models, except for Charger Pursuit (through 2019), came standard with the eight-speed automatic transmission. In January 2014, the AWD Charger Pursuit appeared, and the V8 R/T AWD model disappeared.  Sales of the AWD Pursuit have since skyrocketed.

For 2020, the Charger Hellcat comes standard with the "widebody" to accommodate an improved tire/suspension package.  The 2020 Charger Pursuit is only available in the RWD V6 and AWD V8 models, with the RWD V8 model being discontinued. Both Pursuit models now feature the eight-speed automatics.

The '''Dodge Dart''' is a [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|transverse front-engine, front-wheel drive]], four-door compact [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] manufactured and marketed by [[FCA US LLC]], a subsidiary of [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]]. The automobile made its debut at the [[North American International Auto Show#2012|2012 North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]], Michigan. In some non-US markets, the Dodge Dart is sold as the '''Fiat Viaggio'''.

Resurrecting a nameplate used by Dodge for model years [[Dodge Dart|1960-1976]] for a succession of [[full-size]], [[mid-size car|mid-size]] and finally [[compact car|compact]] models, the Dart (PF) was the brand's first compact sedan since 2005, when the [[Dodge Neon|Neon]] was discontinued.

==History==
A [[mini MPV]] [[concept car]] was designed and developed by [[Chrysler]] and revealed in 2006 as the [[Dodge Hornet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hornet Now A Possibility For Chrysler |url=http://www.autotrends.org/2008/06/13/hornet-now-a-possibility-for-chrysler/ |first=Matt |last=Keegan |publisher=Auto Trends |date=June 13, 2008 |accessdate=2012-01-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211211906/http://www.autotrends.org/2008/06/13/hornet-now-a-possibility-for-chrysler/ |archive-date=11 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was Dodge's first attempt at building a car this small and the car was expected to be released in 2010. The concept was dropped because of the [[Late-2000s financial crisis|2009 financial crisis]] and the restructuring of the Chrysler Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2012 Dodge Hornet and the 2006 Dodge Hornet concept cars |url=http://www.allpar.com/cars/concepts/dodge/hornet.html |website=Allpar.com |accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Chrysler's merger with [[Fiat]] in late 2010, the small Dodge Hornet concept took on a new form to share a Fiat [[Automobile platform|platform]].&lt;ref name="LeftLane"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/future-chrysler-fiat-and-alfa-romeo-models-revealed.html |first=Drew |last=Johnson |title=Future Chrysler, Fiat and Alfa Romeo Models Revealed |publisher=LeftLaneNews |date=June 19, 2009 |accessdate=2012-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, the automaker announced the new small sedan would be called the Dodge Dart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wot.motortrend.com/no-hornet-2013-dodge-dart-is-dodges-new-small-ca-143147.html |first=Jake |last=Holmes |title=No Hornet: 2013 Dodge Dart is Dodge's New Compact Car|publisher=Motor Trend |date=December 6, 2011 |accessdate=2012-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20111121/BLOG06/111129987/1499 |first=Larry P. |last=Vellequette |title=Marchionne isn't one to name names |newspaper=Automotive News |date=November 12, 2011 |accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20111212/RETAIL03/312129970/1251 |title=Dart name: Valuable heritage -- or baggage? |first=Larry P. |last=Vellequette |newspaper=Automotive News |publisher=Crain Communications |date=December 12, 2011 |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 4, 2014, at the [[Geneva Motor Show#2014|Geneva Motor Show]], [[Sergio Marchionne]] commented on possible production of a hatchback model for the North American market, saying "our North American consumers will be gradually offered alternatives for same or close to expense" and that potential buyers might account for either [[Fiat 500X]], or [[Jeep Renegade (BU)|Jeep Renegade]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The dashboard features a {{convert|7|in|mm|0|adj=on}} color [[Thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display|TFT]] display, a “floating island bezel” placed between traditional round gauges, which graphically shows trip computer and navigation system information; it is integrated to make it appear to be part of the gauge cluster itself, rather than a separate screen.

==Models==

The Dodge Dart came in several different trim levels during its four-year production run, each model having its own distinct level of standard and optional equipment:

It offered the following standard equipment: 160-horsepower 2.0L [[Tigershark]] Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine, six-speed manual transmission, A/M-F/M stereo with single-disc CD/MP3 player with auxiliary and USB inputs, four-speaker audio system, heater (no air conditioning), power windows and door locks, cloth seating surfaces, dual manually-adjustable front bucket seats, split-folding rear bench seat, full instrumentation, fifteen-inch (15") black-painted steel wheels with plastic wheel covers, and black door handles and side mirrors. Additional options available for this model included a SE Popular Equipment Group that added equipment such as air conditioning, U Connect Bluetooth with streaming audio, [[SiriusXM]] Satellite Radio, a six-speaker audio system, keyless entry, and exterior color-keyed side mirrors. A six-speed automatic transmission was also available for this trim level. In mid-2016, the SE trim level of the Dodge Dart was discontinued.

SXT: The SXT was the "mid-level" trim level of the Dodge Dart between 2013 and 2016. It added the following equipment to the base SE trim level: sixteen-inch (16") aluminum-alloy wheels (2014 and newer models), U Connect Bluetooth with streaming audio, [[SiriusXM]] Satellite Radio, a six-speaker audio system (four-speaker audio system after mid-2016), air conditioning, keyless entry, and exterior color-keyed door handles and side mirrors.

==Engines==
[[File:Engine - 2013 Dodge Dart Rallye (8475492283).jpg|thumb|Dodge Dart Rallye]]
The Dart has three engine options: a [[Tigershark engine|Tigershark]] 16-valve 2-liter engine, a "Tigershark" 16-valve 2.4-liter [[MultiAir 2]] [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] engine, and a 16-valve 1.4-liter MultiAir Intercooled [[Turbocharger|turbo]] engine used also in Alfa Romeo Giulietta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/06/dodge-dart-a-familiar-name-returns-from-an-unlikely-place/ |first=Paul |last=Stenquist |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Dodge Dart: A Familiar Name Returns From an Unlikely Place |date=December 6, 2011 |accessdate=2011-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That engine has been retuned for American use (changing the required grade of oil to one widely available in the U.S. and Canada, for example) in the Fiat 500 Abarth&lt;ref name="dart-mouth"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dart-mouth.com/engines.html| title= Powering the hot 2013 Dodge Dart: Chrysler and Fiat engines |website=dart-mouth.com |accessdate=2012-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1.4T Dart also will have more torque than the Abarth. A 6-speed [[manual transmission]] is available with all engine options, a six-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] is optional on the 2.0 L and 2.4 L engines and a six-speed dual-clutch transmission is available on the 1.4 L turbo unit. Marchionne has stated that a 9-speed automatic will not be available until sometime later.&lt;ref name="autoblog.com"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/01/09/2013-dodge-dart-is-the-neon-of-the-future-w-video/ |title=2013 Dodge Dart is the Neon of the future |website=autoblog.com |accessdate=2012-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Dart engines are built in [[Dundee, Michigan|Dundee]], [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name="wsj20120908" /&gt;

In 2014, the Dart SXT and Limited both got a 2.4L I4 engine with increased horsepower ratings, making the 2.0L [[Tigershark]] I4 engine only available in the base SE model. The 2.4L I4 engine was offered in late 2013 with the introduction of the Dart GT model. The Dart Aero, Rallye, SXT and Limited models are the only models available with the 1.4L [[MultiAir]] [[turbocharged]] I4 engine.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Motorsports and SRT==
At the [[New York International Auto Show]] in 2012, a Dodge Dart turbo [[four-wheel drive]] [[rally car]] was shown. The blue-and-white [[Street and Racing Technology|SRT]]-badged car entered the [[2012 Global RallyCross Championship]], driven by four-time Rally America champion [[Travis Pastrana]] and his teammates.&lt;ref name="allpar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allpar.com/cars/dodge/dart/rally-car.html |title=600 Horsepower Dodge Dart Rally Car |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the 2013 Dodge Dart, it included a 2.0-liter, 4-cylinder, 16-valve turbo-charged engine rated at {{convert|600|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and over {{convert|550|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque, and Sadev 4-wheel drive transmission.&lt;ref name="Travis Pastrana"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.media.chrysler.com/newsrelease.do?id=12146&amp;mid=324 |title=Taking Passion for Performance to New Heights — Dodge Enters Global RallyCross With All-new Dodge Dart and Travis Pastrana |publisher=Chrysler |accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.allpar.com/cars/dodge/dart/rally-car.html |title=600 Horsepower Dodge Dart Rally Car |publisher=Allpar | accessdate=2012-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dart continued in the [[2013 Global RallyCross Championship]] season, but after Pastrana placed 10th in the driver's standings for both years, Dodge pulled out of the series and he joined [[Subaru Rally Team USA]] in 2014.

The Dart SRT 4 was originally planned for production starting in December 2016, based on the 2014 five-year plan of the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) group. But due to their decision to end production of the Dart, the SRT 4 version was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved from http://www.fcagroup.com/investorday/PresentationList/Dodge_Brand.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, the first television ad for the Dodge Dart aired during the broadcast of the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]], featuring the bassline from [[Kanye West]]'s "[[No Church in the Wild]]", a spoof on the [[Reliant Robin]] and a cameo by [[National Football League|NFL's]] [[Tom Brady]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NFL's Tom Brady appears in tonight's Dodge Dart TV ad - USA Today |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/driveon/post/2012/07/nfls-tom-brady-appears-in-tonights-dodge-dart-tv-ad/1#.UDVzj8FlSQt |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=July 10, 2012 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, the Dodge Dart was marketed as a tie-in to promote the film ''[[Fast &amp; Furious 6]]'', despite not appearing on the film. The car appears in Fast &amp; Furious 6 : The Game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20130523/RETAIL03/130529938/dodge-banks-on-fast-&amp;-furious-6-tie-in-to-rev-up-dart-sales |title=Dodge banks on Fast &amp; Furious 6 tie-in to rev up Dart sales |last=Shaya|first=Isabella |newspaper=Automotive News |date=May 13, 2013 |accessdate=2013-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discontinuation==
On January 27, 2016, Fiat Chrysler announced the end of Dodge Dart and [[Chrysler 200]] production to redirect its focus towards crossover vehicles. A plan to move production from its [[Belvidere Assembly Plant]] to Mexico was in the works but later scrapped.

The Dart ended production on September 2, 2016, with a revived [[Chrysler Neon|Dodge Neon]] based on the [[Fiat Tipo (2015)|Fiat Tipo]] replacing it in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/dodge-dart-and-chrysler-200-are-not-long-world The Dodge Dart and Chrysler 200 may be gone sooner than we thought] ''[[Autoweek]]'' (07/26/2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press conference at the 2017 [[North American International Auto Show|Detroit Auto Show]], FCA President Sergio Marchionne said: "I can tell you right now that both the Chrysler 200 and the Dodge Dart, as great products as they were, were the least financially rewarding enterprises that we've carried out inside FCA in the last eight years," adding "I don't know one investment that was as bad as these two were."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2017/01/09/why-chrysler-200-dodge-dart-were-discontinued/ "Marchionne says the Chrysler 200 and Dodge Dart were terrible investments for FCA"] from ''Autoblog'' (January 9, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sales of the Viaggio and Ottimo ended in September 2017 due to poor sales, recording only 1,623 Viaggio and 650 Ottimo cars sold during its ending year of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carsalesbase.com/china-car-sales-data/fiat/fiat-viaggio/ |title=Fiat Viaggio sales}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carsalesbase.com/china-car-sales-data/fiat/fiat-ottimo/ |title=Fiat Ottimo sales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
The 2013 Dodge Dart Aero was among the five finalists for the 2013 [[Green Car of the Year]] awarded by ''[[Green Car Journal]]'' at the 2012 [[Los Angeles Auto Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/11/29/ford-fusion-wins-2013-green-car-of-the-year/ |title=Ford Fusion wins 2013 Green Car Of The Year |first=Sebastian|last=Blanco |website=Autoblog.com |date=November 29, 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939 [[Dodge]] presented a completely new designed line of pickups and trucks. Formally the '''T series''' for 1939, '''V series''' for 1940, and the '''W series''' from 1941 through 1947, the trucks became mostly known as the '''Dodge Job-Rated''' trucks.&lt;br&gt;With streamlined, [[Art Deco style|Art Deco styled]] front sheetmetal, and introducing the concept of "Job-Rated" truck configurations, Dodge tried to offer customers the truck that fit the job they were buying it for.&lt;ref name=AllparRam&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allpar.com/model/ram/ram-history.html |title=History of the Dodge Pickup Trucks, 1921-1953 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Allpar |publisher= |access-date=2018-02-15 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a result, the 1939 to 1947 Dodge pickup / truck range was offered in a bewilderingly large number of available variants and model codes.

Six different payload classes, a wide range of bodies, and more than twenty different wheelbase-lengths were manufactured,{{refn |group=nb |In 1940 alone, 20 different truck frames were simultaneously produced in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20190408093818/https://www.autopaper.com/images/30896/photo/img5836_129889.jpg 1940 Dodge trucks brochure page (archived)]&lt;/ref&gt; }} and fitted with different sized versions of the [[Chrysler flathead engine#Straight-6|Chrysler-sourced inline six]]-cylinder side-valve engines — from the half-ton TC pickup on a 116-inch wheelbase to three-ton tractor cabs. Nevertheless, mechanically, the trucks were all very similar, with solid axles front and rear and leaf springs at all four corners. With World War II taking up most of production capacity from 1942 to 1945, the 1939 styling continued largely unchanged through 1947, as engineering and production became the main focus.

The Dodge trucks enjoyed some popularity before the war, and the last of them built in 1942, before Dodge turned to mostly military production, had progressed to the
W-series model name. When they resumed sales post-war, they continued as the 1946 Dodge W-series.&lt;ref name=HSW_46W&gt;[https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1946-dodge-wc-pickup.htm 1946 Dodge WC Pickup – howstuffworks]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historic author on Dodge trucks, Don Bunn, noted that the 1939 to 1947 Job-Rated trucks represent a very significant segment in Dodge history. They were the first to be mass-produced in the new, huge (Mound Road) [[Warren Truck Assembly|Warren truck plant]]. The Job-Rated trucks also formed the basis for Dodge's first light-duty military four-wheel drives, the 1940 half-ton [[Dodge VC series]], which in turn further developed into the world's first factory 4WD commercial pickups: the [[Dodge Power Wagon]]. And lastly, Dodge was the first of the Big Three U.S. auto manufacturers to offer a diesel powered truck — all the more exceptional, given that Chrysler engineered and built their heavy-duty diesel engines all in-house. Today, this series is the most popular pickups with Dodge truck collectors.&lt;ref name=BunnHistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pickuptrucks.com/html/history/segment5.html |title=Dodge Trucks History: Segment Five: 1939 to 1947 Job-Rated Pickups |last=Bunn |first=Don |year=2009 |website=PickupTruck.Com |publisher=[[Classified Ventures]] LLC |access-date=2019-08-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130221956/http://www.pickuptrucks.com/html/history/segment5.html |archive-date=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==General==
[[File:1939 Dodge Pickup (15908049624).jpg|thumb|File:1939 Dodge Pickup with wooden bed.]]
[[File:Dodge hood ornament (5184470506).jpg|thumb|Ram hood ornaments adorned every Dodge car and truck from 1932 to 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.allpar.com/corporate/bios/fairbanks.html Avard T. Fairbanks, designer of the Dodge Ram symbol and the Plymouth Flying Lady hood ornaments – Allpar]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
After Dodge joined forces with Graham Brothers trucks from 1925 onwards, Dodge and Graham trucks, marketed through Dodge's vast dealer network, were offered in various capacities, ranging from a half ton to three tons. In May of 1928 ''Power Wagon'' magazine already computed a ''"truly impressive"'' 1,842 possible configuration combinations, of available models, styles, payload ratings and other options.&lt;ref name=Dodgearch&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20190605150341/https://forums.aaca.org/topic/210257-my-1934-dodge-4x4-15-ton/ "The Graham Legacy: Graham-Paige To 1932" by M Keller. – Antique Automobile Club of America (archived)]&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1939, Dodge rolled out a striking, modern design, new from the ground up, except for the updated [[drivetrain]]s – and, as before, offering an exceptionally large number of available variants. In the later 1930s, streamlined styling had become a virtual requirement for anything from appliances, cars, boats, planes — even trucks, trains, and architecture.&lt;ref name=BunnHistory/&gt;  The new, 'Job-Rated' Dodge trucks followed suit, and were completely representative of the '[[Streamline_Moderne#Automobiles|''Streamline Moderne'']]', [[Art Deco]] based style, inspired by [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] design, and characterized by elongated horizontal lines and curving forms, to give the impression of sleekness and modernity.

The all new, all-steel cabs featured a front-end design with a barrel-shaped base, and a sharp V-shaped grille; long, sleek, crowned front and rear fenders, with embossed "speed lines" on the lower rears of each fender – and a new sloped, two-piece windshield, that could be opened for increased airflow. The headlamps were still free-standing, but were mounted in bullet-shaped pods. From the half-tons to the three-ton models, the new trucks all featured the same distinctive design – the heavy-duty models only stood out taller, on larger wheels and tires.&lt;ref name=BunnHistory/&gt; 

The unique styling of the trucks, was only really changed in 1940, when Dodge trucks began using sealed-beam headlamps and were equipped with marker lights mounted on the headlamp housing. For the most part, after 1940, year-to-year appearance changes were very minimal.&lt;ref name=Hemmings3947&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hemmings.com/magazine/hmn/2012/04/1939-1947-Dodge-Trucks/3710541.html |title=1939-1947 Dodge Trucks – Dodge's Job Rated haulers |last=McNessor |first=Mike |year=2012 |website=Hemmings Motor News |publisher= |access-date=2018-02-15 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grille design was lightly changed again in 1941, and this style continued through 1947, except for the lower chrome strips, which were omitted post war.&lt;ref name=BunnHistory/&gt;

The Job-Rated trucks had stronger frames than previous Dodge trucks, using steel with a higher tensile strength, and the frame-rails extended further forward past the engine than before, such that the truck's beefy, channel-type bumpers tied the rails together, reinforcing the frame. After World War II, several changes were made to production truck chassis parts, based on reliability experience gained during military service – for instance stronger differentials and larger axle shafts were used in post-war trucks, and steering boxes were beefed up as well.&lt;ref name=Hemmings3947/&gt;

===Model name codes===
Introduced as the '''T'''-Series for the 1939 model year, the line evolved into the '''V'''-series for 1940, and '''W'''-series for 1941, but the 'W' was retained until the end of sales in 1947. 

The bottom of the range TC, and its successors VC and WC, were {{frac|1|2}}-ton rated, on a {{convert|116|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase. As the second letter in the model code progressed in the alphabet, the payload rating typically also went up, however this was not implemented consistently. Although the TD-15, VD-15 and WD-15 were {{frac|3|4}}-ton rated, the TD-20 and -21 and its later VD and WD versions were one-tonners. The -15s and the -20s had a {{convert|120|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase, but the 1-ton could also be had with {{convert|133|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} (the TD-/VD-/WD-21). Second letter 'E' models only existed in the form of the 1939 TE versions. TF-, VF-, and WF-models were either 1-ton or {{frac|1|1|2}}-ton,&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Except for the 1940 {{frac|3|4}}-ton rated VF-27 through VF-29&lt;/ref&gt; ranging in wheelbase from {{convert|126|-|190|in|cm|0|abbr=on}}. Second letter G- and H-models were consistently {{frac|1|1|2}}-ton and 2-ton rated, respectively, ranging in wheelbase from {{convert|136|-|220|in|cm|0|abbr=on}}. The {{frac|2|1|2}}-ton rated J-models weren't introduced until the 1946 WJ-55 through WJ-59, ranging from {{convert|136|-|235|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} in wheelbase. The K-lettered models were consistently 3-ton rated, but the L-lettered models went against the naming pattern – they were only 2-ton rated. Both were offered in wheelbases ranging {{convert|152|-|205|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} through 1942. From 1946 instead there were 3-ton WK- and WR-models ranging in wheelbase from {{convert|136|-|196|in|cm|0|abbr=on}}.

==Drivetrain==
Dodge's Job-Rated trucks used flathead sixes, originally developed by Plymouth,&lt;ref name=AllparRam/&gt; throughout the 1939–1947 range. In the light half-ton trucks initially a 201.3 cu.in. engine was standard; with 70 Hp in 1939, but uprated to 79 Hp in 1940,&lt;ref name=HSW_DPW/&gt; and 82.5 Hp by 1941. The three-quarter and one-ton trucks used a 217.8 cu.in. engine from 1939 to 1941, rated at 77 Hp initially, then at 82 Hp, and at 85 Hp in 1941.

Starting in 1942 (just before civilian production ended), the 201.3 cu.in. engines were dropped from the range, and the {{1/2}}-ton light-duty models received the larger 218 cu.in. six, like the 3/4-ton pickups, going up to {{nobr|95 HP}} (gross) after the war, while the one-ton trucks got a larger 230.2 cu.in. (instead of the 218), with 102 horsepower, until the line-up was replaced in 1947.&lt;ref name=BunnHistory/&gt;
A three-speed manual was standard issue, while a four-speed with a compound first gear was an option.&lt;ref name=Hemmings3947/&gt;

The 1939–1947 TK- and TL- through WK- and WL-models were also available with a ''diesel'' engine – Dodge's own diesel engine – Dodge and [[Mack Trucks]] were the only two American automakers of the period before World War II, to have their own diesel engines.&lt;ref name=AllparRam/&gt; An additional 6-volt auxiliary generator debuted in 1941 on the diesel engines. The unit furnished power for lighting, instruments, and horns. Diesel sales were extremely limited however, counting as many as 75 units sold in 1939, 134 units in 1940, and 195 rigs in 1941.&lt;ref name=TT1675Diesel/&gt;

==Bodies and options==
Besides with the  "Express" pick-up bodywork, the Job-Rated trucks were available in cab/chassis, [[Cowling|cowl]]/chassis, or bare chassis (for third party custom body) versions. 

At the bottom of the range, Dodge offered the three now common pick-up classes ({{1/2}}-ton, {{3/4}}-ton and one-ton), as well as a 1{{1/2}}-ton pick-up. Dodge's half-ton pickups, on a {{convert|116|in|m|2|abbr=on}} wheelbase with a 7{{1/2}}-foot box, were changed to the 70 HP 201 cu.in. L-head straight-six. The 3/4- and 1-ton models kept the 75 HP 218 cubic inch L-head six, either on a {{convert|120|in|m|2|abbr=on}} wheelbase with a 7{{1/2}}-foot box, or a {{convert|133|in|m|2|abbr=on}} wheelbase with a 9-foot bed. Dodge's 1{{1/2}}-ton pick-up, offered from the Job-Rated trucks launch in 1939 until the 1942 switch to all-wartime production, consisted of the long-wheelbase one-ton model with 9-foot bed, but on bigger wheels and tires. 

Aside from as pickups, the lightest models in the range, the {{convert|116|in|m|2|abbr=on}} wheelbase TC/VC/WC half-tons, were also offered as a delivery truck, either with solid steel "panel" van body, or open canvas-covered canopy or screenside configuration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180620142727/https://www.ebay.com/itm/1939-Dodge-TC-half-ton-Owner-Manual-Pickup-Truck-Panel-Screenside-Canopy-Guide-/400174375663?_trksid=p2349526.m4383.l4275.c1 1939 Dodge TC half ton Owner Manual Pickup Truck Panel Screenside Canopy Guide – eBay (archived)]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, both the 1{{1/2}}-ton pickup, and the long one-ton pickup with the nine-foot bed were dropped.&lt;ref name=BunnHistory/&gt;
Post-war available equipment options included a larger clutch, four-speed transmission, oversize tires, electric driver's wiper, heater, chrome windshield frame, adjustable visor, driver's armrest, dome light, turn signals, "airfoam" seat with leather upholstery, and an AM radio.&lt;ref name=HSW_46W/&gt;

After Dodge supplied the U.S. Army with its first four-wheel drive truck in 1934, more modern {{frac|1|1|2}}-tonners were developed, and 1,700 RF-40-X-4(USA) trucks were supplied in 1938, and 292 TF-40-X-4(USA) in 1939.&lt;ref name=4WWC51BG&gt;[http://www.fourwheeler.com/features/1612-1943-dodge-wc-51-weapons-carrier-power-and-glory-backward-glances/ 1943 Dodge WC-51 Weapons Carrier, Power &amp; Glory – FourWheeler.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=T137Moparts24&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.t137.com/registry/help/partspages/SerialNumberGuide/slide024.html |title=Serial Number Guide – Dodge trucks for the U.S. government |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718092843/http://www.t137.com/registry/help/partspages/SerialNumberGuide/slide024.html |archive-date=2016-07-18 |url-status=live |website=T137.com |access-date=2018-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, Dodge gained an Army contract to design and build {{frac|1|2}}-ton 4×4 military trucks in several styles using many commercial truck parts. Based on the VC-Series, and internally called the T-202 series, the VC-1 through VC-6 came with essentially stock front-end sheetmetal. Similarly, their 116-inch wheelbase and 201-cubic-inch 79-horsepower six-cylinder engine shared much with Dodge's civilian {{frac|1|2}}-ton VC. The following year, the T202 was replaced by the T-207 series trucks. Again rated as {{frac|1|2}}-tonners, they featured a military-specific hood, grille, and fenders. These trucks were powered by the 218-cubic-inch six of 85 horsepower taken from Dodge's {{frac|3|4}}- and one-ton commercial models.&lt;ref name=HSW_DPW&gt;[https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1946-1968-dodge-power-wagon.htm 1946-1948 Dodge Power Wagon – HowStuffWorks]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the military trucks were substantially redesigned, and uprated to {{frac|3|4}}-tons with a 230-cubic-inch engine with 92 Hp. Together with the 1941 {{frac|1|2}}-tons, these were built from 1942 until the end of the war as the [[Dodge WC series]] military trucks.

===Stock models and specifications===
[[File:Dodge T-234 Maintenance Manual p. III (34x191; 34x192).jpg|thumb|Dodge T-234 Lend-Lease truck]]
The U.S. military also used some of Dodge's light truck models in mostly stock, two-wheel drive form. Technical manuals of U.S. Army military vehicles offer some more detailed specifications on three such models: the 1947 model year WC and WD-15 models, and the 160 inch wheelbase version of the [[List of U.S. military vehicles by supply catalog designation#G600 to G699|SNL G-number 618]] aka the WF-32.

Additionally there were 4x2, civilian based variants built either as Canadian "Modified Conventional Pattern" or "[[Canadian Military Pattern truck]]s", called the D15 (15cwt, or ¾-ton – engineering code T-222), and the D60S and D60L (60cwt, or 3-ton, engineering code T-110, with a ''short'' 136" or ''long'' 160" wheelbase).&lt;ref name=T137engines/&gt; The Canadian models were built with a {{convert|236.6|cuin|cm3|abbr=on}} engine with a 25" block, that was unique to them, and they had beefed up rear axles. Chrysler Corporation of Canada produced a total of 180,816 military Dodge trucks during 1939-1945.&lt;ref name=BCTarticle&gt;{{cite book |last=Vanderveen |first=Bart |year=1972 |title=Observer's Fighting Vehicle Directory, WW II |chapter-url=http://www.mapleleafup.net/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=81429&amp;stc=1&amp;thumb=1&amp;d=1461646637 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303115819/http://www.mapleleafup.net/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=81429&amp;stc=1&amp;thumb=1&amp;d=1461646637 |archivedate=2018-03-03 |url-status=live |location=London |publisher=[[Frederick Warne &amp; Co|F.

====Dodge T-234 "China / Burma" truck====
A special case in between stock commercial and dedicated military trucks, was the T-234 "China / Burma Road" truck, which was built as part of the Allied cooperation with China against Japan, in the war and just thereafter. From October 1944 through March 1946, Dodge built 15,000 trucks, that used a special order combination of their most heavy-duty off-the-shelf components, to overland supplies from India to China over the very rough [[Joseph Stilwell|Stilwell]] / [[Ledo Road]], to an extent to specifications personally drawn up by Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]], then commander of the Nationalist Chinese forces.&lt;ref name=AllparT234&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allpar.com/model/ram/burma-road-military-trucks.html |title=Dodge Military Trucks and the Burma Road in World War II |last=Redgap |first=Curtis |year=2010 |website=Allpar |publisher=[[Torstar#VerticalScope|VerticalScope Inc.]] |access-date=2018-05-19 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiang Kai-shek asked [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] himself for 15,000 two-and-a-half-ton trucks capable of handling the Burma Road, requiring them to have an engine of at least 300 cubic inches and a 5-speed transmission.&lt;ref name=AllparT234/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The trucks were built with a near standard civilian closed cab – right-hand drive because the British were in command of Burma – but fitted with a flat, military-style grille &amp; brush guard, and wide open, almost flat fenders, to avoid mud build-up clogging the wheels rotating,&lt;ref name=AllparT234/&gt; and otherwise stood out by having a 60-gallon fuel tank.&lt;ref name=IbiblioT234&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/ref/BurmaTruck/Burma-Maint.html |title=The Chrysler-Dodge Burma Truck |last=Clancey |first=Patrick |date= |website=Ibiblio.org |publisher=HyperWar foundation |access-date=2018-05-19 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order for the trucks to function on the gruelling 4,700 mile journey over the Himalayas, Dodge fitted not only heavy-duty springs and steering gear, but went sofar as to fit tri-metal ''aircraft grade'' bearings and aeroplane-type shock absorbers. Radiators were fitted with an overflow tank, to return the cooled water to the sealed cooling system. Ground clearance was {{convert|13|in|cm|0|abbr=on}}, with a 50° approach angle, and 28.5° departure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20190404120207/http://imageevent.com/vc40wc41/burmadogetrucks?p=2&amp;b=-1&amp;m=14&amp;c=2&amp;w=1&amp;s=1&amp;n=1&amp;l=0&amp;z=9 Specification sheet (archived)]&lt;/ref&gt; Front axles were widened to give wider tread. Nevertheless, the average life of the trucks was only about five trips.&lt;ref name=Mandalay&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://imageevent.com/vc40wc41/burmadogetrucks |title=On the Road to Mandalay |last=McShane |first=Sandy |magazine=Classic Truck |pages=66–69 |publisher=ImageEvent |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808004316/https://imageevent.com/vc40wc41/burmadogetrucks |archive-date=2018-08-08 |url-status=live |access-date=2019-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been commented that the front sheet metal design of the T-234 Burma Dodge shows remarkable resemblance to that of the post-war [[Dodge Power Wagon]]s, and may well have influenced it.&lt;ref name=Mandalay/&gt;

The '''Dodge WC series''' was a prolific range of light [[Four-wheel drive|4WD]] and medium [[Six-wheel drive|6WD]] [[Military light utility vehicle|military utility trucks]], produced by [[Dodge]] / [[Fargo Trucks|Fargo]] during [[World War II|World {{nobr|War II}}]].{{refn |group=nb| Although within the Chrysler Corporation, the ''Fargo'' Division handled government contracts,{{sfnp|ref=SRATAM4045|Summary Report – Tank-Automotive Materiel|1945|pages=19, 58, 64}} the trucks were all built at ''Dodge’s'' Mound Road, [[Warren Truck Assembly|Warren truck plant]] near Detroit, Michigan.&lt;ref name=HydeArsenal/&gt;&lt;ref name=Doyle2011p100/&gt;}} Together with the [[Willys MB|{{frac|1|4}}-ton jeeps]] produced by [[Willys]] and [[Ford]], the Dodge {{1/2}}-tons and {{3/4}}-tons made up nearly all of the [[Military light utility vehicle|light 4WD trucks]] supplied to the U.S. military in WWII – with Dodge contributing some 337,500 4WD units&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Including the 4,640 G-505 VC trucks of 1940&lt;/ref&gt; (about half as many as the jeep{{sfnp|ref=SRATAM4045|Summary Report – Tank-Automotive Materiel|1945|pages=19, 58, 64}}&lt;ref name=HydeArsenal/&gt;{{refn |group=nb| The Army at that time grouped motor transport vehicles into four weight classes — {{3/4}}-ton or one-ton and under were "light", 1{{1/2}}-tons were "medium", and above that were two groups of "heavies".&lt;ref name=HydeArsenal/&gt;&lt;ref name=ThomsonMayo&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomson |first=Harry C. |first2=Lida |last2=Mayo |year=2003 |title=The Ordnance Department: procurement and supply |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112055126327;view=1up;seq=294;size=125 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History|Center of Military History, U.S. Army]] (Originally published: 1960, Washington, D.C., Office of the Chief of Military History, Dept. of the Army) |page=269/270 |isbn= |ref=ODprocure }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}). Contrary to the versatility of the highly standardized jeep, which was mostly achieved through field modification, the Dodge WC{{nbh}}series came in many different, purpose-built, but mechanically uniform variants from the factory, much akin to the later family of [[Humvee|High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles]]. The WC series evolved out of, and was part of a more extended family of trucks, with great mechanical parts commonality, that included open- and closed-cab cargo trucks and weapons carriers, (radio) command cars, reconnaissance vehicles, ambulances, carryalls, panel vans, and telephone installation and mobile emergency / field workshop trucks.

From 1940 to 1942, almost 82,400  [[List of U.S. military vehicles by supply catalog designation#G500 to G599|'''G-505''']] '''{{1/2}}-ton 4x4 Dodge trucks''' were built — initially called the '''VC''' series, but the great majority (from 1941) in the '''WC''' series, and in more variants.&lt;ref name=OD_G505WC/&gt;{{sfnp |ref=SRATAM4045 |Summary Report – Tank-Automotive Materiel |1945 |pages=55–58}} However in 1942, the truck grew into the [[List of U.S. military vehicles by supply catalog designation#G500 to G599|'''G-502''']] '''{{3/4}}-ton 4x4 Truck (Dodge)''' and the [[List of U.S. military vehicles by supply catalog designation#G500 to G599|'''G-507''']] '''1{{1/2}}-ton 6x6 personnel and cargo truck (Dodge)''' — ''retaining'' the Dodge WC model code. Although the {{3/4}}-tons featured significant design improvements, they retained some 80% interchangeable components and service parts with the {{1/2}}-ton models.&lt;ref name=OD_G505WC/&gt;

Dodge was the U.S. Army's main supplier of {{1/2}}-ton trucks, and its ''sole'' supplier of both {{3/4}}-ton trucks and 1{{1/2}}-ton ''six-by-six'' trucks in World War&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;ref name=HydeArsenal/&gt; With over a quarter million units built through August 1945, the G502 {{3/4}}-tons were the most common variants in the WC{{nbh}}series.&lt;ref name=HydeArsenal/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After the war, Dodge developed the {{3/4}}-ton WC{{nbh}}series into the civilian 4x4 [[Dodge Power Wagon|Power Wagons]]; and in 1951, the WCs were replaced by the very similar {{3/4}}-ton 4x4 [[Dodge M37|Dodge M-series]] vehicles .

'''WC''' was not an abbreviation of "Weapons Carrier", but a Dodge ''model'' code – initially '''W''' for 1941, and '''C''' for half-ton rating. However, the 'WC' model code was ''retained'' for both the {{nobr|{{3/4}}-ton}} and {{nobr|1{{1/2}}-ton}} 6x6 Dodges – as well as for the subsequent model years.&lt;ref name=OD_G505WC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftp.olive-drab.com/idphoto/id_photos_dodge_g505_wc.php |title=Truck, 1/2 ton, 4x4, Dodge WC (G505) |publisher=Olive-drab.com |date= |accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
All in all, not counting mechanically related variants, the WC series alone involved 52 model versions (thirty {{1/2}}{{nbh}}ton 4x4, eight {{1/2}}{{nbh}}ton 4x2, twelve {{3/4}}{{nbh}}ton 4x4, and two 1{{1/2}}{{nbh}}ton 6x6 models).

Dodge had been the United States military's primary supplier of light wheeled vehicles, since before the U.S. joined the First World War.&lt;ref name=4WWC51BG/&gt; After starting business in 1900, producing precision engine and chassis components for other car builders in Detroit – Ford and [[Oldsmobile]] chief among these – Dodge introduced their first car, the Model 30/35 tourer, in 1914. It was stronger and more high quality than the ubiquitous [[Ford Model T|Ford {{nobr|Model T}}]], and in 1916, Dodge cars proved their durability, both in the 1910s [[Border War (1910–19)|U.S. Mexico Border War]] — the U.S. military’s first operation to use truck convoys,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mexican Revolution 1910–20 |first=Philip |last=Jowett |first2=Alejandro |last2=de Quesada |publisher=Osprey |page=25 |isbn=978-1-84176-989-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in World War I, when some 12,800 Dodge cars and light trucks were used,&lt;ref name=4WWC51BG/&gt; primarily as ambulances and repair trucks.,&lt;ref name=Dodge100/&gt; but also as staff and reconnaissance vehicles. All the while, Dodge maintained its reputation for high quality truck, transmission, and motor parts they made for other successful manufacturers.

Dodge light trucks were initially based largely on their passenger cars, but later specific truck chassis and bodies were designed. Light- and medium-duty models were offered first, then a heavy-duty range was added during the 1930s and 1940s. Dodge developed its first [[four-wheel drive]] truck in 1934 — an experimental 1{{1/2}} ton for the U.S. Army, designated K-39-X-4(USA), of which 796 units were built in several configurations.&lt;ref name=4WWC51BG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fourwheeler.com/features/1612-1943-dodge-wc-51-weapons-carrier-power-and-glory-backward-glances/ |title=1943 Dodge {{nobr|WC-51}} Weapons Carrier, Power &amp; Glory: Backward Glances |last=Allen |first=Jim |date=7 December 2016 |website=FourWheeler.com |publisher=Extreme Ventures, LLC |access-date=2018-02-24 |authorlink=Jim Allen (4x4 writer)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=T137Moparts24&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.t137.com/registry/help/partspages/SerialNumberGuide/slide024.html |title=Serial Number Guide – Dodge Trucks Built for the U.S. Government |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718092843/http://www.t137.com/registry/help/partspages/SerialNumberGuide/slide024.html |archive-date=2016-07-18 |url-status=live |website=T137.com |access-date=2018-02-15 |quote=scanned images of parts books pages showing serial numbers, engine numbers, and other information from factory MoPar parts books covering Dodge and Fargo trucks manufactured from 1939–1977 |ref=T137serials}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Timken Company|Timken]] supplied driven front axles and transfer-cases, which were added to a militarized commercial truck.

However, Dodge also eagerly pursued military contracts for half-ton four-by-fours at the same time. The smaller size had outperformed the 1{{1/2}}-ton 4x4 during testing in 1938,&lt;ref name=DoyleG506&gt;{{cite book |last=Doyle |first=David |year=2019 |title=Chevrolet G-506 – 1{{1/2}}-ton 4x4 Development, Production and Variants in WW2 |url=https://cdn3.volusion.com/hrqpw.cruld/v/vspfiles/photos/620-1000-5.jpg |archivedate=2019-04-08 |url-status=live |publisher=Portrayal Press |page=8 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190408104402/https://cdn3.volusion.com/hrqpw.cruld/v/vspfiles/photos/620-1000-5.jpg |location=Branchville, NJ |isbn=9780938242062 |author-link=David Doyle (writer) }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dodge had invested greatly in half- to one-ton trucks in prior years. In 1936, Dodge's light, car-based trucks had been crucially redesigned — dropping the old car frames and for the first time using modern, truck-style chassis, with side rails ''welded'' to the cross members on their half-ton to one-ton rated trucks.&lt;ref name=AllparRam/&gt; Additionally, Dodge had built the all new, very large [[Warren Truck Assembly]] plant in Michigan for its light and medium trucks, opened in 1938. In 1939 again, Dodge presented a completely redesigned line of pickups and trucks. The modern looking, "Job-Rated" trucks aimed to fit every job.&lt;ref name=AllparRam&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allpar.com/model/ram/ram-history.html |title=History of the Dodge Pickup Trucks, 1921–1953 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Allpar |publisher= |access-date=2018-02-15 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Well before the onset of World War II, it was clear that the USA needed to update its military. The [[Quartermaster Corps]] (Q.C.), responsible at the time for providing the military with non-combat vehicles, moved to standardize truck designs, and by 1939, as the war in Europe exploded, the Army had settled on five payload-based general-purpose truck classes: {{nobr|{{1/2}}-ton}}, {{nobr|1{{1/2}}-ton}}, {{frac|2|1|2}}-, 4- and {{nobr|{{frac|7|1|2}}-ton}}.{{sfnp|ref=HydeArsfn|Hyde|2013|loc=[https://books.google.nl/books?id=P-PCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA148 page 147–148]}} By June 1940 the Q.C. had tested and approved its first three standard commercial based, all-wheel drive trucks: the ''{{nobr|1{{1/2}}-ton}} 4x4 Dodge'', the [[GMC CCKW 2½-ton 6x6 truck|GMC {{nobr|{{frac|2|1|2}}-ton}} 6x6]] and a [[Mack NM 6-ton 6x6 truck|Mack {{nobr|6-ton}} 6x6]].{{sfnp|ref=ODprocure|Thomson &amp; Mayo|2003|loc=[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112055126327;view=1up;seq=295;size=125 page 271]}} With regards to Dodge however, the U.S. military reconsidered its preferences for the build-up for the war almost immediately after this. 

Whereas in 1936, a [[Marmon-Herrington]] converted ''Ford'' had become the Army's first half-ton 4-wheel drive,&lt;ref name=RealJeep&gt;[http://www.offroaders.com/tech/jeep/Real-Jeep.htm Will The Real Jeep Please Stand Up – Offroaders.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Army had initially standardized ''Dodge's'' {{nobr|1{{1/2}}-ton}} 4x4 truck — following Dodge's push for building {{1/2}}-tonners, after mid 1940 it was decided they preferred ''Dodge'' to build ''light-duty'' four-wheel drives, contracting for a series of ''half-ton'' trucks,&lt;ref name=DonBunn/&gt; while GM / Chevrolet was instead going to become the standard supplier for {{nobr|1{{1/2}}-ton}} trucks.&lt;ref name=HydeArsenal/&gt; So, when in the summer of 1940 the largest government truck contract awarded went to Chrysler's Dodge / Fargo Division, for more than 14,000 (mostly) 4x4 trucks,{{sfnp|ref=ODprocure|Thomson &amp; Mayo|2003|loc=[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112055126327;view=1up;seq=298;size=125 page 274]}} this was in the midst of the transition, and thus included both orders for {{1/2}}-ton and 1{{1/2}}-ton trucks, as GM / Chevy still needed to tool up for the 1{{1/2}}-tonners.

Dodge had started developing designs for a 4x4 half-ton in 1939, and began production in earnest in 1940 — both 4x4 half-tons, as well as 1{{1/2}}-ton 4x4 and 4x2 trucks. On all 1940 trucks, front sheetmetal was mostly identical to the commercial VC and VF models of that year, with the addition of a big brush guard mounted in front of the grille and headlights. Except for the addition of 4-wheel drive, and custom bodies on the {{1/2}}-ton command cars, the trucks followed the 1939 procurement doctrine, to ''"use commercial trucks with only a few modifications such as brush guards and towing pintles to fit them for military use."'' &lt;ref name=ThomsonMayo/&gt;

The first of the {{1/2}}-ton, 4x4, '''VC''' series military trucks were based on Dodge's 1939 civilian, one-ton rated [[Dodge T-, V-, W-Series|model ''TC''-series]].  The military VC models retained the civilian engine and wheelbase, but gained four-wheel drive, and a new internal technical code: T-202. Manufacturing of the Dodge VC models (SNL number G-505) began in 1940, making these the Army's first standard production half-ton 4WD trucks. The soldiers also called the light command reconnaissance vehicles ''"jeeps"'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dog-walker.us/4x4/4x4-204.htm |title=Pages of Interest to 4x4ers: 4x4 History – Where It All Began |publisher=Dog-walker.us |accessdate=2013-06-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211151427/http://www.dog-walker.us/4x4/4x4-204.htm |archivedate=11 February 2014 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; — before that term migrated to the quarter-tons, starting in 1941.&lt;ref name=Jeeps4145&gt;{{cite book |last=Zaloga |first=Steven J. |authorlink=Steven Zaloga |year=2011 |title=Jeeps 1941–45 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H6iHCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17&amp;lpg=PT17&amp;dq=jeep+new-recruit |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |page= |isbn=9781780961477 |accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JeepOffroad&gt;{{cite book |last=Morr |first=Tom |first2=Ken |last2=Brubaker |title=Jeep Off-Road |year=2007 |publisher=MotorBooks International |isbn=9781610590563 |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=QKrYGfVMUdMC&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=11 |accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A total of 4,640 VC models were built across six variants – mostly pick-ups and reconnaissance cars. These 1/2-ton VC trucks proved successful, but were immediately further developed and succeeded by the G-505, 1/2-ton ''WC'' models in 1941. Although obsolete, the VC trucks remained in use until the end of the war.&lt;ref name=ODg505VC&gt;[http://ftp.olive-drab.com/idphoto/id_photos_dodge_g505_vc.php Truck, 1/2 ton, 4x4, Dodge VC (G505) – Olive Drab]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, Dodge also built 6,472 four-wheel drive 1{{1/2}}-ton trucks, under two U.S. contracts – one awarded to Dodge, and one to Fargo.&lt;ref name=DoyleG506/&gt;{{sfnp |ref=SRATAM4045 |Summary Report – Tank-Automotive Materiel |1945 |pages=66–69}}{{refn |group=nb|Chrysler Corp.

Production consisted of just over 6,000 closed cab, open bed cargo trucks, plus just under 400 dump-trucks. 

Like on the {{1/2}}-ton VC-series, the 1940 VF-400 1{{1/2}}-ton models simply used civilian front sheet-metal, based on the 1939 commercial model {{nobr|TE-30 cab}}, with a brush-guard fitted in front of the grille and headlights — but with a Dodge developed front driving axle, directional, cross-country tires, and a military cargo body.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20190824125442/http://photos.imageevent.com/dad2nick/1940dodgevf404/13094157_881058075355645_6435693933442836516_n.jpg 1940 Dodge VF-401 Cargo Trucks (archived)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Importantly, one thousand of the VF-400 series cargo trucks were equipped with a [[power take-off]], gear-driven [[Paccar#Divisions|Braden]] model MU {{convert|10,000|lb|kg|-2|abbr=on}} capacity winch — a feature that was carried over on many of the subsequent {{nobr|{{1/2}}-ton}} and {{nobr|1{{1/2}}-ton}} WC series models, directly from 1941. And although the light-duty WC models that followed, did ''not'' receive the VF-400's two-speed transfer cases, these ''did'' return on the {{nobr|1{{1/2}}-ton}} {{nobr|WC-62}} and {{nobr|WC-63}}. An  ambulance model, {{nobr|VF-407}}, was also designed, but only three units were built, likely experimental.{{sfnp|ref=SNL_G657|SNL G-657 Master Parts List|1943|p=XX–XXII}}&lt;ref name=WW2industry&gt;[http://usautoindustryworldwartwo.com/Chrysler/dodge-trucks.htm Dodge Trucks – US auto industry in WW II]&lt;/ref&gt; 

These proved to be the last of Dodge's 1{{1/2}}-ton 4x4 trucks for the war. Although the Army had steadily taken the bulk of its trucks in this category from Dodge / Fargo up til then, further production of 1{{1/2}}-ton 4x4 trucks was instead awarded to GM's [[Chevrolet G506]], which became the standard in this segment for the rest of the war.&lt;ref name=DoyleG506/&gt;

Aside from four-wheel drive trucks, production started for a militarized commercial 1{{1/2}}-ton, rear-wheel drive truck in 1940 — initially Dodge's model VF-31, cargo (engineering code T-98) under the government SNL number '''G-618'''. The 4x2 model ''VF''-31 was succeeded by the model ''WF''-31 (internally T-118) for 1941 (closed cab tractor) and 1942 (cab and chassis) – both on a {{convert|135|in|m|2|abbr=on}} wheelbase – and the 1942 model WF-''32'', closed cab, stake and platform cargo truck, on a ''{{convert|160|in|m|2|abbr=on}}'' wheelbase.&lt;ref name=OPSI_SNL/&gt;{{sfnp|ref=SNL_G657|SNL G-657 Master Parts List|1943|p=XX–XXII}} After a modest production of 516 units of the WF-31,&lt;ref name=WW2industry/&gt; at least 9,500 Dodge WF-32 trucks were built, mostly for [[lend-lease]] to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.retrotruck.ru/museum/legend-lend-lease/Dodge-WF32/ Dodge WF32.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180827151349/http://www.1jma.dk/articles/1jmaarticlelendlease.htm Lend Lease trucks in Russia (archived)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.o5m6.de/redarmy/dodge_wf32.php Dodge WF-32 – Engines of the Red Army in WW2]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1941–1942 — {{1/2}}-ton WC series===
[[File:Dodge halve ton WC4 Weapons Carrier, W-28572.JPG|thumb|260px|World War II soldiers called the {{1/2}}-ton 1940/1941 Dodge Reconnaissance / Weapon Carriers a "Jeep" before the Willys MB.&lt;ref name=Jeeps4145/&gt;&lt;ref name=JeepOffroad/&gt;]]
The 1940 VC-series Dodge 1/2-ton 4x4s were well liked but considered only an interim solution, because they were essentially a modified civilian truck. At the outset of World War&amp;nbsp;II a more military design was laid out.&lt;ref name=4WWC51BG/&gt; Dodge replaced the 1940 {{nobr|VC-1}} to {{nobr|VC-6}} with the equally half-ton rated '''WC''' series of military light trucks, produced in 38 model variants, of which 30 were four-wheel driven, in varying amounts — thousands of some models were produced, while only a few of some others were made. Where the military {{nobr|VC-series}} still used much civilian sheet-metal, distinguished by a brush-guard in front of the grille — the WC{{nbh}}series came with wide-open, almost flat fenders that prevented mud build-up, clogging rotation of the wheels — as well as a redesigned, sloping nose with an integrated, round, grated grille / brush-guard. A new ambulance with a fully enclosed, all-steel box rear body was designed, on a longer, 123 inch wheelbase; and PTO-driven winches were now fitted to some models.

The {{1/2}}{{nbh}}ton WC models were the first all-military design Dodge developed in the build-up to full mobilization for World {{nobr|War II}},&lt;ref name=OD_G505WC/&gt; and they were the U.S. Army's first standard light truck – prior to the jeep – when the U.S. formally declared war in December 1941.&lt;ref name=4WWC51BG/&gt;

Both the Dodge half-ton '''VC''' and '''WC''' trucks were part of the Army '''G-505''' series. Some 77,750 four-wheel drive {{1/2}}{{nbh}}ton WC numbered trucks were produced during late 1940 to 1942 under War Department contracts.{{sfnp|ref=SNL_G657|SNL G-657 Master Parts List|1943|p=XX–XXII}}{{sfnp|ref=SRATAM4045|Summary Report – Tank-Automotive Materiel|1945|pages=55–58}}&lt;ref name=WC12no group=nb/&gt; Additionally, aside from the fully military 4WD models, a small total of 1,542 two-wheel drive units retaining civilian sheet-metal were also supplied to the U.S. military, bearing WC model numbers in this same range. These models carried the SNL-code '''G-613''', and brought the total number of half-ton WC{{nbh}}series up to some 79,300 units, and the grand total of all half-tonners (VC and WC; 4WD and 2WD) to almost 84,000.

===1942–1945 — {{3/4}}-ton and 1{{1/2}}-ton WC series===

In 1940 the Army revised its range of standard, payload-based, general-purpose truck classes: a {{nobr|{{frac|1|4}}-ton}} chassis requirement was added; the {{nobr|{{1/2}}-ton}} was to be replaced by a {{nobr|{{3/4}}-ton}}, and additional heavy categories were specified.{{sfnp|ref=HydeArsfn|Hyde|2013|loc=[https://books.google.nl/books?id=P-PCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA148 page 147–148]}} The Quartermaster General wanted to start direct negotiations with Dodge, GM and Mack for certain models immediately, but not until after February 1941 could the Quartermaster Corps choose manufacturers directly, based on their engineering and production capabilities.{{sfnp|ref=HydeArsfn|Hyde|2013|loc=[https://books.google.nl/books?id=P-PCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA148 page 147–148]}} One deciding factor had to do with availability of certain critical components, like transfer cases and especially [[constant-velocity joint]]s, not used much on commercial trucks, but all-wheel drive vehicles all needed these; plus additionally, they would use two or three times the amount of driven axles, meaning more gears to cut for all the differentials. Produced up to the war by a few specialized firms with limited capacity, from spring 1942 Ford, Dodge and Chevrolet joined in fabricating these in mass quantity,{{sfnp|ref=ODprocure|Thomson &amp; Mayo|2003|loc=[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112055126327;view=1up;seq=298;size=125 page 274]}} with Dodge's experience in making quality, precision parts dating back from the earliest beginnings of the company.

While very successful, the {{1/2}}-ton WC trucks had to be supplanted by {{3/4}}-ton trucks. In late 1941, Dodge introduced a redesigned WC{{nbh}}series 4×4 trucks uprated to {{3/4}}-ton and their SNL code changed to '''G-502'''. The {{3/4}}-ton featured a lower profile truck bed that could seat eight troops, plus under seat stowage compartments; while service-parts remained 80 percent interchangeable with the existing {{1/2}}-ton series.&lt;ref name=4WWC51BG/&gt; Maintaining 80% service parts interchangeability with the {{1/2}}-ton models was of great value. The {{3/4}}-ton models could swiftly be deployed, and the {{1/2}}-ton, G-505 WC{{nbh}}trucks remained in use to the end of World War II.&lt;ref name=OD_G505WC/&gt;

Throughout the war, Dodge was the U.S. Army's sole producer of {{3/4}}-ton trucks, and built a total of 255,193 of these across all variants from April 1942 to August 1945.&lt;ref name=HydeArsenal&gt;{{cite book |last=Hyde |first=Charles K. |year=2013 |title=Arsenal of Democracy: The American Automobile Industry in World {{nobr|War II}} |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=P-PCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152 |location= |publisher=Wayne State University Press |pages=152–153 |isbn=9780814339527 |author-link= |ref=HydeArsfn }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite sign |title=Chrysler's contribution to the war effort during WWII |year=2010 |type=Museum wall plaque |publisher=[[Walter P.

Standard vehicles in the {{3/4}}-ton 4×4 class were the {{nobr|WC-51}} / {{nobr|WC-52}} Weapons Carrier, {{nobr|WC-56}} {{nobr|/-57}} {{nobr|/-58}} (Radio) Command Reconnaissance, {{nobr|WC-53}} Carry{{nbh}}all, and the {{nobr|WC-54}} Ambulance. In the cargo/troop and command trucks, the {{nobr|WC-52}} and {{nobr|WC-57}} are identical to the {{nobr|WC-51}} and {{nobr|WC-56}}, but with a longer frame, extending to carry the protruding front bumper with front-mounted winch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftp.olive-drab.com/od_mvg_www_dodge.php |title=Dodge Military Trucks |publisher=Olive-drab.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{3/4}}-ton 4x4 WC truck was also stretched into a 1{{1/2}}{{nbh}}ton 6x6 troops and weapons carrier for larger 12-troop rifle squads (the '''G-507''').

In the case of vehicle identifications separated by a slash, the first number refers to a vehicle without winch, and the second to a vehicle fitted with a winch, typically resulting in a {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} longer front overhang, and significantly reduced approach angle. Not only were the winches driven by a [[power take-off]] from the engine,&lt;ref name=TM9_808Dodge/&gt; but unlike the later [[Dodge M37|Dodge M-series]] trucks, on which an extension was bolted to the frame when mounting a winch – on the WC{{nbh}}series the winch equipped versions actually had a different frame.{{sfnp|ref=SNL_G657|SNL G-657 Master Parts List|1943|p=296}}&lt;ref name=Doyle2011p56&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=Ljdma-SYU0gC&amp;pg=PA56 Doyle, 2011: Standard Catalog of U.S. Military Vehicles – 2nd Edition, pg. 56]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 1{{1/2}}-ton rated VF-400 series trucks, the PTO-driven winch had a 10,000 pound capacity, but added almost 1000 pounds to the vehicles weight, reducing the payload to 2400 pounds.&lt;ref name=VF400page/&gt;

The 1940 Dodge / Fargo VC models formed the first production run in the U.S. military's G-505 range of four-wheel drive, half-ton, light military trucks. Created based on Chrysler's civilian one-ton rated range of light trucks and carry-all,&lt;ref name=ODg505VC/&gt; the VC models formed the foundation for the subsequent WC series.

All variants used the same {{convert|116|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase as the commercial trucks, but with the addition of four-wheel drive. Bodywork and sheet metal on the pick-ups and carryall were largely copied from the civilian models — however, for the reconnaissance and radio cars, a dedicated open four seater body was created. Also the same {{convert|201.3|cuin|l|1|abbr=on}} inline six, flathead engine was used, but horsepower was raised from a 70 HP civilian rating in 1939 &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20190407083218/https://www.autopaper.com/1939-dodge-half-three-quarter-one-ton-trucks-tc-td-series-specs-sale-brochure.php 1939 Dodge Half Three Quarter One Ton Trucks TC &amp; TD Series Specs Sale Brochure (archived)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20190407083243/https://www.autopaper.com/images/15382/photo/img7644_47038.jpg 1939 Dodge Trucks brochure specifications (archived)]&lt;/ref&gt; to 79 HP at 3000 rpm in the G-505.&lt;ref name=Doyle2_44/&gt;&lt;ref name=ODg505VC/&gt; The transmission had 4 speeds and the transfer case had one.

T-207 range units initially received only front axles with [[Constant-velocity joint#Weiss joints|Bendix-Weiss]] constant-velocity joints, whereas T-211 and T-215 models were either given front axles made by [[Bendix Corporation#Automotive|Bendix]] or with [[Alfred H. Rzeppa|Rzeppa design]] [[Constant-velocity joint#Rzeppa joints|CV joints]], made by Ford. Additionally, from the T-211 onwards, the rear brakes were 14-inch instead of 11-inch drums,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vintagepowerwagons.com/vehicle-type-a-half-ton-ww2-wc Dodge WWII WC 1/2 Ton 4x4 Information &amp; Parts – Vintage Power Wagons]&lt;/ref&gt; and on the T-215 a military instead of a civilian design dash panel, with round instead of square gauges was introduced.&lt;ref name=OD_G505WC/&gt; Among the T-211 range versions, no single WC model number was explicitly used for any winch equipped units.

Aside from the above, another 1,542 rear-wheel drive units (engineering code T-112) were built ({{nobr|WC-36}} through {{nobr|WC-39}}, and {{nobr|WC-47}} through {{nobr|WC-50}} — mostly carry-alls and pick-ups), that retained civilian bodywork and front axles (one-ton on-road rating).

==Descriptions — Three-quarter-ton models==

In 1942, the Dodge WC range was significantly revised. All four wheeled models were uprated to a nominal three-quarter ton payload rating, and in 1943 a 1{{1/2}}-ton six-wheel drive variant was derived (see appropriate section). All models were widened to a {{convert|64+3/4|in|cm|abbr=on}} front and rear track, while at the same time the bulk of production (pick-up / weapons carrier and radio / command reconnaissance) models were significantly shortened, from a {{convert|116|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} to a {{convert|98|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase, giving the vehicles much more squat proportions. Ambulances, carry-alls, and telephone installation / emergency repair trucks received a wheelbase reduction of only {{convert|2|in|cm|0|abbr=off}}. Panel vans were dropped from the range and no longer made.

The volume production pick-up / weapons carrier models received a redesigned rear bed, seating troops on top of the rear wheels, instead of between them, further widening these models to 6&amp;nbsp;ft 11 in / 2.11 meters. A single such unit, though compact, offered practical all-terrain transportation to a full eight man rifle squad and their gear.&lt;br&gt;
The {{3/4}}-tons retained the same 6-cylinder in-line, L-head engine of 92&amp;nbsp;hp (73&amp;nbsp;kW) gross, from the {{1/2}}-ton WC series.

Almost three quarters of Dodge's 255,195 total {{3/4}}-ton G-502 WC series production, were built in the form of the {{nobr|WC-51}} and {{nobr|WC-52}}, "Truck, Cargo, {{3/4}}{{nbh}}ton, 4x4, Weapons Carrier", with or without winch. 123,541 were built without winch as the {{nobr|WC-51}}, and 59,114 with a front winch as the {{nobr|WC-52}} — for a total of 182.655 units — or just over 188,000 including the 5,380 {{nobr|WC-55s}} M6 GMC's that were later downgraded and used as {{nobr|WC-52s}}.

The open cab pickup could be fitted with an optional M24A1 machine gun mount, which bolted across the front of the bed. The mount could carry the [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle]], the [[M1919 Browning machine gun]], or the [[M2 Browning machine gun]].
The WC-52 was identical to the {{nobr|WC-51}}, but fitted with a [[power take-off]] driven Braden MU{{nbh}}2 7,500&amp;nbsp;lb / 3,402&amp;nbsp;kg capacity winch at the front bumper. As before, the winch equipped models actually had different, longer frames than those without, so a winch wasn't easily added in the field. .

====WC-62====
The G507 Cargo and Personnel Carrier, 1{{1/2}}-ton, 6x6 Truck, Dodge ({{nobr|WC-62}} w/o Winch) was based on a lengthened {{nobr|WC-51}} Weapons Carrier with an extra axle added. When the army enlarged rifle squads from eight to twelve men, the {{3/4}}-ton no longer sufficed, and a 48-inch longer 6x6 variant was created that used most of the mechanical parts and some of the sheet metal of the G-502. The G507 trucks could be driven by all six wheels (6x6) or by the four rear wheels only (6x4).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army Technical Manual TM9-1808B, 1943, page 4&lt;/ref&gt; A number of components were strengthened in this design, and many of these changes were also incorporated in subsequent {{3/4}}-ton production. Production amounted to 43,224 units total,&lt;ref name=HydeArsenal/&gt; — 23,092 {{nobr|WC-62}} units without winch, and 20,132 {{nobr|WC-63}} variants ''with'' winch.&lt;ref name=AMBenedict/&gt;{{sfnp|ref=SRATAM4045|Summary Report – Tank-Automotive Materiel|1945|page=66}} One prototype was produced as an armored car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warwheels.net/FargoArmoredTruckINDEX.html |title=Fargo 6x6 Armored Truck Index |publisher=Warwheels.net |date= |accessdate=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 6,344 WC-62 and WC-63 cargo trucks were provided to World War II Allies — 4,074 to the free French forces, 2,123 to Great Britain, and 137 units to Brazil.&lt;ref name=LLamounts3B/&gt;

The WC-63 Truck, Cargo and Personnel Carrier, 1{{1/2}} ton, 6x6 with Winch, Dodge (G507) ''Weapons Carrier'' was based on a lengthened {{nobr|WC-52}} with an extra axle added. Identical to the {{nobr|WC-62}} but fitted with a [[Power take-off|PTO]] powered Braden MU2 winch, initially of 5,000 pound, later 7,500 pound capacity.

==Comprehensive models table==
This comprehensive, sortable table has been compiled to further elaborate and clarify the extensive range of models in the larger Dodge WC series family, the different codes that were applied, and some of each model's base characteristics, based on dodge's SNL G-657 Master Parts List, U.S. Army technical model manuals, such as the TM9-2800 (editions of 1943 and 1947) and others, the U.S. Summary Report of Tank Automotive Acceptances (!945/1946), and various additional sources.

Different colors have been used to code groupings for maximum convenience, based on nominal payload rating, model family, and wheels and drive.&lt;br&gt;
Lend-lease models (mainly for Russia), and Canadian-built models are presented in red, at the bottom.

[[Dodge]] has used the '''B series''' name on two different vehicles, a [[pickup truck]] and a [[van]].

==Pickup truck==
[[File:'52 Dodge Pickup (Auto classique Salaberry-De-Valleyfield '11).jpg|thumb|left|1952 Dodge B series]]
The B-series pickup trucks were sold from 1948-1953. They replaced the prewar Dodge truck and were replaced by the [[Dodge C series]] in 1954. The B-series trucks came in several different variants. The B1-B were ½&amp;nbsp;ton trucks standard with a {{convert|95|hp|kW|abbr=on}} flathead-[[straight-six engine]] while the B1-C were ¾&amp;nbsp;ton trucks with a standard {{convert|108|hp|kW|abbr=on}} flathead-straight 6 engine. It also came in several other variants such as the B1-T and B1-V which were semi-truck cabs and vans, respectively. A [[Woodie (car body style)|woodie]] version, the "Suburban", was also available from outside companies.

[[File:1949 Dodge Suburban.jpg|thumb|1949 Dodge B-series woodie [[carryall]] ]]
The B-series trucks featured a high-visibility "pilot-house" cab with optional rear quarter windows. The engine was shifted forward and the front axle moved back on the frame for better weight distribution as well as a shorter wheelbase, moving from {{convert|116|in|mm|abbr=on}} to {{convert|108|in|mm|abbr=on}}. The cargo bed sides were made higher to increase capacity by 40%. The redesigned cab could seat three people, with {{convert|2.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} more height, {{convert|6|in|mm|abbr=on}} more width and {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}} additional in length. The cab was mounted on rubber mounts for an improved ride. Another innovation for the time was the use of cross-steering arrangement, giving the trucks a 37° turning radius. The cargo box space was increased over previous models and overload springs made optional on all variants to increase hauling capacity. In 1950, more new features were added as the 3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] shift lever was relocated to the steering column instead of on the floor. A fluid drive standard transmission, with 3 or 4 speeds, became an available option.  The front end and dashboard/gauge layout were redesigned for 1951.

1953 was the last year of the Pilot-house, but brought many new changes. The Truck-O-Matic transmission, a fully [[automatic transmission]] was available for ½ and ¾ton models. A longer {{convert|7|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} bed became available, which would increase the wheelbase to {{convert|116|in|mm|abbr=on}}. And the new wide "step-style" rear fenders were added, which would continue to be used by Dodge up until the 1980s.

==Van==
{{See also|Dodge Ram Van}}
[[File:Ramvan.jpg|thumb|1996 Dodge Ram Van Wagon]]
The B series also includes full-sized vans made by the Dodge division of Chrysler Corporation from 1970 (as early 1971 models) through 2003. During that time, they were originally numbered B100, B200, and B300; the numbers were later upped by 50 (B150, etc.) and finally multiplied by 10 (B1500, B2500, B3500) in the mid-1990s. The actual names were Dodge Sportsman, Dodge Tradesman, Dodge Van, at first; they later changed to Ram Van, Ram Wagon, and, briefly. There was also a Kary Van extended height model.

The cargo and passenger vans used the same frame and powerplants (both [[Straight-six engine|6-]] and [[V8 engine]]s), but the passenger vans had seats for up to 15 passengers (on the extended length, long-wheelbase Maxivans), dual air-conditioning systems (in later years), and large windows on both sides. The 15-passenger vans are today commonly used by military, commuters, church groups, scouts, urban camping, and some corporations. Throughout their run, two wheelbases were used: {{convert|109|in|mm|abbr=on}} and {{convert|127|in|mm|abbr=on}}, with an extended length version based on the {{convert|127|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase. Engines ranged from the 198&amp;nbsp;in³ [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine|Slant Six]] (available only in 1970-71), to the 440&amp;nbsp;in³ V8 (only briefly available in the late 1970s), with factory compressed-natural-gas 318&amp;nbsp;in³ (5.2&amp;nbsp;L) engines available from around 1995 onwards, to fleet buyers only. A popular Kary Van (basically a factory-built cube van, instead of upfitted by an aftermarket company), which extended the cargo area height to {{convert|6|ft|2|in|m|abbr=on}}, was added in 1972. A sliding door was made optional in 1974; that same year, the original stamped aluminum grille was also replaced with a molded plastic part. A one-piece rear door and hard-service interior were made optional in 1975.&lt;ref name=allpar&gt;[http://www.allpar.com/trucks/b-vans.html B-Vans/Allpar]&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, Dodge was the sales leader for vans, including conversions for tradespeople, ambulances, school buses, and campers, working with numerous upfitters to provide alternatives for customers. However, in 1979, the RV market crashed, and Dodge stopped making RV chassis; their van sales also dropped roughly in half. After that, upgrades to the "B-vans" came more slowly, especially as the vans' utility was in some ways duplicated by the company's own popular [[Plymouth Voyager]] and [[Dodge Caravan]] minivans.

In 1988, a 239&amp;nbsp;in³ (3.9&amp;nbsp;L) [[V6]] originally developed for the [[Dodge Dakota]] mid-size pickup replaced the 225&amp;nbsp;in³ (3.7&amp;nbsp;L) Slant Six, and throttle body injection was given to the 318 V8. The 360&amp;nbsp;in³ (5.9&amp;nbsp;L) V8 gaining fuel injection and a roller camshaft in 1989. In 1990, rear wheel antilock brakes were made optional, along with a heavy-duty four-speed [[automatic transmission]].

In 1992, the V6 and 5.2L V8 engines were fitted with sequential multiple-port fuel injection (SMPI) and a "barrel" / "kegger"-type intake manifold, which boosted power dramatically, and the outboard positions of the rear seat gained three-point belts. In the same year, [[compressed natural gas]] 5.2&amp;nbsp;L engines became optional for fleet buyers. The 5.9&amp;nbsp;L received the new intake and SMPI for 1993.

Numerous changes to the drivetrain, body, and suspension were made after 1993, as Dodge tried to make the vans more competitive, leading to a fairly sizeable redesign in 1998, which added numerous features, made the vans more driveable and safer, and added power to the 5.9&amp;nbsp;L V8 engine. More, and also substantial, changes were made for the 2000 model year, but little was changed from then until the final vans.&lt;ref name=allpar/&gt; Dodge stopped making the vans in June 2003, citing the expense of meeting future safety standards and slow sales. The Pillette Road plant in Windsor, Ontario which made the vans was closed down and later demolished.

The '''C series''' was a line of [[pickup truck]]s sold by [[Dodge]] from 1954 to 1960. It replaced the [[Dodge B series]] of trucks and was eventually supplanted by the [[Dodge D series]], introduced in 1961.

Unlike the B series, which were closely related to Dodge's prewar trucks, the C series was a complete redesign. Dodge continued the "pilot house" tradition of high-visibility cabs with a wraparound windshield introduced in 1955. A two-speed "[[PowerFlite]]" [[automatic transmission]] was newly available that year.

Chrysler called the [[Chrysler FirePower engine|Hemi]]-powered Dodge trucks "Power Giant" in 1957, and introduced power steering and brakes, a three-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]], and a 12-volt electrical system.

From 1957 to 1959, Dodge proposed the ''Sweptside pickup'', a rival to the [[Chevrolet Cameo Carrier|Chevrolet ''Cameo Carrier'']], but it never became a best-seller.&lt;ref name="DodgeSweptside"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1957-1959-dodge-d100-sweptside-pickup.htm |title=1957-1959 Dodge D100 Sweptside Pickup|publisher=HowStuffWorks |access-date=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A flat-sided (and thus wider) "Sweptline" cargo box came in 1959. The company also adopted the standard pickup truck numbering scheme, also used by Ford and GM at that time. Thus, the ½&amp;nbsp;ton Dodge was now called the D100. A traditional separate-fender body "Utiline" version was also built which had a [[GVWR]] of {{convert|9000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.

==Medium-duty/heavy-duty C series==
{{Main|Dodge LCF series}}
Since it still utilized the older cab design, the C series name was continued for Dodge's line of medium- and heavy-duty trucks (better known as the [[Dodge LCF Series|LCF series]]) through the 1975 model year, long after most of Dodge's other trucks had moved to the newer D series designation.

The '''Dodge Viper (SR I)''' is the first generation of the [[Dodge Viper|Viper]] [[sports car]], manufactured by American automobile manufacturer [[Dodge]]. It was originally tested in January 1989 as a prototype, then later introduced in 1991 as a pace car for the [[Indianapolis 500]], then finally going on sale in January 1992.

The SR I began the Dodge Viper model lineup, which would continue on until 2017, consisting of five generations.

The SRI was replaced by the updated SRII after a series of updates in 1995.

== History and development ==
[[File:1991 Dodge Viper Indianapolis 500 Pace Car.jpg|left|thumb|220x220px|The pre-production Dodge Viper (SR I) as the pace car for the [[1991 Indianapolis 500]].]]
[[File:Dodge Viper RT-10 - Flickr - Alexandre Prévot (4).jpg|left|thumb|The lightweight hard top became an option for later Viper models.]]The original Viper was intended to be a performance sports car. The project was started in 1988 at Chrysler's Advanced Design Studios, when then-president [[Bob Lutz (businessman)|Bob Lutz]] suggested to [[Tom Gale (designer)|Tom Gale]] that the company should consider the production of a modern [[AC Cobra|Cobra]]. A clay model was created months later, and the car later appeared as a concept in 1989 at the [[North American International Auto Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/vehicles/coll/sci/112metal.html|title=The American Carrozzeria|last=Lamm|first=Michael|publisher=The Auto Channel|accessdate=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief engineer Roy Sjoberg was then directed to develop the car after public reactions of the initial concept were highly positive.

"Team Viper" was later formed with 85 engineers selected by Sjoberg, and development of the car began in March 1989, with full completion in February 1990.

It was later introduced in 1991 at [[1991 Indianapolis 500|the Indianapolis 500 of that year]] with a [[pre-production car]] driven by [[Carroll Shelby]], being forced to replace the [[Dodge Stealth]] because of complaints coming from the [[United Automobile Workers]]. It later went on sale as the ''Dodge Viper RT/10 Roadster'' in January 1992.

== Engineering and design ==
[[File:Dodge Viper RT-10 - Flickr - Alexandre Prévot (13).jpg|thumb|200x200px|Rear view of the Viper.]]
The Viper lacks modern driver aids such as [[Traction control system|traction control]] and [[anti-lock brakes]]. The car also has no exterior-mounted door handles or key locks, and instead, entry is done by unzipping a vinyl window to reach the interior door release handle (when the canvas/hard top is in place). No [[air conditioning]] was installed on the car (the option for A/C was added in later models). There were also no [[Airbag|airbags]] for weight reduction. The roof was made from [[canvas]], and the windows were made from vinyl and used zippers to open and close. Despite these lack of features, the car still had some features in order for it to be tolerable as a daily driving car, such as manually-adjustable seats with lumbar support, an AM/FM stereo player, a clock, and carpeting.

Later models of the Viper allowed the option for a lightweight fiberglass hard top to replace the standard canvas soft top.

[[Lamborghini]], who was owned by Chrysler Corporation at the time, assisted with the design of the aluminum-alloy [[V10 engine]] for the car, with the design based on Chrysler's [[Chrysler LA engine|LA engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2dRqgSuHAjgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA296#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Car: The Definitive Visual History of the Automobile|date=2011|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780756689384|page=296|language=en|accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dick Winkles, the chief power engineer, was a major contributor on the engine project, and had spent time in Italy for the purpose of the engine's development.

== Specifications and performance ==

The '''Dodge Viper (SR II)''' is the second generation of the [[Dodge Viper]] [[sports car]], manufactured by American automobile manufacturer [[Dodge]]. The car had many parts carried over from the previous generation.

== Production and specification history ==
[[File:Red Dodge Viper GTS.jpg|left|thumb|1996 Dodge Viper GTS]]

The 1996 model year marked as the start of production for the second generation of the Viper, called the SRII. The car was essentially an updated version of the first generation of the Viper, since most of its parts were passed on to this generation.

The RT/10 received minor changes, the biggest change being the exhaust positions. The exhausts of the car were relocated to the rear to release back pressure, which therefore increased the power to {{convert|415|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and the torque to {{convert|488|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. A removable hardtop was now available along with a sliding glass window. A few steel suspension components were replaced by [[Aluminium|aluminum]], which resulted in {{convert|27|kg|lbs|abbr=on}} of weight reduction.&lt;ref name="edmunds.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/dodge/viper/history.html|title=Dodge Viper History|work=Edmunds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new model of the Viper was introduced in late 1996. Known as the GTS, the car was essentially a coupé and more powerful version of the RT/10. The roof of the car was shaped in such a way that drivers were able to fit their helmets during track days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shelby-dodge.com/viper.html|title=Viper|date=|publisher=Shelby-dodge.com|accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was dubbed the double-bubble, and has been used for all of the subsequent generations of the Viper following the SR II. Over 90% of the GTS contained new parts compared to the RT/10 despite similar looks, and the 8.0-liter [[V10 engine]] received a power increase, with the engine now producing a maximum power output of {{Convert|450|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. The GTS was also the first Viper to receive airbags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/viphist.htm|title=The Original Dodge Viper: 1992-2002 including RT/10 and GTS|work=allpar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 and 1998 model years the Viper  would continue to receive minor updates. The GTS would get second-generation airbags, revised exhaust manifolds, and a revised camshaft for 1997, and the RT/10 would gain a power increase up to {{Convert|450|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} for 1998.

Lighter hyper-eutectic pistons and factory frame improvements were made for the Viper in 2000.

2002 would be the final year of production for the SR II generation of the Viper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2010/04/06/dodge-slithers-out-new-2010-viper-final-edition/|title=Dodge slithers out new 2010 Viper Final Edition models|author=Jeremy Korzeniewski|work=Autoblog}}&lt;/ref&gt; To commemorate the final year, 360 "Final Edition" cars (326 coupes and 34 ACR special edition cars) were built.

== Special editions ==

=== ACR ===
The Viper ACR was introduced in 1999, as an optional performance package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consumerguide.com/used/1992-02-dodge-viper/|title=1992-02 Dodge Viper|work=Consumer Guide Auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The package included a revised air intake, removal of the air conditioning and radio, and adjustable suspension. The car also included unique 18-inch BBS wheels along with interior updates and power windows.

A lap record was set in [[Willow Springs International Motorsports Park]] when a Viper ACR set a lap time of 1:34.90, setting the fastest lap time for a car built in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fastestlaps.com/tests/1a3vfzk780rh|title=Dodge Viper ACR laptime at Willow Springs - FastestLaps.com|website=FastestLaps.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GTS-R ===
In order to meet [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologation]] requirements, Dodge built the GTS-R, a special edition taking the name of its racing counterpart. The car was also built to commemorate the manufacturer's [[1997 FIA GT Championship]] class win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/vipacr.htm|title=special Dodge Vipers – Viper GT2 and ACR|publisher=Allpar.com|accessdate=September 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The V10 engine in the GTS-R was rated at a power output of  {{cvt|460|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{cvt|500|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. The bodywork was made similar to that of the [[Chrysler Viper GTS-R]], including the colors, aerodynamics package, and visual design in order to publicise the Viper's motorsport achievement.

== Motorsport ==
{{Main|Chrysler Viper GTS-R}}
[[File:3 Greg Crick (TAS), Dodge Viper GTS ACR.JPG|thumb|The Dodge Viper GTS-ACR race car, built by Greg Crick to compete in the [[2006 Australian GT Championship]].]]
[[File:Lemans chrysler viper.jpg|thumb|Chrysler Viper GTS-R, also called Dodge Viper GTS-R in North America.]]
In 1996, Dodge constructed a race car along with [[England|English]] racing team [[Reynard Motorsport]] and [[France|French]] racing team [[Oreca]] for GT class in LeMans called the [[Chrysler Viper GTS-R|Viper GTS-R]]. The result would end up in a race car that would race 12 years in motorsport with 163 wins in 262 races completed.

The car was unveiled in the same year at the [[IMSA GT Championship]], with racing team Canaska Southwind. Competing in the GTS-1 class (the highest of classes at the time), its first race was at the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], with a finish at the 29th position. It would fare much better in the following races, finishing at 12th position at the [[12 Hours of Sebring]]. The team would switch to GTS-2 afterwards however, after achieving no further improvements.

Oreca and Canaska Southwind entered the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], with three of the four entrants finishing the race, the Canaska Southwind car performing the best at the 10th place. Both teams would return to their respective series, Oreca concluding the year with an eighth place at [[Brands Hatch]], ninth at [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa]], and sixth at [[Circuit Paul Armagnac|Nogaro]] in the [[BPR Global GT Series]], and Canaska Southwind concluding their season second in class at [[Mosport]] and sixth overall.

For 1999 and 2000, Oreca expanded greatly, racing in both the [[ALMS]] and [[FIA GT Championship]] series respectively, earning them nine wins, one of them won by a racing team ran by [[Paul Belmondo]]. Oreca would win the championships. Meanwhile, at the FIA GT Championship, a team named Chamberlain had improved to finish second overall.

Oreca would go on to win their second consecutive win later at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, with the top six positions in every class being taken by various GTS-Rs driven by Oreca and other teams. Oreca would leave the series in 1999, in favour of the ALMS, leaving the privateers to race there. The remaining Viper racing teams were still competitive with four race wins, but they would lose to the [[Lister Cars|Lister]] racing teams, and their [[Lister Storm]] race cars, with them winning five races.

The GTS-R would make its first appearance in the [[FFSA GT Championship]], and would see the first overall win for [[Zakspeed]] in the [[24 Hours Nürburgring|24 Hours of Nürburgring]]. The three other teams DDO, ART, and MMI teams would win a total of eight victories.

In 2003, the winning ways of the GTS-R would fade away, as the dominance of the [[Prodrive]]-built [[Ferrari 550|Ferrari 550 GTS]] race cars would rise. 2004 oversaw the Viper GTS-R begin to phase out, and the car would eventually diminish entirely from competition by 2007 and 2008.

A modified Dodge Viper GTS-ACR driven by Greg Crick under the team Crickcars.com entered the [[2006 Australian GT Championship]] and won the series, with 713 points in total.

}}The '''Dodge Viper (ZB I)''' is the third generation of the [[Dodge Viper|Viper]] [[sports car]], manufactured by [[Dodge]]. The third generation received a heavy design change, designed by Osamu Shikado in 1999.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2003-dodge-viper-srt-10-first-drive-review|title=2003 Dodge Viper SRT-10|work=Car and Driver|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
{{See also|Street &amp; Racing Technology}}
For the third generation, the Dodge Viper was heavily redesigned, courtesy of Osamu Shikado from Dodge's performance division, [[Street &amp; Racing Technology]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The design took inspiration from the Viper competition coupé concept, also designed by Shikado which was unveiled two years prior as a preview for the next generation of the Viper.

== Production ==
[[File:2005-03-04 Motorshow Geneva 117.JPG|left|thumb|The third generation of the Viper would get heavy design updates.]]
The new Viper was released in 2002, named as the SRT-10, which replaced both the RT/10 and GTS models. The engine displacement was increased from 8.0 to 8.3 liters,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.topspeed.com/cars/dodge/2003-dodge-viper-srt10-ar474.html|title=2003 Dodge Viper SRT10 at Top Speed|work=Top Speed|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and along with other upgrades, the engine produced a maximum power output of {{Convert|500|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, and {{Convert|525|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/viper/2003/2003-dodge-viper-srt-10/|title=SPEEDING SHOOTOUT: 2003 DODGE VIPER SRT-10|last=Vance|first=Brian|date=2003-07-09|website=MotorTrend|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weight of the engine would also lose as much as {{Convert|230|kg|lbs|0|abbr=on}}. The chassis would become more rigid and lightweight, losing {{Convert|36|kg|lbs|0|abbr=on}}. A 6-speed [[TREMEC Corporation|Tremec]] T56 manual transmission is used to deliver all of the power to the rear wheels.

Three years later after the SRT-10 was unveiled, the coupé version of the Viper would be launched, adapting the same "double-bubble" structure as the GTS from the previous generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/viper/2006/2006-dodge-viper-srt10-coupe/|title=ROAD TEST: 2006 DODGE VIPER SRT10 COUPE|last=Stone|first=Matt|date=2006-01-03|website=MotorTrend|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model would have an increased power output of {{Convert|510|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, and {{Convert|535|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The design of the car takes styling cues from the GTS, with the rear portion of the car adapting the tail shape, and the taillights using a design inspired by the GTS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2006-dodge-viper-srt-10-coupe-first-drive-review|title=2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe|work=Car and Driver|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodge would stop production of the Viper for 2007, in lieu of preparing the new updates for the car for the 2008 model year.

== Performance ==
The SRT-10 can accelerate from {{Convert|0-60|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}} in 3.8 seconds, {{Convert|0-100|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}} in 8.36 seconds, complete the quarter mile in 11.77 seconds at {{Convert|123.68|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}}, and attain a top speed of {{Convert|189.5|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}}. The Viper also has an average slalom speed of {{Convert|70.4|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}}, a skidpad acceleration average of 1.05 ''g'' (10.3&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and a {{Convert|100-0|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}} stopping distance of {{Convert|274|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="viper507"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/womt/112_0306_spdtest/index.html|title=Speeding Shootout: The Performance Tests|work=|format=online|accessdate=December 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coupé variant can accelerate from {{Convert|0-60|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}} in 3.7 seconds, {{Convert|0-100|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}} in 8.36 seconds, complete the quarter mile in 11.77 seconds at {{Convert|123.68|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}}, and attain a top speed of {{Convert|192.6|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}}.

The '''Dodge Journey''' is a [[Mid-size car|mid-size]] [[crossover (automobile)|crossover SUV]] manufactured and marketed by [[FCA US LLC]]'s [[Dodge]] brand since [[model year]] 2009, with a minor [[Facelift (automotive)|facelift]] for the 2011 model year.

==Overview==
The Dodge Journey debuted at the 2007 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Neff |first=John |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2007/08/26/2009-dodge-journey-crossover-will-debut-in-frankfurt/ |title=2009 Dodge Journey crossover will debut in Frankfurt |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=2007-08-26 |accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Neff |first=John |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2007/09/11/frankfurt-2007-dodge-journey-drops-in-germany/ |title=Frankfurt 2007: Dodge Journey drops in Germany |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=2007-11-09 |accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; later appearing at the 2009 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.chryslerllc.com/entry/758/a_walking_tour_of_chryslers_stand_at_frankfurt |title=A Walking Tour of Chrysler's Stand at Frankfurt |publisher=Blog.chryslerllc.com |accessdate=2010-10-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708152450/http://blog.chryslerllc.com/entry/758/a_walking_tour_of_chryslers_stand_at_frankfurt |archivedate=2011-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identified internally as the '''JC49''',&lt;ref name="mtrend"&gt;http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/suvs/112_0804_2009_dodge_journey_first_drive/specifications.html&lt;/ref&gt; the Journey shares a modified [[automobile platform|platform]] with the [[Dodge Avenger]] and an identical wheelbase to the outgoing short wheel base (SWB) Chrysler minivan, a slightly shorter wheelbase {{convert|113.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} than the outgoing [[Chrysler Pacifica]].&lt;ref name="allpar1"/&gt;
Featuring 5- or 7-passenger seating with four forward-hinged doors, the Journey is available with a [[Straight-4|four-cylinder engine]], as with past models of the Chrysler SWB minivans.

Production versions of 2009 model year vehicles went on sale in 2008 for the 2009 model-year in [[North America]], and mid-2008 elsewhere. A version for the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] market was unveiled at Auto China in 2008, marketed as the JCUV. Initial model production began in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9080422.005/dodge-journey-launched-in-china-as-jcuv|title=Dodge Journey Launched in China as JCUV|date=2008-04-22|accessdate=2009-05-27|author=Frank de Leeuw van Weenen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freemont went on sale in Russia in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wroom.ru/en/news/663 |title=Fiat Freemont Minivan Soon on Sale in Russia |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=4 June 2013 |website=Wroom.ru |accessdate=21 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021131946/http://wroom.ru/en/news/663 |archive-date=21 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halfway through the 2009 model year, the model name emblem moved to the right-end of the trunk lid, replaced by the brand emblem.

===2011 update===
Revisions for the 2011 model-year include modifications to the grille, lower front fascia, redesigned interior, suspension, steering, powertrain, and use of Dodge's new logo, launched in 2011, as well as LED Taillights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.caranddriver.com/2011-dodge-journey-receives-face-lift-pentastar-v6-revised-interior/ 2011 Dodge Journey receives facelift, Pentastar V6 &amp; revised interior.] -- ''[[Car &amp; Driver]]'' (Retrieved October 21, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2012 model year, the Journey became Dodge's smallest SUV after FCA stopped manufacturing the [[Dodge Nitro|Nitro]]. For the 2013 model year, Dodge released the Journey Blacktop, with 19-inch gloss black aluminum wheels and center caps, a gloss black grille, gloss black bezel headlamps, gloss black lower front fascia accent and gloss black exterior mirrors. In 2014, the Journey Crossroad was introduced with chrome accents along the lower part of the body and in the interior, a large bumper, smoked head- and taillights, a black grille, rocker panels, rails for a roof rack, and a skid plate simile at the rear.&lt;ref name=autoev15&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.autoevolution.com/reviews/dodge-journey-review-2015.html | title = 2015 Dodge Journey Review | last = Ross | first = Jeffrey | work = autoevolution | publisher = SoftNews NET | date = 2015-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysler added the revised Dodge logo with two slanted rectangles for the 2013 Model Year. For the 2016 model-year, the Journey's AVP and Limited trims were discontinued and the Crossroad Plus trim was added and also for the 2017 model-year, the R/T trim is replaced by the GT trim.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The Freemont had its Italian launch in the end of May 2011.&lt;ref name="europeancarnews.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://europeancarnews.com/2011/06/01/fiat-says-the-freemonts-launch-was-a-success/#more-337|title=Fiat says the Freemont’s launch was a success.|accessdate=2011-06-01|work=europeancarnews.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815213612/http://europeancarnews.com/2011/06/01/fiat-says-the-freemonts-launch-was-a-success/#more-337|archive-date=2011-08-15|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has two front-wheel-drive turbodiesel variants the {{Convert|140|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and the {{Convert|170|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} version of Fiat's 2.0 L Multijet turbodiesel. Later will be introduced all-wheel-drive version of {{Convert|170|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} diesel and the Pentastar V6.&lt;ref name="fiatpress.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fiatpress.com/index.php?lng=2&amp;group=1&amp;method=cartelle&amp;action=zoom&amp;id=4963|title=Fiat Freemont, international debut|accessdate=2011-01-25|work=fiatpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], [[Brazil]] and [[China]], both the Freemont and the Journey are available for sale. However, to create a distinct market for the two vehicles, the Freemont is only available with the 2.0 and 2.4L 4-cylinder engines in the market other than China, while the Journey is now only sold with the Pentastar V6 engine (both engines were available before the launch of the Freemont).

The Freemont was originally available in [[Right- and left-hand traffic|LHD]] markets only, except [[the Netherlands]]. ''Fiat Group Automobiles Netherlands'' did not offer the Fiat Freemont on the Dutch market, owing to the Dutch [[tax]] climate, that would make the car too expensive to become a sales success.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} However, a RHD model was introduced to [[Australia]], but not in the [[United Kingdom]]. In January 2011, ''[[What Car?]]'' expressed doubts for the model to reach the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fiat Freemont seven-seater unveiled|url=http://www.whatcar.com/car-news/fiat-freemont-seven-seater-unveiled/1199023|publisher=whatcar.com|date=January 24, 2011|accessdate=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2020 model year changes===

For the 2020 [[model year]], the Dodge Journey will be offered in two trim levels: SE Value and Crossroad. All other trim levels (SE and GT) have been discontinued. All 2020 Journey models will be powered by the same 2.4L inline four-cylinder (I4) engine, mated to the 4-speed automatic transmission, and front wheel drive (FWD). The 3.6L [[Pentastar]] V6 engine, 6-speed automatic transmission, and all wheel drive (AWD) have all been discontinued for 2020. A Blacktop Package becomes available on the SE Plus trim that adds 17-inch gloss black-finished aluminum alloy wheels and black-painted exterior accents. The SE Value trim also gains standard seven-passenger seating with a third-row split-folding bench seat. The Crossroad also gains additional standard equipment, such as a power sunroof. All trims receive standard rear park assist and rearview backup camera, and a Popular Equipment Group is now available on both trims for 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=20872&amp;mid=183|accessdate=13 November 2019|date=1 September 2019|title=2020 Dodge Journey Fact Sheet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engines===
The available [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] is a {{convert|2.4|L|cuin|0|abbr=on}}, with {{convert|173|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|166|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque; a version of Chrysler's [[Global Engine Manufacturing Alliance|GEMA]] built, [[World Gasoline Engine|World Engine]] class of four-cylinder engines shared with Hyundai and Mitsubishi.&lt;ref name=2009specs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.media.chrysler.com/dcxms/assets/specs/2009_DodgeJourneySpecifications_WN.pdf |title=2009 Journey |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-09-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708152824/http://www.media.chrysler.com/dcxms/assets/specs/2009_DodgeJourneySpecifications_WN.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carconnect"&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Journey Interior.jpg|thumb|left|Dodge Journey interior (2009-2010)]]
[[File:Interni Fiat Freemont2.JPG|thumb|right|Fiat Freemont interior]]
Through 2010, the [[V6]] offered in North America was a {{convert|3.5|L|cuin|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name=2009specs/&gt; with a six-speed automatic transmission, producing {{convert|235|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|232|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. For 2011, it was changed to the 3.6-liter [[Pentastar]] V6, producing {{convert|283|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|260|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}} torque.&lt;ref name="media.chrysler.com/newsrelease"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://media.chrysler.com/newsrelease.do;jsessionid=698AE0C1FAA5CBE9F36D0E15880CE74C?&amp;mid=2&amp;id=10140|title=2011 Dodge Journey Crosses Over: A Gorgeous New Spirit and a Driver’s Soul|accessdate=2010-12-28|work=media.chrysler.com/newsrelease}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other markets offer the six-speed [[automatic transmission]] with the flex-fuel ([[E85]] compatible) 2.7-liter V6. All-wheel drive is only available with a V6.

Also through 2010 a [[Volkswagen Group|Volkswagen]]-sourced diesel engine was available outside of North America with an automatically shifted [[dual clutch transmission]]. Chrysler performed primary engineering for the dual-clutch transmission with support from long-time partner Getrag, which was to build the transmission in the United States. Due to funding issues, this did not happen, and the factory, nearly finished, was sold and used for other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allpar.com/news/index.php/2011/01/chrysler-getrag-contractors-partly-paid Chrysler-Getrag contractors: partly paid]. ''allpar.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the second generation in 2011 it was replaced by the [[Fiat]] 2.0-liter four-cylinder diesel engine with {{convert|140|hp|abbr=on}} or {{convert|170|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|258|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque and a manual or optional automatic six-speed transmission.

===Marketing===

Dodge Journeys marketed in Japan are known as '''Dodge JC''' because "[[Isuzu Journey|Journey]]" has been used by [[Isuzu|Isuzu Motors]]. JCs were qualified by the Japanese government to be included in Subsidy Scheme for Environmentally Friendly Vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us.emb-japan.go.jp/english/html/eco-car2.html|title=The Application of Japan’s Subsidy Scheme for Environmentally Friendly Vehicles ("eco-cars") to PHP Import Cars|accessdate=2012-02-14|publisher=Japanese Embassy in the United States|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213153807/http://www.us.emb-japan.go.jp/english/html/eco-car2.html|archive-date=2012-02-13|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operating expenses in Japan incur additional costs due to exceeding Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]] and the engine displacement incurring higher [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] obligations.

As part of the vehicle's introductory promotion, [[Dario Franchitti]]'s No. 40 [[Dodge Charger (LX)|Dodge Charger]] carried a '''"Journey"''' paint scheme for the [[2008 Daytona 500]] on February 17, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Dodge Viper (ZB II)''' is the fourth generation of the Viper [[sports car]]. Introduced for the 2008 model year; the car was the same as its predecessor on the exterior but had undergone notable mechanical and interior changes.

== History and development ==
[[File:'08 Dodge Viper (Montreal).jpg|thumb|Dodge Viper (ZB II) coupé]]
[[File:Dodge Viper 2008 SRT10 Roadster Cockpit LakeMirrorClassic 17Oct09 (14620617123).jpg|thumb|Interior]]
For the 2008 model year, engine capacity was raised to {{cvt|8382|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} which also resulted in power output being raised to {{convert|600|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,100 rpm and {{convert|560|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 5,000 rpm. The engine was developed in collaboration with [[McLaren Automotive]] and [[Ricardo Consulting Engineers]] and included better flowing heads with larger valves, Mechadyne cam-in-cam [[variable valve timing]] on the exhaust cam lobes, and dual electronic [[Throttle#Throttle body|throttle bodies]].&lt;ref name="viper505"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.automobilemag.com/am/2006/dodge/viper/specifications.html |title=2006 Dodge Viper Specifications |accessdate=October 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other modifications included improved [[valvetrain]] stability from both the new [[camshaft]] profiles and [[Poppet valve#Operation|valve-springs]], as a result of which the rev limit could be further extended by 300&amp;nbsp;rpm along with an [[Electronic control unit|Electronic engine control]] developed by [[Continental AG]]; the controller can monitor the [[crankshaft]] and [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] position up to six times during each firing and has 10 times more processing power than the previous unit.

No notable exterior changes were present on the new generation of the Viper except a vented engine cover. The [[Borg-Warner T-56 transmission|Tremec T56 transmission]] was replaced with a new [[Tremec TR-6060 transmission]] with triple first-gear [[Synchronizer (automotive)|synchronizers]] and doubles for higher gears. The rear axle was also replaced and now had a [[GKN]] ViscoLok speed-sensing [[limited-slip differential]] that helped in attaining maximum grip for the tires. New Michelin Pilot Sport 2 tires increased grip and driver feedback and, along with revised suspension system (springs, anti-roll bars, and shock valving).

Another notable change was the reworked [[exhaust system]]; previous third-generation cars had their exhaust crossover under the seats which resulted in a large amount of heat going into the cockpit, which was done initially to help improve the car's exhaust note, since the first two generations of the Viper, which had no crossover, were criticized for their lackluster exhaust notes.

There were also notable changes to the car's electrical system, including a 180-amp [[Alternator (automotive)|alternator]], twin electric cooling fans, electronic throttle bodies, and completely new VENOM [[engine management system]]. CAN bus architecture had been combined with pre-existing systems to allow for regulatory compliance. The fuel system was upgraded to include a higher-capacity fuel pump and filtration system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= First Look: 2008 Dodge Viper Coupe and Convertible |url= http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/exotic/112_0702_2008_dodge_viper/engine.html |work= |publisher=Motor Trend |accessdate=June 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variants ==
=== Viper SRT-10 ACR ===
[[File:09 Dodge Viper ACR (6170720919).jpg|thumb|right|Dodge Viper SRT-10 ACR]]
The Viper SRT-10 ACR ('''A'''merican '''C'''lub '''R'''acer) is a track-focused, performance-oriented variant of the Viper SRT-10. The intention was to combine Dodge's racing DNA into the [[Street-legal vehicle|road legal]] Viper to produce a car that was fast, agile and lightweight without compromising its normal driving identity. A carbon fiber front splitter, front canards and an adjustable carbon fiber rear wing made the car more responsive around corners and enabled it to generate {{cvt|1000|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} of downforce at {{cvt|150|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/reviews/a4204/4247053/|title=2008 Dodge Viper ACR Test Drive|date=January 28, 2008|work=Popular Mechanics|access-date=October 16, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; distributed approximately 45 percent to the front and 55 percent to the rear. The front splitter included three removable protective wear-resistant rub strips, while the stainless steel tension cables provided enough support to absorb the energy from minor upward deflections. In terms of aerodynamics, the car made use of the high-performance autoclaved carbon-fiber to reduce weight. Lightweight filler panels replace the front fog lamps and gloss black lightweight forged aluminum Sidewinder wheels with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup DOT-approved (street-legal) race tires finish off the exterior of the car. The Viper SRT-10 ACR features a signature two-tone paint scheme with a black center section. There is an optional driver's stripe available which features a sewn leather accent on the steering wheel. A monotone paint scheme is available as an option that features a body-color rear wing and dual painted [[Racing stripe|stripes]]. Five colors were available especially for the ACR variant namely; Viper Red, Viper Black, Viper Violet, Viper Bright Blue Metallic, and Viper Very Orange. The interior is driver focused with the deletion of the audio system in favor of a lightweight cover on the dashboard that can be used to mount a lap-timer, deletion of the floor mats, underhood silencer pad and the tire inflator in the optional "Hard Core" package in order to save weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jalopnik.com/320554/2008-dodge-viper-srt10-acr|title=2008 Dodge Viper SRT-10 ACR|date=November 11, 2007|work=Jalopnik|access-date=October 16, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of carbon fiber along with the minimalist interior make the car {{cvt|80|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} lighter than the standard SRT-10 coupe when equipped with the Hard Core package, and {{cvt|40|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} lighter without.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/viper/2009/2009-dodge-viper-acr/|title=First Drive: 2009 Dodge Viper ACR|date=February 1, 2008|work=Motor Trend|access-date=October 16, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Power remained the same as the SRT-10 but the maximum speed was  reduced to {{cvt|290|kph|mph|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} for the 2008&amp;ndash;2009 models and {{cvt|296|kph|mph|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} in 2010 models with the redesigned wing endplates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1039003_2010-dodge-viper-srt10-acr-preview|title=2010 Dodge Viper SRT10 ACR Preview|date=November 25, 2009|work=Motor Authority|access-date=October 16, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SRT10 ACR features a suspension system that includes adjustable coil-over racing [[Shock absorber|dampers]] from KW Suspensions and two-way adjustable shocks. The dampers and forks are made from solid aluminum billet and are optimized for increased weight reduction and performance. Stopping power comes from StopTech two-piece, slotted lightweight rotors combined with the Viper SRT10's [[Brembo]] calipers. This setup reduces rotating inertia and unsprung mass, improves brake cooling, and significantly reduces fade even under extreme conditions. Due to the improved brakes, the car stops from {{convert|60|mph|0|abbr=on}} in less than {{convert|100|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}. Braking from {{convert|80|mph|0|abbr=on}} is shorter by {{convert|11|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} than the standard car, steady-state lateral grip has improved by 0.11 [[g-force|g]], and improved transient dynamics through the salom bump up the average speed by {{convert|3.2|mph|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/car-comparison-tests/reviews/a20265/evil-twins-dodge-viper-srt10-vs-srt10-acr/|title=Evil Twins: Dodge Viper SRT10 vs. SRT10 ACR|date=February 2, 2015|work=Road &amp; Track|access-date=October 26, 2018language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Viper SRT-10 ACR X ===
The Viper SRT-10 ACR X is a more powerful, track only, limited edition variant of the Viper ACR, produced at the end of the fourth generation Viper's production run. The ACR X is powered by the same {{convert|8382|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} V10 engine which powered all of the fourth generation cars but received a power increase to {{convert|640|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,100 rpm and {{convert|605|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 5,100 rpm.&lt;ref name="caranddriver"/&gt; The suspension is adjustable and higher spring rates allow the chassis to maximize grip from the special 18-inch-front and 19-inch rear Michelin racing slicks. Various aerodynamic enhancements, such as additional dive planes on the front fascia, provide up to 1,100 pounds of downforce at {{convert|150|mph|0|abbr=on}}, or about 100 more than on the regular ACR. The X's curb weight is claimed to be reduced by {{cvt|120|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} compared with the standard ACR's weight. The new total—about {{cvt|3200|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}—was mostly realized by thoroughly stripping out the interior. The dash board and the center console are retained from the ACR and an eight-point, [[SCCA]]-certified [[roll cage]] and [[Fuel cell vehicle|fuel cell]] have been fitted, but the cabin is definitely sparse, with no side windows to roll down, a single racing seat and harness, and a removable [[Momo (company)|Momo]] steering wheel. Other racing add-ons include a fire-suppression system, transmission and differential coolers, and larger front brake rotors fed by ducting that is more efficient than the street car's. The X's improved power-to-weight ratio improves acceleration by 1/10th of a second as compared to the ACR's 3.4-second 0-to-{{convert|60|mph|0|abbr=on}} time and enables the car to complete the {{convert|1/4|mi|m|0}} in 11.8-seconds at {{cvt|126|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}}. The racing slicks help the car obliterate the street car's 1.08 g of skidpad grip, but courtesy to the extreme drag generated by all the downforce-generating aero components, the top speed is reduced to {{cvt|185|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="caranddriver"&gt;{{Cite web

== Production ==
On November 4, 2009, Dodge Brand President and CEO [[Ralph Gilles]] announced that the Viper would cease production in the summer of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.autotropolis.com/auto-industry-news/dodge-car-brand-ceo-confirms-end-of-dodge-viper-production.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720062559/http://www.autotropolis.com/auto-news/dodge-car-brand-ceo-confirms-end-of-dodge-viper-production.html | archivedate=July 20, 2011 | title=Dodge Car Brand CEO Confirms End of Viper Production | last=Ross |first=Jeffrey N. | publisher=Autotropolis.com | date=November 4, 2009 | accessdate=November 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keeping the end of production onto consideration, Dodge announced several special edition Vipers for the 2010 model year:

'''Voodoo edition''': The Voodoo edition (31 units were made) was a special take on the ACR edition which included special black paint and red striping. The Voodoo edition also had a unique interior and steering wheel as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2010-dodge-viper-srt10-acr-voodoo-edition-and-133-edition-auto-shows|title=2010 Dodge Viper SRT10 ACR Voodoo Edition and 1:33 Edition|work=caranddriver.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1:33 Edition''': The 1:33 edition was another take on the ACR edition which celebrates the then unofficial lap record at [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca]]. The 1:33 edition had black paint and red two-tone paint. The 1:33 cars have piano black trim inside and red accent stitching on the seats.

'''Final Edition''':  On February 10, 2010, Dodge began accepting orders for the Viper SRT10 "Final Edition" models.
Only 50 cars were produced (20 coupes, 18 roadsters and 12 ACRs). "Final Edition" cars carried the special build code,
"AXZ", and were to be the very last of the Viper cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Korzeniewski |first=Jeremy |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2010/04/06/dodge-slithers-out-new-2010-viper-final-edition/ |title=Dodge slithers out new 2010 Viper Final Edition models — Autoblog |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=April 6, 2010 |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

July 1, 2010 brought about the end of production for the fourth generation of the Dodge Viper. During an event hosted by Dodge and the Viper Club of America, the final iteration of the Viper, which was given a gold finish with contrasting orange stripes, was presented in front of those attending the ceremony. Its completion commemorated the end of production of the ZB II Viper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=October 2018}} {{cite web|url=http://www.dragtimes.com/blog/the-last-dodge-viper-rolls-off-the-line |title=The Last Dodge Viper Rolls off the Line |publisher=DragTimes.com |date=July 2, 2010 |accessdate=July 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SRT-10 ACR was put through its paces at the [[Nürburgring]] and clocked in a record time of 7:22.1. Kuno Wittmer piloted a street legal 2010 Dodge Viper ACR to a record lap of 1:59.995 at [[Miller Motorsports Park]] in [[Tooele, Utah]], on Monday, April 11, breaking the 2-minute mark for the first time in a production car on the 3.048-mile Outer Course configuration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.topspeed.com/cars/dodge/2008-2010-dodge-viper-srt10-acr-ar46976.html|title=2008 - 2010 Dodge Viper SRT10 ACR Review at Top Speed|work=Top Speed|access-date=May 7, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dodge Viper (VX I)''' is the fifth and final generation of the Viper sports car. Introduced in the 2013 model year, the car was entirely redesigned and included features such as an Anti-lock Braking System, electronic stability control and traction control that made the car compatible to modern vehicle safety standards. The discontinuation of production of the VX I in August 2017 marked the culmination of the Viper.

There would be cars produced for the 2011 model year.

In Autumn of 2011, Ralph Gilles announced that the next generation of the Viper would debut at the New York Auto Show in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viperclub.org/news/news.php?displayType=article&amp;articleID=34|title=Viper Club of America: 2013 SRT Viper Debut Set|accessdate=October 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2013 New York International Auto Show, the all new SRT Viper GTS was unveiled along with plans to enter the car into racing as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/04/04/2013-srt-viper-bites-back-with-640-hp-returns-to-racing-w-vide/|title=2013 SRT Viper bites back with 640 HP, returns to racing|last=Korzeniewski|first=Jeremy|date=April 4, 2012|publisher=Autoblog|accessdate=October 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of Chrysler's plan of turning [[Street and Racing Technology]] (SRT) as a separate vehicle brand within Chrysler Group LLC, the SRT Viper became the brand's halo vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inautonews.com/new-2013-viper-to-inaugurate-independent-srt-brand|title=New 2013 Viper to inaugurate independent SRT brand|accessdate=October 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, the SRT brand was re-consolidated under [[Dodge]], with former ''SRT'' [[CEO]] Ralph Gilles continuing as senior vice president of product design and also as the CEO and president of Motorsports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.chrysler.com/newsrelease.do;jsessionid=8397249783AF91C44AF82E60D8E4299B?&amp;id=15625&amp;mid=1|title=Chrysler Group Announces Leadership Changes|publisher=[[Chrysler Group LLC]]|accessdate=October 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car was renamed back to '''Dodge Viper''' in 2015.

== Specifications ==
SRT offered two versions of the Viper; the SRT Viper and the GTS. The GTS is the premium model offering more creature comforts over the base model. The most notable exterior difference between the two models is the hood. The base model has six functional hood vents while the GTS model only has two. To commemorate the return of the Viper, SRT offered a 'launch edition' package available on 150 GTS models in 2013. All of the launch edition cars were painted in Viper Blue with twin white stripes and came with a serialized dash plaque placed inside their cabins. The interior of the launch edition cars was swathed in Black Laguna leather with contrast stitching.

The SRT Viper GTS includes leather upholstery, accented colors on the seats, doors, center console and stitching; gun metal trim on the cluster bezel, HVAC outlets, window switch bezels, shifter base, park brake bezel and the integrated passenger grab handle on the center console; Sabelt racing seats with Kevlar and fiberglass shell, carbon-fiber hood, roof, decklid and aluminum door panels, split six-spoke forged aluminum "Venom" wheels with polished face and graphite-painted pockets (standard), fully painted Hyper Black or fully painted low-gloss black finished wheels.&lt;ref name="trendzcar.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trendzcar.com/2013-dodge-srt-viper-gts.html|title=2013 Dodge SRT Viper GTS|work=trendzcar.com|accessdate=October 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SRT Viper features a cruise control and controls on the steering wheel. [[In-car Internet|UConnect]] [[Bluetooth]] phone with [[Bluetooth Audio]] streaming is standard, as is an 8.4-inch [[touch screen]] display like that found on the [[Chrysler 300]], [[Dodge Charger]], and [[Dodge Journey]]. It also features an [[Alpine Electronics|Alpine]] [[surround sound]] system and many exterior, interior, and wheel combinations. There is also a four-inch reconfigurable [[Thin-Film Transistor]] display in the gauge cluster to display important vehicle information, system messages, and has controls to turn the [[traction control]], [[stability control]], and other features off. It also has a "Track Mode" with a built-in track timer, "stoplight" countdown timer display, and other features. Power seats, keyless entry, and heated seats are also new options. A [[navigation system]] by [[Garmin]] was also an available option, as were the [[Sirius-XM]] [[satellite radio]] and [[HD radio]]. A built-in [[Hard disk drive|HDD]] for storing music and photos [[JPEG]] and [[MP3]] was also included as standard equipment.

The optional SRT Track Package includes Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires, StopTech slotted two-piece brake rotors and ultra-lightweight wheels in Hyper Black or matte black finishes.

Dodge introduced a new GT package in 2015 to fill the gap between the base Viper and the GTS model. GT buyers got the two-mode, driver-adjustable suspension and five-mode electronic stability control system from the GTS, along with Nappa leather seats with Alcantara accents and contrast stitching.

== Performance ==
The Viper (VX I) is powered by an all-aluminium {{convert|8382|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} V10 engine. The engine initially generated {{convert|640|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 6,150 rpm and {{convert|600|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,950 rpm but in 2015, power was raised by 5&amp;nbsp;hp for a total of {{cvt|645|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

The Viper could accelerate from {{cvt|0-60|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}} in 3.5 seconds and could attain a top speed of {{cvt|208|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}}.

== Variants ==
'''ACR'''
[[File:2016 Dodge SRT Viper ACR.jpg|thumb|2016 Dodge Viper ACR (Phase VX I)]]
At SEMA 2014, Dodge presented a Viper ACR concept car based on the new VX I platform. After many rumors and speculations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everythingdodge.com/blog/viper-acr-returning-for-2016|title=Viper ACR will be returning for 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the car was eventually introduced in 2015 for the 2016 model year. The base price of the 2016 ACR was US$121,395 in the United States and CA$159,995 in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2016-dodge-viper-acr-official-photos-and-info-news|title=2016 Dodge Viper ACR Has More Wing, More Adjustability than You Can Rattle a Snake At - Official Photos and Info|access-date=October 22, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 Viper ACR came installed with an all-new aerodynamic body kit made from carbon fiber, that included a new front splitter and a fixed carbon fiber rear wing, altogether producing a total of {{convert|680.5|kg|lbs|0|abbr=on}} of downforce at corners. The {{convert|8382|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} [[Viper engine|Viper V10 engine]] generated the same power output {{convert|645|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 6,200 rpm and {{convert|600|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 5,000 rpm as in all other Viper trims. The brakes were from [[Brembo]], with discs and calipers built specifically for the car. The discs were now [[carbon ceramic]], a first for the Viper series. The braking system contains {{convert|391|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} discs with 6-piston calipers up front, and {{convert|360|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} discs with 4-piston calipers down the rear. The tires were from [[Kumho Tire|Kumho]], using a set of tires called the Kumho Ecsta V720 ACR, a variant of the V720 specifically built for the ACR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tirerack.com/tires/BigPic.jsp?tireMake=Kumho&amp;tireModel=Ecsta+V720+ACR&amp;sidewall=Blackwall|title=SuperView of the Kumho Ecsta V720 ACR|website=www.tirerack.com|language=en|access-date=October 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front tires are P295/25R19Z, slightly smaller than the regular Viper, and P355/30R19Z at the rear. Suspension system is manufactured by [[ThyssenKrupp|Bilstein]], which has 10 settings for rebound and compression tuning for the dampers.

The options for the car are very diverse, like all of the other Viper trims. One example is the ACR Extreme Aero Package, which was the same package used to help the car break a total of 14 track lap records.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fastestlaps.com/articles/dodge-viper-acr-goes-ham-on-13-tracks-spanks-porsche-918|title=Dodge Viper ACR goes "HAM" on 14 tracks, "spanks" Porsche 918 - FastestLaps.com|website=fastestlaps.com|language=en-US|access-date=October 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The package included the addition of a removable extended front splitter extension, a new adjustable dual-element rear wing, four dive planes, six removable diffuser strakes, removable brake ducts, and removable hood louvers, and if removed, will reveal a hood gap. This helped the car produce an extra {{convert|227|kg|lbs|0|abbr=on}} of downforce at corners, for a total of {{convert|907|kg|lbs|0|abbr=on}}. With this package, the top speed was reduced at only {{convert|177|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}} instead of {{convert|191|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}} because of the massive downforce produced by the car. At top speed, the car produces {{convert|799.5|kg|lbs|0|abbr=on}} of downforce, the most of any production car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbuzz.com/m/article.aspx?Id=33636|title=These Are The Things Most People Don’t Know About The Hypercar Killing Dodge Viper ACR|publisher=CarBuzz|access-date=October 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TA'''&lt;br&gt;The '''T'''ime '''A'''ttack (TA) model was introduced in 2013 and had two variants, 1.0 and 2.0, each variant different from the other. The number of 2015&amp;ndash;2017 TA package 1.0 and 2.0 cars produced is unknown but the numbers are relatively low. To add to the confusion, the full TA 1.0 or 2.0 package could be added to the GTC one of one configuration. Also, besides the original run of 2014 TA 1.0 with the production number being stated as xx/33 (or xx/93 for the orange TA 1.0). The TAs built from 2015 to 2017 were numbered in sequence. For example, #11 was built in 2015 and #22 in 2016.

The 1.0 was sold by SRT and was made as a small enhancement for the Viper GTS.

Power stayed the same as the standard car, {{convert|645|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|600|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}, but the top speed dropped to {{convert|193|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}} because of the car's aerodynamic additions.&lt;ref name="caranddriver.com"&gt;2014 SRT Viper TA First Drive – Review – Car and Driver: [http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2014-srt-viper-ta-first-drive-review 2014 SRT Viper TA First Drive – Review – Car and Driver], accessdate: 20. tammikuuta 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The car now had the addition of the Advanced Aerodynamic Package (two-piece front corner splitters and a rear decklid spoiler made from carbon fiber), lightweight Sidewinder II wheels finished in matte-black, [[Pirelli]] P Zero Corsa tires, two-mode (Street and Race) [[ThyssenKrupp|Bilstein]] DampTronic suspension adapted from the GTS, but with firmer levels of damping and a smaller spread between modes, shock dampers, increased spring rates and thicker anti-roll bars, carbon fiber underhood X-brace (instead of the aluminium brace in all other models), carbon fiber rear tail light applique from the Exterior Carbon Fiber Accent Package, two-piece Brembo brake rotors with wider brake annulus, black-anodized [[Brembo]] brake calipers painted with the Viper logo in TA Orange, TA logos behind both front wheels and a Stryker decal instead of the standard badge on the hood (TA Orange on the Venom Black cars, black on the TA Orange and Venom White cars), black interior with TA Orange accent stitching on the ballistic cloth seats, instrument panel &amp; cowl, center stack, console, hand brake, shifter boot, and door panels. The aerodynamic package adds {{convert|200|lb|kg}} of downforce at {{convert|100|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="caranddriver.com" /&gt; The car's mileage is 12 [[Miles per gallon|mpg]] in city, and 19 mpg on the highway.

On March 18, 2013 MotorTrend tested the SRT Viper TA in [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca]], setting the production car lap record in 1:33.62, besting the previous lap time holder [[Chevrolet Corvette C6 ZR1|Chevrolet Corvette ZR1]]'s 1:33.70 lap time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Motor Trend Channel|title=New SRT Viper TA Strikes Back! - Ignition Episode 58|date=2013-03-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLa3l_UX77c|accessdate=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TA edition returned for the 2015 model year and was called the TA 2.0 (but the TA 1.0 was still available up to and including the last model year, 2017). This model was sold by Dodge.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gearheads.org/dodge-decide-to-upgrade-to-the-dodge-viper-ta-2-0/|title=Dodge Decide To Upgrade To The Dodge Viper TA 2.0|date=2015-02-27|work=GearHeads.org|access-date=2017-05-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2.0 part of the moniker refers to the updated aero package, which incorporates a bigger rear wing, new front dive planes, and a new carbon-fiber front splitter. The package improves downforce to 400 pounds at 150&amp;nbsp;mph versus the 2014 Viper TA's 278 pounds at 150&amp;nbsp;mph. The internal parts had also been improved, with a much better suspension setup, new two-piece [[Brembo]] rotors, and improved shocks, dampers, springs, and stabilizer bars. The car also has an improved X-brace.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The car's power output also stayed the same like the 1.0. However, the data was based on the Dodge version of the Viper, not the SRT version. Unlike the 1.0, the car is able to keep the {{convert|206|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}} top speed. The car's mileage was improved in the 2.0 version, with 13 mpg in city, and 20 mpg on the highway.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''GTC'''&lt;br&gt;The GTC model was introduced in 2015, and had a customization program that offered 8,000 colors and 24,000 hand-painted stripes, 10 wheel choices, 16 interior trims, 6 aero options, and an undisclosed amount of standalone options to choose from. There were a total of 25 million possible build combinations.&lt;ref name="drivesrt.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drivesrt.com/2015/viper/1of1/|title=Dodge Viper GTC 1 of 1 Program {{!}} driveSRT|website=SRT|language=en|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Road &amp; Track"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/news/a24705/2015-dodge-viper-gtc-is-customizable-expensive/|title=Dodge Viper GTC offers 8,000 colors, 24,000 stripes|date=2015-01-08|work=Road &amp; Track|access-date=2017-05-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2015/01/08/2015-dodge-viper-gtc-1-of-1-free-customs/|title=2015 Dodge Viper GTC available in 25 million no-cost combos with 1 Of 1 bespoke program|author=Login|date=2015-01-08|publisher=Autoblog.com|accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordering a GTC enrolled a customer in a unique VIP program called Viper Concierge, which according to Dodge, "offers an exclusive point of contact throughout the custom Viper build process." The Concierge process started with the ordering stage, which included Dodge sending customers a paint chip confirming the owner's choice. Shortly thereafter, Dodge sent buyers a 1:18-scale "speed-form" replica in their chosen custom colors, to confirm or deny the build. Once the buyer's color and option selection was locked-in, that car became a one-of-one Viper for that year – no other buyer would be permitted to build a Viper to the same specifications.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Lap records ==
In October 2015, the ACR gained a 7:01.67 laptime at the Nürburgring Nordscheleife with the Extreme Aero Package, which was run by SRT, and lapped by their test driver [[Dominik Farnbacher]]. Unfortunately, the lap was unofficial according to SRT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://horsepowerkings.com/rumor-did-the-2016-viper-acr-crack-off-a-701-67-nurburgring-lap-time-back-in-october/|title=The 2016 Viper ACR cracked off a 7:01.67 Nurburgring lap time back in October|date=2015-11-03|work=HorsepowerKings.com|access-date=October 22, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A crowdfund attempt started by volunteer Russ Oasis in 2017 on the GoFundMe funding platform began collecting funds to reclaim the lap record on the Nürburgring. Crowdfunding ended up being as high as $198,000. He eventually found himself supported by 377 people, and sponsorship and assistance from [[Kumho Tire]] (tire supplier), Prefix Performance (formally known as Arrow Performance) (logistics and parts supplier), [[Viper Exchange Racing|ViperExchange]] (car loaners), and Fox Pro Films (lap filming). SRT test driver, racing driver, and former Nürburgring record holder [[Dominik Farnbacher]] returned to the track to help the group retake the record. Racing drivers Luca Stolz, Mario Farnbacher, and [[Lance David Arnold]] came in as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1111714_dodge-viper-acr-prepares-for-nrburgring-lap-record-assault|title=Dodge Viper ACR prepares for Nürburgring lap record assault|last=Vijayenthiran|first=Viknesh|date=July 25, 2017|work=Motor Authority|access-date=October 22, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their target was the second position in street legal vehicles category. The [[Lamborghini Huracán|Lamborghini Huracán Performante]] holding the position at that time had a lap time of 6:52.01. The group went through three attempts, with the lap times of 7:03.45 (set by Dominik Farnbacher), 7:03.23 (set by Mario Farnbacher), and 7:01.30 (set by [[Lance David Arnold]]), respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/motorsports/a10349049/2017-dodge-viper-gts-r-nurburgring-ring-lap-time-farnbacher/|title=2017 Dodge Viper GTS-R Sets Unofficial 7:03.45 Lap Time in First Nurburgring Attempt|date=July 26, 2017|work=Road &amp; Track|access-date=October 22, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a12096594/dodge-viper-acr-nurburgring-record-attempt-two/|title=The Dodge Viper Has Gone Slightly Quicker at the Nürburgring|last=Lomas|first=Dale|date=August 26, 2018|publisher=Road &amp; Track|access-date=October 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jalopnik.com/crowdfunded-dodge-viper-acr-nurburgring-lap-effort-sets-1798729829|title=Crowdfunded Dodge Viper ACR Nürburgring Lap Effort Sets Impressive 7:01.3 Time Before Crashing Out|last=Westbrook|first=Justin T.|work=Jalopnik|access-date=October 22, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their three-day trip to [[Nürburg]], Germany ended with a crashed Viper ACR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2017/09/one-nurburgring-record-attempt-viper-acrs-crashed.html|title=One of the Nurburgring Record Attempt Viper ACRs Has Crashed » AutoGuide.com News|date=September 1, 2017|work=AutoGuide.com News|access-date=October 22, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the failure of surpassing the Huracán Performante, the team was still able to make the Viper ACR the fastest American, rear-wheel driven (with no additional assistance), and manual transmission equipped car to go around the track. Their lap time also brought the car to [[List of Nürburgring Nordschleife lap times|fifth position for street legal vehicles]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/motorsports/a12159736/dodge-viper-acr-sets-7013-lap-time-in-final-nurburgring-lap/|title=Dodge Viper ACR Sets 7:01.3 Lap Time in Final Nurburgring Attempt|date=September 1, 2017|work=Road &amp; Track|access-date=October 22, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
Sales of the Viper in 2013 and 2014 was poor. Production was reduced by 1/3 in October, 2013 and then halted for two months in April, 2014 amid slow sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/srt-viper-production-halted-amid-slow-sales|title=SRT Viper production halted amid slow sales|date=March 10, 2014|publisher=Autoweek|accessdate=October 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Fiat Chrysler group announced that the Viper would end production in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/viper-cease-production-2017|title=Dodge Viper to cease production in 2017, labor agreement reveals|date=October 16, 2015|publisher=Autoweek|accessdate=October 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Fiat Chrysler cited poor sales as a reason for discontinuing the Viper; however, other sources have stated the car was discontinued because the Viper was unable to comply with [[FMVSS 226]] safety regulation, which requires side curtain air bags.&lt;ref name="Mike Connor"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Connor |url=http://www.motortrend.com/news/the-dodge-viper-is-being-axed-because-it-cant-fit-curtain-airbags/?sm_id=social_aumomotortrendhub_MotorTrend_20160116_57322616&amp;adbid=688284564255473665&amp;adbpl=tw&amp;adbpr=25383000 |title=Dodge Viper Axed Because it Can’t Fit Curtain Airbags |publisher=Motortrend.com |date=2016-01-13 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, Fiat Chrysler announced they would be permanently closing the Conner Assembly Plant on August 31, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2017/07/13/detroit-viper-factory-closing-after-fiat-chrysler-stops-production/|title=Fiat Chrysler Ends Viper Production, Closes Detroit Plant|author=|date=|website=fortune.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrysler announced five special edition Vipers for the final model year of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torquenews.com/106/dodge-viper-production-end-2017-5-special-models|title=Dodge Viper Production to End in 2017 with 5 Special Models - Torque News|author=|date=|website=torquenews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dodge Crusader''' is an automobile built by [[Dodge|Dodge Canada]]. Initially introduced in 1951, the original Crusader was a [[badge engineering|rebadged]] [[Plymouth Cambridge]] fitted with a long-block {{convert|218|cuin|cc|0|abbr=on}} [[straight-six engine|flathead-six engine]].&lt;ref name="allpar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allpar.com/world/canada.html |title=Chrysler Canada, 1924 to 2014 |publisher=Allpar.com |accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 1954, the Crusader nameplate was switched to a rebadged version of the [[Plymouth Plaza]], and it remained in production until 1958.&lt;ref name="allpar"/&gt;

The '''D/W series''' was a line of [[pickup truck]]s that was sold by [[Dodge]] from 1961 to 1993. The same basic design was retained until the 1994 introduction of a completely redesigned Ram. The D/W series shared its [[Chrysler AD platform|AD platform]] with the [[Dodge Ramcharger|Dodge Ramcharger/Plymouth Trail Duster]] twins. 4x2 models were designated D, while 4x4 models were designated W.

The [[Chrysler A engine]] of 318 {{nowrap|cu in}} (5.211&amp;nbsp;l) was the smallest V8 option; and all of [[Chrysler B engine|Chrysler's larger engines]], with the notable exception of the [[Chrysler Hemi engine]], were available as factory options. The original design was built until the spring of 1965, when the facelifted, single-headlamp version arrived.

[[File:1964 Dodge D-200 Pick-Up (27785841323).jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of a 1964 D-200]]
Besides straight-sided beds (called Sweptline), the D series also offered step-sided narrow beds (called Utiline) in {{convert|6.5|ft|abbr=on}} (D-100 only), {{convert|8|ft|abbr=on}} (D-100 and 200), and {{convert|9|ft|abbr=on}} (D-300 only) lengths.

The first generation of the D series was manufactured in Warren, Michigan. They were given the Dodge and [[Fargo (truck)|Fargo]] brands. The trucks were produced by the Dodge Division of the Chrysler Corporation.

===Custom Sports Special and high-performance package===
1964 saw the introduction of the sporty Custom Sports Special. The Custom Sports Special included bucket seats, console, carpeting and racing stripes. The optional high-performance package could be ordered with a CSS truck or by itself on a base model truck complete with Chrysler's big 426 {{nowrap|cu in}} (6.981&amp;nbsp;l) [[Chrysler RB engine#426|wedge-head]] [[V8 engine|V8]]. This engine produced 365&amp;nbsp;hp (272&amp;nbsp;kW) and 470&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (637 N·m)—in line with the [[muscle-car]] revolution that was then sweeping Detroit. The high-performance package also included the LoadFlite [[automatic transmission]], a 6000&amp;nbsp;rpm-rated Sun tachometer with heavy-duty gauges, power steering, dual exhaust and rear axle torque rods (traction bars) sourced from 1961 [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]]s. Custom Sports Special trucks were produced from 1964 to 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cssregistry.com/css/whatis.html|title=1964 CSS sales brochure|website=www.cssregistry.com|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The High Performance Package was only offered from 1964 to early 1966.

===1965–67===
[[File:'66 Fargo (Auto classique Laval '11).JPG|thumb|left|1966 Fargo, sold only in Canada as a Dodge D-series clone]]
The D series was mildly redesigned in spring of 1965, hence there are both two-headlight and four-headlight models titled as 1965s. Updates for mid-'65 included a wider tailgate and the replacement of the [[Chrysler A engine|A-series]] engines with the updated [[Chrysler LA engine|LA series]], as well as a six-inch wheelbase stretch on {{convert|8|ft|abbr=on}} bed models. In 1967, the D-series trucks received [[big-block]] 383 2-barrel engines as a standard option.

From 1965 until the early 80s, D-series trucks were assembled in Warren, Michigan by the Chrysler Corporation. Foreign models were manufactured by the Automotive Equipment Group (מכשירי תנועה בע"מ) in Israel at a new factory located at Nazareth-I'llit: [[Automotive Industries]] (תעשיות רכב נצרת-עלית), using straight-four and -six gasoline engines with manual transmission. This factory also produced the [[Jeep Wagoneer]] SUV for the Israeli army, and UK [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] and [[Ford Transit]] vehicles for the civilian market. The D series were made both for the civilian market and for the Israeli army. The models were D100 &amp; D200 light trucks, D500 truck, and the D600 truck with the straight-six engine and having on-demand four-wheel drive. There was also a bus version made (mainly for army use). This bus was a 20-seat bus built on the chassis of the D500 truck using the straight-four engine with front and rear hydraulic doors, as well as the complete D500 front end and dashboard.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===1968–71===
[[File:Dodge-D-Series.jpg|thumb|left|1968–1970 Dodge D series]]

The 1968 models received a new front grille—two rows of four holes each. A new Adventurer trim package replaced the old Custom Sports Special; basically, it included a padded front seat with vinyl trim (either full bench or buckets with console) and carpeting, plus other hallmarks such as extra chrome trim and courtesy lighting. This generation continued to be built in South Africa as well. Sold as the D300 or the D500, the lighter model received the 225 Slant-Six, while the heavier-duty D500 has the 318&amp;nbsp;ci V8. Power outputs are {{convert|127|and|177|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} (net), respectively; SAE claims are 140 and 212&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref name=ZA71&gt;{{citation | type = brochure | title = Dodge D300 and D500 | publisher = Chrysler South Africa | location = Pretoria, South Africa | pages = 3–4 | date = 1971 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1970, the Adventurer would be expanded into three separate packages: the base Adventurer, the Adventurer Sport and the top-line Adventurer SE. The Adventurer SE included such things as a chrome grille, wood trim on the dashboard, the padded vinyl front seat with color-keyed seatbelts, full courtesy lighting, extra insulation, dual horns, full carpeting, luxury door panel trim, a vinyl-embossed trim strip ran along the sides of the truck, full wheel discs and a woodgrain-insert panel on the tailgate. The 1970 models also featured a new four-section grille (two rows of two holes each).

==="The Dude"===
In August 1969, the "Dude Sport Trim Package" was released. This was essentially the D100 already in production, with an added black or white body-side "C" stripe decal; a Dodge Dude decal on the box at the rear marker lamps; tail lamp bezel trim; and dog dish hub caps with trim rings. The Dude's tailgate was unique, featuring a Dodge decal on a flat tailgate surface, without the typical tailgate's embossed logo. The Dudes were only offered in the 1970 and 1971 model years and only 1,500 to 2,000 Dudes were produced.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allpar.com/trucks/dodge/dude.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dodgedude.com/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;

A redesign of the D series for 1972 introduced a more rounded look. This redesign, which lasted until 1980 with minor changes, included new features such as an [[independent front suspension]] and pocketed taillights (the distinctive reverse-on-top lights were recessed to {{convert|.25|in|mm|abbr=on}} to avoid damage in loading docks and confined spaces). Styling cues, such as the scalloped hood and rounded fenderwells, were similar to the rounded, smooth look of the 1971 [[Plymouth Satellite]]. These trucks were built with a considerable amount of galvanized steel to resist rust and corrosion, making them very durable.

Dodge pioneered the [[Pickup truck#extended cab|extended-cab]] pickup with the introduction of the Club Cab with the 1973 models.  Available with either a {{convert|6.5|ft|abbr=on}} or {{convert|8|ft|abbr=on}} Sweptline bed, the Club Cab was a two-door cab with small rear windows which had more space behind the seats than the standard cab, but was not as long as the four-door crew cab. Inward-facing jump seats were available, providing room for five passengers. 1974 saw the introduction of the 440 {{nowrap|cu in}} engine as an option for the light trucks, as well as a "Dyna-Trac" dual-rear-wheel option on D300 pickups with a {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}} GVWR.

The 1972 D series was made famous in the television show ''[[Emergency!]],'' where a D300 chassis cab was the featured [[paramedic]] rescue squad vehicle for all seven seasons.

[[File:Dodge Lil Red Express.jpg|thumb|left|1978 Li'l Red Express truck]]
Notable models produced during this era were the 1978–1979 '''Li'l Red Express''', the '''[[Dodge Warlock|Warlock]]''', the '''Macho Power Wagon''', the '''Macho Power Wagon Top Hand''', '''Macho Power Wagon Palomino''', and the '''Adventurer'''. The colors of the Dodge Macho Power Wagon Palomino were the same as a Palomino horse (all Li'l Red Express trucks were Adventurers, though the reverse was not true).  The Li'l Red Express was not available for sale in California, Florida, Maryland, Oregon and Washington and did not meet special noise standards in certain locations.  Because of this The Midnight Express was born.
The Midnight Express was not a factory option like the Li'l Red Express, it was a dealer installed package.  Dealers that could not sell the Li'l Red Express used high optioned Warlock's, repainted them metallic black and ordered all of the Li'l Red Express parts through there parts department.  The Midnight Express was available for the 1978 model year only. This truck was equipped much like the Li'l Red Express with exhaust stacks, wheels, and gold pinstriping. The Midnite Express was painted black instead of red and featured a "Midnite Express Truck" decal on the door. Most Midnite Express trucks were powered by the 440 engine, instead of the 360 like the Li'l Red Express. All of these trucks were considered "lifestyle" pickups and were marketed to an audience that wanted specialty, personal-use trucks.

The 1978 models also saw the introduction of the first [[Diesel engine|diesel]] powered Dodge pickup truck. Available as an economy choice in light-duty trucks and [[Dodge B series|B-series vans]] was Mitsubishi's [[List of Mitsubishi Fuso engines#6DRx|6DR5]] 4.0&amp;nbsp;L inline six-cylinder [[naturally aspirated engine|naturally-aspirated]] diesel, rated at {{convert|105|hp|kW|abbr=on}} at 3500&amp;nbsp;rpm, and ~230 N·m (~169 {{nowrap|lb·ft}}) at 2200&amp;nbsp;rpm. The diesel used standard Dodge manual and automatic transmissions via specially made adapter plate which had the LA V8 bolt pattern. This rare factory option, VIN code H, was the result of fuel crisis and the collaboration of Chrysler and Mitsubishi.&lt;ref name=curbside&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.curbsideclassic.com/automotive-histories/automotive-history-the-case-of-the-very-rare-1978-dodge-diesel-pickup-and-the-non-existent-diesel-van/ | title = The Case Of The Very Rare 1978 Dodge Diesel Pickup And The Missing Diesel Van | last = Niedermeyer | first = Paul | date = 2012-11-26 | accessdate = 2014-05-13 | work = Automotive History | publisher = Curbside Classics }}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine, while being trustworthy and having far better economy than any other engine in the Dodge lineup at the time, suffered from low power output and was considered to be underpowered by American standards, even though it was previously used in the Japanese 3.5-ton [[cab-over]] Mitsubishi T44 Jupiter Truck and in industrial applications. Because of the low sales, it was phased out quickly, and as a result, it became practically a single-year specialty.
[[File:USA_Aut%C3%B3_2008_-_002.jpg|thumb|D200-based M880 [[CUCV]]]]
Thousands of D-series trucks entered military service as the M880 series [[CUCV]].

===Dodge Ram (1981–93)===
{{Main|Ram Pickup}}
[[File:1983 Dodge D150 Sweptline.jpg|thumb|1983 Dodge Ram D150 shortbed]]

This final generation received a facelift in 1981 when the D series was rebadged as the [[Ram Pickup|Dodge Ram]] pickup around when [[Lee Iacocca]] took charge of the ailing Chrysler Corporation. Such things including an embossed "DODGE RAM" name on the tailgate along with other obvious changes like the grille and hood, the taillights, and the entire interior. More subtle was the addition of a "shoulder" line reminiscent of the GM competition. Beginning in 1982, even more corrosion-resistant steel was used in the construction of the trucks. This body style continued until 1993 and many of these vehicles are still on the road. Many body panels are interchangeable for all models from 1972–1993, so it is not uncommon to see a "hybrid" with, as an example, a 1978 grille mounted with a 1974 hood and a 1991 cab. Sometimes the bed is swapped with a [[box truck|moving truck style box]] for models like these. In most jurisdictions, the year is dictated by the year of the truck's chassis regardless of the body which has been bolted to it. Also kept was the narrow Utiline bed that dated back to the 1940s; this was dropped in 1985. Throttle-body injection was introduced in 1988.

A narrower range of engines was offered: the base power plant was the  {{convert|225|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine|slant-6]], now with top-fed hydraulic [[tappet]]s, and the {{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler LA engine#360 V8|LA-series V8]]s. The slant-6 was supplanted by the {{convert|237|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} V6 for 1988; in 1992 it and the V8s became [[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 5.2|Magnum]] engines. The 6BT {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} 12-Valve Cummins [[Cummins B Series engine#B5.9|B-series diesel engine]] became an option in 1989.

Sales were good during the Sweptline era and into the late 1970s. A combination of stagnant styling that was nearly two decades old plus brand loyalty primarily to [[Chevrolet]] and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] during the 1980s and 1990s reduced sales volume for the first-generation Dodge Ram. A wholly [[Ram Pickup#Second generation .281994.E2.80.932001.2F2002.3B BR.2FBE.29|new Dodge Ram]] was released for the 1994 model year.

The '''Cashuat''' is an armored personnel carrier produced in [[El Salvador]], and based on the [[Dodge M37|Dodge M37B1]] ¾ ton (4×4) truck.  

==History==
The first military vehicle ever produced in [[El Salvador]], the Cashuat was designed by [[Salvadoran Army]] Colonel [[Oswaldo Marenco Carballo]] (1955 - ) in 1984, with a prototype being built and trialed in-country in February 1985.  During the trials, it was found that this particular prototype lacked sufficient ballistic protection, so the Salvadoran government sought assistance from the [[United States]].  Seeing that El Salvador didn't have manufacturing facilities capable of building the number of vehicles required, the US Army Tank Automotive Command's RDE Center's Design and Manufacturing Technology Directorate proposed a three-step plan to produce the vehicles:

1. A second, improved prototype would be built in Detroit, and sent to El Salvador to serve as a reference model.&lt;br/&gt;
2. The armor would be cut and welded in the United States, pre-assembled with the windshields and side-rails, and shipped as kits to El Salvador.&lt;br/&gt;
3. Train a cadre of welders from El Salvador at facilities in the United States.

66 kits were provided for final assembly in El Salvador, one for each of the M37s in the [[Salvadoran Army]]'s inventory.

The '''Dodge Polara''' is an automobile introduced in the United States for the 1960 [[model year]] as [[Dodge]]'s top-of-the-line [[full-size car]]; after the introduction of the [[Dodge Custom 880]] in 1962, the Polara nameplate designated a step below the full sized best trimmed Dodge model; the Polara that year had been downsized to what was in effect intermediate, or [[Mid-size car|mid-size]] status. In its various forms, the Polara name was used by Dodge until 1973, when its position in Dodge's line-up was replaced by the [[Dodge Monaco]]. The name Polara is a reference to the [[Polaris]] star, in a marketing attempt to appeal to the excitement surrounding the [[Space Race]] during the early 1960s. The Polara was a competitor to the [[Ford Galaxie 500]] and the [[Chevrolet Impala]].

The 1960 model year marked the first year that all [[Chrysler]] models, except for the [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]], used [[unibody]] construction.

The 1960 Polara and other full-sized Dodges featured styling cues carried over from 1959 models, itself an evolution of [[Virgil Exner]]'s "[[Forward Look]]" cars introduced in 1957. The top-of-the line Polara and [[Dodge Matador]] continued to ride on the {{convert|122|in|mm|0|sing=on}} wheelbase of their predecessors, while a new line-up of still full-sized [[Dodge Dart]]s rode on a shorter {{convert|118|in|mm|0|sing=on}} wheelbase. The Polara was available as a 2-door [[convertible]], 2-door [[hardtop]], 4-door hardtop [[sedan (car)|sedan]], 4-door hardtop [[station wagon]], and conventional (pillared) 4-door sedan. 

Like these cars, both 1960 full-sized Dodges continued with the make's styling hallmarks of stacked "jet pod" tail lights, however, the size of the lights was greatly increased compared to the previous year's lamps, with the lower lights set into the rear bumper. The design also incorporated Dodge's trademark shortened tail fins, which, on the Polara, included small vertical tail light lenses placed on the vertical surface at the back of the fin; again, the purpose of the shortened fin was meant to exaggerate the length of the "jet pods" holding the tail lights.

The fins on Darts were shorter both in length and height because unlike the full sized Dodge's, the Polara and Matador, the Darts were based on the Plymouth and used much Plymouth sheet metal forms and the Plymouth rear door. The Plymouth rear door did not have any part of the fin whereas on the full sized Dodges the fin actually started on the rear door (on the 4-doors) and continued back from there. This allowed the fin to start sooner, on the door, and end sooner, relative to the tip of the round tail light and still appear as long or longer than on the Dart. The net effect was that the fins on the Dart look stunted whereas on the Polara and Matador the fins appear in proper proportion to the rest of the car. Up front, the car featured a small grille consisting of eight stacks of anodized aluminum rectangles nested in a massive (and complex) chrome front bumper assembly. As the top model in the line-up, the Polara featured better interior fabrics and trim treatments. Polaras also received more trim on the outside of the car, most notably a chrome stone guard aft of the rear wheel housings, a full-length chrome spear, and a wide chrome base to the chrome spear atop the headlight housings.

[[File:Mopar National img 0005 (35014322981).jpg|thumb|left|1961 Dodge Polara sedan]]

For 1961, Dodge dropped the Matador, leaving the Polara as the sole "senior" Dodge model. Darts on the shorter wheelbase continued. For 1961, Exner's styling department reversed the car's fins, making them taller as they flowed toward the rear window. As the fins sloped towards the rear of the car, they cut slightly towards the center (to allow the single tail light housing on each side) of the rear of the vehicle, wrapping downward and then back along the side fender to form a C-shaped line accentuated in chrome. The overall effect made the rear of the car seem to "pucker" from the angles the design created. Up front, the massive bumper treatments that had been a Dodge hallmark since 1957 were replaced with a simple bar design, above which was a massive concave grille shared with the Dodge Dart.

The 1961 styling overhaul of the Dodge line-up was different from anything else on the US market at that time (save the 1961 [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]], which was equally unique in its styling) and consumers voted on the 1961 restyle with their car-shopping dollars. Sales of fullsize Dodges plunged to their lowest levels since the firms founding in 1914, with only 14,032 units produced in the United States. For the second straight year, the make was carried by the Dart which saw sales of 142,000 units for the year. Total Dodge sales for 1961 were down 53% compared to 1960, dropping the make from sixth in the American market to ninth place.

}}

All Dodge models were redesigned with a smaller, lighter, sculpted body on a {{convert|116|in|mm|0|sing=on}} wheelbase for 1962. This was the first Chrysler B-Body. This move came after Chrysler's president overheard and misunderstood [[Chevrolet]] chief [[Ed Cole]] to have said Chevrolet's largest cars would be downsized for 1962. Chrysler designers were forced to take the planned 1962 Dodge full-size line and shorten the design to fit a more compact wheelbase in a last-minute effort to compete with what was supposed to be a smaller new Chevrolet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/reviews/1962/sport-fury.html |title=1962 Plymouth Sport Fury car reviews |last=Redgap |first=Curtis |publisher=allpar.com |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chevrolet in fact offered a range of truly full-size cars for 1962, and Dodge and Plymouth alike were stuck with smaller cars the public and motoring press found stylistically awkward. The new Dodge models were sized closer to [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]'s new intermediate Fairlane than to Ford's or GM's full-size models.

Quickly realizing the critical mistake they had made, Dodge hurriedly put together a new full-size car using the front end from the 1961 Dodge Polara and the body from the 1962 Chrysler. This new full-size model was known as the '''[[Dodge Custom 880|Custom 880]]''', and became Dodge's top-of-the-line model when it was introduced on January 21, 1962. In 1963 a lower specification version was offered, known simply the '''Dodge 880'''. A/C was $455.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunnell |first=John |title=standard catalog of American Muscle Cars 1960–1972 |year=2006 |publisher=Krause Publications |isbn=0-89689-433-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the B-Bodied 1962 Dodges was a bucket-seated sporty model called the '''Polara 500'''. It was available as a two-door hardtop and a convertible, and a 4-door hardtop was added in December. Standard equipment included a 305-horsepower 361 cubic inch V8 with four-barrel carburetion and dual exhaust. Positioned beneath the Polara 500 in descending order were the '''Dart 440''' and the '''Dart 330'''. For 1962 there was no model named simply "Polara." These models were marketed in Canada as the '''Dodge 440''' and '''Dodge 330''', and a Canada-only basic-spec '''Dodge 220''' model was offered as well.

The Dodges were available with optional [[V8 engine]]s of up to {{convert|413|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}. These mid-sized Dodges (and similar models from Plymouth) competed successfully as stock cars in [[NASCAR]] races, and in stock-automatic classes in drag racing, where their smaller size and lighter weight gave them an advantage over the larger cars from Ford and General Motors.

The basic body of the 1962 model continued until 1964, revised and lengthened by the new Chrysler Vice President of styling [[Elwood Engel]]. The Polara range eventually grew to include a 4-door sedan. For 1963 and 1964, the Polara 500 was available only as a convertible or hardtop [[coupé]].

For the 1963 model year, the wheelbase was increased to {{convert|119|in|mm|0}} and the car received new sheet metal. The Dart name was reassigned to Dodge's line of compact cars that had previously been known as the [[Dodge Lancer]]. Positioned below the Polara were the plain 440 and 330. The 1964 models received a revised front end and new [[Automotive lighting|tail lamps]] to distinguish them from the 1963 cars. Rear end treatment took its inspiration from the Chevrolet Impala, the Polara models now featuring six small, square-shaped taillights (three on each side) surrounded by an attractive bright trim panel. Lesser mid-size Dodges featured only four taillights (two on each side) and lacked the bright trim panel. A new "C" pillar for the hardtop coupes, combined with the more attractive front and rear end styling, made the '64s look totally new (and longer/ lower/wider as well), resulting in a significant increase of sales over 1963.

The Polara 500 continued as Dodge's sporty mid-size model, competing with the full-size Ford Galaxie 500/XL and Chevrolet's Impala Super Sport, featuring an engine-turned anodized aluminum trim strip along the car's flanks, bucket seats and deluxe vinyl upholstery.

For 1965, Chrysler moved the Polara back to a [[Chrysler C platform|Chrysler "C" fullsize platform]] that was shared with Chrysler and Plymouth models. Once again offered in a full range of bodies (sedans, hardtops, station wagons, etc.), the Polara, in effect, replaced the 880 and remained a step below the Custom 880, and the new [[Dodge Monaco|Monaco]] hardtop coupe was now Dodge's top model. The previous mid-sized Dodges that were sold under the names Polara 500, Polara, 440, and 330 continued in production under the name [[Dodge Coronet]], their wheelbase shrinking to {{convert|117|in|mm|0}}. These Polaras were criticized for low fuel economy, with some configurations going only 12 miles on a gallon of gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;

The 1967 models included new U.S. Government-required safety package that featured an energy-absorbing steering column and safety steering wheel, blunt dashboard controls, more interior padding, and a dual-circuit brake master cylinder. The 1968 model years added outboard front shoulder belts and side marker lights in addition to the 1967 safety equipment.

One constant of the 1965 to 1968 models was taut, square-edged styling, which was [[Planned obsolescence|updated each year]]. From 1965 to 1970, the Polara would be the only full-sized Dodge available in the U.S. as a convertible.

The new 1969 Polara wore a broad-shouldered streamlined design called the "Fuselage Design", which would continue for the next five model years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yPwcDJ10TtAC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=Dodge+did+away+with+the+fuselage+design+introduced+in+1969 |page=161 |title=American Cars, 1973-1980: Every Model, Year by Year |first=J. Kelly |last=Flory, Jr. |publisher=McFarland |year=2012 |isbn=9780786456369 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; New safety requirements included front seat head restraints.

For 1969, the Polara 500 was reintroduced as a mid-level series between the standard Polara and top-of-the-line Monaco. The Polara 500 was available as either a convertible or hardtop coupe. Available powerplants included 318, 383, and 440 cubic-inch [[V8 engine|V8]] engines, along with a 225 cubic-inch [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine|slant-6]] engine. The 1969 Dodge Polara models offered the '''Super-Lite''' option, which placed a quartz auxiliary "turnpike beam" [[headlamp]] in the driver side grille.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fuselage.de/dod69/69dod_superlite_b.jpg |title=Dodge Super-Lite information &amp; spec sheet |date= |accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Polara 2001 01.jpg|thumb|left|1970 Dodge Polara]]

In 1970, the Polara received new front and rear styling that included a bumper that wrapped around the grill and headlights. The Polara 500 was replaced by the Polara Custom in hardtop coupe, 4-door hardtop sedan, and conventional 4-door sedan body styles. There was also a stripped-down Polara Special available as either a 4-door sedan or station wagon. 1970 was the last year that the Polara would be available in a convertible body style (with a scant 842 produced, making it extremely rare today), and Dodge would never again offer a full-sized convertible. The early 1970 production featured a "medallion" rear bumper. This bumper was pictured in all of the sales literature, but was discontinued after late August or early September 1969 production and replaced with a plain bumper lacking the center [[Fratzog]] medallion. Dodge also discontinued the "Super-Lite" option at the end of the 1970 model year because of lack of consumer interest and challenges to its legality in some states. The 1970s also received a new locking steering column which locked the steering wheel and column shift lever when the key was removed.

[[File:1971 Dodge Polara Station Wagon 1ff.jpg|thumb|left|1971 Polara station wagon]]
The Polara Special was discontinued for 1971 with a new sub-series was the Polara Brougham positioned above the Polara Custom, but below the Monaco. The Polara Brougham was available only as a hardtop coupe or 4-door hardtop sedan. The 360 V8 was also introduced for 1971.

The 1972 model year featured a facelift with new sheet metal and the discontinuation of the Polara Brougham model. The 1973 models received new front-end styling (which resembled the big 1970 Chevrolet), without the previous wrap-around front bumper.

Sales of the Polara were declining. Having been eclipsed by the Monaco, Dodge discontinued the Polara after 1973. The energy crisis in the fall of 1973, spurred on by the Arab/OPEC oil embargo, resulted in a drop in sales of all full-size American automobiles, which did not provide good fuel economy. The redesigned 1974 Monaco replaced the Polara.

==In Argentina==
[[File:Dodge Polara (Argentina).jpg|right|thumb|Argentinian Dodge Polara]]
In [[Argentina]], the name Polara was used to refer to a series of vehicles developed on the basis of the North American 1967-1969 [[Dodge Dart#1967–1969|Dodge Dart]]. These cars were manufactured between 1968 and 1980 by the subsidiary [[Chrysler-Fevre Argentina S.A.]]&lt;ref name="Chrysler Argentina "/&gt; in sedan and coupe versions.

While the Argentinian Polara was badged as a Dodge, it was marketed alongside the Argentinian variant of the [[Plymouth Valiant]] (derived from the US Plymouth Valiant, the first and second generation Australian [[Chrysler Valiant]], and third and fourth generation US [[Dodge Dart]]). The sedan variant of this line was mainly composed of two models based on the same body, with the basic model sold as the Polara and the deluxe version as the  '''Coronado'''.&lt;ref name="Polara "/&gt; The coupe variant's models were also based on the same body, with the basic model known as the '''Dodge Polara Coupe''', the sports version as the '''Dodge Polara R/T''', all these models featured the 225 cu in (3.7 L) [[Straight-6|Straight]] [[Chrysler Slant 6 engine|Slant-6]] engine, and the deluxe high-performance version as the  '''Dodge GTX'''. This last model came equipped with a 318 cubic inch V8, considered the most powerful engine ever produced in Argentina. Other models in the production line were the '''Dodge Valiant''', '''Polara GT''', and '''Polara Diesel''', all 4-door sedans.&lt;ref name="Chrysler Argentina "&gt;[http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/d/dodge_sedan_cupe.htm Chrysler Argentina S.A., Dodge Coronado and Polara specifications] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111115144202/http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/d/dodge_sedan_cupe.htm |date=November 15, 2011 }} (in Spanish) – accessed January 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dodge Polara line of cars were designed exclusively for the Argentinian market. The interior, especially the dashboard, is similar to that of the early 1970s Dodge Dart–Plymouth Valiant cars.{{CN|date=November 2019}} The coupes were not available in large numbers,{{CN|date=November 2019}} but are collected by enthusiasts.{{CN|date=November 2019}} They were hard to sell as gas consumption is high compared to the 4- and 6-cylinder cars the Argentinian consumer is used to.{{CN|date=November 2019}} Several restyling jobs of the whole line with new front and rear ends were carried out within its lifetime.{{vague|date=November 2019}}{{CN|date=November 2019}}

An automobile magazine, ''Corsa'', road-tested a '''Polara GTX coupé''' with a V8 rated at {{Convert|212|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4400 rpm, {{Convert|308|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 2600 rpm and 8.5:1 compression ratio. It reached a top speed of 189&amp;nbsp;km/h (117&amp;nbsp;mph), and reached 0–100&amp;nbsp;km/h (0–62&amp;nbsp;mph) in 10.2 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valiant.org/south-american-valiants.html www.valiant.org] Chrysler in South America (1962–1982)  – accessed December 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a version of this model, built from 1971 to 1978 exported to Spain as a [[Complete knock down|CKD]] in cooperation with the Barreiros company known as the [[Barreiros (manufacturer)#The Spanish Dodge Dart|Dodge 3700]].&lt;ref name="Polara "&gt;[http://www.pruebas.pieldetoro.net/web/pruebas/ver.php?ID=14 Dodge 3700 GT, Piel de toro.net] {{Webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141129053723/http://www.pruebas.pieldetoro.net/web/pruebas/ver.php?ID=14 |date=November 29, 2014 }} (in Spanish) – accessed January 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Brazil==
[[File:Dodge Polara Brazil.jpg|thumb|Brazilian Dodge Polara GLS]]
In '''[[Brazil]]''', the Polara nameplate was revived in 1977 for a version of the [[Chrysler Avenger]]. They were sold until 1981.

There was also a version of this model in sedan and station wagon built in the 1970s in Argentina of the same car known as the '''Dodge 1500''' until [[Volkswagen]] took over ''Chrysler Fevre Argentina SAIC'', including the tooling for the car, in 1980. From then until 1988 the car was sold in Argentina as the [[Volkswagen Type 3#Unrelated Argentine Volkswagen 1500|Volkswagen 1500]] (not to be confused with the [[Volkswagen Type 3|Type 3]], also sold as the Volkswagen 1500 in most markets, including a similar version with 1600 engine in Brazil).
