The '''Buick Wildcat''' was a [[Full-size car|full-size]]d [[automobile]] that was produced by [[Buick]] from 1962 to 1970. It took its name from a [[fiberglass]]-bodied 1953 [[concept car]].
&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1946-1959'' (Jefferson, NC:  McFarland &amp; Coy, 2008), p.1022.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invicta subseries==
In 1962 the Wildcat was a [[Buick Invicta]] subseries, mating the Invicta's longer full-size two-door [[hardtop]] Buick body (known as the "sport coupe", body production code 4647) with a high-performance {{convert|325|hp|abbr=on}} version of the {{convert|401|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#Nailhead|Nailhead]] [[V8 engine|V8]], known as the "Wildcat 445" for producing {{convert|445|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of [[torque]]. To further distance itself from the Invicta, the Wildcat had [[Buick Electra 225|Electra 225]]-like taillights, a [[bucket seat]] interior, and a [[center console (automobile)|center console]] with tachometer and transmission shifter. It had a [[Dynaflow]] transmission shared by all full-sized [[Buick]]s, plus special exterior side trim, vinyl-covered roof (new for 1962), and its own unique emblem: a stylized head of a wild cat, located on each of the [[Pillar (car)|C-pillars]]. However, the Wildcat did share the LeSabre's and Invicta's trio of VentiPorts on the front fenders, a design cue lasting only through the 1963 model year.

From 1963 to 1970 the Wildcat was its own series, no longer an Invicta subseries. The 1963 model had a large aluminum trim panel on the side of the body that seemed to compete directly with the [[Oldsmobile Starfire]], another full-size "sporty" model by GM.  Wildcats built in the 1964 model year did not have the traditional horizontal [[Buick#ventiports|VentiPorts]] like other Buicks, but instead had vertically situated chrome hash-marks on the lower front quarter panel directly behind the front wheel housings. After becoming its own full series in 1963, the Wildcat added a convertible and four-door hardtop sedan to the original two-door hardtop coupe introduced in 1962. In the four-door version, a bench seat was standard but the bucket seat and console interior used in the coupe and convertible were optional. In 1964, a pillared four-door sedan was added to the line and two levels of trim were available - standard and custom, with a mid-line deluxe subseries added for 1965 only. From 1966 to 1969, the base (with trim similar to the 1965 Wildcat deluxe) and custom trims were again the sole options.

[[File:Super Wildcat 425ci Front View.jpg|thumb|left|1964 Buick Super Wildcat four-door hardtop]]
The {{Convert|325|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 401 cubic-inch Wildcat [[V8 engine|V8]] remained the standard engine through 1966. From 1964 to 1966 a larger, 425 cubic-inch, Wildcat V8 was also available, producing either {{Convert|340|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with a factory four-barrel carburetor or {{Convert|360|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with two four-barrel carburetors ("dual quads"). This version also featured finned cast aluminum valve covers with the Buick logo embossed on the top. Also beginning in 1964, a three-speed [[manual transmission]] with column shift became standard equipment on all Wildcats, with either the four-speed manual (1963-1965 only) or three-speed automatic Super Turbine 400 transmissions as options.  Engine names referred to engine torque output rather than displacement.  The "Wildcat 445" was a 401 CID V8 that produced a peak torque rating of {{convert|445|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}}, while the "Wildcat 465" was a 425 CID V8 that produced {{convert|465|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. The "dual quad" version of the Wildcat 465 was dubbed "Super Wildcat".

In 1966 a one-year-only Wildcat "[[Buick Gran Sport|Gran Sport Performance Group]]" package could be ordered by selecting the "A8/Y48" option. Two engine choices were available. The single carb 425 CID/340&amp;nbsp;hp V8 was included in the base package price with a {{Convert|360|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} dual-carb set-up available at extra cost. Initially, this {{Convert|20|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} upgrade remained a dealer-installed carb-intake modification bolted to stock MT-coded engines but eventually these "Super Wildcats" could also be obtained direct from the factory with MZ-coded engines. Rounding out both the base and Super GS packages were dual exhaust, heavy-duty suspension, posi-traction and updated rear quarter-panel "GS" badging in the new, initials-only format employed on all post-1965 Gran Sports. A total of 1,244 Wildcat GSs were built by Buick during the model year. Of those, 242 were convertibles and the rest were hardtops. A mere 22 (consisting of an unknown mix of both body styles) were Super Wildcats.

A styling appearance cue was adopted from the popular 1963 [[Buick Riviera]], where the [[beltline (automotive)|beltline]] arched up over the rear wheels, a modification of an older styling element called the "[[Buick#Sweepspear|Sweepspear]]," with later vehicles installing a rub strip along the entire side of the vehicle tapering down as it reached the rear bumper.

The year 1967 brought a new engine to the Wildcat line (along with the Riviera and Electra 225) – a 430-cubic-inch V8 with four-barrel carburetor and {{Convert|360|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} rating that featured larger valves for better breathing than the previous 401/425 Nailhead design that dated back to Buick's first V8, in 1953. It had a 10.25:1 compression ratio and a four-barrel carburettor, with maximum power reached at 5000&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|475|lb.ft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque at 3200&amp;nbsp;rpm - all SAE gross values. The 430 was relatively short-lived as it was only offered through the 1969 model year. For 1970, the 430 was superseded by the largest Buick V8 engine ever – a 455-cubic-inch engine that was basically a bored version of the previous engine with the same large-valve design, a horsepower rating of 370, and torque rating of more than 500 pounds. 1967 and 1968 saw the addition of new federally mandated safety equipment that provided better occupant protection in collisions, and accident avoidance features as well. Like other full-size U.S. cars of the late 1960s, the Buicks became bigger, plusher, and less economical.

The Wildcat was offered only in Custom trim for its final year of 1970. It was superseded by the [[Buick Centurion]] for 1971.

The 1965–1970 [[GM B platform]] is the fourth-best selling automobile platform in history after the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], [[Ford Model T]] and the [[Lada Riva]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Wildcat concept cars==
[[File:1954 Buick Wildcat I (6333008771).jpg|thumb|1954 Buick Wildcat II]]
Buick has used the name "Wildcat" for five concept vehicles, three in the early 1950s, one in 1985 and another in 1997. The 1953 Wildcat I, 1954 Wildcat II and 1955 Wildcat III were all designed under the guidance of [[Harley Earl]]. The I and II still exist today.

The 1985 Wildcat was a radical mid-engined, [[all-wheel-drive]] sports car with an exposed high-performance, double-overhead cam [[V6]]. The chassis was built of carbon-fiber and vinyl-ester resin and the body featured a [[Vehicle canopy|'lift-up' canopy]] for entry and exit. This futuristic vehicle is still owned by Buick today, and is still operational.

In 1997, Buick made a Riviera Wildcat concept car. This car had carbon fiber instead of woodgrain trim inside and black chrome outside and its engine was modified.

The '''Buick Centurion''' is a [[full-size car]] built from the 1971 through 1973 model years. Replacing the [[Buick Wildcat|Wildcat]] as the sporty iteration of [[Buick|Buick's]] three full-size car lines, it slotted between the [[Buick LeSabre|LeSabre]] and [[Buick Electra|Electra]] in the lineup. The Centurion name was inspired by a Buick [[concept car]], the name coming from that of an officer in the Roman Army.  The car's emblem was not the traditional Buick tri-shield, but a side profile of a [[centurion]].

The Centurion name was first used on a [[Buick]] [[concept car]] in the 1956 [[Motorama]]. It featured a red and white [[fiberglass]] body, airplane-like interior design, a fully clear "bubble top" roof and the first [[backup camera]] in place of a [[rear-view mirror]], although it was never shown to be functional. This car currently resides in the Sloan Museum at the [[Flint Cultural Center]] in [[Flint, Michigan]].
{{clear}}

== 1971–1973 ==
First seen on a concept car, the Centurion was nearly identical to the contemporaneous [[Buick LeSabre]], differing in badging and grillework, minimal chrome trim, and an absence of the [[Buick#Ventiports|VentiPorts]] found on other full-size Buicks. Body styles included two-door and four-door [[hardtop]]s and a [[convertible (car)|convertible]]. There were no pillared sedans. The two-door hardtop shared the handsome semi-fastback roofline with the LeSabre and other GM B-body cars (such as the Chevrolet Impala Sport Coupe and the Olds Delta 88) along with a standard vinyl roof.

===1971===

[[File:1971 Buick Centurion convertible rl.jpg|thumb|1971 convertible, rear view]]
Replacing the Wildcat as the mid-line full-sized Buick positioned between the lower-priced LeSabre and the larger and more luxurious C-body Electra 225, the Centurion was promoted more as a mid-level luxury car than the Wildcat, which was marketed as a sporty/luxury performance car. The Centurion was offered initially with only the 455&amp;nbsp;in³ big-block V8 in two power output ranges determined by the presence of either a single or dual exhaust.  The '71 Centurion produced {{convert|315|hp|abbr=on}} @4400 rpm and {{convert|510|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque @2800 rpm with the base 455. The Centurion was also offered in the 455 Stage 1 and a Manual Trans configuration as well during the early portion of the 1971 model year. This was known as the A9 and B6 Option when ordering the car. What also separated the car from the LeSabre was that when the car would be ordered or recognized as a Centurion it would be branded as a 4P as the first two letters of the [[Vehicle Identification Number]].

Interior trim was upgraded from LeSabres with a notchback bench seat including center armrest standard equipment along with more luxurious cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl upholstery.

In March 1971, the three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic transmission became standard on all Centurions as well as the lower-priced LeSabres. Variable-ratio power steering and power front disc brakes were standard equipment during the entire model year.

Total sales were 29,398,&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960-1972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), p.796.&lt;/ref&gt; exceeding the Wildcat,&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p.793.&lt;/ref&gt; by nearly 25%.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p.796.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1972===
[[File:Krone3_Frederiksborg.JPG|thumb|1973 convertible owned by the Royal house of Denmark, used by Henrik, Prince Consort]]
The 1972 Centurion featured minor appearance changes including a revised vertical bar grille and taillight lenses.

Under the hood, the standard and only available 455 cubic-inch V8 was rated at 250 net horsepower, which represented an "on-paper" decrease from the 315 gross horsepower rating in 1971. This was due to an industry-wide change in horsepower measurements from the gross method by a dynamometer outside a vehicle with no accessories installed to a SAE net method in which horsepower was measured as installed in a vehicle with accessories and emission controls hooked up. Turbo Hydra-matic transmission, variable ratio power steering and power front disc brakes were again standard equipment.

Sales climbed over 20%, to 36,165 for the model year.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p.874.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1973===
[[File:1973 Buick Centurion Convertible.jpg|thumb|left|1973 convertible]]
The 1973 Centurion featured a larger {{convert|5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} front bumper and new vertical grille shared with LeSabre models along with revised taillights. The two-door hardtop coupe no longer included a standard vinyl roof and the distinctive formal rear window was replaced by a backlight shared with LeSabre coupes.

Under the hood, the standard engine was downgraded to a four-barrel 350 V8 rated at 175 net horsepower. The 250-horsepower 455 four-barrel was now optional.

With the LeSabre convertible temporarily dropped after 1972 and the intermediate-sized Buick lineup (renamed from Skylark to Century for 1973) losing its droptop permanently after the 1972 model year, the Centurion was Buick's only convertible offering in 1973. This would also be the final year for the Centurion series, which was replaced for 1974 by the new LeSabre Luxus, which included the convertible reinstated to that line for another two model years. GM would not see another Buick convertible until the [[Buick Riviera]] in 1982.

Total Centurion production was 110,539 units, including 10,296 convertibles. With only three years of production, the Centurion had one of the shortest model runs in modern Buick history.

The '''Buick Estate''' was a line of full-sized [[station wagon]]s manufactured by the [[Buick]] division of [[General Motors]].  As its premier luxury division, [[Cadillac]], didn't offer a station wagon, the Estate was GM's most expensive and most fully equipped entry in the market.

==Early history==
The first Buick Estate [[station wagon]] was a large-bodied [[GM C platform (RWD)|GM C platform]] [[Buick Super|Super]] modified with a [[Woodie (car body style)|wooden body]], shared with the [[Oldsmobile Series 60]].  In 1941 and 1942 it was available on Buick's [[GM B platform|B platform]] [[Buick Special|Special]] series, and later on Buick's C platform ([[Buick Roadmaster|Roadmaster]] and Super) in the 1946–53 model years. From 1954 to 1958 it was only offered on the smaller B platform [[Buick Century|Century]] and Special, with all steel bodies. Among these were [[hardtop]] Estate Wagons called Caballero that were offered only in 1957 and 1958.

From 1959 through 1964 the Estate Wagon was offered on the B platform [[Buick Invicta|Invicta]] and [[Buick LeSabre|LeSabre]]. In 1965, the Estate Wagon was replaced by the new, smaller [[GM A platform (1936)#1964–1967|A platform]] [[Buick Sport Wagon]], making the B-body [[Chevrolet Impala#Fourth generation (1965–1970)|Chevrolet Impala Estate]] and [[Pontiac Safari]] the only full-sized GM station wagons until 1970.

The '''Buick Estate''' wagon was re-introduced as the top-level luxury station wagon for GM in 1970 to compete against the [[Mercury Colony Park]] and [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country (1941–1988)|Chrysler Town &amp; Country]]. 
Buick's first full-sized station wagon since 1964, it was available as a separate series on the B-body [[Buick LeSabre|LeSabre]] and [[Buick Wildcat|Wildcat]], sharing their {{convert|124.0|in|mm|sing=on}} wheelbase, basic body and interior.  The LeSabre Custom's bright rocker, wheelhouse and rear lower fender moldings were used. [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|Woodgrain]] was an option for the body sides, incorporating the traditional "[[Buick#Sweepspear|Sweepspear]]" feature. Interiors were all vinyl in a Custom grade. Despite being on the B-body it shared the [[GM C platform|C-body]] division [[Flagship#Automobiles|flagship]] [[Buick Electra|Electra]]'s [[Buick V8 engine#455|455]] cubic inch [[V8 engine|V8]] and four [[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPorts]] on the front fenders. The following year the Estate would move up to Electra's larger body and more voluminous interior.

The 1971 to 1976 Estates were the first Buick station wagons to be built on its largest chassis since the Roadmaster Estates of 1947–53.  However, even though the Estate shared its {{convert|127.0|in|mm|sing=on}} C-body wheelbase with the Electra 225, all 1971–76 GM wagons were assigned B-body-based per model numbers.&lt;ref&gt;1976 Buick sales brochure says wagon models are 4BR35 and 4BR45. One telltale is the lower inside door trim which was hard plastic in 1971–76 B-bodies and padded vinyl in C-bodies. Wheelbase is not a good indicator of body; check rear legroom.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1971–76 GM full-size bodies, at {{convert|64.3|in|mm|sing=on}} front shoulder room and {{convert|63.4|in|mm|sing=on}} rear shoulder room set a record for interior width that would not be matched by any car until the full-size GM rear-wheel drive models of the early to mid 1990s. The Estate also shared the Electra 225's interior and exterior styling from 1971 to 1974 (complete with the prerequisite four [[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPorts]]). Door trim and seats were not as plush in 1971–74 wagons and no door pull strap was included as it was on the Electra. 

Although from 1975 to 1976 the number of VentiPorts were reduced by one, and the front fascia was downgraded to a LeSabre's (as was door trim and seats), the Electra 225 style chrome rocker panel moldings and distinctive Electra 225 style rear quarter panels (albeit without fender skirts) remained. The taillights were different from both the LeSabre and the Electra in all of these years. The Estate Wagons, as with other GM full-sized wagons during these years, used a rear suspension with multi-leaf springs instead of the coil springs used on other full-sized Buicks, and other full-sized GM cars.

The Estate Wagons also featured a new '[[Station wagon#Tailgate evolution|clamshell]]' tailgate design, marketed as the ''Glide-away Tailgate,'' where the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof as the lower tailgate (manually or with power assist), slid into a recess under the cargo floor. Ultimately, the manual lower tailgate was supplanted by the power tailgate. The tailgate system was operated by switches on the instrument panel or a key switch on the rear quarter panel. Like a top-hinged tailgate, the clamshell design allowed a user to stand directly at the open cargo area without impediment, facilitating loading and unloading in tight spaces. the rear seat could be folded flat for additional cargo, and incorporated a 60/40 split so that extended cargo and passengers could be accommodated.

[[File:1974 Buick Estate Wagon.jpg|thumb|left|1974 Buick Estate Wagon]]
In its first year, 24,034 Estate Wagons were sold.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960–1972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), p. 793.&lt;/ref&gt;

At {{convert|5182|lb|kg|abbr=on}} shipping weight, or about {{convert|5400|lb|kg|abbr=on}} curb weight, the three-seat 1974 Estate Wagons are easily the heaviest Buicks ever built, even heavier than the [[Buick Limited]] limousines of 1936–42. The 1975 and 1976 models were the longest station wagons ever built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stationwagon.com/faq.html#q12 | title = 12. What was the biggest station wagon ever made? | work = FAQ's | publisher = Stationwagon.com | accessdate = 2013-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Estate used the  [[Buick V8 engine#455|Buick 455]] from 1971 to 1976 throughout. The last year that the Stage One high performance version, with high lift camshaft, enlarged ports, enlarged valves and dual exhaust was available was in 1974.

In 1977, the Buick Estate was downsized and relaunched on General Motors' [[GM B platform|B-body]].  In 1979, an Estate Wagon Limited was offered with many extra cost options included as standard. To further differentiate the Limited model, fenders included four [[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPorts]] (up from three) and the interior had loose pillow designed seating. In 1980, body changes made the wagon more aerodynamic for better fuel efficiency.  Also that year, the Electra Estate Wagon was introduced and replaced the Estate Wagon Limited while the 'base' model was now called the LeSabre Estate Wagon. The Buick 350 V8 engine was dropped from the options list because 1980 was the final year of production for that engine. The standard engine now was the 5.0 Oldsmobile 307 engine. 

[[File:Buick Electra Estate Wagon.JPG|thumb|left|1980s Buick Electra Estate Wagon]]

According to The Buick Book, 1987. In 1987 Buick offered Electra Estate Wagon (V35) and LeSabre Estate Wagon (R35). Both wagons are equipped with the 5.0 litre 4 bbl V8. The Electra Estate Wagon was to be the more luxurious of the two models. 
Buick also offered a 29.5 inch shorter and 9.9 inch smaller front wheel drive Century Custom Wagon (H35) and Century Estate Wagon (L35). Three choices of engines was offered. A 2.5 litre Tech IV with Electronic fuel injection, a 2.8 litre V6 with Multi-port fuel injection and a 3.8 litre V6 with Sequential-port fuel injection. The Century Custom Wagon was aimed towards "the active living and hard-working utility" and the Century Estate Wagon towards "luxury touches by the score". Both models of the Century Wagon could be equipped with an optional third seat; "Surprisingly perhaps, eight full-size adults can seat themselves in the contemporary-sized Century Wagon".
[[File:1982 Buick Electra Estate in WA, US.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|1982 Buick Electra Estate]]
Although the Electra and LeSabre coupes and sedans had both switched to new [[front wheel drive]] platforms by 1986, the model names also continued to be used on the rear wheel drive wagons through 1989. In 1990, its final year, the Electra and LeSabre model designations were dropped and the car was once again sold simply as the Estate Wagon.  Although the Estate Wagon model was discontinued in 1990, the Estate trim designation continued on the mid-size Century and full-size Roadmaster station wagons through 1996.

==1991–1996==

{{main article|Buick_Roadmaster#1991.E2.80.931996|l1=1991–1996 Buick Roadmaster}}

Buick revived the [[Buick Roadmaster|Roadmaster]] name with the introduction of the Roadmaster Estate in 1991. A "Vista Roof" fixed sunroof over the second row seats, was standard. Initially the Roadmaster Estate used [[Chevrolet]]'s 5.0&amp;nbsp;L [[Chevrolet_small-block_engine#L03|L03]] V8.  It was replaced a year later with a 180hp 5.7L small-block [[Chevrolet_small-block_engine#L05|L05]] V8 shared by both wagon and sedan. In 1994 both received a modified dual-exhaust version of the advanced Corvette-derived 5.7L [[fuel_injection#Multipoint_fuel_injection|sequential point fuel-injection]] [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#LT1|LT1]] V8, increasing output to 260hp and upping performance substantially.  The same engine was used on the Impala SS, Chevrolet police interceptors, and the Cadillac Fleetwood, with an aluminum head version on the Corvette C4, Camaro Z-28, and Firebird Trans-AM. A high-performance engine had last been offered on a GM station wagon in 1974.

GM discontinued the Roadmaster Estate in 1996, ending production on December 13 of that year.&lt;ref name='Wards97'&gt;{{cite book |title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 1997 |publisher=Ward's Communications, Inc |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:gs70stage1.jpg|right|thumb|[[Buick]] Skylark GS, 1970 455 Stage 1]]
The '''Gran Sport''' name has been used on several high-performance cars built by [[Buick]] since 1965. In the GM brands hierarchy, Buick was surpassed in luxury and comfort appointments only by [[Cadillac]], which did not produce performance models. As a result, the Buick GS series were the most opulently equipped GM sport models of their era.

==Skylark based Gran Sports==
The 1965 '''Skylark Gran Sport''' was the [[midsize car|intermediate]] [[Buick Skylark]] with the Gran Sport option added.  Although a {{convert|300|in3|cc|0|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]] was already offered in the Skylark, the Gran Sport had the largest engine permitted by GM - a {{convert|401|cid|cc|0|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine|Buick V8]] (called a 400 by Buick because that was the maximum engine size allowed in intermediate body cars). This engine produced 325&amp;nbsp;hp (242&amp;nbsp;kW) and 445&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (603&amp;nbsp;Nm) and was known as the "nailhead" engine. Buick sold more than 15,000 Skylarks with the Gran Sport option that first year, and almost as many the next.  It was renamed the GS 400 in 1967, and the Gran Sport became its own model in (about) that same year along with a new "400" engine quite different from the famously reliable but becoming-obsolete nailhead engine design that was first introduced in 1953. Sales fell somewhat in the face of increasingly higher-performance and more popular [[muscle cars]] from other marques when compared to those from the more stodgy and expensive Buick. Buick, however, stepped it up a notch when introducing the '''Stage 1''' option in 1969.  This limited production (less than 1,500 cars in 1969) version delivered 340&amp;nbsp;hp (253&amp;nbsp;kW) and 440&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (597&amp;nbsp;Nm).

The name Gran Sport replaced the GS moniker with the 1973 Gran Sport, and was again revived in the late eighties on the FWD Skylark model with various performance options added.

===GS California===
[[File:Buick Skylark GS California in FLA-5.JPG|275px|right|thumb|A rare GS California in a shopping center in [[Weeki Wachee, Florida]].]]
Buick touted the California as "The Distinctive Personal Car for Americana on the GO", using the Skylark platform. The merchandising creation of the West Coast's Mickey Garrett, the California GS became one of Buick's entries into what is now often known as a junior musclecar. The intent of these autos were to provide the visual impact of the era's supercars with the low maintenance and price of a more economical car, while maintaining reasonable performance levels. When reviewed with these thoughts in mind the California GS delivered quite nicely. They were fitted with the small block GS drivetrain and the exterior received the full treatment including vinyl top, chrome moulding package, GS emblems, and special California scripts. This marketing approach was also used in Colorado, using the "Colorado" name instead of "California".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/37573576@N06/8620119293/ 1969 Buick GS Colorado, www.flickr.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geocities.ws/MotorCity/Speedway/1569/colorado.html A Brief History of the GS Colorado, Ken's Buick GS Home Page] Retrieved 18 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

1967 was the maiden year for the California GS. It was available in California only and was not advertised nationally by Buick. Built on the thin-pillar coupe chassis it came equipped with the 340 ci/260&amp;nbsp;hp engine and [[Super Turbine 300]] transmission. Bench seats were standard and accessories were kept to a minimum to help keep the price down. Car Life tested one in their June issue and ran the 1/4 in 16.7 seconds at 81&amp;nbsp;mph, they also recorded a top speed of 105&amp;nbsp;mph. The article contains a lengthy description of the car and how it performed during testing, it is a must read for anyone interested in learning more about the '67 California GS.

Mid year 1968 saw the official introduction of the California GS, and it is frequently known as a '69 model.&lt;ref name="Muscle Cars Magazine p.64"&gt;''Guide to Muscle Cars'' Magazine, 2/87, p.64.&lt;/ref&gt; Buick asked "Why settle for less when the California GS, built especially for YOU, costs no more?" Exclusively designed for Golden State motorists, Buick advertised the car nationally as a high performance family sports car at an economy car price. Though the car was not included in Buick's yearly catalog it was shown in a two-page black and white fold out brochure. Custom California GS emblems again graced the rear fenders while GS ornamentation could be found in the grille and sail panels. The drivetrain included Buick's new for '68 350-4 V8 with 10.25:1 [[compression ratio|compression]] and [[Rochester Products Division|Rochester]] (GM) 4GC [[Quadrajet]] four-[[Venturi effect|barrel]] (four-choke) carburetor,&lt;ref&gt;''Guide to Muscle Cars'' Magazine, 2/87, p.62.&lt;/ref&gt; producing 280&amp;nbsp;hp and 375&amp;nbsp;lb·ft of torque. The two-speed&lt;ref name="Muscle Cars Magazine p.64"/&gt; Super Turbine 300 transmission (driving a 3.23:1 rear axle gear, designed for highway cruising)&lt;ref name="Muscle Cars Magazine p.64"/&gt; and bench seat interior were again the only choices. Buick also added chrome plated wheels and air cleaner lid to the two-door thin pillar coupe. Tires were {{convert|7.75|in|mm|abbr=on}} on {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on}} rims.&lt;ref name="Muscle Cars Magazine p.64"/&gt;

1969 was the last year of production for the California GS. The car was for the first time featured in Buick's big brochure. A two-page color picture of the thin pillar coupe and pictures of the again standard bench seat interior were included along with equipment descriptions. Tom McCahill tested the car and recorded a 0–60 time of 9.5 seconds and a top speed of 110&amp;nbsp;mph. Again the car came with Buick's 280&amp;nbsp;hp 350-4 engine but now it was mated to the new Turbo 350 transmission. Custom California emblems again graced the rear fenders, and the rear marker lights were plain red without Buick's normal 350 or 400 script. Vinyl tops, as with previous years, were standard fare with the California's distinctive GS logo on the sail panel.

===Gran Sport 340/350===
[[File:Buick Skylark GS (Toronto Spring '12 Classic Car Auction).JPG|thumb|right|1970 Buick Skylark GS convertible]]
In 1967 Buick added a {{convert|340|CID|cc|0|abbr=on}} version, there was the '''GS 340''' and the '''GS California''' sub-model, little more than the [[Buick Skylark|Skylark]] hardtop with new badging and trim,&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960-1972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), p.484.&lt;/ref&gt; The 340 produced {{convert|260|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and 365&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (495&amp;nbsp;Nm), and less than 4,000 cars were sold. It was replaced the next year with the '''GS 350''' and similar '''GS California'''; these used [[Buick]]'s {{convert|350|CID|cc|0|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#350|small-block]] engine. A California 2-door coupe appeared in 1969;&lt;ref name="Flory, p.641"&gt;Flory, p.641.&lt;/ref&gt; total GS sales for the year, not counting the new California coupe, were 12,465 (4,933 GS 350s, 7,532 GS 400s).&lt;ref name="Flory, p.641"/&gt; Sales of the GS 350 for 1970 climbed to 9,948;&lt;ref name="Flory, p.718"&gt;Flory, p.718.&lt;/ref&gt; in addition, 10,148 {{convert|455|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} 2-doors were built.&lt;ref name="Flory, p.718"/&gt; The Gran Sport 350 outlived its big brothers, lasting until V8 Gran Sport production stopped in 1975, replaced by the '''Gran Sport 231'''.&lt;!--for 1975 only?--&gt;

===Gran Sport 400===
In 1968 and 1969 Buick offered the GS 400 in a convertible and hardtop model. Standard issue of the GS 400 was a 400 cubic inch (6.6&amp;nbsp;L) engine (with likely lower stated horsepower rating to keep insurance premiums lower) of 340 horsepower (350&amp;nbsp;hp stage 1 ) and 440&amp;nbsp;ft. lbs. torque, a four barrel Rochester Quadrajet carburetor, dual exhaust, 2.93 standard gear ratio optional ( limited slip differential, (3.64 stage 1 option, 3.42 with A/C ), and the available three speed turbo [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM400|Super Turbine 400]] automatic transmission (revered as the finest automatic transmission ever built, and commonly called Turbo Hydra-matic 400), U-shape Hurst (automatic transmission) shifter and linkage, located on a center console. A 1968 or 1969 GS400 equipped with the TH400 auto transmission was faster off the line than many of its contemporaries thanks to an unusually "low" 1st gear. Shift pattern for the TH400 from most forward position is Park, Reverse, Neutral, Drive, Second, First. A standard three-speed or optional four-speed manual gearbox was also available. Compression ratio on this engine was a moderately high 10.25:1, which allowed for the use of any grade gasoline to be used in normal driving without pinging. The factory air cleaner was covered with a large round chromed cover, secured with a wing nut. The small air scoop behind the hood hinge-line on the 1968 model was generally fake, although it could be functional if ordered with the very rare ram air package. 1969 brought ram air as standard to the GS.

Like all of the GM versions of this body style in this period, the convertible chassis was considerably more robust than the hardtop version. In fact, the convertible chassis was a full box frame chassis that had numerous lightening holes.  The hardtop chassis was a 3/4 box frame with no lightening holes. The only GM hardtop ever built with the "Swiss cheese" convertible chassis was the GTO Judge.  Same chassis.  All of the GS400 convertibles were built at GM's Fremont, California assembly line.

The 400 was replaced for 1970 with the [[Buick V8 engine#455|Buick {{convert|455|cid|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine]], used in the '''GS 455'''. The base model was rated at {{convert|350|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|510|lbft|Nm kgm|0|abbr=on}} at 2800 rpm of torque. In the optional Stage 1 trim equipped with a single 4-barrel [[Rochester Products Division|Rochester]] [[Quadrajet]] [[carburetor]] was rated at {{convert|360|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Horsepower#SAE gross power|SAE gross]] at 4600 rpm and {{convert|510|lbft|Nm kgm|0|abbr=on}} at 2800 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1970/85430/buick_gsx_stage-1_sport_coupe_4-speed.html|website=automobile-catalog|title=1970 Buick GSX Stage-1 Sport Coupe 4-speed|accessdate=July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with all American engines produced prior to the 1972 model year, these were SAE gross ratings, which are generally significantly higher than SAE net ratings and are not indicative of what actual production engines produce in their "as installed" condition (with all engine accessories and full exhaust system in place).  The fastest magazine test results from this period were obtained by MOTOR TREND Magazine, which managed to extract a 13.38 ET @ 105.5 MPH from their 3,810 pound GS Stage 1 coupe test car. Using Hale's Trap Speed formula, this result indicated actual "as installed" peak HP of approximately 360 SAE Net (ironically the same as its advertised Gross Figure, meaning this engine was very conservatively rated for that time period).

Dennis Manner, Buick Engine development engineer still recalls the production-line pulled engine dyno test results from 1970 where the lowest HP output of the 15 tested 455 Stage 1 engines was 376&amp;nbsp;hp.

The December 2004 issue of Musclecar Enthusiast" conducted an engine dynamometer test of a freshly rebuilt and well documented 1970 455 Stage 1 (bored .040" over to 464 cubic inches and minus the power-robbing factory engine fan, air cleaner assembly and mufflers). In that condition and with factory timing and carburetor tuning, the engine produced a maximum of 360.9 HP. Optimal carburetor and ignition tuning yielded a peak HP reading of 381.7 HP - again with no engine fan, air cleaner or mufflers in place. While urban legend would have us believe that these engines made "420 HP from the factory," actual empirical results prove otherwise. Although another dynamometer test on a 1970 Skylark GS Stage I showed 471 SAE gross hp, which is more consistent with the engine producing about 360 SAE net hp.

The Stage 1 engine option used cylinder heads that, while using raw castings of the same pattern as all of the other Buick 455s sharing the same model year, were machined differently in order to accept larger valves (2.13" intake and 1.755" exhaust), and to produce smaller compression chambers for increased static compression ratio. The option also included a more aggressive camshaft, a specially tuned 4-barrel Quadrajet carburetor, more aggressive ignition timing,5/8&amp;nbsp;inch oil pickup tube and a higher numerical final drive, and was available with either Turbo Hydra-matic 400 3-speed automatic transmission, or a Muncie M-22 4-speed manual transmission (although it was later discovered, and confirmed, that one 1970 GS Stage 1 convertible was produced with a 3-speed manual and a standard 3.64:1 Positraction axle ratio). Stage 1 cars equipped with air conditioning received a 3.42 axle ratio.

While powerful in production form, the Buick 455 (including Stage 1) engines had problematic engine blocks. All used 2 bolt main bearing caps; the oiling system was undersized for high-rpm use (including Stage 1 engines) and thin walls in the lifter valleys promoted cracking. The magic of the Stage 1, it would seem, was primarily attributable to its advanced (for the period) cylinder heads, stunningly high torque and the relatively high mid-range horsepower they produced.

The relatively unknown, very expensive, and very rare 1970 GS 455 Stage 1 drew a great amount of attention and controversy in the muscle-car world when in the 1980s it was listed as faster than any of the Chrysler Hemi cars in the original "50 fastest muscle cars" list. This Hemi ''vs''. Stage 1 controversy has prompted several contests to settle the issue; it remains an unsettled matter and has been a great boon to car magazine sales over the years.
[[File:GS Stage II.JPG|275px|right|thumb|Buick GS Stage 2.]]
There was also a rare “Stage 2” option produced. This was a dealer-installed package (known as a "dealer option"), first offered in 1969. It included a cam, headers, intake manifold, high compression forged pistons, hollow pushrods,  and some calibration changes to the ignition and carburetor . In 1970(?) the Stage 2 package was designed for the 455 and included special round  exhaust port Stage 2 heads, matching Kustom brand headers, a radical cam, high compression forged pistons, Edelbrock B4B aluminum intake, Holley carburetor #4781 850 cfm, and other equipment for racing. Few Stage 2s  even exist  and Buick only ever factory assembled 1 Stage 2 test unit, it was a factory GSX clone test mule with 4-speed manual transmission used for speed testing. That GSX test mule was equipped with 4.78 gearing and was driven on the streets and tracks on the West Coast. The Stage 2 package's existence was not made public until 1972 when the Stage 2 parts could be ordered in any combination. There is little documentation about any Stage 2 cars that were sold. Three are known to exist and all three of these cars were built as Stage 1 cars at the factory. One was owned by Kenne-Bell a factory backed Buick high performance specialist based in California . Sponsored by Reynolds Buick .This car was used as a test car in the development of the Stage 2 components in conjunction with Buick engineering . The second Stage 2 was known as the Jones-Benisek car. The Jones/Benisek car is known to have been delivered as a Stage 1 car .The Stage 2 hood and scoop was added later . The Stage 2 iron heads were purchased by the owner at a local Buick Dealer. The car had a very successful drag racing career with many wins and some world records also. The third Stage 2 is known as Wiley Coyote and as the Turner car. It was originally owned by Bob Thetford and campaigned as "Wiley Coyote" in the NHRA. Sponsored by Kenne-Bell and Dunn Buick in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Later it was owned by Jim Turner and was very successful in NMCA winning 5 National Records.

Output and sales for the assembly-line cars were down after 1970 largely due to reduced engine compression ratios and a change from gross to net horsepower ratings. In later years, air quality regulations further limited the power in part due to the addition of catalytic converters and single exhaust pipes. However, Stage 2 parts were available over the Buick parts counter although the Stage 2 heads were discontinued after about 75 sets were produced. The discontinuation was due to porosity problems with castings. The discontinuation of the Stage 2 also was due to the ever-tightening emission standards which resulted in lower performance.

===GSX===

[[File:1970 Buick GSX 455 Coupe (33285990451).jpg|thumb|1970 GSX 455 Stage 1 in Apollo white]]
'''GSX / GSX Stage 1''' was Buick's contribution to the Classic era American Muscle car list, based on the GS455 which was in turn based on the Skylark platform adding an appearance, performance and handling package available starting in the 1970 model year. The GSX Performance and Handling package was a $1,100 option on the GS455. The GSX was Buick’s attempt to increase showroom traffic on a newly designed Skylark body style for 1970 which started off slow but sales improved.  The GSX was Buick's answer to Pontiac's GTO Judge, Oldsmobile's 4-4-2 W-30, and Chevrolet's Chevelle SS. Buick advertised it as "A Brand New Brand Of Buick" and "Another 'Light Your Fire' Car From Buick". It came standard with a 455ci engine with or without the optional Stage 1 performance engine upgrades during the first year of release.  Although near the top of GM's brand hierarchy, the GSX hardtop's basic bodyshell was the same as the lower-priced 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle but with differing guards, grill, bumpers, doors, etc, while Pontiac and Oldsmobile midsize hardtop coupes shared a slightly different body.
[[File:1970 Buick GSX in Saturn Yellow.JPG|thumb|In Saturn Yellow]]
[[File:1971 Buick GSX rear right, Poughkeepsie.jpg|thumb|'72 GSX Rear view]]
Due to the late introduction of the GSX, a very special prototype was displayed at the Chicago Motor Show in February 1970 to test consumer reaction. This particular GSX had Mother Of Pearl white paint, a special fiberglass/steel ram air hood with unique modified hood scoops, one-off 3 piece rear spoiler and a prototype front spoiler, custom multicolored leather interior featuring checkerboard black and white X patterned seats and door panels. It became a hit and production started with the factory GSX looking slightly different than the prototype GSX. The GSX did not appear in the standard model catalog for 1970, however a GSX pamphlet was made available to the public. A four page, full size pamphlet announced the GSX with artist drawn pictures and specifications. Only 678 GSXs were produced in the second half of the 1970 model year beginning in March 1970. and ending in May of 1970. Just 278 were equipped with the standard 455, a further 400 purchasers selected the optional Stage 1 performance package. The impressive performance is partly due to the light weight of the 455 which is roughly {{convert|150|lb|abbr=on}} less than the 426 Hemi or Chevrolet 454. At 510&amp;nbsp;lb-ft the Buick 455 produced the highest torque output of any American production performance car, a record held for 33 years until finally surpassed by the Series 2 V10 Viper in 2003. The 1970 Buick GSX has, without doubt, the most extensive list of standard equipment high performance features of any classic era muscle car. 
It is this last fact that truly sets the GSX in a class of its own when compared to its late '60s - early '70s peers. Every single 1970 GSX Stage 1 produced received the full list of performance and handling parts. You could buy a poorly optioned Chevelle SS, a leaf-sprung, bench seat Hemi Roadrunner or even a Pontiac GTO Judge with the smaller 400ci engine and drum brakes, but there is no such thing as an under-equipped 1970 GSX.

In 1970, the GSX option was available in only two colors, Saturn Yellow and Apollo White and always with the 455ci stump-puller and black interior (in 1971 and 1972 6 other colors were available for the GSX). All GSXs had the distinctive full body length black stripe that crossed over the standard equipment rear spoiler and was outlined in red pin stripes. A large area of the hood was also black with a hood mounted tachometer (Buick engineers disliked the hood tachometer because it was a Pontiac part) and black front spoiler. Also standard equipment were black bucket seats, floor shifter, wide oval tires, quick ratio steering and anti-sway bars front and rear and quad-link suspension attached to a limited-slip rear differential. Some other options were automatic transmission or four speed manual, A/C or Non-A/C. Restored matching numbers versions have sold in Barrett-Jackson's and Mecum auctions for as much as $200,000.

During 1971 and 1972, the GSX package became an option that was available on any Gran Sport. Production dropped in 1971 to only 124, and again to 44 in 1972. These numbers include the available 350-4 bbl option, the standard 455, and the Stage 1 engines.
Many GSXs survive to this day and can be seen at the Buick Gran Sport Nationals held annually in [[Bowling Green, KY]] in the middle of May (for the past number of years this time had been changed to September because of weather concerns) along with many other examples of '60s, '70s and '80s Buick performance models. Another Buick event is the Buick Performance Group Nationals which is held at National Trail Raceway in Columbus, Ohio early during the month of August each year.

==Other Gran Sports==
===Riviera GS===
[[File:Riviera GS.JPG|thumb|left|1968 Riviera GS]]
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Muscle car]] --&gt; 
The '''Riviera Gran Sport''' was a high-performance luxury version of the [[Buick Riviera]], produced from 1965 through 1975.

In 1965, it was called Riviera Gran Sport and the later models were still officially called Gran Sport but showed GS badges instead of Gran Sport.
Unlike the mid-size GS models, the Riviera and Wildcat GS package included a standard 3.42 positraction rear axle until 1973.
The 1965 (and optional in 1966) Riviera Gran Sport also came with a 425 cubic "Super Wildcat" engine, with dual carbs and dual snorkel chrome air cleaner. You could add H2 option (Ride and handling package) for even better road handling. Shorter gear ratio for steering, 1&amp;nbsp;inch lower suspension.

===Wildcat GS===
[[File:1966 Buick Wildcat Convertible.jpg|thumb|left|1966 Buick Wildcat GS convertible]]
Another GS option package was available on the [[Buick Wildcat]] and Wildcat Custom, hardtop and convertible. The GS package included a 3.42 ratio posi rear, variable rate suspension springs, quick ratio steering box, heavy duty sway bars, and a switch-pitch Turbo Hydra-matic 400 transmission. The addition of the Y48 option gave the purchaser a pair of Carter AFB four barrel carburators, and finned aluminum valve covers on the 425 nail head engine. This was a one-year only option, existing in 1966 only. The Y48 option was delivered in the trunk and installed by the dealer.

===Century GS / Century GS Stage 1===
[[File:1973BuickCenturyGSlarge.JPG|thumb|left|1973 Buick Century GS]]
[[File:1973 Buick Century Gran Sport Stage I, rear left (Greenwich 2018).jpg|thumb|left|1973 Buick Century GS]]
In 1973–75 and in 1986, there was a Century Gran Sport. For 1973, Buick renamed its intermediate line from Skylark to Century, a nameplate previously used on Buick's full-sized performance cars from 1936 to 1942 and 1954 to 1958. Like all GM intermediates, the 1973 Century received new Colonnade styling, which amounted to pillared hardtop sedans, coupes and station wagons - each of which utilized frameless windows along with fixed rear side windows, and convertibles were discontinued. on third generation Buick Century the GS name badge became the "Gran Sport" and was now an option package on the semi-fastback Century Colonnade coupes. The "Gran Sport" option included decals on the rear fenders and trunk lid reading "gran sport" along with suspension and appearance upgrades.

The standard engine was a 150-horsepower 350 two-barrel V8, which was the standard engine for all Centurys. In addition to the 175-horsepower 350 four-barrel V8 (with single exhaust), the 190-horsepower 350 four-barrel V8 (with dual exhaust) was available only on the Gran Sport. Two 455 cubic-inch V8s were available including the 250-horsepower four-barrel and the Stage 1 four-barrel rated at 270 horsepower (both with dual exhaust) - all net figures and similar to the 1972 models. In 1973 only 979 Century Gran sport 455 and 728 Century Gran sport 455 Stage 1 models were assembled, For 350 engines there was 3 transmissions available, 3 speed manual or 4 speed M21 manual and Turbo Hydra-matic 350 Automatic and for 455 engines only M21 four speed manual and Automatic Turbo Hydra-matic 400 transmission.

The 1974 Century "gran sport" received exterior and interior trim changes. The same selection of engines was carried over from 1973 including the 350 four-barrel, 455 four-barrel and the 455 Stage 1 four-barrel (the 455s downrated to 245 and 255 net horsepower respectively). In this Year 455 stage 1 was one of first GM cars that receive [[High energy ignition]] distributor. Like 1973 model year for 350 engines there was 3 speed manual or 4 speed M21 manual and Turbo Hydra-matic 350 Automatic and for 455 engines M21 four speed manual and Automatic Turbo Hydra-matic 400 transmission. Radial tires were a new option for 1974 along with reclining Strato bucket seats. In 1974 only 579 Century Gran sport 455 and 478 Century Gran sport 455 Stage 1 models were assembled.

For 1975, the Century GS, or "gran sport" entered its third and final year on the Colonnade body. It was reduced to a mere appearance/handling package as the 455/Stage 1 options were discontinued and Buick's revived 231 cubic-inch V6 was the standard engine, mated to a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional Turbo Hydra-matic. The only optional engines were two 350 V8s, a two-barrel 155 horsepower version or the four-barrel option rated at 175 horsepower and offered only with the Turbo Hydra-matic. Both engines were also mated to catalytic converters for the first time this year, which mandated the use of unleaded gasoline and precluded the availability of true dual exhaust systems. Radial tires were now standard equipment and the Strato bucket seat option reverted to the non-reclining version.

Both the Century GS and the larger Riviera GS (which also had been continually produced since 1965) were discontinued after the 1975 model year due to sagging sales for high-performance cars following the 1973–74 energy crisis and subsequent trends toward smaller and more fuel-efficient cars. Performance versions of the Century (and its companion Regal line) and Riviera would return in the late 1970s with the advent of Buick's turbocharged 231 V6 introduced in 1978 on the Century/Regal intermediates and the full-sized LeSabre Sport Coupe and then the newly introduced front drive Riviera in 1979 for the "S-Type" which later became the T-Type, a moniker that would ultimately replace the GS badge for sporty/performance Buicks in the early 1980s.

The Century GS model returned in 1986 for what was now Buick's front-drive intermediate-sized car (Regal continued as a coupe on the 1978-vintage rear-drive G-body until 1987). The GS was only offered as a two-door coupe and was powered by a fuel-injected 3.8 liter (231 cubic-inch) V6 mated to a four-speed overdrive automatic transmission but with far less horsepower than the rear-drive Regal GN's turbocharged/intercooled version rated at 245 horsepower. This Century GS was a one-year-only offering in 1986 sold alongside the Century T-Type coupe and sedan.

===Apollo GSX===
In 1974, the GSX consisted of a trim package on Buick's small, X-bodied Apollo. Three engines were available on the 1974 GSX: the Chevrolet supplied 250 6-cyl.,and two Buick engines:the 350 2 barrel and 350 4 barrel versions.

===Regal GS / Regal GSX===

[[File:Regal l67.jpg|thumb|left|The 3800 Series II L67 Supercharged engine in a 1998 GS]]

From 1988 to 2004 and 2010 to present There is [[Buick Regal]] GS and Gran Sport models. For third Generations Buick Regal there was a Gran Sport version model. The Gran Sport option generally contained the following items:
* Leather bucket seats and center console
* Black, wide, body side moldings (coupe only)
* Gran Touring (FE3) suspension - which included faster power steering, and revised springs and struts
* Front air dam and aero rocker panels (coupe only)
* 16 inch aluminum wheels
* Fog lamps
* Two tone paint (sedan only)
* Leather steering wheel

Beginning in late 1990, the 3.8L (231 cu in) Series I V6 producing {{convert|170|hp}} was available. The 1997–2004 body style featured a {{convert|240|hp}} 3.8L Series II supercharged V6.

For 4th Generation Buick Regal The 3.8 liter V6 supercharged Regal GS had a 1/4 mile ET of 14.9 seconds, and acceleration to 60&amp;nbsp;mph (100&amp;nbsp;km/h) took 6.7 seconds. The Regal GS, equipped with the supercharged 3.8 liter V6 engine (L67) produced 240&amp;nbsp;hp (180&amp;nbsp;kW) &amp; 280&amp;nbsp;lb⋅ft (380 N⋅m) of torque. The Regal GS's PCM has programming that activates torque management to reduce wheel spin at launch. Regal GS was EPA rated at 18/27 MPG city/freeway.
In the 2003 and 2004 model years, Buick, in collaboration with SLP Performance, came out with the Buick Regal GSX. They offered dealer-installed options and dealer supplied accessories for GS models. Like the GS Buicks that came before it, the SLP GSX came in three power train packages, referred to as stages. The Stage 1 package added 10 horsepower with the addition of a dual stainless steel cat-back exhaust system and free-flowing cold air induction system. If you opted for the Stage 2 package, a Hypertech Power Programmer with an SLP custom calibration tune was included with the Stage 1 components good for an extra 20 horsepower. The range-topping Stage 3 package added a 3.5 inch smaller diameter supercharger pulley to crank up the boost. With an advertised 30 more horsepower than stock, the Stage 3 GSX was conservatively rated at 270 horsepower and 312 pound-feet of torque. Since the parts were available from SLP over the counter for many years, there have been quite a few Regal GS sedans that have been cloned into a GSX for both appearance and performance purposes. Though the model didn’t officially debut until 2003, a licensed SLP dealer could perform the transformation on any Regal GS from 1997 to 2004. A true GSX can be verified from an SLP door jamb label with the correct part number for the kit.

For 5th generation Buick Regal, GS version of the Regal was based on the Opel Insignia [[Opel Performance Center|OPC]] and the Vauxhall Insignia VXR. This front-wheel drive sedan GS features Buick's Interactive Drive Control System with GS mode, a choice of an FGP Germany F40-6 six-speed manual or Aisin AF-40 (G2) six-speed automatic transmission, high performance brakes with Brembo front calipers and high performance strut (HiPerStrut) front suspension. 19&amp;nbsp;inch wheels will be standard and 20&amp;nbsp;inch forged aluminum wheels will be available. The GS is expected to accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in under seven seconds. It is equipped with GS-only high-output version of the Ecotec 2.0L turbo engine with {{Convert|270|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|295|lbft|abbr=on}} of torque. The GM LHU engine used in the GS trim makes 135&amp;nbsp;hp per liter.

For the 6th generation Regal, from 2018 Buick released an updated version of the Regal GS. The new Regal is equipped with a GM LGX V6 3.6 producing 310 horsepower paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission yielding acceleration from zero to 60 mph in under six seconds.

The '''Buick Electra''' is a [[Full-size car|full-size]] [[Luxury Vehicle|luxury car]] manufactured and marketed by [[Buick]] from 1959 to 1990 over six generations &amp;mdash; having been named after heiress and sculptor [[Electra Waggoner Biggs]] by her brother-in-law [[Harlow H. Curtice]], former president of Buick and later president of [[General Motors]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.texasmonthly.com/content/showdown-waggoner-ranch?fullpage=1&lt;/ref&gt; The Electra was offered in [[coupe]], [[convertible]], [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]], and [[station wagon]] body styles over the course of its production &amp;mdash; with rear-wheel drive (1959-1984) or front-wheel drive (1985-1990, except station wagon).  For its entire production run, it ran on some form of [[GM C platform|GM's C platform]], which it shared with the [[Oldsmobile 98]] and [[Cadillac DeVille]].  The Electra was superseded by the [[Buick Park Avenue]] in 1991.

For years, the [[Buick Super|Super]] and the [[Buick Roadmaster|Roadmaster]] constituted the upper echelon of Buick's lineup. The [[Buick Limited|Limited]], even more luxurious than the Roadmaster, returned for 1958. For 1959, the Super was renamed the Electra, the Roadmaster was renamed the Electra 225, and the unsuccessful Limited model was discontinued. The appearance was shared with two other Buick models, the mid-level [[Buick Invicta|Invicta]] and the entry level [[Buick LeSabre|LeSabre]]. The Electra 225 nameplate was a nod to the latter car's overall length of over 225&amp;nbsp;in (5,715&amp;nbsp;mm), earning it the street name "deuce and a quarter."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N_c4_ORNfY&lt;/ref&gt;

The Electra 225 [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]] was the top-line model and it shared its six window [[hardtop]] roofline exclusively with [[Cadillac]] (which offered it on all of its models). Buick first applied the "Riviera" name to a premium trimmed 2-door Roadmaster hardtop in the middle of the 1949 model year, and thereafter denoted all Buick hardtops Rivieras. Also, from 1950 through 1953, Buick made a premium trimmed, stretched wheelbase sedan, exclusively in the Roadmaster and Super lines, that was called Riviera. But 1959 was the first year that not all Buick hardtops were called Rivieras. A standard 4-window four-door hardtop was also available, as was a 4-door 6-window pillared sedan, along with a stripped chassis of which 144 were built in 1959 and 1960.&lt;ref name="production"&gt;{{cite web |title=Buick Production Figures 1950–1979 |url=http://buicks.net/years/index.shtml |work=Buicks.net |accessdate=2007-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-door convertible was only available as an Electra 225, and the 2-door hardtop as an Electra.

'''1959'''

[[File:1959 Buick Electra 225 Riviera Sedan wings.JPG|thumb|left|[[Buick#Delta fin|Delta Fins]] on a 1959 Buick Electra 225 4-door 6-window Riviera hardtop]]
For 1959, the Electra and Electra 225 both used the General Motors [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] shared with the [[Oldsmobile 98]] and all Cadillac, riding on a longer {{convert|126.3|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase than the [[GM B platform|B-body]] [[Buick LeSabre|LeSabre]] and [[Buick Invicta|Invicta]], both of which rode on {{convert|123|in|mm}}. The standard and only available engine was the 401 cubic-inch [[Buick Wildcat|Wildcat]] V8 with four-barrel carburetor, 10.25 to 1 compression ratio and {{convert|325|hp}} mated to a two-speed [[Dynaflow]] [[automatic transmission]], which was also standard equipment along with power steering and power brakes using Buick's unique {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} finned aluminum brake drums. Power windows and seat and leather interiors were standard on the Electra 225 convertible and optional on all other models. Front bucket seats were optional on the convertible. Electra interiors were trimmed in nylon Mojave cloth or broadcloth combinations with Cordaveen. Electra 225 convertibles were trimmed in leather. Standard Electra features included horizontal Red-line speedometer, two-speed electric windshield wipers, trip mileage indicator, cigar lighter, dual sunshades, Step-On parking brake, dual horns, Twin-Turbine automatic transmission, Foamtex seat cushions, electric clock, trunk light, glovebox light, power steering, power brakes, full wheelcovers and dual exhaust. In addition Electra 225s had Super Deluxe wheelcovers and an outside rearview mirror as standard equipment. Padded dashboards were also standard.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt;

The Electra, along with all other 1959 Buicks, featured all new styling not shared with other GM divisions that included slanted headlights in front along with a highly chromed square grille somewhat similar to the 1958 Buick and "[[Buick#Delta fin|Delta-Fin]]s" back along with round taillights. The "slanted" headlights were also shared with the 1958-60 [[Lincoln Continental#Third generation (1958–60)|Lincoln Continental]]. Exterior distinction from other Buicks came from extra-wide moldings, with a massive Electra emblem on the front fender extension. The Electra 225 script was found on the front fenders ahead of the wheelhouse. The 4-door models had a lower bright rear fender molding as well.

'''1960'''

The 1960 Electra and Electra 225 received a minor facelift with a concave grille and horizontal headlights centered by Buick's then-new "[[Buick#Trishield|Trishield]]" logo, which is still in use today. Reintroduced to Electras and other Buicks for 1960 were the chrome [[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPorts]] first introduced in 1949 and last seen in 1957. Electra and Electra 225 models featured four VentiPorts on each front fender while lesser LeSabre and Invicta models had three VentiPorts. Electras featured wider rocker panel bright moldings and the Electra script on the front fenders ahead of the wheelhouse. Electra 225s featured a badge that was circled on the deck lid. The Electra 225 name was found on the front fenders in place of the Electra name.

[[File:Museu Eduardo André Matarazzo - acervo automóveis 5.jpg|thumb|left|1960 Buick Electra 225 4-door 4-window hardtop]]

Inside, a revised instrument panel featured a "Mirromatic" speedometer for which the lens could be adjusted to better visibility to suit the driver. A new two-spoke steering wheel with horn bars was introduced, replacing the time honored horn ring then still common to most automobiles. Brisbane cloth interiors graced closed models while the convertible was trimmed in leather. Convertibles also had a two way power seat adjuster and power windows standard.

The bucket seat option introduced on Electra 225 convertibles in 1959 was now available on Electra coupes and included a center consolette with storage compartment. Standard Electra features included windshield wipers, trip mileage indicator, cigar lighter, dual sunshades, Step-On parking brake, dual horns, a single-key locking system, Twin-Turbine automatic transmission, Foamtex seat cushions, electric clock, trunk light, license plate frames, glovebox light, power steering and power brakes. In addition Electra 225s had back-up lights, a Glare-proof rear view mirror, parking brake signal light, safety buzzer, map light and Super Deluxe wheelcovers as standard equipment.

'''1961'''

The Electra, along with the Invicta and LeSabre, was redesigned for 1961 with drastically shrunken fins, and was joined with the all-new compact sized [[Buick Skylark#1961–1963|Skylark/Special]]. Electras featured bright rocker panel and wheelhouse moldings.  Four [[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPorts]] per front fender were a hallmark, with identification spelled out on the front fender plaques.  Electra 225s had four "hash marks" interrupting behind the wheelhouse of the rear fender. Electra 225 nameplates were found on the front fenders. Electra interiors were trimmed in fabric. Electra 225s were trimmed in Calais cloth or leather trim, except for convertibles which were trimmed in vinyl. An optional Custom interior featured leather trim, while another featured vinyl with contrasting vertical stripes and front bucket seats with a storage consolex and power two-way seat adjustment.

Standard equipment on the Electra included Turbine-Drive automatic transmission, "Mirromatic" instrument panel, directional signals, full-flow oil filter, electric windshield wipers, Deluxe steering wheel, trip mileage indicator, cigar lighter, Step-On brake, dual armrests, cloth and vinyl trim, combinations, carpeting, power steering, power brakes, two-speed windshield wiper/washer system, glovebox light, Custom-padded seat cushions and Deluxe wheelcovers.

The Electra and Electra 225 were the same length in 1961. Buick discontinued the Electra nameplate at the end of the 1961 model year, leaving only the Electra 225 starting in 1962.

'''1962'''
[[File:1962 Buick Electra 225.jpg|thumb|left|1962 Buick Electra 225 4-Door Sedan]]
The big Buick of 1962 carried four VentiPorts per front fender and featured a rakish sculptured restyle of its 1961 guise. The [[hardtop]] coupe and standard hardtop sedan featured a convertible inspired semi-formal roofline, while the [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]] hardtop sedan continued to use six-window pillarless configuration. Electra 225 rear fenders had a group of vertical hashmarks, with Electra 225 spelled out in block letters just above. A full length bright strip crowned the upper  body ridge, while the tower rocker molding and wheelhouses were accented with bright trim. Wheelcovers had a gold accent ring. Interiors were of the finest cloth and, on the convertible, leather was used. Standard features included directional signals, full-flow oil filter, dual speed electric windshield washer/wipers, Deluxe steering wheel, cigar lighter, Step-on parking brake, dual armrests, Turbine-Drive transmission, padded dashboard, heater, defroster, glovebox light, back-up lights, power steering, Glare-proof rearview mirror, power brakes, power brake signal light, safety buzzer, courtesy lights, two-way power seats, power windows, Super Deluxe wheelcovers, Safety option group, custom padded cushions, Accessory Group options and custom moldings.

'''1963'''

Buick's largest, plushest and most expensive models were restyled for 1963, with distinctive rear fenders culminating in a sharp vertical edge housing narrow back-up lights. The taillights were horizontally placed in the vertical deck cove. A unique cast grille was used at the front. Bright wheelhouse and lower body moldings, with ribbed rear fender panels were used. Red-filled Electra 225 badges were found on the rear fenders, while four VentiPorts lent status to the front fenders. Interiors were cloth and vinyl combinations, while a Custom interior in vinyl and leather, with front bucket seats and a storage console, was available for the convertible and sport coupe. Standard equipment included directional signals, full-flow oil filter, dual speed electric windshield wiper/washers, Deluxe steering wheel, cigar lighter, Step-On parking brake, dual armrests, Turbine-Drive automatic transmission, padded dashboard, heater, defroster, glovebox light, back-up lights, power steering, Glare-proof rearview mirror, power brakes, parking brake signal light, safety buzzer, courtesy lights, two-way power seats, power windows, Super Deluxe wheelcovers, Safety option group, custom padded cushions, Accessory Group options and custom moldings. Buick dropped the Riviera name as a body style designation after the 1963 model year, shifting the [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]] name exclusively to Buick's new personal luxury coupe that had been introduced in 1963. Buick added a 7-way tilt steering wheel and a new cruise control as an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1963_Buick/1963_Buick_Full_Size/1963%20Buick-23%20%20amp%20%2024.html |title=Directory Index: Buick/1963_Buick/1963_Buick_Full_Size |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---October/1963-Buick-Full-Size-Brochure-Cdn/1963-Buick-Full-Size-Cdn--24-25 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008080710/http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---October/1963-Buick-Full-Size-Brochure-Cdn/1963-Buick-Full-Size-Cdn--24-25 |archive-date=2017-10-08 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1964'''
[[File:1964 Buick Electra 225 four-door six-window sedan, rear right.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of 1964 Electra 225 four-door pillarless sedan (six-window)]]
The large [[General Motors]] [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] was used to create the 1964 Electra 225, Buick's richest full-size car. Vertical, narrow taillamps were found in the nearly straight-cut rear fender ends, and the so-called "Deuce-and-a Quarter" came with fender skirts. Four traditional VentiPorts were found on the front fenders, with heavy die-cast grille accenting the frontal aspect. Wide front lower body moldings were used along with a bright deck cove insert. Electra 225 lettering was found on the rear fenders and specific full wheelcovers were featured. Vinyl and brocade cloth interior trims were found in closed models, while leather upholstery was offered for seats in the convertible. Among the Electra's exclusive standard equipment were power steering; power brakes; two-speed electric wipers with windshield washer; foam padded seats; electric clock; license frame; trunk light; two-way power seat and power windows for the convertible; safety buzzer; and additional courtesy lights. The two-speed [[Dynaflow]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] was replaced by the 3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic|TH-400]] as standard equipment.

'''1965'''

All GM passenger vehicles received a major redesign in 1965 dominated by flowing "[[Coke bottle styling|Coke bottle]]" lines and [[fastback]] roof profiles on its [[coupe]] models, and the 6 window-body style was eliminated. For 1965, Buick also changed its marketing strategy and offering the Electra 225 in two trim levels, base and Custom. Along with the new body came a new chassis with a full perimeter frame including side rails that replaced the previous "X" frame used since 1961. Engine offerings were unchanged from 1964 including the standard {{convert|325|hp|0|abbr=on}} 401 V8, and two versions of the larger 425 V8 that were rated at {{convert|340|hp|0|abbr=on}} with a four-barrel carburetor or {{convert|360|hp|0|abbr=on}} with two four barrels. The three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic transmission was standard equipment.  A new body style introduced for 1965 was the thin-pillar 4-door sedan, which featured frameless window glass with a thin, chrome fixed "B" pillar.

'''1966'''
[[File:Buick Electra 225 Coupé 1966 2.jpg|thumb|left|1966 Electra 225 2-door hardtop]]

The 1966 Electra 225 saw only minor styling changes including a new grille and a revised full-width taillight and trunk lid that included an "Electra 225" script rather than the "BUICK" nameplate spelled out in 1965. Engine offerings were unchanged from 1965 with the exception that the dual-quad {{convert|360|hp|0|abbr=on}} 425 was downgraded from a factory option to dealer-installed. Inside, a revised instrument panel featured a horizontal sweep speedometer, fuel gauge and warning lights. Front seat headrests became an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1966_Buick/1966_Buick_Prestige_Brochure/1966%20Buick%20Prestige-54-55.html |title=Directory Index: Buick/1966_Buick/ 1966_Buick_Prestige_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JVgx_9XqcnMC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=remy+martin+Cognac+1867&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tvFiw083gf&amp;sig=bGV3XTIvCY7CpWMj3ETQOhxC6aY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPze_Ngd7QAhUhrlQKHWQWAZMQ6AEIQTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=remy%20martin%20Cognac%201867&amp;f=false Google books: "Ebony"; Nov 1965]: pp 26- Retrieved 2016-11-5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1967'''
[[File:1967 Buick Electra 225 Hardtop.jpg|thumb|left|1967 Electra 225 2-door hardtop]]

A moderate facelift highlighted the 1967 Electra 225 including a [[Pontiac]]/[[Oldsmobile]]-like divided split grille. Both base and Custom models were continued with a new "[[Buick Limited|Limited]]" option package available Electra 225 Custom 4-door hardtop reviving a nameplate that graced Buick's ultra-luxury flagship in the late 1930s (and again in 1958), which included an ultra-luxurious interior trim. Under the hood a new 430 cubic-inch V8 rated at {{convert|360|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with four-barrel carburetor replaced the previous "[[Buick V8 engine#Buick .22Nailhead V8.22|Nailhead]]" 401 and 425 V8s. Power front disc brakes were available as a new option along with a stereo 8-track tape player.

'''1968'''
[[File:1968 Buick Electra 225 Custom 4-door sedan in black, front right.jpg|thumb|left|1968 Buck Electra 225 4-door sedan]]

The '68 Electra 225 received a revised grille and taillight trim along with concealed windshield wipers. Inside, there was a revised instrument panel with a square speedometer and other instruments, plus a new steering wheel. Shoulder seat-belts were standard for both the driver and front passenger.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1968_Buick/1968_Buick_Brochure_2/1968%20Buick-a02.html&lt;/ref&gt; Base and Custom models were still offered, with the Limited trim option available on the Electra 225 Custom hardtop sedan.

'''1969'''
[[File:1969 Buick Electra 225 Custom white convertible.jpg|thumb|left|1969 Buick Electra 225 Custom convertible]]

The year 1969 also brought a major restyling to the Electra 225 and other GM [[GM B platform|B-body]] and [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] cars with somewhat crisper bodylines than 1965–68 models, but continued with the same chassis and inner body structure introduced with the 1965 model, however the wheelbase was increased one inch to {{convert|127|in|mm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}}. The 1969s were also the first to offer headrests as standard equipment due to a federal safety mandate, and the steering column with ignition switch that also locked the steering wheel with the transmission in "Park", a feature found on all 1969 GM cars one year before it became a federal safety mandate in 1970. Also new was a variable-ratio power steering system combined with revised front suspension tuning called "Accu-Drive."

Other changes included ventless front windows. The same assortment of base and Custom models were offered in 1969 with the "Limited" trim package available on Custom sedans and coupes. A new option available with the Limited package was a split 60/40 bench seat with center armrest.

Finned aluminum drum brakes were again offered as standard equipment, while the Bendix four-piston disk brake units were also available. 12" x 1" vented steel rotors were coupled with the cast iron caliper assemblies. A dual exhaust was available as an option. Five different rear axles were available: a 2.56 Economy as well as 2.73, 3.08, 3.23:1 gear ratios. The special PX-Code "AC Delete" 3.91 performance gear option was also available. The standing quartermile was completed in 15.5 seconds at a terminal velocity of {{convert|90|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}} for the dual exhaust engine with the 2.73 gear ratio in a {{convert|4700|lb|0|abbr=on}} Custom Convertible.

'''1970'''
[[File:1970 Buick Electra 225 ht sedan front right.jpg|thumb|left|1970 Buick Electra 225 4-door hardtop]]

Only a minor facelift with revised grille and taillight trim marked the 1970 Electra 225. The big news was under the hood, where a new {{convert|370|hp|0|abbr=on}} 455 cubic-inch V8 replaced the 430 V8 used from 1967 to 1969. This was the final year for the Electra convertible, finned aluminum brake drums and high compression engines. New this year was a concealed radio antenna, which amounted to two wires embedded in the windshield.

New for 1970 was the [[Buick Estate|Estate Wagon]], which shared the Electra's 455 V8 and four [[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPorts]], but was a [[GM B platform|B-body]] car like the [[Buick LeSabre|LeSabre]] and the [[Buick Wildcat|Wildcat]] and consequently shared the smaller cars' {{convert|124.0|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase and interior. This was Buick's first full-sized station wagon since 1964. The following year the Buick Estate would move up to Electra's larger body and more voluminous interior.

Like the other GM brands, Buick completely restyled its [[GM B platform|B-body]] and [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] cars for 1971. The full-size cars emerged larger and heavier than ever before or after. The new GM full-size bodies, at 64.3" front shoulder room and 63.4" rear shoulder room set a record for interior width that would not be matched by any car until the full-size GM rear-wheel drive models of the early to mid 1990s. The styling featured curved bodysides, long hoods and wide expanses of glass. All Electra 225s were hardtops in the 1971 to 1973 model years, eliminating the previous four-door pillared sedan variant and the convertible. In 1974 Buick adopted GM's pillared coupe body and fitted it with the "Landau" option on the Electra Limited coupe. Optional driver and passenger [[airbag]]s were also available from 1974 to 1976, but they were unpopular due to their cost.

'''1971'''

In the first year for new GM C-body shared with [[Oldsmobile 98]] and [[Cadillac]], the 1971 Electra 225 rode on a new body chassis which retained the {{convert|127|in|mm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} wheelbase with styling evolutionary from previous models. The new design included a double-shell roof for improved roll-over protection and noise reduction. Inside was a new wrap-around cockpit style instrument panel shared with B-body LeSabre and Centurion models that grouped all instruments with easy reach of the driver.

Under the hood, the 455-cubic-inch V8 was retained as standard equipment, but featured a lower compression of 8.5 to 1 compared to 10.25 to 1 in 1970 as part of a GM corporate mandate requiring all engines to run on 91 Research octane regular leaded, low-lead or unleaded gasolines. Horsepower also dropped from 370 to 315 as a result. Standard equipment continued to consist of variable-ratio power steering and Turbo Hydra-matic transmission. Power front disc brakes were now standard equipment on Electras, replacing the {{convert|12|in|mm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} finned aluminum drum brakes used in full-sized Buicks since the late 1950s.

Also new for the 1971 Electra 225, as well as the B-body [[Buick LeSabre|LeSabre]] and [[Buick Centurion|Centurion]], and [[GM E platform|E-body]] [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]], was a new power ventilation system. The system, shared with other GM B-, C- and E-body cars along with the compact [[Chevrolet Vega]], used the heater fan to draw air into the car from the cowl intake, and force it out through vents in the trunk lid or tailgate. In theory, passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped, as in heavy traffic. In practice, however, it didn't work.

Within weeks of the 1971 models' debut, however, Buick—and all other GM dealers—received multiple complaints from drivers who complained the ventilation system pulled cold air into the car before the heater could warm up—and could not be shut off. The ventilation system was extensively revised for 1972.

From 1971 to 1976, Buick's full-sized [[Buick Estate|Estate Wagon]] shared the {{convert|127.0|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase and 455 cubic-inch V8 with the Electra 225, and shared its interior and exterior styling from 1971 to 1974 (complete with the prerequisite four [[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPorts]]). And although from 1975 to 1976 the number of VentiPorts were reduced by one, and the front fascia was downgraded to a LeSabre's, the Electra 225 style chrome rocker panel moldings and distinctive Electra 225 style rear quarter panels (albeit without fender skirts) remained. These were the first Buick station wagons to be built on Buick's largest chassis since the [[Buick Roadmaster|Roadmaster Estates]] of 1947–53. The Estate Wagons, as did other GM full-sized wagons during these years, used a unique rear suspension with multi-leaf springs instead of the coil springs used on other full-sized Buicks, and other full-sized GM cars. The Estate Wagons also featured a new '[[Station wagon#Tailgate evolution|clamshell]]' tailgate design where the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof as the tailgate (manually or with power assist), slid into a recess under the cargo floor. The power tailgate, the first in station wagon history, ultimately supplanted the manual tailgate, which required marked effort to lift from storage. It was operated by switches on the instrument panel or a key switch on the rear quarter panel. The clamshell system, heavy and complex, made it easier to load and unload the extremely long wagons in tight spaces. But it remained un-adopted by any other manufacturer, and would be eliminated when GM reduced the length of their wagons by about a foot in 1977, and the overriding concern became increased fuel economy.

At {{convert|5182|lb|kg|abbr=on}} shipping weight, or about {{convert|5400|lb|kg|abbr=on}} curb weight, the three-seat 1974 Estate Wagons are easily the heaviest Buicks ever built, even heavier than the [[Buick Limited]] limousines of 1936–42.

'''1972'''
[[File:Nationale oldtimerdag Zandvoort 2010, 1972 BUICK ELECTRA 225 AM-97-30.JPG|thumb|left|1972 Buick Electra 225]]

A new egg-crate grille and taillight trim highlighted the 1972 Electra 225s. The trouble-prone ventilation system used in 1971 was replaced by a new system using vents in the doorjambs instead of the trunk-mounted vents of 1971.

The 455 V8 was carried over and now rated at 250 net horsepower compared to 315 gross horsepower in 1971. The differences in advertised horsepower in the two years was due to an industry-wide switch from "gross" (dynometer-rated and not installed in vehicle) to "net" (as installed in vehicle with accessories and emission controls installed) horsepower measurements.  The 1972 Buick was available as: Electra 225, Electra 225 Custom, and Electra 225 Custom Limited.

'''1973'''
[[File:Buick-Electra-coupe.jpg|thumb|right|1973 Electra 225 coupe]]
A revised egg-crate grille above a new federally mandated {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} front bumper and revised taillights were among the most noticeable changes for the 1973 Electra 225. All engines now featured EGR valves to meet increasingly stringent 1973 emission standards (the EGR valve was featured on Buick engines for California cars in 1972).

'''1974'''

New grillework and a new rear with revised taillights and a federally mandated {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} rear bumper highlighted the 1974 Electra 225, still available in base and up level Electra Custom models. The Electra Limited, previously a luxurious trim option on the Custom models, was upgraded to full model status. Electra Limited models also got power windows, power driver's seat and a new digital clock as standard equipment, along with an optional leather upholstery trim, the first Buicks (along with that year's Riviera) to offer real leather seats since the 1963 Riviera. The 1974 Buick Electra Limited had velour seats and door panels that were the same as the 1974 Oldsmobile 98 Regency.

The 455 V8 was revised to meet the 1974 federal and California emission standards with horsepower dropping from 250 in 1972–73 to 230 for 1974. A one-year only option for the '74 Electra was the high-performance Stage 1 455 with dual exhausts and a {{convert|245|hp||abbr=on}} rating.  1974 was the last year for the pillarless hardtop coupe, although the 4 door hardtop would continue to be produced until 1976.

Inside, the wrap-around instrument panel was substantially revised and optionally available for the first time (and seldom ordered) was a driver's side airbag system with an exclusive steering wheel design. 1974 was the final year for the Max Trac traction control option. New options for 1974 included radial tires and a "low fuel" warning light came on when the gas tank was down to only four gallons. A new distinctive "Landau" option was available on the Limited coupe that included the now-popular rear side opera windows and rear-quarter vinyl roof.

'''1975'''
[[File:Buick Electra Limited 1975.jpg|thumb|left|1975 Buick Electra Limited]]
1975 brought about changes in all of General Motors C-body cars.  In 1975, all Electra 225 coupes had fixed rear side windows and center posts.  1975 also brought along a newer front end and interior design. Rectangular headlights became standard on all GM C-body cars&lt;!---NOTE: This was ''not'' the case with the Chevrolet, [[Pontiac Catalina]], Oldsmobile Delta 88, or Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser, which didn't have them until 1976(and the Chevys that got them were only the Caprice models)---&gt;, along with many others. This supposedly would allow engineers to lower the front end to reduce wind resistance, but this wasn't very apparent with the new design.  The Electra received a new metal "eggcrate" style grille, which covered most of the front end, and wrapping under the headlights. The grille included running lights on either side. There was a choice of a base model Electra 225, whose trim and appointments were upgraded to the same level as the previous year's Electra 225 Custom, an upscale Limited, and the Park Avenue. The 1975 Electra was also the longest Buick ever built at {{convert|233.4|in|mm|0}}, which is over 19 feet. These cars dwarfed the newer front-wheel drive Electras and Park Avenues in sheer size and weight.

Power windows and a power driver's seat became standard on all Electra models in 1975. Also new to the standard equipment list were radial-ply tires. The 1975 Electra was one of the first GM vehicles to offer an Air Cushion Restraint System or "airbag".

Inside, a new flat instrument panel (shared with LeSabre, Estate Wagon and Riviera) with horizontal sweep speedometer (silver facing with black lettering) replaced the wrap-around cockpit dash of previous years and door panel trim was revised. The speedometer was scaled back from {{convert|120|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|100|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and kilometer readings were added. The 1975 Buick Electra Limited got an all new interior.

Technical changes for 1975 included the addition of a catalytic converter and electronic ignition to not only meet the stringent 1975 and later emission requirements, but also extended routine maintenance intervals, and improved fuel economy and driveability which was a must in the era immediately following the 1973–74 energy crisis, but also spelled the end of dual exhaust systems and mandated the use of unleaded gasoline as the converter could be rendered useless if contaminated with lead. Axle ratios were also numerically lowered to aid in improving gas mileage. The 455 four-barrel V8, now rated at {{convert|205|hp||abbr=on}}, was retained as the standard and only available engine.

'''Electra Limited Park Avenue'''

The [[Buick Park Avenue|Park Avenue]], originally an interior comfort and appearance package, gave buyers ultra-luxurious pillow-topped seating, a center console, velour headliner, thicker carpet, and an upscale door panel design. The Park Avenue's seats were designed by Flexsteel. This seating design was similar to the [[Cadillac Sixty Special]] with the Talisman (1974–1976) option and stayed with Park Avenue through the 1980 model year. Some Park Avenues were built with the full size center console (unlike the Sixty Special's Talisman's half console), which eliminated the 6th passenger, in the front middle, between the driver and front passenger. The center console was eliminated in 1977 to better accommodate a sixth passenger. 1975 also offered a more luxurious Park Avenue Deluxe, which was sold only in 1975, and included every option available on the Electra (posi-traction, 15" rallye sport wheels, rear automatic leveling, etc.). The Park Avenue Deluxe was an expensive option not popular with buyers; only 37 were built. The Park Avenue would remain as the top level trim package through 1988. In 1989 the Electra Park Avenue Ultra debuted as the top model. In 1991, the Electra name would be dropped completely and Park Avenue would replace it as the flagship Buick sedan.

'''1976'''
[[File:'76 Buick Limited (Destination Décarie 2012).JPG|thumb|left|1976 Buick 225 Limited 2-door coupe]]
[[File:1976 Buick Electra Limited fR.jpg|thumb|1976 Electra 225 Limited]]

1976 brought about a few changes on the Electra. The front-end was reworked, including the grille and bumper. The new plastic grille featured 17 vertical bars and covered much of the radiator. The grille did not extend under the headlights in 1976, but instead Buick moved the running lights and turn signal lights underneath the headlights, where the 1975 grille had once been. The bumper no longer housed running lights.  There were also some minor interior differences. The brake release handle was black instead of chrome, the seat material was slightly different, on the limited, notch-back diamond pattern seating. The 1975 material appeared in a "corduroy" form, but the actual material was not corduroy. The 1976 diamond pattern seating material did not have this appearance.  The engine air cleaner did not have a "cold-air" ram air intake hose like the 1975 model did, and there were some carburetor changes and camshaft changes to meet EPA standards. The rear end ratio also was higher than the 1975 standard, at 2.56:1 instead of 2.73:1. The Park Avenue and leather seating in 1975 and 1976 were the same. Once again, there was the base 225, the Limited, and the luxurious Park Avenue. The Park Avenue Deluxe vanished for 1976 due to poor sales. The 1976 Electra is about the same size as the 1975 at {{convert|233.3|in|mm|0}}, making them among the biggest Buicks ever.

The 1975 Buick Electra 225 Limited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://img87.imageshack.us/img87/5060/1272713img7mt.jpg |title=1975 Electra image |accessdate=2011-08-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716220405/http://img87.imageshack.us/img87/5060/1272713img7mt.jpg |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was the longest four-door hardtop car GM ever built, as the Cadillac Sixty Special (which was a bit longer) was unavailable as a hardtop sedan since the mid-sixties. The model also ushered in a return of the six window configuration that Buick offered between 1959 and 1964.

All Electras were powered by Buick's 455 cu. in. (7.5&amp;nbsp;L) engine between 1971 and 1976. The 1971 model had {{convert|315|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, but that was reduced to {{convert|205|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} by the 1976 model year; increasingly stringent [[Vehicle emissions control|exhaust emission limits]] reduced engine output, and an industry-wide 1972 [[Horsepower#Society of Automotive Engineers|change in rating systems]] reduced the horsepower numbers produced by any given engine. Even at its weakest state, the Buick-built 455 engine still produced {{convert|345|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 2000&amp;nbsp;rpm. The 455 was the standard engine on the Electra, but there were some built with Buick 350s during the GM strike, when 455 production halted. The 350 engine also came with a price rebate. The 455 engine disappeared after the 1976 model year, in favor of smaller, more efficient engines.

Total production for this generation was 794,833.

GM downsized all [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] cars in 1977, including the Electra.  It lost over {{convert|11|in|mm|0}} in length and quite a bit of weight too.  The car was totally redesigned, but still offered base 225 and Limited trims, plus a top-line Park Avenue option package, which became available on the coupe.  The console option in the Park Avenue was gone, never to return to the rear wheel drive Electra. The downsized model brought increased sales, with 161,627 Electras produced in 1977.&lt;ref name="production"/&gt;  Hardtops were no longer produced; all models now had thick "B" pillars.

The big-block 455 was gone forever. The base engine was now the [[Buick V8 engine#350|Buick 350]] with a 4-barrel carburetor until 1979. The [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#403|Oldsmobile 403]] was optional from 1977 to 1979. Oldsmobile's [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#LF9 Diesel|350 diesel]] was added to the option list beginning in 1980, along with an Oldsmobile-sourced 307. The Buick 350 was now optional, with the base engine being the Buick 4.1 L V6 for improved fuel economy. In 1981, the then-optional Buick 350 was dropped. That same year, the Electra gained the new THM200-4R automatic transmission, which featured a lock-up torque converter and a 0.67:1 overdrive ratio. With the new transmission, the Electra could be equipped with a numerically higher rear axle ratio for better performance, while offering improved fuel economy with the overdrive range.

Park Avenue, previously an appearance option package, became an official trim level on the Electra in 1978.  Cosmetically, a different grille and redesigned tail lights were the only notable cosmetic changes that year but 1979 brought a redesigned, flat front end and a subtly different taillight treatment featuring a Buick crest and bisecting horizontal silver line.  It didn't last as the 1980 Electra went back to its earlier 1977 roots but with a new grille featuring vertical slats.  Also in 1980, Buick completely dropped the "225" moniker leaving just Limited and Park Avenue trims.

For the first time since 1959, Electras didn't have four [[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPorts]] in 1981. The 1981 model saw very few changes from the 1980 restyle but it got a modified grille and new powertrains.  The top-line Electra Park Avenue model continued to show 4 small depressions with stickers in the chrome moulding on its front fenders until they were completely gone in 1985. Production of the rear-wheel drive Electra ceased in April 1984.&lt;ref name="conundrum"&gt;{{cite news|author=Stark, Harry A. |title=C-car conundrum: selling two different cars with one name |work=Ward's Auto World |date=February 1984 |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3165/is_v20/ai_3121734 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050408185157/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3165/is_v20/ai_3121734 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2005-04-08 |accessdate=2007-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Technically this was the last year of the rear wheel drive [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]], as it was renamed the [[GM D platform|D-body]] and would continue on under the [[Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham]], and later the 1987–92 [[Cadillac Brougham]] and finally the 1993–96 [[Cadillac Fleetwood]]. The next large rear wheel drive Buick sedan would be the 1992–96 [[Buick Roadmaster|Roadmaster]], sharing the same [[GM B platform|B-body]] as the Chevrolet Caprice and GM's last full-size rear wheel drive station wagons.

The [[Buick Estate Wagon]] was also downsized for 1977. It had been a separate model in its own right since 1970, alternatively sharing chassis and styling with both the Electra and LeSabre. In stark contrast to 1975–76 when it shared Electra's {{convert|127.0|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase and used the LeSabre's front end styling, the new Estate Wagon shared LeSabre's [[GM B platform|B-body]] and used Electra's front-end styling.

For 1985, a redesigned [[front-wheel drive]] Electra debuted with the new GM [[GM C platform (FWD)|C body]] which was further downsized compared to the previous generation.  Despite its notably smaller exterior, interior dimensions remained largely the same as the prior generation, though forgoing all V8 engines. Sales began in April 1984, alongside the previous [[rear-wheel-drive]] model, which had ceased production that month.&lt;ref name="conundrum"/&gt; It was initially powered by a carbureted 3.0 liter Buick [[V6 engine]], a fuel injected 3.8 liter Buick V6 engine, or a 4.3 liter [[Oldsmobile Diesel engine|Oldsmobile diesel]] V6 engine.  Each used a 4-speed [[automatic transmission]] with a 0.70:1 overdrive gear.  The 3.0 liter carbureted V6 and 4.3 liter diesel V6 were not offered after 1985.

[[File:Buick Electra Park Avenue.jpg|thumb|250px|left|1988 Buick Electra Park Avenue sedan]]

The trim levels for the Electra initially included 300/380/430 (based on engine displacement), Park Avenue, and performance-oriented [[T-Type]].  Limited replaced the number designation starting in 1987 and a new top level Park Avenue Ultra was added in 1989.

The Electra's hood was hinged in the front thus opening at the passenger compartment, opposite of the conventional setup.  The car's overall design remained largely unchanged from 1985 thru 1990, though in 1987, the Electra lineup lost the four-lamp "quad" headlights used in 1985–86 models in favor of composite one-piece headlights.

The sixth generation Electras were initially offered in both 2-door coupe and 4-door sedan body styles but the 2-door coupe versions were eventually discontinued in 1986 (Electra 380) and 1987 (Electra Park Avenue).

In 1988, the Electra Park Avenue received the 3800 V-6. The original 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V-6 was still offered in some Electra models through the 1988 model year and was designated by the VIN code 3, while Electras with the 3800 V-6 were designated by the VIN code C. For 1989, the front seat belts became door-mounted, and back seat shoulder belts became standard.

'''Park Avenue Ultra'''

In 1989 and 1990, Buick introduced the Park Avenue Ultra trim level. The Ultra was essentially an upgrade to the Electra Park Avenue line, and featured a standard leather interior with dual 20-way power front seats, lower-body accent exterior paint treatment, distinctive thick-padded vinyl top with smaller limousine-style rear-window  (available only on Ultra), simulated burled elm trim on the doors and instrument panel, unique aluminum wheels, anti-lock brakes, chromed [[B-pillar]] moldings, specific grille and tail lamps, leather-wrapped steering wheel, leather padded glove-compartment door, unique interior door panel trim, and a variety of otherwise minor changes. With its longer list of standard equipment, the Park Avenue Ultra sedan actually carried a higher base price than the Cadillac [[Cadillac de Ville series|Sedan de Ville]].  The Park Avenue Ultra did not gain much popular recognition, however, until the following generation of Park Avenue where the "Ultra" trim level offered even more features.

[[File:Buick_Electra_Estate_Wagon.JPG|thumb|left|1980s Buick Electra Estate]]
During the 1985 to 1989 model years, the Electra name also continued to be used on the rear-wheel drive B-body station wagon.  "Electra" was dropped from the name in 1990, becoming the Estate Wagon, and the model was then replaced by the [[Buick_Roadmaster#1991-1996|Roadmaster Estate]] in 1991.
{{clear}}

== Discontinuation ==
The long running Electra name was dropped from Buick's lineup at the end of the 1990 model year. Starting in 1991, the  [[Buick Park Avenue|Park Avenue]] became a distinct model instead of a trim designation. The last Electra rolled off the assembly line on August 3, 1990.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The '''Buick Invicta''' is a [[Full-size car|full-size]] automobile produced by [[Buick]] from 1959 to 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Auto Editors of Consumer Guide|title=1959-1963 Buick Invicta|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1959-1963-buick-invicta6.htm|website=[[HowStuffWorks]]|date=19 August 2007|accessdate=2 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Invicta was a continuation of the [[Buick Century]] concept that mated the standard size [[Buick LeSabre]] (pre-1959, [[Buick Special]]) body with Buick's larger 401 cubic inch [[Buick V8 engine#401|Nailhead]] V8 engine, yielding what was referred to as "the banker's hot rod." The name was derived from [[Latin]] and signified 'unconquerable, invincible, unbeatable, unvanquished' according to Buick Motor Division sales training materials.

The Invicta series was introduced as a full line of body styles for model year 1959.  Sales never approached that of either the entry-level [[Buick LeSabre|LeSabre]] or top level [[Buick Electra|Electra]] models, but were consistent with the traditional sales penetration of Buick's sporty mid-priced models (the 1954 to 1958 Century and 1963 to 1970 Wildcat). The Invicta continued the tradition of installing [[Buick#Ventiports|Ventiports]] on the front fenders from the Century.

In a survey of 1959 Buick owners in the March, 1959 issue of [[Popular Mechanics]], 47.1% of owners like the ride comfort, though many (25.2%) said the drive shaft tunnel was too big.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vtsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=24 June 2019 |work=Popular Mechanics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1960, an Invicta Custom trim package was offered, featuring bucket seats and a 'consolette' in the hardtop coupe, convertible and wagon and a leather bench seat with a center armrest on some 4 door hardtops. Sales were nominal.

According to [[Robin Moore]]'s 1969 book ''[[The French Connection (book)|The French Connection]]'', "the 1960 Buick Invicta had a peculiarity in body construction conducive to the installations of...extraordinary, virtually detection-proof traps concealed within the fenders and undercarriage" that made it a popular model for international heroin smugglers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Robin|year=1969|title=The French Connection: A True Account of Cops, Narcotics, and International Conspiracy|location=Boston|publisher=Little, Brown &amp; Co.|isbn=1-59228-044-7|pages=50, 54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Invicta received several updates for the 1961 model year. It was the last year the 364 cubic inch [[Buick V8 engine#364|Nailhead]] V8 engine was offered before the engine was retired. The station wagon did not reappear until the 1962 model year.

1962 saw the debut of the [[Buick Wildcat|Wildcat]] two-door hardtop within the Invicta series. The Wildcat featured most of the interior trim of the Invicta Custom, which included standard bucket seats and upgraded door panels.  Instead of the Invicta Custom's short console, however, the Wildcat had a long console with a tachometer and a shift lever. Other Wildcat features included special badging and exterior trim, along with a vinyl top and [[Buick Electra|Electra 225]]-like taillights, rather than those of the LeSabre/Invicta. These features placed the Wildcat well in step with the shift towards sports-oriented models.

For 1963, the Wildcat would replace the Invicta four-door hardtop, two-door coupe, and convertible. The Invicta series had a 6-passenger station wagon as its sole model. Only 3,495 Invicta station wagons were built for 1963, after which the name disappeared.

The Invicta nameplate was re-trademarked by Buick in 2004{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}, a [[concept car]] bearing that name was unveiled at the [[Auto China|Beijing Auto Show]] on April 19, 2008. The vehicle was designed in a collaboration between the [[General Motors Technical Center]] in [[Warren, Michigan]] and [[Pan Asia Technical Automotive Center]] in [[Shanghai|Shanghai, China]].&lt;ref name="autoblog" /&gt; The designers responsible for the exterior design were Justin Thompson and Richard Duff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2008-04-18|others=Justin J.

The concept was equipped with a 2.0-liter direct injection turbo engine rated at {{convert|250|hp|kW|0}} and {{convert|220|lbft|Nm|0}} mated with a 6-speed automatic transmission, MacPherson strut front and independent rear suspensions, four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes, 20 x 8.5 inch polished aluminum wheels with P245/40R20 tires. Featured on the car are several traditional Buick design cues: the [[Buick#Sweepspear|Sweepspear]], [[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPorts]], a [[Buick#Trishield|tri-color Buick trishield]], and the [[Buick#Waterfall grille|waterfall grille]].

The vehicle's designs were later used on the second generation [[Buick LaCrosse#Second generation (2010–2016)|Buick LaCrosse]].{{clear}}

The '''Buick Roadmaster''' is an automobile that was built by [[Buick]] from 1936 to 1958, and again from 1991 to 1996. Roadmasters produced between 1936 and 1958 were built on Buick's longest non-limousine wheelbase and shared their basic structure with entry-level [[Cadillac]] and, after 1940, senior [[Oldsmobile]]s. Between 1946 and 1957 the Roadmaster served as Buick's flagship.

When it was resurrected for the 1991 through 1996 model years, it became the marque's largest vehicle. The Roadmaster sedan, a [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] vehicle over its eight previous generations, shared the [[GM B platform|B-body]] for the first time in its history. It was a full {{convert|10|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} longer with a {{convert|5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} greater wheelbase than the [[GM C platform (FWD)|C-body]] [[Buick Park Avenue]].  It was also larger both in wheelbase ({{convert|2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}) and overall length ({{convert|6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}) than the [[GM K platform (1980)|K-body]] [[Cadillac_de_Ville_series#Seventh_generation_(1994–1999)|Cadillac DeVille]].

The Series 80, which belonged to an upper category trim package, had a {{convert|5650|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on|disp=flip}} straight eight engine developing {{convert|104|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 2,800 rpm. The next year  a new high performance engine was introduced developing {{convert|113|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. In 1933, the model was completely revised. At the end of 1933 the 80 series was discontinued after 24,117 units produced. In 1936 the model was re-introduced and changed its name to "Series 80 Roadmaster".

The origins of the Roadmaster name date to 1936 when Buick added names to its entire model lineup to celebrate the engineering improvements and design advancements over their 1935 models. Buick's Series 40 was named the [[Buick Special|Special]], the Series 50 became the [[Buick Super|Super]], the Series 60 was named the [[Buick Century|Century]] and the Series 90 — Buick's largest and most luxurious vehicle — was named the [[Buick Limited|Limited]]. The Series 50 was retired, but new for the model year was the Series 80 Roadmaster. The implications of the name were clear, for as the 1936 Buick sales catalogue said, "It literally named itself the first time a test model leveled out on the open highway."

The Roadmaster was introduced in a year when Buick's [[Overhead valve|valve-in-head]] straight-eight engines were heavily revised. Buick reduced the number of engines from four sizes to two: a 233-cubic-inch, 93-horsepower job for the Special, and a big, 320.2-cubic inch, 120-horsepower engine for the other series. (To put the size and power of Buick’s larger straight-eight engine in context, compare it to the new 322-cubic-inch mono-block 120 horsepower V-8 that Cadillac introduced that year.) In addition to this major engineering change 1936 was also the year Buick adopted an all steel turret top and hydraulic brakes. Coil springs were in the front.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1937"/&gt;

The Roadmaster was a big car, in sedan form tipping the scales at 4,098 pounds, some 88 pounds heavier than Cadillac's new [[Cadillac Series 60|Series 60]]. But pricewise, the Roadmaster was a tremendous bargain. The sedan sold for $1,255, $440 less than the least expensive Cadillac. The only other body style available was a four-door convertible phaeton, priced at $1,565 (of which only 1064 were produced), at a time when a Cadillac in the same body style sold at prices ranging from $2,745 to $7,850. Buick’s new engineering and styling was a big hit, with model year sales more than tripling from just over 48,000 to nearly 158,000, and with the all new Series 80 Roadmaster contributing a total of 16,049 units to that number.

[[File:1937 Buick Roadmaster Series 80 sedan, front right side.jpg|thumb|left|1937 Buick Roadmaster sedan]]
With the Roadmaster being a completely new model, and with Buick having totally restyled its entire line for 1936, one might have expected only modest changes for 1937. But that was not the case. Buick was the only GM car, along with the Chevrolet Standard, to retain its basic 1934 styling for 1935, so the 1936 re-style merely caught Buick up with the rest of the GM marques. For 1937, Buick moved to newly re-styled bodies along with all other GM cars. The Roadmaster gained a divided grille with horizontal bars. The center section of the grille was painted to match the body of the car. Fenders became squared off and the headlight shells were gracefully streamlined. Overall height fell by {{convert|1.5|in|mm}} without sacrificing interior room. A new carburetor and revised camshaft raised engine horsepower to 130. The engine also received a new intake manifold, oil pump, cooling system and a quieter overhead valve mechanism. A formal sedan, featuring a roll-down glass partition between the front and rear compartments, was added to the Roadmaster line for $1,641, of which 452 were sold. The price of the sedan was raised to $1,518, and that of the phaeton to $1,856, or by 21 percent and 19 percent respectively. Nevertheless, overall Roadmaster sales increased to 16,129.

[[File:The spring and shock absorber hook-up on the rear wheel of the 1938 Buick chassis.jpg|left|thumb|Spring and shock absorber mechanism on the rear wheels of the 1938 Buicks]]
Styling changes for 1938 were modest, with a longer hood extending to a now nearly vertical grill, taller bumper guards and redesigned hubcaps, but the effect was striking. Important changes were made to both engine and chassis. The ride was improved by replacing the rear leaf springs with coil springs, supported by double-acting shock absorbers that were some four times the size of any others on the market. The frame X-member was changed from I-beam to channel construction and all wood structural elements were replaced with steel. The engine combustion chambers were redesigned and new "turbulator" pistons raised the compression ratio from 5.9 to 6.5:1, resulting in an increase in horsepower to 141.

The 4-door convertible phaeton traded its built-in trunk look for a fastback appearance, and a new fastback sedan was added to the line with 466 being sold. The Roadmaster's price was increased, but not as swiftly as the previous year, going to $1,645 for the sedan. Although Buick’s overall market share increased in an off year, Roadmaster sales plummeted to 5,568, falling from 7.3 percent to 3.3 percent of Buick's total output.

Styling for 1939 featured a new two-piece “waterfall” grille with thin vertical bars. The hood was narrower, front door pillars were narrower and hubcaps were larger. Window area increased substantially with the rear window changing to a one-piece design. On the interior all major gauges were moved to in front of the driver and the gear shift was moved to a column mount. The 4-door phaeton could now be ordered with the built-in trunk appearance or as a fastback, but only three of the latter were actually sold. Although prices were reduced (the price of the sedan fell to $1,545) sales only rose to 6,097, with Roadmaster’s share of Buick’s total sales falling to 2.9 percent.

In 1940 the Series 80 was renamed Limited. The Roadmaster name was transferred to the new Series 70, which was introduced at the same time as a brand new Series 50 [[Buick Super|Super]]. The Roadmaster featured a cutting-edge "torpedo" [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]. The new C-body that the 1940 Buick Roadmaster shared with the Super, the [[Cadillac Series 62]], the [[Oldsmobile 98|Oldsmobile Series 90]], and the [[Pontiac Torpedo]] featured shoulder and hip room that was over 5" wider, the elimination of running boards and exterior styling that was streamlined and 2-3" lower. When combined with a column mounted shift lever the cars offered true six passenger comfort. These changes had clearly been influenced by the [[Cadillac Sixty Special]].

The 1940 Roadmaster had a shorter wheelbase, was lighter, and was less expensive than the previous year’s model. The formal and fastback sedans were gone, but for the first time a 2-door coupe was available, which sold a respectable 3,991 units. Also new for this year, the coach-building firm of [[Brunn &amp; Company|Brunn]] was asked to design several custom-bodied Buicks for the Series 70, 80 and 90. Only one Roadmaster example is known to have actually been produced in 1940, an open-front town car not surprisingly called the Townmaster. Overall sales more than tripled to 18,345.

The styling changes for 1941 were modest, but the changes under the hood were major. The compression ratio was raised from 6.6:1 to 7.0:1, the "turbulator" pistons were redesigned, smaller spark plugs were substituted for the previous type and “Compound Carburetion” was introduced. Compound Carburetion was the forerunner of the modern four-barrel carburetor, and consisted of twin two-barrel carburetors. One unit operated all of the time, while the other operated only under hard acceleration. The new engine delivered 165 horsepower. With five more horsepower than a senior [[Packard]], 15 more than any Cadillac, and 25 more than the largest [[Chrysler]]s, it was the most powerful engine available that year on an American car.

A new bodystyle for this year was a 2-door convertible, which sold 1,845 units. There was also one Brunn designed convertible produced, but priced at $3,500 actual orders for the vehicle failed to appear. Overall sales remained respectable at 15,372.

The 1942 Roadmaster was longer, lower, wider, and roomier than before (a [[Harley Earl]] trademark), thanks in part to a longer wheelbase. There was also a new vertical-bar grille and "Airfoil" fenders that swept back all the way to the rear fenders, which in subsequent generations became the chromed "[[Buick#Sweepspear|Sweepspear]]". Both features became a Buick icon exhibited in one way or another for years to come, and were influenced by the [[concept car]] called the [[Buick Y-Job]]. The 4-door phaeton was dropped and would never return. Coupes adopted the appealing Sedanet [[fastback]] style that had been the sensation of 1941 on the [[Buick Century|Century]] and [[Buick Special|Special]].

Effective at the beginning of 1942, new automobiles were available only to those in occupations deemed essential to the war effort. By mid-January, cars with no exterior chrome trim apart from the bumpers were being produced. By February passenger car production was shut down completely. Despite the abbreviated model year a total of about 8,400 were sold.

When postwar automobile production resumed in the 1946 model year, chrome was more sparingly applied, swept-back fenders were fitted to sedans as well as coupes, and a war-inspired "bombsight" hood ornament was adopted. The instrument panel was two-toned with woodgrain facings except on convertibles which used body-colored panels. Series identification was found on cloisonne emblems centered in the bumper guard front and rear. Compound Carburetion was eliminated and the compression ratio was reduced to 6.60:1. As a consequence the 1946 Roadmaster's horsepower fell from 165 to 144. Torque on the other hand was hardly affected. Nevertheless, Roadmaster’s I-8 still produced more horsepower than a top of the line Chrysler's. Owing to wartime inflation, prices were substantially higher than those of pre-war models. The biggest change was in sales proportions. Roadmaster increased its share of Buick sales from four percent in 1941 to 20 percent in 1946, with a total of about 31,400 sold.

In 1947 a new stamped grille with a separate upper bar was used. The Roadmaster name appeared in red-filled script on a chrome button within the bumper guard crossbars, front and rear. All new was an [[Buick Estate|Estate]] wagon body style. It sold 300 units and instantly became the top of the line in the station wagon market.

In 1948 a series script appeared on the front fenders and the white Tenite steering wheel that had been used previously was traded in for a black one, in order match the change from a two-tone woodgrain instrument panel to a two-tone gray instrument panel, with silver tone instruments. A new optional custom trim option was offered, consisting of cloth upholstery with leather bolsters with the robe cord cover and lower door panels trimmed in leatherette. Convertibles acquired power windows, seat and top as standard equipment. But the biggest advancement was the introduction of [[Dynaflow]], the first passenger car torque converter transmission. Optional on Roadmaster in its first year,&lt;ref&gt;https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1936-1992-buick-roadmaster4.htm&lt;/ref&gt; it was so popular that by the following it was standard equipment. Overall sales were just under 80,000 in both 1947 and 1948, over four times greater than in any prewar year.

The Roadmaster received its first major postwar restyling in 1949. Its wheelbase and overall length were reduced but its weight was actually marginally increased. The biggest change was a much larger two-piece, curved glass windshield that the sales brochure described as like an “[[observation car]].” It was also in 1949 that Buick introduced "[[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPorts]]." Four were displayed on each of the Roadmaster's front fenders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975|publisher=Krause publications|isbn=0-87341-027-0|editor=Gunnell, John A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; with three on the fenders of the Super, Century, and Special. The sales brochure noted that VentiPorts helped ventilate the engine compartment, and possibly that was true in early 1949, but sometime during the model year they became plugged. The idea for VentiPorts grew out of a modification Buick styling chief Ned Nickles had added to his own 1948 Roadmaster. He had installed four amber lights on each side of his car’s hood wired to the distributor so as to flash on and off as each piston fired simulating the flames from the exhaust stack of a fighter airplane. Combined with the bombsight mascot, VentiPorts put the driver at the controls of an imaginary fighter airplane. Upon seeing this, Buick chief [[Harlow Curtice]] was so delighted that he ordered that (non-lighting) VentiPorts be installed on all 1949 Buicks, with the number of VentiPorts (three or four) corresponding to the relative displacement of the [[straight-eight engine]] installed.

Dynaflow was now standard equipment, and engine horsepower was increased to 150 through a slight increase in the compression ratio. This contributed in conjunction with the now standard Dynaflow in giving the new Buicks a top speed of {{convert|110|mph|0|abbr=on}}. In the middle of the year the Riviera, joined the body style lineup selling 4,314 units. Featuring power windows as standard equipment, the 2-door Buick Roadmaster [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]], along with the [[Cadillac Series 62]] [[Cadillac De Ville|Coupe de Ville]] and the [[Oldsmobile 98]] Holiday, was among the first [[hardtop]] coupes ever produced. The Riviera was also notable for its popular optional "[[Buick#Sweepspear|Sweepspear]]" chrome body side molding, which would soon become a Buick trademark. This chrome-plated strip started above the front wheel, after which it gently curved down nearly to the rocker panel just before the rear wheel, and then curved around the rear wheel in a quarter of a circle to go straight back to the tail-light. The "Riviera trim", as it was initially called, was also made available on the Roadmaster convertible very late in the model year. With a total of 88,130 sold, the all-time annual record for Roadmaster, the model accounted for 27 percent of all Buick sales, a remarkably high proportion in light of its price, which was only slightly less than a [[Cadillac Series 61]].

The 1950 restyling featured a grille so toothy that ''Consumer Reports'' commented that "a toothbrush for the dentures comes extra." The Sweepspear had proved so popular in its first year that it was made standard on most body styles at the beginning of the 1950 model year, and on the station wagon and the new long wheelbase sedan mid-year. The long wheelbase sedan was stretched an extra four inches (102&amp;nbsp;mm). Like the convertibles, the Riviera and the extra plush long wheelbase sedan came with both power windows and power seats as standard equipment. Overall Roadmaster sales fell to 75,034, with Roadmaster’s share of total Buick output plummeting to 12 percent, thanks mainly to the surging popularity of the Special.

In 1951 the long wheelbase sedan was also called a Riviera although it was not a hardtop. The Sedanet and regular wheelbase sedan were cancelled.

Styling changes were minimal in 1951 and 1952. Power steering was added as an option in 1952 and horsepower climbed to 170 thanks primarily to a new four-barrel carburetor. Sales continued to slide falling to about 66,000 in 1951 and to 51,000 in 1952.

By 1953 the Roadmaster straight-eight was 16 years old and had become seriously dated. All of Roadmaster’s major competitors had shifted to short-stroke V-8 engines, and if Buick wanted to continue to be the paragon of longer, lower and wider, it needed one of its own. The new engine was ready in time for 1953, Buick’s Golden Anniversary year. Although the [[Buick V8 engine#322|Nailhead]] (as it was popularly called) was nearly identical in displacement to the straight eight [[Buick Straight-8 engine|Fireball]] (322 versus 320 cubic inches), it was {{convert|13.5|in|mm}} shorter, four inches (102&amp;nbsp;mm) lower, and {{convert|180|lb|0|abbr=on}} lighter, but with {{convert|188|hp|0|abbr=on}}, it was 11 percent more powerful. The compression ratio increased from 7.50:1 to 8.50:1 and torque increased from {{convert|280 to 300|lbft|0|abbr=on}}.

The compact dimensions of the V-8 engine enabled Buick to reduce Roadmaster’s wheelbase by {{convert|4.75|in|mm}} across the line, although styling differences behind the engine cowl, apart from new V-8 emblem hubcaps, were largely nonexistent. Buick also introduced a new "Twin-Turbine" Dynaflow as a companion for the V-8 engine. Estimated to increase torque at the wheels by 10 percent, the new transmission provided faster and quieter acceleration at reduced engine speeds. Both power steering and power brakes were made standard. Air conditioning was a new option and, years before many other makes, a 12-volt electrical system was adopted.

A new body style for 1953 was the [[Buick Skylark|Skylark]] convertible. The Buick Roadmaster Skylark was one of three specialty convertibles produced in 1953 by General Motors, the other two being the [[Oldsmobile 98]] Fiesta and the [[Cadillac Series 62]] [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]]. The Skylark featured open wheel wells, a drastically lowered belt line, a four-inch-chop from the standard Roadmaster's windshield, the absence of VentiPorts and a new Sweepspear that anticipated Buick’s 1954 styling. Kelsey-Hayes wire wheels and a solid boot cover were standard. At $5,000 only 1,690 units were produced. The following year, and for one year only, it would become its own series built on a Century body. This was the last year for the Roadmaster Estate, and it was the last [[Woodie (car body style)|wood-bodied station wagon]] mass-produced in the [[United States]]. Its body was a product of Ionia Manufacturing which built all Buick station wagon bodies between 1946 and 1964. Priced at $4,031, the Estate was second in price only to the Skylark, with 670 being sold. Overall Roadmaster sales bounced back up to 79,137.

In 1954 Buick Roadmaster and [[Buick Super|Super]] shared with [[Cadillac]] and [[Oldsmobile 98]] the new General Motors [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]], adopting the new "[[Ponton (automobile)|ponton]]" appearance, and the addition of "[[Dagmar bumpers]]" to the front. These were large, roomy cars, as much as five and a half inches longer in wheelbase and more than nine inches (229&amp;nbsp;mm) longer overall than in 1953. Roadmaster script was found on the rear quarters and within the deck ornament. Rear fenders had a blunted fin at the rear edge, with dual "bullet" taillamps below. A new panoramic windshield with vertical side pillars was used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1t4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VTQqT6rRIMbo2AX_39SHDw&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Owners Praise Buick Styling And Wrap Around Windshields."] ''Popular Mechanics'', June 1954, pp. 106-110.&lt;/ref&gt; Seats had chrome bands on 2-door models and rear seats had an armrest on 4-door models. The front suspension was refined and Roadmaster's horsepower was increased to 200. The pillared coupe and the Estate wagon were no longer offered as body styles. Overall sales dropped to 50,571 (which is 11.37 percent of model year production)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hometownbuick.com/1954-buick/1954-buick-production/&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1955 broad lower rear fender bands, gold-colored Roadmaster deck script and hood ornament, bars on the hubcaps and gold-accented grille were added to distinguish Roadmaster. Horsepower jumped to 236, and a new variable-pitch [[Dynaflow]], in which the stator blades changed pitch under hard acceleration, provided quicker off-the-line getaway. Back up lights were now standard. Overall sales were 64,527 (which is 8.73 percent of model year production)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hometownbuick.com/1955-buick/1955-buick-production/&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1956 Roadmaster had a shallower [[Buick#Sweepspear|Sweepspear]] that did not dip all the way to the rocker panel as on other models. Twin chrome strips graced the decklid with Roadmaster spelled out between them. Roadmaster script now appeared on the doors beneath the vent windows. Fender tip dual bombsights were standard. Two stator wheels were adopted as an improvement to Dynaflow. A brand new 4-door Riviera hardtop, proved to be the most popular Roadmaster, with 24,770 units sold and outselling the pillared sedan by more than two-to-one. Overall sales were 53,427 (which is 9.34 percent of model year production)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hometownbuick.com/1956-buick/1956-buick-production/&lt;/ref&gt;.

A lower body graced the 1957 Roadmaster with an even more panoramic windshield equipped with reverse slanted pillars. A red-filled [[Buick#Sweepspear|Sweepspear]] lined the bodysides and a chromed rear fender lower panel filled the area between the wheelhouse and the bumper end, continuing to offer "[[Dagmar bumpers]]" at the front. A new centered fuel filler was found in the rear bumper, the ends of which the single or optional dual exhaust passed through. Roadmaster script was found within the deck and grille emblems. Two door models had a trio of chevrons on the rear quarters but the four door models had a Roadmaster emblem nestled within the Sweepspear dip. Interiors featured a padded dashboard and were broadcloth and nylon in 4-doors, nylon in 2-doors and leather in convertibles. Front hip room was 65.3-in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Compare the 1957 cars |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cuEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA181&amp;dq=Buick+Roadmaster&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiL4JLB2c7nAhUPHzQIHY2HDBQQ6AEwA3oECAAQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Buick%20Roadmaster&amp;f=false |accessdate=13 February 2020 |work=Popular Mechanics |date=February 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a new 364-cubic-inch engine, developing 300 horsepower. A new ball-joint suspension system improved handling. Evidently the 4-door [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]] [[hardtop]] proved so popular on its introduction the previous year that the pillared sedan was dropped entirely from the model lineup. Also, new was a mid-year production ( March 1957) Roadmaster designated as Model 75 which was distinguished by standard power seats and windows, carpeted lower doors, a one piece rear window (instead of a three piece which were a steadfast design feature found only on the smaller Jr model lines of the Special and Century), Deluxe hubcaps and a Series 75 script found on the rear quarter body panel of the R.M. Coupes and the rear door panels on the R.M. 4-door sedans, thus replacing the standard 3 chevrons found in the same location on the standard full model year Roadmaster model lines. Nevertheless, overall Roadmaster sales plunged to about 33,000. However, this "sales plunge" was not an isolated occurrence found only at GM but was one shared by all manufacturers to one extent or another due to a capital market recession which effected the overall economy starting in late 1956 and extending into 1958.

For 1958, GM was promoting their fiftieth year of production, and introduced Anniversary models for each brand; Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Chevrolet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gmphotostore.com/1958-Chevrolet-Impala-50th-Anniversary-Art-Poster/productinfo/P8367/|title= Image of 50th Anniversary promotional photo|publisher= gmphotostore.com|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151017224216/http://www.gmphotostore.com/1958-Chevrolet-Impala-50th-Anniversary-Art-Poster/productinfo/P8367/|archivedate= 2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1958 models shared a common appearance on the top models for each brand; Cadillac Eldorado Seville, Buick Roadmaster Riviera, Oldsmobile Holiday 88, Pontiac Bonneville Catalina, and the all-new Chevrolet Bel-Air Impala.

In 1958 the Roadmaster could only be ordered as the well equipped Roadmaster 75, and its body was adorned with bulkier more heavily chromed styling. A new "drawer pull" grille was used, made up of rectangular chrome squares. For the first time since 1948 there were no distinguishing [[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPorts]] on the front fenders. On the rear deck the Roadmaster name was spelled out in block lettering beneath a Buick emblem housing the trunk lock keyway. Wheelhouses had bright moldings, rocker panels had an ebbed molding and a large rear fender bright flash with ribbed inserts replaced the previous year's chromed rear fender lower panel. Four headlamps were standard. New brakes, with cast iron liners in aluminum drums, proved to be the best in the industry. But sales fell further to about 14,000.

There was a complete restyling for 1959, but this time the names of the various series were changed. Not until 1991 would there again be a big Buick known as the Roadmaster; the largest Buick models were renamed the [[Buick Electra|Electra]].

The ''Roadmaster'' name returned to the Buick line for the 1991 model year after a 33-year absence, with the third generation [[Buick Estate Wagon#1977-1990|Buick Estate]] wagon becoming the [[Buick_Estate#1991-1996|Roadmaster Estate]]. A four-door sedan was added to the Roadmaster line for the 1992 model year, the first rear-wheel drive Buick sedan since 1985. Combined sales showed an over ''tenfold'' increase over '91 thanks in part to an extended production run which had 1992 models going on sale in March 1991.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

=== Chassis ===
As with its precursor, the new Roadmaster Estate wagon was based on GM's [[full-size car|full-size]] [[rear-wheel drive]] [[GM B platform|B platform]], which was closely related to the GM [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] and [[GM D platform|D-body]] chassis reserved for top of the line Buicks and Cadillacs. It rode on the same 115.9-inch wheelbase in use since the wagon series was downsized from the C-body in 1977, yet was three inches shorter than the 1990 model. 

The Roadmaster sedan, a C-body vehicle over its eight previous generations, shared the B-body for the first time in its history. Nonetheless, it stood not only as the largest Buick, a full 10" longer with a 5" greater wheelbase than the apparent top-of-the-line C-bodied [[Buick_Park_Avenue#First_generation|Buick Park Avenue]], but larger both in wheelbase (2") and overall length (6") than the [[GM K platform (FWD)|K-body]] [[Cadillac_de_Ville_series#Seventh_generation|Cadillac Sedan de Ville]].

=== Powertrain ===
The standard engine for the 1991 wagon was a {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 5.0-L [[Chevrolet small-block engine#L03|Chevrolet small-block]] V8. It was replaced a year later with a {{convert|180|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 5.7-L [[Chevrolet small-block engine#L05|Chevrolet small-block]] V8 shared by both wagon and sedan. In 1994 both received a modified version of the advanced 5.7-L [[Fuel injection#Multipoint fuel injection|sequential point fuel-injection]] [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#LT1|LT1]] V8, increasing output to {{convert|260|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and substantially improved performance.

Derived from the 300&amp;nbsp;hp LT1 debuted in the 1992 Chevrolet Corvette, the Roadmaster version was shared both with other B-and D platform luxury and performance cars such as the [[9C1 (Chevrolet Police package)|Chevrolet Caprice Police Package]] and [[Cadillac_Fleetwood#1993-1996|Cadillac Fleetwood]] and GM's specialty [[GM F platform|F-bodied]] [[Chevrolet_Camaro#Fourth generation (1993–2002)|Chevrolet Camaro Z28]] and [[Pontiac Firebird#Fourth generation (1993–2002)|Pontiac Firebird Trans Am]]. It differed in the use of iron heads for durability, camshafts tuned for increased low-end torque, and intake silencers to decrease drive-by noise (only in engines used in luxury-brand cars).

While installed in part to better comply with emissions and fuel-economy standards, the LT1 V8 not only offered an 80hp power increase but raised rated fuel economy by 1 mpg, to 17 mpg city/25 mpg highway. As a result of this significantly boosted engine output General Motors limited the softer-riding Roadmaster (which ran on lower [[Speed rating|speed-rated]] tires than used on the Corvette) to a top speed of {{convert|108|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. For 1996, the LT1 became OBD-II compliant.

All three V-8s were paired to a four-speed automatic transmission. In 1994, the hydraulically-controlled 4L60 (700R4) transmission was replaced by the electronically-controlled 4L60E.

When ordered with the factory towing package, the 1994-1996 Roadmaster was rated to tow up to {{convert|5000|lb|kg|abbr=out}}. For the station wagon, this could be raised to 7000 pounds with the use of a weight-distributing hitch, dual sway controls, setting rear tire pressure to 35 PSI, and disabling the Electronic Level Control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1995 Buick Roadmaster Owner's Manual|publisher=General Motors Corporation|year=1994|edition=First|pages=4–34|chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The towing package added 2.93 rear-axle gears and a limited slip differential, heavy duty cooling system including oil and transmission coolers, and a factory installed self leveling rear suspension consisting of air shocks, a height sensor between the rear axle and body and an on-board air compressor. Most visibly, a pair of electric fans offset to the left under the hood was replaced by the combination of one conventional fan driven mechanically from the engine alongside one electric fan.

=== Body ===
The Roadmaster Estate wagon shared its body with the Caprice Estate and [[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]]; common styling features included the Caprice's headlights and the Custom Cruiser's 2nd-row "Vista Roof" with sunroof. [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|Simulated woodgrain]] sides were standard, though the treatment could be deleted for credit. All three wagons offered an optional rear-facing third-row seat, bringing seating capacity to eight. The Roadmaster sedan had a distinct fascia, featuring its own grille and headlights stacked above running lights and turn signals. It shared a formal sedan roofline with the [[Cadillac Fleetwood]], but rode on a wheelbase nearly six inches shorter.

The interior received a redesign for the 1994 model year which included new dual airbags, moving some instrument panel gauges closer to the steering wheel, and revisions to the radio and climate controls. Folding sideview mirrors moved forward from their previous location in 1995-96. The '95 Roadmaster retained its skirted rear wheels (deleted from the Caprice/Impala SS), while the sedan was updated with new bodyside moldings. Station wagons saw a shade for the Vista Roof along with a cargo cover. In 1996 automatic climate control became standard, and the rear seatbelts were redesigned with a "cinching" feature.

=== Discontinuation ===
A combination of overcrowding among Buick's high-end sedans and pressure from [[full-size SUV]]s on the Estate wagon led to both Roadmasters being discontinued after the 1996 model year; the final vehicle was produced on December 13, 1996.&lt;ref name="Wards97"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 1997 |publisher=Ward's Communications, Inc |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Ford having eliminated its Country Squire and Colony Park station wagons in 1991, the passing of the Roadmaster Estate and Chevrolet Caprice Estate marked the end of the full-size station wagon in North America until the introduction of the [[ Dodge Magnum#Chrysler LX platform 2005–2008|Dodge Magnum]] in 2005.

Another factor behind the discontinuation of the GM B-body line was the growth of the [[full-size SUV]] segment, which impacted both sedan and wagon sales. Additionally, a strong upswing in the longstanding body-on-frame [[Chevrolet Suburban|Chevrolet/GMC Suburban]] offered truck-based durability, four-wheel drive, and much higher profit margins. In 1996, the [[Arlington Assembly]] facility in Texas was converted to assemble SUVs and pickup trucks, leaving the B-platform without an assembly line. It would be an entire decade before GMC capitalized on the full-sized [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover]] evolution with the introduction of the [[GMC Acadia]] and its derivatives sold by Buick, Chevrolet, and Saturn.

The '''Buick Special''' was an [[automobile]] produced by [[Buick]]. It was usually Buick's lowest-priced model, starting out as a full-size car in 1936 and returning in 1938 (after a two-year hiatus) as a mid-size.

By 1970, Special was no longer offered as a standalone model but the name would later be used for the entry trim on 1975 to 1979 and 1991 to 1996 [[Buick Century|Century]] models.

The entry level Buick can trace its heritage to the Buick Model 10, a companion to Buick's first car, the [[Buick Model B]]. The Model 10 started out as one of the independent brands merged into Buick, called the [[Janney (automobile)|Janney]].

When the Series 40 was introduced, it had a {{convert|4220|cc|cid|1|abbr=on|disp=flip}} six cylinder engine that produced 80.5 bhp of power at 2,800 rpm, and 74,257 examples were made, being the highest number of Buicks for 1930. For the year 1934, the Series 40 was temporarily discontinued, with the Series 50 being the entry level product.  The 1935 version was introduced with a {{convert|3818|cc|cid|1|abbr=on|disp=flip}} straight-eight engine and 93 bhp. In 1936 the name changed to "Special".

From 1936 to 1958, Buick's Special model range represented the marque's entry level [[full-size]] automobile. The '36 was a very successful year for Buick and also marked the first time of using names rather than the simple serial numbers which had been in use before. The Special continued to also be known as the 40-series, however.&lt;ref name="buick1"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Standard Catalog of Buick, 1903-2004 (3rd ed.) | ref = JGunnell | first = John | last = Gunnell | publisher = Krause Publications, Inc. | location = Iola, WI | page = 44 | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-87349-760-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Specials rode on a {{convert|118|in|m|1|abbr=on}} wheelbase, but for the next model year this was increased to {{convert|122|in|m|2|abbr=on}} as all Buicks grew for that year. The engine was also new, and was now of {{convert|248|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} rather than {{convert|233|cid|L|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[#JGunnell|Gunnell]], pp. 46-48&lt;/ref&gt; The Special (and all other Buicks as well) underwent a full restyling for 1939, with a more enclosed nose and a wider grille.&lt;ref&gt;Odin, L.C. ''World in Motion 1939, The whole of the year's automobile production''. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG.&lt;/ref&gt; The wheelbase was also two inches shorter.&lt;ref&gt;[[#JGunnell|Gunnell]], pp. 54-55&lt;/ref&gt; For 1940, there was the usual restyle and the wheelbase increased by an inch. This was also the only model year that a four-door convertible Special ("Sport Phaeton") was offered, although only 552 were built.&lt;ref&gt;[[#JGunnell|Gunnell]], p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1941 the bodywork was again all new, with the front fenders now very closely integrated into the cars overall design. The Estate Wagon migrated from being a [[Buick Super|Super]] into the Special lineup. Also new was the 40-A series (the regular Special now being the 40-B), a version on a three inches shorter wheelbase which shared its body with the 1941 [[Chevrolet]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#JGunnell|Gunnell]], p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; These two series, with a restyle reminiscent of the 1939 [[Buick Y-Job|Y-Job]], continued into the abbreviated 1942 model year. Production ended on 4 February 1942.&lt;ref&gt;[[#JGunnell|Gunnell]], p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; For 1946 only the larger Special range remained available, still using the prewar B-body. The 1946 Special is rare, representing less than two percent of Buick's production that year.&lt;ref&gt;[[#JGunnell|Gunnell]], pp. 66-67. 2,999 Specials were built (plus 1,500 stripped chassis for export), out of 158,728 Buicks in total for the model year.&lt;/ref&gt; The Special continued with minor changes until the prewar body was finally replaced halfway through the 1949 model year.&lt;ref&gt;[[#JGunnell|Gunnell]], p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Post-war Specials were only available as a four-door sedan or a two-door "sedanet", until the new 1949 models arrived.

In the movie ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]],'' Veda Pierce, Mildred's daughter, played by actress [[Ann Blyth]], was given a 1940 Buick Special convertible as a gift.

The movie ''[[Small Town Conspiracy]]'' features a 1939 Buick Special 8 that the main character of the film John Haleran ([[Zen Gesner]]) drives as his official police car. The car remained the property of director [[Ralph Clemente]] and was untouched for many years until sold to Florida restorer and car collector [[Axel Caravias]].

Halfway into the 1949 model year, the Specials received all-new bodywork, the first fully postwar design for the series. New was also the 40D-series, a better equipped version called the Special DeLuxe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#JGunnell|Gunnell]], p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The engine remained the {{convert|248|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} which had been used since 1937, but for 1951 this was replaced by the larger "Fireball" straight-eight. A two-door hardtop coupe was also new for 1951.&lt;ref&gt;[[#JGunnell|Gunnell]], p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; The 1954 Specials had an all-new body and chassis, much wider and lower, and were now equipped with the all-new, more powerful [[Buick V8 engine|"Nailhead"]] [[V8 engine|V8]] engines.&lt;ref&gt;[[#JGunnell|Gunnell]], p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Introduced in the middle of the 1955 model year the four-door Buick Special [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]] (along with the [[Buick Century|Century Riviera]], the [[Oldsmobile 98|Oldsmobile 98 Holiday]], and the [[Oldsmobile 88|88 Holiday]]) were the first four-door pillarless [[hardtop]]s ever produced. By then, the Buick Special was one of America's best selling automotive series. For 1956 the larger {{convert|322|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine was shared with the rest of the range, although it was replaced by the bigger, {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 364 V8 for 1957. This year also brought all-new bodywork, as well as a four-door hardtop station wagon called the Buick Caballero.&lt;ref&gt;[[#JGunnell|Gunnell]], p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The 1957 wheelbase remained 122&amp;nbsp;inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1957_Buick/1957_Buick_Brochure_2/1957%20Buick-a18.html | title = Directory Index: Buick/1957 Buick/1957 Buick Brochure 2 | publisher = Buick Motor Division | work = Oldcarbrochures.com | year = 1957 | accessdate = 2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the June, 1957 issue of [[Popular Mechanics]], the Special was rated with a 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph time of 11.6 seconds, fuel economy of {{convert|17.4|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} at {{Convert|50|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, and ground clearance of {{Convert|6.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FuEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=Buick&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JzndTqK9JcmciALj4bnKCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CGYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Buick&amp;f=false | title = Popular Mechanics |publisher=Hearst Corporation | location = NY, NY |date=June 1957 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1958 brought the most chrome yet and twin headlights, as the car grew longer and wider, albeit on an unchanged chassis.

1949-1957 Buick Specials had three [[ventiport|VentiPort]]s while more senior Buicks (with the partial exception of the [[Buick Super]], which switched from three to four in 1955) had four. Earlier versions had a "[[Buick#sweepspear|Sweepspear]]" inspired character line alongside the body, while later versions had the "Sweepspear" moulding attached to the side of all models. GM renamed the Buick Special the [[Buick LeSabre|LeSabre]] for the 1959 model year, taking the name from the 1951 [[Le Sabre concept car]].&lt;ref&gt;Flory,  J.

In 1961, the car returned after a short absence of two years, but this time it was on the brand new [[Monocoque|unibody]] [[compact car|compact]] [[GM Y platform]]. The Special was powered by a {{Convert|155|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#215|innovative aluminum-block 215&amp;nbsp;in³]] [[V8 engine|V8]], and had [[Dualpath]] transmission and power steering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Francis | first = Devon | title = 850 Miles in Buick's New Compact | journal = [[Popular Science]] | volume = | issue = | pages = 90–91 | publisher = | location = |date=October 1960 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xyUDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-year a '''[[Buick Skylark#1961–1963|Skylark]]''' option was released with special trim, optional bucket seats and a four-barrel version of the 215 that made {{Convert|185|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

In 1962, the Special was [[list of automotive superlatives|the first]] American car to use a [[V6 engine]] in volume production; it earned ''[[Motor Trend]]''{{'}}s [[Car of the Year]] for 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960-1972'' (Jefferson, NC:  McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), p.142.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Buick V6 engine#198|198&amp;nbsp;cid '''Fireball''']] was engineered down from the 215 and used many of the same design parameters, but was cast in iron. Output was 135&amp;nbsp;hp (gross) at 4600&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{Convert|205|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 2400&amp;nbsp;rpm. In their test that year, ''[[Road &amp; Track]]'' was impressed with Buick's "practical" new V6, saying it "sounds and performs exactly like the aluminum [[V8 engine|V8]] in most respects." In 1963, the Special's body was restyled. Mechanically, however, the car was identical to the 1962 model. There was also some minor interior restyling, particularly to the dash and instrument cluster. The 1963 Special was available as a 2-door pillared [[hardtop]] [[coupe]], a four dour [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]], a [[convertible (car)|convertible]], and a [[station wagon]]. Engine choices were a standard {{convert|198|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} V6 with a twin-barrel carburetor and optional {{convert|215|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} V8 with {{convert|155|hp|kW|abbr=on}} (two-barrel) or more powerful four-barrel ({{convert|190|hp|kW|abbr=on}} in 1962, {{convert|200|hp|kW|abbr=on}} in 1963).&lt;ref name="Flory, pp.143 &amp; 205"&gt;Flory (2004), pp.143 &amp; 205.&lt;/ref&gt; Transmission choices were a three speed [[Manual transmission#Column-mounted shifter|column shift]] [[manual transmission]], a floor shift Borg-Warner T-10 four-speed manual, or a two-speed [[Dynaflow|Turbine Drive]]&lt;ref name="Flory, pp.143 &amp; 205"/&gt; [[automatic transmission|automatic]]. The two speed "Dual Path Turbine Drive" automatic was a Buick design and shared no common parts with the better known Chevrolet Power-Glide transmission.

The 1962 model sold 153,763, including 42,973 Skylarks.&lt;ref&gt;Flory (2004), p.144.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1963 body was only produced for one year; it sold 148,750 copies, including 42,321 Skylarks.&lt;ref&gt;Flory (2004), p.207.&lt;/ref&gt; The entire car was redesigned for 1964. After that, the 215 found its way into the [[Rover P6]] 3500S in 1968, but was never sold in North America in any great numbers. It was also employed in other British cars, including the [[Morgan Plus 8]], [[MG MGB|MG MGB GTV8]], [[Land Rover]], and [[Triumph TR8]], as well as retrofits into [[MG MGA|MGA]]s and MGBs. The engine had really earned its stripes as being the sole engine powering the Range Rover for a couple decades and eventually finding its way into the original Series/Defender Land Rover; and several other Land Rover Models including the Discovery and the Forward Control.

The [[Buick Skylark|Skylark]] became a separate series for 1962.

The Special, along with the upscale [[Buick Skylark|Skylark]], were redesigned for the 1964 model year with separate body-on-frame construction—renamed the [[GM A platform (RWD)|A-body]]—and marketed as an [[intermediate car|intermediate]]-sized car. The Skylark was expanded to a full top-line series that now included two- and four-door sedans, two-door hardtop coupe and convertible, along with a station wagon. The other series models included the base Special and the slightly fancier Special Deluxe, in a more limited range of bodystyles.

Also new for 1964 were engines. The capacity of the V6 engine was increased from 198 to 225 cubic inches, while the aluminum V8 was replaced by a new cast iron-block 300 cubic inch V8 with aluminum cylinder heads. In 1965, cast iron heads replaced the problematic aluminum ones. This reliable engine, produced until 1967, was based on the aluminum V8, and many parts (such as the cylinder heads) were interchangeable.

The Special nameplate was used on lower-priced intermediate-sized Buicks through the 1969 model year.

[[File:Buick Special DeLuxe 1.jpg|thumb|left|1968 Buick Special Deluxe coupe]]
In 1968 and 1969, the Buick Special was dropped and only Special Deluxes were manufactured.

In 1970, the end of the Special came about when the Special Deluxe was dropped too in favor of the slightly upscale Buick Skylark.

==1975–1977==
[[File:1977 Buick Special coupe.jpg|thumb|1977 Buick Century Special]]
The Special returned briefly to the GM A platform as an entry level subseries of the [[Buick Century]].  Although officially sold as the Buick Century Special, it was sometimes also referred to as just the Buick Special.

Century Specials were usually powered by Buick's own [[Buick V6 engine#231|231]] V6; a V8 (from either Buick, Oldsmobile, or Chevrolet) was offered but rarely optioned. It used the "colonnade" roofline but was fitted with a landau roof that covered most of the rear quarter windows. The opening that was left was the same shape as the windows on the higher series formal-roof cars.

==1978–1979==
In 1978 and 1979, the Special trim continued on the redesigned Century fastback and wagon models.

==1991–1996==
Special returned once again as the entry level trim on the Century sedan (starting 1991) and wagon (starting 1993).  The "Special" designation was discontinued with the Century's redesign in 1997.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The '''Buick Lucerne''' is a full-size car manufactured by [[General Motors]] from 2005 to 2011. Named for the city of [[Lucerne, Switzerland]], it served as Buick's top-of-the-line sedan until it was replaced by the second generation [[Buick LaCrosse#Second generation (2010–present)|Buick LaCrosse]].

==History==
The Lucerne replaced both the full-size [[Buick LeSabre|LeSabre]] and top-of-the-line [[Buick Park Avenue|Park Avenue]] in the Buick lineup. It was based on a revised [[GM G platform (FWD)|G platform]], though GM continued to refer to it as the H.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frame|first=Phil|title=GM H CARS MOVE TO G PLATFORM|url=http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950116/ANA/501160730#axzz2TYYYR1jT|work=[[Automotive News]]|accessdate=17 May 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130616065939/http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950116/ANA/501160730%23axzz2TYYYR1jT|archivedate=16 June 2013|url-status=dead|date=16 January 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was introduced with the standard 3.8 liter [[Buick V6]] (also known as the ''GM 3800 engine''), with a 4.6 litre [[Cadillac]] ''[[Northstar engine series#LD8|Northstar LD8]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] and the [[Chevrolet Corvette]]'s Magnetic Ride Control [[active suspension]] available as options. All General Motors 3.8 L V6 powered cars become the first [[SULEV]]-compliant vehicles.
[[File:2011 Buick Lucerne CX -- NHTSA.jpg|thumb|left|2011 Buick Lucerne CX]]
In keeping with Buick tradition, the Lucerne featured a row of "[[Ventiport]]s" on the front fenders corresponding to the number of cylinders in the engine — three on each side for the V6 or four for the V8.  The '''CXL''' trim package added numerous premium features.

The Lucerne was built at GM's [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly]] Plant alongside the [[Cadillac DTS]].  The plant won Initial Quality Awards from J.D. Power and Associates from 2004 through 2006. GM also lead all other automakers in Strategic Vision's Total Quality Index (TQI) &lt;ref&gt;Strategic Vision (2006). [http://autos.msn.com/advice/article.aspx?contentid=4020223 Total Quality Index] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215083242/http://autos.msn.com/advice/article.aspx?contentid=4020223 |date=2006-12-15 }} ''MSN Autos''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2008 Buick Lucerne controls closeup.jpg|thumb|left|2008 Buick Lucerne controls closeup]]
Sales remained brisk through much of 2007. The Super was introduced at the 2007 [[New York Auto Show]], featuring the sophisticated 4.6 litre ''[[Northstar engine series#L37|Northstar L37]]'' V8 and upscale trim. In addition to {{Convert|17|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} extra horsepower over the CXS V8, updated front end styling and a rear spoiler created a bolder, sportier look.

All Lucernes got modest mid-cycle updates in 2008, including a [[lane departure warning system]] and revised exterior colors.  Two new trim levels, '''CXL Special Edition''' (with more standard features than regular CXL) and '''Super''', were added for 2008.

The 2009 Lucerne received some small upgrades, including a new base engine, the 3.9&amp;nbsp;L ''[[GM High Value engine#LZ9|GM High Value LZ9]]'' V6, [[Bluetooth]] phone connectivity, and [[XM]] NavTraffic. [[flex-fuel vehicle|Flex-fuel]] technology was made available at no additional cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abuelsamid |first=Sam |url=http://www.autobloggreen.com/2008/04/18/2009-buick-lucerne-adds-the-ability-to-use-a-fuel-that-it-will-l/ |title=(2008) |publisher=AutoblogGreen |date=2008-04-18 |accessdate=2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2010, the Super's rocker panels, grille, and fog lights were added to the entire Lucerne lineup.

The 2011 Lucerne was largely unchanged. The last was built on June 15, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.just-auto.com/news/gm-axes-cadillac-dts-and-buick-lucerne_id111499.aspx|title=US: GM axes Cadillac DTS and Buick Lucerne|publisher=just-auto.com |date=2011-05-26 |accessdate=2011-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second generation [[Buick LaCrosse|LaCrosse]] replaced it as Buick's flagship sedan for 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://cars.about.com/od/buick/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Buick Skylark''' is a passenger car produced by [[Buick]]. The model was made in six production runs, during 46 years, over which the car's design varied dramatically due to changing technology, tastes and new standards implemented over the years.

Of the three, the Skylark's run of 1,690 units proved the most successful, and an amazing sales feat considering the car's 1953 list price of slightly in excess of US$5,000 was over 50% more than the well-equipped US$3,200 [[Buick Roadmaster|Roadmaster]] convertible on which it was based. Nevertheless, many languished in dealer showrooms and were eventually sold at discount.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Production ran for two years. Based on the model 76R two-door Roadmaster convertible, the 1953 Skylark (designated model 76X) had identical dimensions (except height), almost identical appearance, shared its drive train, and had all its standard equipment, plus its few remaining options, including power windows, power brakes, full carpeting, and a "Selectronic" AM radio.&lt;ref name="Flory Jr. 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/new/130211/1954%20Buick%202/1954%20Buick%20%282%29-06-07.html OldCarBrochures.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Only A/C was not offered, unnecessary in either convertible.&lt;ref name="Flory Jr. 2008"/&gt;

Importantly, the new Skylark featured Buick's new 322&amp;nbsp;in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (5.3&amp;nbsp;L) [[Buick V8 engine#322|Nailhead]] [[V8 engine|V8]] in place of the automaker's longstanding [[Straight-eight engine|straight 8]], and a 12&amp;nbsp;volt electrical system, both division firsts. It debuted full-cutout wheel openings, a styling cue that spread to the main 1954 Buick line. Accenting its lowered, notched [[beltline (automotive)|beltline]] was a new "[[Buick#sweepspear|Sweepspear]]" running almost the entire length of the vehicle, a styling cue that was to appear in various forms on many Buick models over the years.

The 1953 Skylark was handmade in many respects. Only stampings for the hood, trunk lid and a portion of the convertible tub were shared with the Roadmaster and Super convertibles. All Skylark tubs were finished with various amounts of lead filler. The inner doors were made by cutting the 2-door Roadmaster's in two then welding the pieces back together at an angle to produce the rakish door dip. An overall more streamlined look was reinforced by cutting the windshield almost {{convert|3|in|cm}} shorter and lowering the side windows and convertible top frame proportionately. Seat frames and steering column were then dropped to provide proper headroom and driving position. Front leg room was {{convert|44.7|in|cm}}.&lt;ref name="Flory Jr. 2008"/&gt; Authentic wire wheels were produced by [[Kelsey-Hayes]], chromed everywhere except the plated and painted "Skylark" center emblem.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures.com"/&gt;

The Skylark returned in 1954 with radically restyled styling unique to the Buick line,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motorbase.com/profiles/picture/index.ehtml?i=112806128 |title=Buick Skylark A (1954) |publisher=Motorbase |accessdate=2010-10-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526112556/http://www.motorbase.com/profiles/picture/index.ehtml?i=112806128 |archivedate=2009-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which included wheel cutouts that could be painted in a contrasting color to the body's. The trunk was sloped into a semi-barrel, and tail lights moved to large chromed fins projecting atop the rear fenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dusan Ristic-Petrovic |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/new/130211/1954%20Buick%202/1954%20Buick%20%282%29-06-07.html |title=File: 1954 Buick 2/1954 Buick (2)-06-07 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Re-designated model 100, the car was based on the all-new shorter [[Buick Century|Century]]/[[Buick Special|Special]] series 40 chassis and not the larger series 60 Roadmaster/[[Buick Super|Super]] chassis, also all-new for 1954. Once again, all Skylarks were built as two-door convertibles and carried the same luxury equipment as before, but front leg room dropped {{convert|2.4|in|cm}}.&lt;ref name="Flory Jr. 2008"/&gt; While smaller and lighter, the Skylark got a performance boost by retaining the big Buicks' powertrain, an evolutionary improvement of 1953's with the highest output in the division's lineup.

The 1954 Skylark once again had unique sheetmetal stampings for its elongated wheel cutouts and new semi-barrel trunk, though fabrication was done without hand labor. The hood ornament was unique, adopted the following year across the Buick product line.

Sales proved to be poor, reflecting the Skylark's continued high price coupled with a perceived step-down from the Roadmaster/Super series, slumping far enough to cause the model's cancellation at the end of the 1954 model year.

In the fall of 1960, General Motors introduced a trio of new compact cars for the 1961 model year that shared the same chassis, engines, and basic sheet metal: the [[Buick Special#1961–1963|Buick Special]], [[Pontiac Tempest]], and [[Oldsmobile F-85]]. The Special's styling was strongly influenced by the new corporate look shared with the larger [[Buick LeSabre#Second generation (1961–1964)|LeSabre]], [[Buick Invicta|Invicta]], and [[Buick Electra#1961–1964|Electra]] also introduced in 1961.

In the middle of the 1961 model year the '''Buick Special Skylark''' made its debut.  Effectively a luxury trim level, it was based on two-door sedan (also referred to as a coupe),&lt;ref name="1964–1965 Buick Skylark"&gt;[http://www.hemmings.com/hcc/stories/2008/12/01/hmn_feature22.html  Hemmings.com]  1964–1965 Buick Skylark - Retrieved on 07/01/2013&lt;/ref&gt; it featured unique Skylark emblems, taillight housings, lower-body side moldings, turbine wheel covers, and a vinyl-covered roof. 1961 Skylarks featured three [[Ventiport]]s on each fender. A plush all-vinyl interior was standard, with bucket seats available as an option. Instrumentation was minimal, consisting of only a [[speedometer]] and  [[fuel gauge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1963_Buick/1963_Buick_Full_Line_Brochure/1963%20Buick%20Full%20Line-46.html |title=Directory Index: Buick/1963_Buick/1963_Buick_Full_Line_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Skylark replaced the Special's standard aluminum block {{convert|215|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} two-barrel carburetor V8 with a higher compression ratio four-barrel version that boosted power from {{convert|155|hp|abbr=on}} at 4600&amp;nbsp;rpm to {{convert|185|hp|abbr=on}}.

[[File:Buick Skylark 1962 (6142537876).jpg|thumb|left|1962 Buick Skylark hardtop]]

For the 1962 model year, the  Skylark became a model in its own right. It used the previous year's basic sheet metal but was available in two new body styles: a two-door convertible coupe (shared with the Special and Special Deluxe models) and a two-door (pillarless) [[hardtop]] unique to it. Tuning of the 215-cubic-inch V8 increased power to {{convert|190|hp|abbr=on}} at 4800&amp;nbsp;rpm. In 1962, the Skylark Special was also [[list of automotive superlatives|the first]] American car to use a [[V6 engine]] in volume production; it earned ''[[Motor Trend]]''{{'}}s [[Car of the Year]] for 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960-1972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Buick V6 engine#198|198&amp;nbsp;cid '''Fireball''']] was engineered down from the 215 and used many of the same design parameters, but was cast in iron. Output was 135&amp;nbsp;hp (gross) at 4600&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{Convert|205|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 2400&amp;nbsp;rpm. In their test that year, ''[[Road &amp; Track]]'' was impressed with Buick's "practical" new V6, saying it "sounds and performs exactly like the aluminum [[V8 engine|V8]] in most respects."

In 1963, the Special's body was restyled and minor changes made to the interior, particularly to the dash and instrument cluster. The 1963 Special was available as a two-door pillared hardtop coupe, a four dour [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]], a convertible, and a [[station wagon]]. Engine choices were a standard {{convert|198|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} V6 with a twin-barrel carburetor and an optional {{convert|215|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} V8 with {{convert|155|hp|kW|abbr=on}} (two-barrel) or more powerful four-barrel ({{convert|190|hp|kW|abbr=on}} in 1962, {{convert|200|hp|kW|abbr=on}} in 1963).&lt;ref name="Flory, pp.143 &amp; 205"&gt;Flory (2004), pp. 143 &amp; 205.&lt;/ref&gt; Transmission choices were a 'three on the tree' [[manual transmission]], a floor shift [[BorgWarner|Borg-Warner]] T-10 four-speed manual, or a two-speed [[Dynaflow|Turbine Drive]]&lt;ref name="Flory, pp.143 &amp; 205"/&gt; [[automatic transmission|automatic]]. The two speed "Dual Path Turbine Drive" automatic was a Buick design and shared no common parts with the better known Chevrolet Power-Glide transmission.

Two prototypes were made for 1962, each with a unique body. One a convertible and the other a hardtop. The prototypes came directly from Buick Engineering, both had been given two 4-barrel carburetors by the engineers thus increasing the prototype's horsepower a little more than 80&amp;nbsp;hp. Of note was that they had features from the '61, '62, and the '63 production models. Some features, such as the two 4-barrel carburetors, were left out of the production-line Skylarks. The prototypes were also were {{convert|2|in|spell=in}} longer, and wider than the production models. Of the two prototypes, only the hardtop still exists and resides with its owner in Michigan. It is possible the convertible prototype still exists in the [[Sloan Museum]] collection.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

[[File:1963 Buick Skylark Convertible, front right.jpg|thumb|left|1963 Buick Skylark convertible]]

The 1963 Skylarks used the same chassis and wheelbase as the previous 1961 and 1962 models, but adopted new sheet metal that featured boxier styling. Length was increased by {{convert|5|in|spell=in}} to {{convert|193|in|mm|abbr=on}}, and the 215-cubic-inch V8 generated {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on}} at 5,000&amp;nbsp;rpm. The 1963 Skylark was available as a two-door convertible coupe or a two-door (pillarless) hardtop coupe. The 1963 Special shared most sheet metal with the Skylark, but was available as a two-door pillared hard top, four-dour sedan, convertible, and station wagon. Engine choices included a {{convert|198|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V6 with two-barrel carburetor, the {{convert|215|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with two-barrel or a four-barrel carburetor. Transmission choices were a "three on the tree" [[manual transmission]], a floor-shifted [[BorgWarner|Borg-Warner]] T-10 four-speed manual, or a two-speed automatic. The two-speed "Dual Path Turbine Drive" automatic was a Buick design and shared no common parts with the Chevrolet Power-Glide transmission. Instrument panel padding and a cigarette lighter was standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1963_Buick/1963_Buick_Full_Line_Brochure/1963%20Buick%20Full%20Line-30-31.html OldCarBrochures.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hagerty.com/price-guide/1961-Buick-Special_Deluxe Hagerty.com]  History of the 1961–1963 Buick Skylark - Retrieved on 07/22/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buick Skylark Sedan (Auto classique Ste-Rose '11).JPG|thumb|left|1965 Buick Skylark sedan]]

Beginning with the 1964 model year, the dressed-up compact '''Skylark''' trim level had enough sales to merit its own separate line.&lt;ref name="1964–1965 Buick Skylark"/&gt; Along with the lower-priced Special from which it was derived, the model would move to a new {{Convert|115|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase intermediate-size chassis shared with the [[Oldsmobile F-85]], [[Pontiac Tempest]], and new [[Chevrolet Chevelle]]. Both Buicks had a length of {{Convert|203.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}.

The standard 215-cubic-inch-displacement, aluminum-block V8 engine was discontinued, and the associated tooling eventually was sold to the British manufacturer, Rover. Rover initially improved and produced the [[Rover V8 engine]], manufacturing several additional versions for use in its sedans, Land Rover sport utility vehicles and trucks until 2006.

In its place was a new {{convert|225|cuin|adj=on}}, all-cast-iron-block V6 with a Rochester 1-barrel carburetor that generated {{convert|155|hp|abbr=on}} at 4400&amp;nbsp;rpm. It was almost 30 cu. in. larger than   a prior, unrelated {{convert|196|cuin}} V6 introduced for the 1962 model year. The 225 was basically a Buick 300 CID V8 engine, less two cylinders. The basic V8 option was a 300-cubic-inch, with cast-iron-block, aluminum-heads, and a Rochester 2-barrel carburetor that generated {{convert|210|hp|abbr=on}} at 4600&amp;nbsp;rpm. A high performance version was offered with 11:1 compression and a 4-barrel carburetor, generating {{convert|250|hp|abbr=on}}. A long-throw, 4-speed Hurst shifter was available. For the 1965 model, cast-iron blocks and heads were used for all engines.

For the first time a four-door sedan was offered in addition to the two-door convertible, two-door sedan, and hardtop coupe. Specials and Special Deluxes only came in pillared coupe versions.  All Skylarks would have higher levels of exterior and interior trim than the Special and Special Deluxe from which they were derived. The sedan would come with cloth-and-vinyl seats standard, with an all-vinyl interior optional.  All-vinyl bucket seats were standard on the convertible and optional on the hardtop coupe. The Skylark Coupe had a lower, more road-hugging profile than the other models. Buick's traditional  [[Buick#ventiports|VentiPorts]] were integrated into the front half rub strip that ran the entire length of the vehicle, with later versions appearing vertically stacked as on the [[Buick Wildcat]].

Inspired in no small part by the sales success of the 1964 [[Pontiac Tempest]], [[Pontiac LeMans|LeMans]], and [[Pontiac GTO|GTO]], a '''[[Buick Gran Sport|Gran Sport]]''' option became available in mid 1965, offered as a coupe, hardtop or convertible.&lt;ref name="1History of the 1964–1967 Buick Skylark"&gt;[http://www.hagerty.com/price-guide/1965-Buick-Skylark Hagerty.com]  History of the 1964–1967 Buick Skylark - Retrieved on 07/22/2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Gran Sport featured Buick's 401-cubic-inch-V8 with a Carter 4-barrel carburetor that produced {{convert|325|hp|abbr=on}} at 4400&amp;nbsp;rpm,&lt;ref name="1History of the 1964–1967 Buick Skylark"/&gt; listed as 400-cubic-inch in sales literature to elude a General Motors limit of 400 cubic in intermediate-sized cars. Unique Gran Sport badging, a heavy-duty radiator, and dual exhaust were also added.

In the 1966 model year, the pillared four-door sedan was replaced by a four-door hardtop. The 1966 two-door Skylark was available with the optional 340 ci "Wildcat 375", engine which produced {{Convert|260|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|365|lbft|abbr=on}} torque with a 4-barrel Carter carb.
[[File:'67 Buick Skylark Convertible (Auto classique Laval '10).jpg|thumb|left|1967 Buick Skylark convertible]]

The four-door sedan would rejoin the lineup for the 1967 model year, making a total of five Skylark body styles. The 225 cu. in. V6 was standard on the two-door sedan, the 300-cubic-inch V8 on all other models but  the four-door hardtop sedan, which came with a 340-cubic-inch-displacement V8 engine using a Rochester 2-barrel carburetor and producing {{convert|220|hp|abbr=on}} at 4400&amp;nbsp;rpm.

1967 Skylarks got all the Federally-mandated safety equipment as other U.S. market passenger cars, including a dual-circuit hydraulic brake system, energy-absorbing steering column and wheel, 4-way hazard flashers, shoulder belt mounting points for outboard front passengers, softer interior surfaces and recessed controls on the instrument panel.

The Gran Sport became the Gran Sport 400 to reflect its engine. A Gran Sport 340 was added, using the 340-cubic-inch V8, available only as a two-door hardtop coupe.

The 1968 model year was one of significant change for the Buick Skylark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hagerty.com/price-guide/1968-Buick-Skylark Hagerty.com] History of the 1968–1972 Buick Skylark - Retrieved on 07/22/2013&lt;/ref&gt; Although still using the same basic chassis, all of GM's mid-sized cars adopted a policy of using two different length wheelbases. Two-door models used a shorter wheelbase of {{Convert|112|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, while four-door models used a longer wheelbase of 116&amp;nbsp;in (the [[Buick Sport Wagon]] and [[Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser]] used an even longer wheelbase of 121&amp;nbsp;in). All of GM's mid-sized cars received all-new sheet metal.  More Federally mandated safety features improved occupant protection and accident avoidance, including side marker lights, shoulder belts (on all models built after January 1, 1968), and parking lights that illuminated with headlights.

The [[Buick Gran Sport]], previously an option package available on the Skylark, became a separate series, starting with the 340&amp;nbsp;hp/440&amp;nbsp;lbs torque 400 c.i.d. V8 1968 GS 400, using the 2 door Skylark body and chassis. In a reshuffling of models in the lineup, the Special Deluxe replaced the previous Special. The Skylark nameplate was shuffled down a notch to replace the previous Special Deluxe. The previous Skylark was replaced by a new Skylark Custom.

The basic Skylark was available as a two-door hardtop coupe or a four-door sedan. The Skylark Custom came as a two-door convertible coupe, two-door hardtop coupe, four-door hardtop sedan, or four-door sedan.

[[File:Buick Skylark Coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1969 Buick Skylark coupe]]

The previous V6 was discontinued and the associated tooling was sold to Kaiser Industries, which used the V6 in its Jeep trucks and sport utility vehicles. The base engine in Buick Skylarks (and Buick Special sedans) became a 250-cubic-inch {{convert|250|cuin|L|abbr=on}} Chevrolet [[Straight-six engine|I6]], that produced {{convert|155|hp|abbr=on}} at 4200&amp;nbsp;rpm using a single-barrel Rochester carburetor.

Optional on the Skylark and standard on the Skylark Custom was a new 350-cubic-inch V8 derived from the 340, using a two-barrel Rochester carburetor that produced {{convert|230|hp|abbr=on}} at 4400&amp;nbsp;rpm. The Buick Special name was dropped after the 1969 model year. A locking steering column with a new, rectangular ignition key became standard on all 1969 GM cars (except [[Chevrolet Corvair|Corvair]]), one year ahead of the Federal requirement.

For 1970, the mid-sized Buicks once again received new sheet metal and the Buick Skylark name was moved down another notch, replacing the previous entry-level Buick Special. It was available in two- and four-door sedans with the 250-cubic-inch inline-six as standard and the optional 350-cubic-inch V8 (260 horsepower at 4600&amp;nbsp;rpm). Two-door models shared their roofline with the 1970 [[Chevrolet Chevelle|Chevelle]], distinct from that of the shared [[Pontiac LeMans]] and [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]]. The two-door sedan was unique to Buick, sharing its roofline as the hardtop but having a thick [[Pillar (automobile)|"B" pillar]], with Buick's traditional "[[Buick#sweepspear|Sweepspear]]" feature appearing as a crease running the length of the vehicle. Chevrolet did not offer a pillared coupe for the Chevelle from 1970 to 1972; all two-doors were hardtops.

Replacing the previous Buick Skylark was the Buick Skylark 350, available as a two-door hardtop coupe or four-door sedan with the 350-cubic-inch V8 as standard equipment. This 350-cubic-inch engine was a different design than the Chevy's 350 CID engine (4.000&amp;nbsp;in × 3.48&amp;nbsp;in) the Buick design had a longer stroke and smaller bore (3.80 X 3.85&amp;nbsp;in) allowing for lower-end torque, deep-skirt block construction, higher nickel-content cast iron, {{Convert|3.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} crank main journals, and {{Convert|6.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} connecting rods, the distributor was located in front of the engine (typical of Buick), the oil pump was external and mounted in the front of the engine, the rocker arm assembly had all rocker arms mounted on a single rod and were not adjustable. The Skylark Custom continued to be available, also using the 350-cubic-inch V8 as standard equipment and still available as a two-door convertible coupe, two-door hardtop coupe, four-door hardtop sedan, and four-door sedan. Buick Gran Sport models continued to be available as a separate series. The Buick Sport Wagon name was now used on a conventional four-door station wagon that no longer featured a raised roof with glass panels over the cargo area, or a longer wheelbase, as in the past. It now used the same {{Convert|116|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase as the Buick Skylark four-door sedan and the now-discontinued Buick Special four-door Station Wagon. It became, in effect, a Buick Skylark four-door station wagon in all respects but the name.

For the 1971 model year, the base Skylark was available only with the [[inline-6]], now only putting out {{convert|145|hp|abbr=on}} due to emission control devices, but in a two-door hardtop coupe body-style (in addition to the previous two- and four-door sedans). The Skylark 350 had a V8 engine that put out only {{convert|230|hp|abbr=on}}. It was now available as a two-door sedan in addition to the previous two-door hardtop coupe and four-door sedan.

[[File:1972 Buick Skylark Custom 4-door Hardtop Sedan, front right.jpg|thumb|left|1972 Buick Skylark Custom 4-door Hardtop Sedan]]
1972 was the last model year for the mid-sized Buick Skylark. During this model year many pollution controls were added to the engines, Compression was lowered, engines had to accept leaded and unleaded gas, and spark timing was retarded (no vacuum advance in lower gears) while driving in lower gears to reduce emissions. For 1972, the base Buick Skylark used the 350-cubic-inch V8 with the 2-barrel Rochester carburetor (now putting out 145 horsepower) as standard equipment. A new federally mandated system to calculate power was put into effect that year, and the actual engine performance was probably comparable but slightly lower because of pollution controls in the 1972 model year to the {{convert|230|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} that was listed for the previous year. The Skylark 350 now used a version of the same V8 engine as the base Skylark, but with a 4-barrel Rochester carburetor that generated {{convert|180|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

Skylark Customs were available with the same 350-cubic-inch V8 engines available in the basic Skylark and the Skylark 350. The Custom had an upgraded interior and dash with some extra chrome. Convertibles only came in the Skylark Customs and the Skylark 350s.

For the 1973 model year, the Buick Gran Sports, Skylarks, and Sport Wagons would all be replaced by the new mid-sized Buick Century. Since Centurys were available with Gran Sport trim, the Gran Sport name was once again reduced to being an option package.

In the middle of the 1973 model year, Buick returned to the compact market with the Buick Apollo, using General Motors’ X-body platform, based on the [[Chevrolet Nova]]. When the car was extensively restyled for the 1975 model year, the two-door hatchback sedan (coupe) and two-door sedan (coupe) were rechristened “Skylark”, while the four-door sedan remained "[[Buick Apollo|Apollo]]". As this generation Skylark was "downsized", the next larger coupe and sedan to take the market position that the Skylark formerly occupied was the all-new [[Buick Regal]].

Two-door hatchback and two-door sedan models were available as the base Skylark or as the more upscale, European-inspired Skylark S/R ("Sports/Rallye"). Four-door sedans were available as the base Apollo or the more upscale Apollo S/R. In addition, there was a very plain, lower-priced Skylark "S" available only as a two-door sedan with minimal interior and exterior trim. "[[Buick#ventiports|VentiPorts]]" reappeared integrated into the front half of the rub strip that ran the length of the vehicle, which had disappeared from Skylarks in 1968.
[[File:197? Buick Skylark (32122105040).jpg|thumb|left|1977 Buick Skylark 2-door]]
The standard engine for the Buick Skylarks was Buick's own 231-cubic-inch (3.8&amp;nbsp;L) V6 engine with a 2-barrel carburetor creating {{convert|110|hp|abbr=on}} at 4000&amp;nbsp;rpm. Buick purchased back the tooling for the engine from American Motors, which acquired them when the company purchased the Kaiser Jeep division from Kaiser Industries. The Apollo used Chevrolet's 250-cubic-inch (4.1&amp;nbsp;L) [[Straight-six engine|inline 6-cylinder engine]].

Optional engines included the Oldsmobile 260-cubic-inch (4.3&amp;nbsp;L) V8 with a two-barrel carburetor producing {{convert|110|hp|abbr=on}} at 4,000&amp;nbsp;rpm, and the Buick 350-cubic-inch (5.7&amp;nbsp;L) V8 with either a 2- or 4-barrel carburetor. In 1976, the 5.7&amp;nbsp;L V8 engines produced {{convert|140|hp|abbr=on}} at 3,200&amp;nbsp;rpm with the 2-barrel carburetor, and {{convert|155|hp|abbr=on}} at 3,400&amp;nbsp;rpm with the 4-barrel carburetor.

Beginning with the 1976 model year, the four-door sedans used the Skylark and Skylark S/R names instead of the previous Apollo badge, and came with the 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 engine as standard.

The 260-cubic-inch (4.3&amp;nbsp;L) V8 was discontinued after the 1976 model year. For the 1977 model year, it was replaced by a pair of V8 engines.

Available as an option in 1977 was a 301-cubic-inch (4.9&amp;nbsp;L) [[V8 engine|V8]] with a 2-barrel carburetor, which produced {{convert|135|hp|abbr=on}} at 4000&amp;nbsp;rpm (supplied by Pontiac). Also available was a 305-cubic-inch (5.0&amp;nbsp;L) V8 with a 2-barrel carburetor, which produced {{convert|145|hp|abbr=on}} at 3800&amp;nbsp;rpm (supplied by Chevrolet). The Buick-built 5.7&amp;nbsp;L V8 was still available, but only with the 4-barrel carburetor.

Beginning with the 1978 model year, Chevrolet's 5.7&amp;nbsp;L (350-cubic-inch) V8 with a four-barrel carburetor, which produced {{convert|170|hp|abbr=on}} at 3,800&amp;nbsp;rpm, also was available. Also in that year, the Skylark Custom replaced the Skylark S/R as the most luxurious variant. The 1978s also received some very light cosmetic changes to the corner lights and grille.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SCbuick|Gunnell (2004)]], p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1979 model year saw the discontinuance of the Skylark Custom two-door [[hatchback]] coupe (the base V6 produced {{convert|10|hp|abbr=on}} more than 1978's version). The 1979 model year was short because, midway through it, the all-new 1980 models were introduced early.

===Buick Skylarks in Iran===
Buick Skylarks were assembled in Iran (four-door sedans only) from 1977 to 1981 and again from 1986 to 1988 under the brand name of "Buick Iran". The first generations were known as B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, from 1977 until 1981 and the second and last generation was known as the B2 and B3 from 1986 until 1988. The later models were made after GM released the kits and parts to Iran following the GM's debt to Iran General Motors. These cars were equipped with a 5.7L engine (SB 350 Chevrolet, L engine, 4BBL), and were fully equipped (power door locks, power window, power steering, automatic transmission, a/c, vinyl top). The [[Cadillac Seville]] and [[Chevrolet Nova]] were manufactured in [[Iran]] during the same period. A total of 40,000 GM cars were produced between 1977 and 1987 in Iran. It appears that these models were basically the same as those built in the U.S. from 1975 to 1979 (Islamic Revolution). It is said that in 1978, the Iranian Chevrolet Nova and Buick Skylark cars had order backlogs of 13 months.

GM Iran changed its name to [[Pars Khodro]] (meaning "Pars Automobile" in Iranian; 'Pars' being the ancient, original name of Persia) after 1979. The production continued from 1979 to 1987 on a part-time basis. Since the spare parts and the assembly-line equipment were not used between 1979 and 1986.

GM ceased the production of all vehicles in Iran in 1987.

The 1980–1985 Skylark was Buick's [[badge engineered]] version of GM's new [[GM X platform (1980)|X-body]] architecture, shared with the [[Chevrolet Citation]], [[Pontiac Phoenix]], and [[Oldsmobile Omega]] and would bear some resemblance to the larger [[GM G platform (RWD)|G-body]] [[mid-size car]]s. GM's X-body would also become the basis for GM's A-body mid-size cars that would be introduced as 1982 models. The new Skylark was introduced in the spring of 1979 as an early 1980 model featuring [[front-wheel drive]], MacPherson strut front suspension and transversely mounted engine. The new optional 60 degree 2.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 engine was developed specifically for the X-cars. This platform became the basis for nearly all following GM front wheel drive vehicles, but like the other X-body cars was plagued by numerous reports of a [[GM X platform (1980)#Mechanical problems|tendency to lock the rear wheels upon braking]], causing it to lose control and crash.

The Skylark was available in two- or four-door sedan bodystyles, and in base, Sport, or Limited trims. The standard 2.5&amp;nbsp;L Iron Duke 4 used a 2-barrel Rochester carburetor and produced {{convert|90|hp|abbr=on}} at 4000&amp;nbsp;rpm. The optional 2.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 also used a 2-barrel Rochester carburetor and produced {{convert|115|hp|abbr=on}} at 4800&amp;nbsp;rpm. A four-speed manual overdrive transaxle was standard with a three-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] transaxle as an option.

[[File:1983-1984 Buick Skylark Custom 4dr.jpg|thumb|left|1983–1984 Buick Skylark Custom, rear view]]
For the 1982 model year, the base 2.5&amp;nbsp;L engine received fuel injection. The optional 2.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 was joined by a more powerful high-output version that produced {{convert|135|hp|abbr=on}} at 5400&amp;nbsp;rpm. Also for the 1982 model year, the Skylark received a mild facelift in the form of a new grille (the front parking lamps moved from outside the headlights to inside). In model year 1983, the base Skylark became the Skylark Custom. The Sport model was replaced by the T-Type, which was available only as a two-door coupe and came with the high-output version of the 2.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 engine as standard equipment.

In 1985, the last year of production, the X-body Skylark was available only as a four-door sedan in Custom or Limited trim, as the two-door coupe was replaced by Buick's new [[Buick Somerset Regal|Somerset Regal]] coupe, built on GM's new N-body platform, shared with Pontiac's revived [[Pontiac Grand Am|Grand Am]] and the new [[Oldsmobile Calais]]. For 1985 the grille was again redesigned, as was the rear. The taillights were wider and the license plate was moved down to the bumper, while a "Buick" plate appeared where the taillights had been.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SCbuick|Gunnell (2004)]], p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buick-Somerset.jpg|thumb|Buick-Somerset]]
For the 1985 model year, the two-door Skylark [[coupe]] was replaced by the '''Somerset Regal''', built on the Oldsmobile-developed [[GM N platform|N-body platform]]. The "Somerset" name had previously been used as a trim package on the [[Buick Regal|Regal]]. This generation of compact Buicks featured a more upscale and aerodynamic design than its predecessor, incorporating the long-hood/short-deck look popular at the time. The Pontiac-produced Iron Duke engine continued from the Skylark, but an [[Isuzu]]-sourced five-speed manual transmission replaced the four-speed as standard equipment. A new {{convert|181|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} multi-port fuel injected [[Buick V6 engine#LN7|Buick]] V6, generating {{convert|125|hp|abbr=on}} at 4900&amp;nbsp;rpm, replaced the Chevrolet-designed 2.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 and was paired only with a three-speed automatic transmission. The Somerset featured an all-digital instrument cluster.

For 1986, the Skylark sedan was shifted to the N platform and redesigned to match its coupe stablemate, which dropped the "Regal" suffix from its same. It remained available in either Custom or Limited trim levels, and gained the powertrain options from the Somerset but retained conventional analog gauges.

Beginning with the 1987 model year, the four-door Skylark was available as a sporty [[T-Type]] model. In mid-model year, 1987 Skylark models had door-mounted automatic seat belts.

For 1988 models, the Somerset name was dropped and Buick's two-door N-body compact would share the Skylark nameplate with its four-door counterparts. In 1988, the Somerset name was discontinued, and all models were called Skylark. A new engine option for 1988 models was the fuel-injected, Oldsmobile-designed 2.3&amp;nbsp;L DOHC Quad-4 [[Inline-four engine|4-cylinder engine]] that produced {{convert|150|hp|abbr=on}} at 5200&amp;nbsp;rpm. An S/E package for Custom models replaced the previous T-Type trim. On 1989 models, a fuel-injected 3.3&amp;nbsp;L [[V6]] (160&amp;nbsp;hp at 5200&amp;nbsp;rpm) replaced the previous 3.0&amp;nbsp;L V6, which was also Buick-built. A new LE package become available on four-door sedans that featured a vinyl roof that covered part of the rear side windows. The three-speed automatic transaxle became standard for 1989. For 1990, a new base Skylark was added, moving the Custom model up to replace the Limited. The S/E package was replaced by a new Gran Sport two-door sedan, reviving a name that had not been connected with the Skylark for many years. The LE ("Luxury Edition") sedan would become a full-fledged model.

The 1991 Skylark was a continuation of the 1990 lineup, with virtually no change made to the outward appearance of the car. There were minor mechanical changes made to the Skylark's optional 3.3&amp;nbsp;L V6 power plant, including a one piece rear main bearing seal to replace the rope type previously used, and a redesigned camshaft flange.

Radical new wedge-shaped styling appeared in 1992, with a sharply pointed grille reminiscent of 1930s [[Buick Special]]. The Skylark's new aerodynamic body had a low 0.319 coefficient of drag, compared to 0.374 for the previous version. The pointed grille appearance was used during the mid-1960s on all Buick products.

[[File:1992-1995 Buick Skylark sedan -- 03-03-2010.jpg|thumb|left|Skylark sedan, pre-facelift design]]
It was initially offered in two- and four-door body styles and in base and [[Buick Gran Sport|Gran Sport]] versions. The base engine was the 2.3&amp;nbsp;L Quad OHC, which produced {{convert|120|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5200&amp;nbsp;rpm. The optional 3.3&amp;nbsp;L V6 (standard on the GS) produced {{convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at&amp;nbsp;5200 rpm. All Skylarks came with the three-speed automatic transaxle.

For the 1993 model year, the base model was replaced by Custom and Limited trims. For 1994, a new 3.1&amp;nbsp;L V6 ({{convert|160|hp|abbr=on}} at 5200&amp;nbsp;rpm) replaced the previous 3.3&amp;nbsp;L V6 as standard on the GS and optional on the others. The Limited coupe was dropped for 1994, but returned for 1995.

Mechanical changes for the 1995 model year included the upgrading of the standard 2.3&amp;nbsp;L Quad 4 engine from a SOHC design to a DOHC design, increasing power to {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6000&amp;nbsp;rpm. The three-speed automatic transaxle continued to be standard with the base four-cylinder engine, but a new four-speed automatic (electronically controlled 4T60-E) was optional with the 4-cylinder engine and standard with the V6.

[[File:1997 Buick Skylark Limited (29781494480).jpg|thumb|left|1997 rear view]]

Skylark received a facelift for the 1996 model year in the form of a more conventional-looking grille. The previous 2.3&amp;nbsp;L I4 was replaced by a new 2.4&amp;nbsp;L DOHC I4 that produced {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6000&amp;nbsp;rpm. The previous three-speed automatic transaxle was discontinued and the four-speed automatic became standard on all Skylarks. An on-board diagnostic system (OBD II) was standard. Buick offered an "Olympic Gold" edition of the 1996 Skylark to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Olympic Games. It featured gold USA/5-ring badging on the fenders, gold "Skylark" badges, gold-accented wheel covers, and gold accent trim.

There were only minor changes to the lineup for the 1997 model year, which was the last year that it would be available to the public in showrooms. A single-model 1998 Skylark sedan was produced for fleet-only sales, mostly to auto rental companies. Most of these 1998 models, the last year that Buick used the Skylark name, were eventually resold to the general public as used cars. After the Skylark's discontinuation, Buick did not produce another compact car until the 2012 [[Buick Verano]].

Production ended on December 4, 1997.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The Skylark production line in [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] was retooled to build the 2000–2003 Chevrolet Malibu.

The '''Buick Limited''' was an automobile built by [[Buick]] between 1936 and 1942 and during model year 1958. Since 1959 Buick has used the "Limited" name to denote those models which featured a high level of trim and standard options in its various model ranges.

==Buick Series 90 (1931-1935)==
[[File:Buick Phaeton 193 2.jpg|thumb|right|1931 Buick Series 90 Phaeton]]
The predecessor to the Buick Limited was the Series 90.  It had an {{convert|5650|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} in-line eight-cylinder engine, developing 104 bhp of power at 2,800 rpm. Due to its size, it was the top model of the Buick range, using the GM "[[GM C platform|C-body]]" platform shared with Cadillac. The next year the size grew and a new high performance engine was introduced developing 113 hp. In 1933 the model was completely revised. In 1934, however, the running board was shortened and the engine output increased again, reaching 116 hp. In 1935 the appearance was updated, while the mechanics remained unchanged, and Buick manufactured 43,321. In 1936 the model changed its name to "90 Limited".

[[File:1937 Buick. Limited series - 90. (3593514158).jpg|thumb|left|1937 Buick Limited]]

The origins of the Limited name date to 1936 when Buick added names to its entire model lineup to celebrate the engineering improvements and design advancements over their 1935 models. It shared its chassis with the top-level Cadillac [[GM D platform|D body]] vehicles. Buick had released a new line of cars that were technically superior to their predecessors by offering such features as all-steel passenger compartment tops (GM's Turret Top design), improved front suspension, improved hydraulic safety braking system, alloy engine pistons and an improved engine cooling system.
Buick's Series 40 was named the [[Buick Special|Special]], the Series 50 became the [[Buick Super|Super]], the Series 60 was named the [[Buick Century|Century]], the Series 80 was named the [[Buick Roadmaster|Roadmaster]], and the Series 90 — Buick's largest and most luxurious vehicle — was named the Limited. The engine was a {{convert|320|cuin|cc|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|120|hp|kW+PS|0|abbr=on}} [[Straight-eight engine|I8]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1936_Buick/1936_Buick_Brochure_1/1936%20Buick-09.html |title=Directory Index: Buick/1936_Buick/1936_Buick_Brochure_1 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limiteds were the most expensive Buicks in production, riding on the company's longest wheelbase of {{convert|138|in|mm|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1937_Buick/1937_Buick_Brochure/1937%20Buick-33.html |title=Directory Index: Buick/1937_Buick/1937_Buick_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the best appointed cars that Buick built. All Limiteds were built at the Buick factory in [[Buick City|Flint, Michigan]], while all Cadillacs were built in [[Detroit Assembly|Detroit]] at the Clark Street Facility. The name Limited was truly appropriate to the cars themselves which were limited to touring sedans and limousines; its sales too were the smallest of Buick's entire model range:

:'''1936''', 4,086
:'''1937''', 3,697
:'''1938''', 1,491
:'''1939''', 1,451
:'''1940''', 1,739
:'''1941''', 3,006
:'''1942''', 636 (abbreviated model year September 1941 to January 1942)

In 1938, the wheelbase was stretched 2 inches from 139 to {{convert|140|in|mm|0}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1938_Buick/1938_Buick_Brochure/1938%20Buick-32.html |title=Directory Index: Buick/1938_Buick/1938_Buick_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Limited, along with Roadmaster, lost its wooden structural members for steel, making them the last Buick passenger cars to rely upon a wood components.

In 1939 Buick products underwent a substantial redesign; however, the Limited's "limited" production merited it to continue using its 1938 body.

Behind the scenes, Cadillac executives lobbied to get the Limited out of production because it infringed on their market. While it was priced in the lower end of its Fleetwood series price point, the Limited almost equaled Cadillac's factory built Imperial Sedan (Limousine),&lt;ref&gt;[http://cadillacdatabase.com/Dbas_txt/Phocad38.htm Photos of Cadillac Imperial sedan limousine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601043345/http://cadillacdatabase.com/Dbas_txt/Phocad38.htm |date=June 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which cost almost four times as much as the Buick, in its appointments. Buick executives fired back that Limited production averaged only 1,561 vehicles per year for model years 1938 through 1940, an insignificant amount compared to Cadillac's production of its senior cars.

Production of the Limited continued until the eve of [[World War II]]. Following [[World War II]], Buick dropped its extended wheelbase models, and dropped the Limited nameplate.

The Buick Limited series was revived in 1958 as the ultimate Buick for the model year, using the [[GM C platform (RWD)|GM C platform]]. In a model year where General Motors's answer to [[Chrysler|Chrysler's]] "Forward Look" was to update its 1957 Buicks and Oldsmobiles by slathering them in excessive amounts of [[Chrome plating|chrome]], the 1958 Buicks received the ultimate treatment.

Each Buick Special, Century and Roadmaster received a ''Fashion-Aire Dynastar'' grille, cast of 160 chrome squares, each, according to Buick PR pieces, "shaped in a design to maximize the amount of reflective light". Buick also added quad headlights and three emblems bearing a stylized "V", one a medallion on the hood and the other two as gun-sight fender-toppers. The Buick "[[Buick#Sweepspear|Sweepspear]]" side trim, a styling hallmark since 1949, was joined by broad chrome panels attached to the rear quarter panels. Tail lights were housed in massive chrome housings; each trunk lid received a chrome grip in the center. Wheelbase was 127.5"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1958_Buick/1958_Buick_Brochure/1958%20Buick-06.html |title=Directory Index: Buick/1958_Buick/1958_Buick_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 227.5"long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1958_Buick/1958_Buick_Brochure/1958%20Buick-34.html |title=Directory Index: Buick/1958_Buick/1958_Buick_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison to the junior models in the Buick lineup, the Limited was slightly more restrained. Each Limited traded its chromed side panel trim for a body color-keyed insert decorated with fifteen slanted [[Service stripe|hash marks]] (three groups of five). The Limited also received its own rear tail treatment that traded the heavy chrome tail light housings for a wraparound tail light lens broken up by four chrome bands. Rear bumper [[Dagmar bumpers|"Dagmars"]] housed "Dual Jet" back-up lights. Power brakes were standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1958_Buick/1958_Buick_Brochure/1958%20Buick-33.html |title=Directory Index: Buick/1958_Buick/1958_Buick_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Available only as a four-door hardtop, two-door hardtop coupe or convertible, the Limited rode Buick's 127.5" wheelbase, with its body stretched 227.1", just shy of nineteen feet in length. Inside, buyers were treated to high quality fabrics in sedans and coupes, full leather in convertibles.

Buick sold only 7,438 Limiteds, due in part to their price. The Limited's four-door hardtop sedan started at a base price of $5,112, which was $221 higher than Cadillac's extended deck [[Cadillac Series 62|Series 62]] four-door hardtop sedan ($4,891) of which [[Cadillac]] sold 13,335 units.

For the 1959 model year, Buick renamed its entire lineup, with the [[Buick Super|Super]] becoming the [[Buick Electra|Electra]], the [[Buick Roadmaster|Roadmaster]] becoming the [[Buick Electra|Electra 225]] and the Limited being discontinued due to lack of sales success.
{{clear}}

== 1965 and beyond ==
[[File:1976 Buick Electra Limited fR.jpg|thumb|left|1976 Buick Electra Limited]]
The Limited name was used again in 1965 as a trim option on the Electra 225 Custom model and other models.
Between 1972-1979, Buick added the "Limited" name to its top trim Electra 225, which was previously known as the Electra 225 Custom. The cars were not badged as Electra 225's, but instead wore "Limited" scripts. However, these cars were Electra 225's, and in a break from tradition, the "Limited" trim level could be optioned with either the Park Avenue or Park Avenue DeLuxe options package, each even more well-equipped than the Limited model alone.

Buick continued to use the designation of "Limited" through 2005 on its various models to typically denote the highest trim level in a model range.

The '''Buick Skyhawk''' is an [[automobile]] produced by [[Buick]] in two generations for the 1975 through 1989 model years.

The first generation (1975-1980) were two-door hatchbacks using the subcompact, rear-wheel drive [[GM H platform (RWD)|H-body platform]], a [[badge engineered]] entry-level version of the [[Chevrolet Monza]], which was based on the [[Chevrolet Vega]].

The second generation (1982-1989) models were built on the compact, front-wheel drive [[GM J platform|J-car platform]] that was available in four [[body styles]]: two-door sedan and hatchback, as well as four-door sedan and station wagon &amp;mdash; manufactured alongside its [[badge engineering|rebadged variants]], the [[Chevrolet Cavalier]], [[Cadillac Cimarron]], [[Oldsmobile Firenza]], and [[Pontiac Sunbird|Pontiac J2000/2000/Sunbird]] at GM's [[South Gate Assembly]] and [[Janesville Assembly Plant|Janesville Assembly]] plants.

The "first generation" Buick Skyhawk is a [[subcompact]], four passenger, [[hatchback]] automobile that was introduced September 1974, and produced for the 1975 through 1980 model years. It was
based on the [[Chevrolet Vega]], and shares its [[wheelbase]] and width.&lt;ref name="h-body.org"&gt;h-body.org&lt;/ref&gt; The Skyhawk was produced with [[GM H platform (RWD)|H-body]] variants Chevrolet Monza, Oldsmobile Starfire, and [[Pontiac Sunbird]]. In North America, it competed with other small sporty cars, such as the [[Toyota Celica]], [[Datsun 200SX]], [[VW Scirocco]], [[Mercury Capri]], and the [[Ford Mustang II]]. The Buick Skyhawk was the smallest car to wear the Buick badge in more than 60 years.

===Overview===

The Skyhawk has a {{convert|97.0|in|mm|adj=on}} [[wheelbase]] and a {{convert|65.4|in|mm|adj=on}} width. The Skyhawk, Chevrolet Monza, and [[Oldsmobile Starfire]] were among the first vehicles to adopt the newly approved quad rectangular headlamps. The body style is noted for having a resemblance to the [[Ferrari 365 GTC/4]]. The Skyhawk is a rear-wheel drive vehicle with a [[live axle|live rear axle]] design. Throughout its production, the H-body Skyhawk was offered only with the Buick-designed 3.8 liter (231 cid) [[V6 engine]], using a two-barrel carburetor that generated {{Convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm in comparison to its siblings which offered a variety of engines. A four-speed [[manual transmission]] was standard; with a three-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] offered as an option. The front suspension is short and long control arms with coil springs, and anti-roll bar; the rear suspension is a torque-arm design with coil springs and an anti-roll bar. Its design was later incorporated into GM's third- and fourth-generation F-bodied ([[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaro]] and [[Pontiac Firebird|Firebird]]). Variable-ratio power steering was standard and of a [[recirculating ball]] design. The brake system features standard power assist including front disc brakes with solid rotors, and rear drum brakes.

[[File:1976 Buick Skyhawk.jpg|thumb|left|1976 Buick Skyhawk hatchback coupe]]
Following the introduction of the Skyhawk, in mid-1975, it was joined by a lower-priced and less well-equipped Skyhawk ''S''.

In 1976, a five-speed manual transmission became available as an option. Starting with the 1976 models, the front and rear disc rotors were of the vented type. Another new option was the Astroroof, which was a large, heavily tinted, overhead glass roof combined with a wide aluminum band that extended from one B-pillar across the roof to the opposite B-pillar.  In 1977, a conventional sliding sunroof became optional and also could be ordered with the aluminum band.

For the 1979 model year, the Skyhawk received a facelift that incorporated single rectangular headlamps, replacing the previous dual rectangular headlamps that all models had used.  A new option was the "Road Hawk" package that included a Rallye ride and handling package consisting of larger front and rear stabilizer bars, larger tires, and special interior and exterior trim. There was also a "Skyhawk Designers' Accent Edition" that was primarily an exterior trim package available in bright yellow or red with black trim.

There were few changes for 1980, the last model year for the GM H-body platform, most notably the discontinuance of the five-speed manual transmission as an option. Only the four-speed manual and three-speed automatic transmissions were offered for 1980.

The H-body Skyhawk was replaced in the spring of 1981 with the new front-wheel drive Buick Skyhawk, built on General Motors' J-body platform.  However, this new second-generation was not a direct replacement for the original Skyhawk. While the original Skyhawk was a small sporty car, the second-generation model was a line of compact cars that included two- and four-door sedans, a two-door hatchback coupe, and a four-door station wagon.

The Skyhawk and Starfire failed to achieve the sales success of the Monza and Sunbird possibly because small sporty coupes seemed out-of-place in a Buick or Oldsmobile showroom. Lack of a notchback model may have also been a factor. They were discontinued on December 21, 1979 to allow for more production of Monza and Sunbird hatchbacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 1980 |year=1980 |publisher=Ward's Communications, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 125,311 H-body Skyhawks were produced in six model years.&lt;ref name="h-body.org" /&gt;

The 1982–1989 [[front-wheel drive]] Skyhawk ([[GM J platform|J-body]]) debuted in February, at the 1982 Chicago Auto Show. The Skyhawk was originally available as a two-door and four-door sedan and was very similar to the Chevrolet Cavalier. The standard engine was a corporate [[GM 122 engine|1.8 liter]] "122" OHV carbureted four-cylinder (88&amp;nbsp;hp), with a Brazilian-built 1.8 liter overhead-cam TBI four (84&amp;nbsp;hp) as an option. A carbureted, 90&amp;nbsp;hp SOHC two-litre also appeared soon after the Skyhawk went on sale, along with an optional five-speed manual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Standard Catalog of Buick, 1903-2004 (3rd ed.) | author = John Gunnell | publisher = Krause Publications, Inc. | location = Iola, WI | pages = 205–208 | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-87349-760-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Skyhawk was an entry-level compact platform for a luxury brand, Buick, and was a refocused effort from the previous generation introduced. It followed many economic factors. The United States had entered into a [[Early 1980s recession in the United States|recession]], following the effects of the [[1970s energy crisis]], and the United States Congress having passed the [[Energy Policy and Conservation Act]], establishing [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] standards. Sales of large luxury sedans declined in favor of smaller, fuel efficient products with luxury features installed. Smaller luxury vehicles were imported into North America from both Europe and Japan, and GM responded with a small luxury sedan.

For 1983, the Brazil-built 1.8-litre gained four hp, while the OHV 1.8 and SOHC 2.0 were replaced by a Chevrolet-built OHV 2.0, also with 90&amp;nbsp;hp. A four-door station wagon was also introduced, Buick's first front-wheel drive wagon.&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Catalog of Buick'', pp. 211–214&lt;/ref&gt; The next year there was a minor facelift, with bigger cooling openings and larger bumper rub strips. The 2.0 lost four hp, down to 86. Shortly after the introduction of the '84s, a turbocharged MPFI version of the Brazilian 1.8 became available on the [[T-Type]] model, offering a hefty {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The turbo T-Type was not available with the five-speed manual. The Skyhawk set a sales record in 1984 with 134,076 built.&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Catalog of Buick'', pp. 217–220&lt;/ref&gt; There was not much change for 1985, but for 1986 a new two-door hatchback was added, in "Sport" or T-Type trim. Also, both 1.8s and 2.0s now claimed the same 88&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Catalog of Buick'', pp. 231–236&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1.8-litre engines were replaced by two SOHC multi-port injected 2.0 liter versions for 1987, one naturally aspirated (96&amp;nbsp;hp/71&amp;nbsp;kW) and one {{convert|165|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} turbocharged version known as ''[[Regular Production Option|RPO]] [[GM 122 engine#2.0 L SOHC|LT3]]''. The OHV two-litre remained, now with 90&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Catalog of Buick'', p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; For 1988, only Skyhawk Sports remained, and the hatchback was discontinued. There was also a "Sport S/E" two-door coupe. The OHV and turbocharged engines were no longer available.&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Catalog of Buick'', pp. 248–250&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buick Skyhawk (J) Wagon facelift rear.jpg|thumb|left|Facelifted Skyhawk station wagon]]
[[File:1987 Buick SkyHawk Custom.jpg|thumb|left|1987 Buick Skyhawk sedan]]
1989 was to be the last year of the Skyhawk, but nonetheless the car received updates such as standard electronic fuel injection, better acoustical insulation and body colored door and window frames on the station wagon.&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Catalog of Buick'', pp. 254–256&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 23,366 '89s were built, for a total of 499,132 second generation Skyhawks.

The Skyhawk, along with variant the Oldsmobile Firenza, were built in [[Leeds, Kansas City|Leeds]], next of [[Kansas City, Missouri]] from 1982 through 1988. Nineteen-eighty eight was the last year of Oldsmobile Firenza production  and [[Leeds Assembly]] was then closed. For 1989, GM moved Skyhawk production to its [[Janesville, Wisconsin]], assembly plant. Production of the Skyhawk ceased after the 1989 model year. The Chevrolet Cavalier was also produced at Leeds for some of these model years.

The last Skyhawk rolled off the assembly line on June 16, 1989. The Skyhawk was the last Buick vehicle to offer a manual transmission option, until the introduction of the [[Opel Insignia]]-based [[Buick Regal#Fifth generation .282009.E2.80.93present.29|2011 Buick Regal Turbo]].

'''Buick Century''' is the model name that was used by [[Buick]] for a line of upscale [[full-size car]]s from 1936 to 1942 and 1954 to 1958, as well as from 1973 to 2005 for [[mid-size car]]s.

The first Buick Century debuted in 1936 as a shorter and lighter model featuring the same engine as the bigger Roadmaster and Limited series giving it more performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Severson |first=Aaron |title=One Hundred from Zero: The 1936–1942 Buick Century |url= https://ateupwithmotor.com/model-histories/buick-century-1936-1942/ |website=Ate Up With Motor |accessdate=12 November 2019 |date=23 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Century name was then used on six generations of cars of varying sizes as well as performance and trim levels. 

In 1969, Buick developed a [[concept car]] known as the [[Buick Century Cruiser|Century Cruiser]].

==Series 60 (1930–1935)==
[[File:Buick 66S Sport Coupe 191.jpg|thumb|right|1931 Series 60 Sport Coupe]]
Originally, the Series 60 had a six-cylinder {{convert|5431|cc|cid|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} engine, developing {{convert|99|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 2,800 rpm. It had, at the beginning of the generation, a full-length [[running board]] denoting the top model for Buick at the time. In 1930, GM built 38,180 cars. The bodystyles available were [[torpedo (car)|torpedo]], sedan, coupe, and roadster [[convertible]], using GM's "[[GM B platform|B-body]]" platform.

In 1931, the running board was reduced and a new straight-eight {{convert|4467|cc|cid|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} engine and {{convert|90|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Aesthetically, the Series 60 remained almost unchanged, and the same fact occurred also in the following year. In 1931 and 1932, a total of 55,135 were produced.

In 1933, the length of the body increased. The engine power increased to {{convert|97|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. In 1934, the appearance was changed to a more rounded appearance, with a new {{convert|4557|cc|cid|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} eight-cylinder engine and 100&amp;nbsp;hp. In 1935, the model remained almost unchanged. Total production from 1933 to 1935 was 31,385. In 1936, the model changed its name to "Century".

Buick renamed its entire model lineup for the 1936 model year to celebrate the engineering improvements and design advancements over their 1935 models, introducing a "[[Streamline Moderne|streamlined]]" appearance. Buick's Series 40 model range became the [[Buick Special|Special]], the Series 80 became the [[Buick Roadmaster|Roadmaster]], and the Series 90, Buick's largest and most luxurious vehicles, became the [[Buick Limited|Limited]]. The Century took the place of the Series 60.

The basic formula for the 1936 to 1942 Century was established by mating the shorter behind-the-engine cowl [[Buick Special|Special]] bodies to the Roadmaster's larger [[straight-eight engine]] (and consequently longer engine compartment). (In contrast, the 1940 Series 50 [[Buick Super|Super]] combined the larger Roadmaster body with the smaller Special engine.) While the Special was powered by Buick's [[Buick Straight-8 engine|233 cu in inline-8]] was rated {{convert|93|hp|abbr=on}} at 3200&amp;nbsp;rpm, Centurys produced between 1936 and 1942 were powered by the 320-cubic-inch producing {{convert|165|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, making them the fastest Buicks of the era and capable of sustained speeds of {{convert|100|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, hence the name Century (100), earning the Century the nickname "the banker's hot rod."

The Century was discontinued at the end of the abbreviated 1942 model year, during which total model production only accounted for about 10% of Buick's total output.

In 1954, Buick reintroduced the Century using the same formula of mating the smaller, lighter Buick Special body to its largest and most powerful 322 cubic inch [[Buick V8 engine#Nailhead1|"Nailhead"]] [[V8 engine]], with the intent of giving Buick a performance vehicle. Included in the model lineup during this period was a station wagon model, a body style that had been unavailable during the Century's first production period of 1936 to 1942.

Introduced in the middle of the 1955 model year, the four-door Buick Century [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]] along with the four-door [[Buick Special|Special Riviera]], the four-door [[Oldsmobile 98|Oldsmobile 98 Holiday]], and four-door [[Oldsmobile 88|88 Holiday]], were the first four-door [[hardtop]]s ever produced. For the first time the Century wore four "[[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPorts]]" on the front fenders, just like the larger [[Buick Roadmaster]] and Super; making more apparent its status above that of the Special.

In 1955, the [[California]] Highway Patrol placed a large fleet order for Century two-door sedans, a body style unavailable to the general public. It combined the Special two-door sedan body shell with Century powertrain and trim. [[Broderick Crawford]] was shown driving a two-door Century sedan during the first season of his popular syndicated TV series ''[[Highway Patrol (U.S. TV series)|Highway Patrol]]''. (In later seasons, he drove a four-door Century, like his real-life counterparts in the California Highway Patrol.) Power brakes were optional.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1955_Buick/1955_Buick_Brochure_1/1955%20Buick-26.html&lt;/ref&gt; Tubeless tires were new.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1955_Buick/1955_Buick_Brochure_1/1955%20Buick-24.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Century remained Buick's performance line, with engine power rising from 200 (SAE gross) in 1954, to 236 in 1955, to 255 in 1956, and topping out at 300 from a bored-out {{convert|364|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} engine in 1957–58, the last model years for the full-sized Century line.

In 1956, the Century's base price was $2,963. Power windows were standard in the convertible. A padded safety dash became optional.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1956_Buick/1956_Buick_Brochure_1/1956%20Buick-29.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the Century was considered the senior "small Buick", the model received GM's only hardtop station wagon, the '''Century Caballero''', from 1957 through 1958. The Caballero proved expensive to manufacture and unpopular with customers (only 14,642 produced for both model years), so GM did not bring it back for 1959.

For 1959, Buick renamed the Century the [[Buick Invicta|Invicta]].

The Buick Century nameplate was revived for the 1973 model year on the [[rear-wheel drive]] intermediate [[GM A platform (RWD)|A-body]] platform, which was redesigned for this year. The name replaced Skylark for Buick's mid-sized cars. The '''[[Buick Regal|Century Regal]]''' coupe was added at the top of the model range, and later became a separate series, dropping the Century name. It was available with two- and four-barrel versions of the [[Buick V8 engine#350|Buick 350]], putting out {{convert|150|and|175|hp|abbr=on}}, respectively. The {{convert|225|hp|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#455|455]] was also an option. The base Century and Century 350 coupes had a fastback roof with large rear quarter glass, while the Century Luxus featured a more formal notchback roofline with narrow opera windows.

By replacing the Skylark, the Century inherited the Gran Sport performance option. The package was available with any engine and included upgraded suspension, additional instrumentation, and unique appearance treatment. Dual exhaust increased output of the four-barrel 350 to {{convert|190|hp|abbr=on}}. While the Stage I 455 was somewhat diminished from its performance heyday due to emission controls, output was competitive for the era at {{convert|270|hp||0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|390|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. A Saginaw three-speed manual was standard with either 350 engine. A Muncie M-21 four-speed was available with either 350 or with the regular 455, while the Stage I required a [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] 400.&lt;ref name='hemmings73gs'&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Fitzgerald |first=Craig |date=June 2004 |title=1973-1974 Buick Gran Sport |url=https://www.hemmings.com/magazine/mus/2004/06/1973-1974-Buick-Gran-Sport/1728622.html |magazine=Hemmings Muscle Machines |publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1973 Buick Century Gran Sport Stage I, rear left (Greenwich 2018).jpg|thumb|left|1973 Buick Century Gran Sport]]
For 1975, the Luxus was renamed Century Custom. The new {{convert|110|hp|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine|231]] V6 was installed as standard equipment along with a three-speed [[manual transmission]] on coupes and sedans, and the big-block [[Buick V8 engine#455|455]] was no longer available. The four-barrel 350 V8 became standard on station wagons. A new landau top became available for fastback coupes that partially covered the rear quarter glass, giving an appearance similar to the formal-roof Century Custom. A Century [[Buick Special|Special]] coupe was added to the lineup, using the fastback roofline. The Special was marketed as an economy variant of the Century and was only available with the V6 engine.

In 1976, the US government legalized rectangular headlights (long commonplace in Europe), and Buick promptly added them to the Century, positioned side-by-side on coupes and stacked vertically on sedans. Sedans received a taller, more-formal grille, while coupes got an angled, body-colored front end along with new bodyside sheetmetal that lacked the traditional "sweepspear". The Gran Sport option was discontinued.

In 1977, the V6 engine was revised to be [[V6 engine#Odd and even firing|even-firing]], and a {{convert|403|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#403|Oldsmobile]] V8 was added as an option for station wagons.

Buick Centuries were used in the 1975 and 1976 Indianapolis Motor Speedway as pace cars. Buick introduced a 1975 Buick Century "Free Spirit" edition replica based on the Indy Pace Car for the public with patriotic graphic decals and the Buick Hawk on the hood. This 1975 vehicle had a transmission shifter on the floor with bucket seats and "Hurst Hatch" T-tops installed. The white exterior and blue/white interior was based on the 1975 two-door sheet metal. The engine was a 350 V8, as opposed to the 455 V8 used on the actual Indy 500 Pace Car. Alternatively, in 1976, Buick introduced the "Free Spirit" edition of the Indy Pace Car; it was downsized to the 1976 Special facelift sheet metal with a 231 V6. The original Indy Pace Car had the turbocharged 231 V6. The replica featured a rakish silver, black, and red paint job with black interior. The vehicle had positive-traction differential.

In 1978, GM downsized its intermediate line, reducing wheelbase by 4 in and curb weight by nearly half a ton. The Century name was now applied to the entire range except for the coupe, which retained the Regal name. The Century was initially offered as an "aeroback" fastback two-door coupe and a fastback four-door sedan along with a station wagon model (sharing bodies with the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass#Fifth-generation (intermediate) 1978–1988|Oldsmobile Cutlass Salon]]). The car was over a foot shorter, several inches narrower, and several hundred pounds lighter than its predecessor. V6 engines were still standard due to fuel economy regulations. Big-block engines were gone and the new base powerplant was Buick's new {{convert|196|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V6, introduced specifically for the Century and Regal. The {{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V6, and the [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#305|Chevrolet 305]] V8 were options. The Pontiac {{convert|265|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|301|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} replaced the Chevrolet engine for 1979.

[[File:1980 Buick Century Estate (14680574096).jpg|thumb|left|1980 Buick Century Estate Wagon]]
One of the more rare models of this time was the 1979 to 1980 Century Turbo Coupe, powered by a [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] version of the 3.8&amp;nbsp;L [[V6]], which offered [[V8 engine|V8]]-like performance with more reasonable fuel consumption and reduced emissions. The Turbo Coupe was not nearly as popular as the similar Regal Turbo Sport Coupe of the time, and total production is estimated to be less than 2,500.

The two fastback models (along with the Oldsmobile Cutlass Salon) proved unpopular. For 1980, the fastback four-door sedan was dropped in favor of a conventional notchback four-door sedan. After 1980, the Century fastback coupe was discontinued. With the introduction of the new front-wheel drive Century in 1982, the existing notchback sedan and wagon models were transferred to the Regal line.

In January 1982&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/14/business/new-cars-coming-gradually.html&lt;/ref&gt;, another downsized Century arrived, this time on the [[front-wheel drive]] [[GM A platform (1982)|A platform]], in coupe and sedan forms. In October 1983, a station wagon was added to the lineup to replace the departed Regal wagon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1984/314555/buick_century_estate_wagon_2_5l.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url= https://books.google.com/?id=h9QDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=buick+century+wagon+%22october+1983%22#v=onepage&amp;q=buick%20century%20wagon%20%22october%201983%22&amp;f=false | title=Popular Mechanics| publisher=Hearst Magazines| date=October 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1984 model year also had an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] version of the Buick Century, commemorating the 1984 games in [[Los Angeles, California]]. In 1985, all 1986 versions were "freshened" with a new, more angular front fascia. Wheelbase was {{convert|104.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, with {{convert|189|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} overall length. Both four-cylinder gasoline units and [[Diesel engine|diesel]] V6 engines were offered in this generation, although neither became popular. Performance versions of several Buick models, including the Century coupe, were offered in the mid-1980s under the T-Type name. With Buick's [[Buick V6 engine#3.0|181&amp;nbsp;cu in]] (3.0&amp;nbsp;L) V6 producing {{Convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, the Century T-Type's performance was modest, but the [[GM 3800 engine#3.8 FWD|3.8]] SFI engine, producing {{Convert|140-150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, offered spirited performance in this comparatively lightweight vehicle.

For 1985 and 1986, [[Hess &amp; Eisenhardt]]/Car Craft of [[Lima, Ohio]] converted 124 finished Buick Century coupes into [[Coachbuilder|coachbuilt]] [[convertible]]s. Although these convertibles were sold as new cars through Buick dealerships, these conversions were not factory authorized. In 1986, the engine distributor was replaced by a coil-pack ignition system that proved to be far more reliable than the system that it replaced. The Venezuelan-built models were sold as the "Chevrolet Century" in South America and the Caribbean. In Mexico, it was sold as the Century Limited (with no brand, although it wears the Buick logos). Introduced for 1984, it was the top model for General Motors Mexico, and it survived successfully the import car wave from 1991 (previously new car importations were forbidden in Mexico) and continued in production until the 1996 model year.

The Century received a facelift in late 1988 for the 1989 model year&lt;ref&gt;https://newspaperarchive.com/hutchinson-news-oct-14-1988-p-61/&lt;/ref&gt;, gaining a new more-rounded roofline, but continuing on the A-body platform. Black plastic inserts with the Buick trishield emblem replaced the rear quarter windows. The front end received flush headlamps and a rounded grille, and the stand-up hood ornament was now standard. All sedan models were easily distinguished by their distinctive full-width tail lights, a somewhat extravagant flourish on a smaller sedan, but one that carried on a Buick tradition of big tail lights. The 3300 was introduced in 1989 as a lower-powered alternative to the 3800 cc power plant. The smaller engine featured multiport fuel injection, waste spark distributor-less ignition controlled by the ECM after startup, but had no balance shaft. An interior refresh came in 1989 for 1990 models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/?id=214EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;dq=%22november+1989%22+1990+%22buick+century%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22november%201989%22%201990%20%22buick%20century%22&amp;f=false | title=Black Enterprise| last1=Earl g. Graves| first1=Ltd| date=November 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1991 facelift===
For the 1991 model year,&lt;ref&gt;https://newspaperarchive.com/syracuse-herald-journal-sep-24-1991-p-111/&lt;/ref&gt; the Century received another slight facelift featuring a bigger radiator grille and different headlamps. Also, the interior received new door panels moving the window switches and door lock switches into a more convenient configuration found on more modern cars, where the switch location corresponds with the window location in the car body. This feature never appeared on its sibling the Oldsmobile Ciera, which retained the inline switch bank mounted flush with the door panel, the rear switch being the drivers door window. The Century windows switches were not backlit, but lit by a small bulb in the door panel trim above the switch bank. Other interior changes included new seat covers, and relocating the front outboard seat belts from the A pillar into the door, functioning as "automatic" seat belts so that the belts could be buckled and the door opened and closed while still buckled. The driver and front passenger could enter and exit the vehicle while the seat belt was still fastened.

For 1993, the 2.5&amp;nbsp;L [[Straight-4|I4]] was replaced with a new 115&amp;nbsp;[[Horsepower|hp]] 2.2 I4. For 1994, the slow-selling coupe model was dropped (603 sold for 1993, or 0.5% of overall Century sales&lt;ref name="buick"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Standard Catalog of Buick, 1903–2004 (3rd ed.) | first = John | last = Gunnell | ref = harv | publisher = Krause Publications, Inc. | location = Iola, WI | page = 279 | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-87349-760-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and all models received a standard driver's-side [[airbag]]. Also in 1993, the {{Convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.3&amp;nbsp;L Buick V6 was replaced with a 3.1&amp;nbsp;L V6 with the same power rating, and power on the 2.2&amp;nbsp;L I4 was up to {{convert|120|hp|abbr=on}} with the introduction of [[Fuel injection|MFI]]. Midway through the 1994 model year, a round speedometer replaced the wide rectangular one, but the car still carried on with the original dash.

Despite its dated design, the Century and its sibling the Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera still sold well during the 1990s and proved both reliable and profitable to GM since their tooling costs had been monetized. In general, the A-body platform was very sturdy, and quality was improved every year while more standard features were added.

The Century was redesigned for the last time in December 1996.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1996-08-11-9608110276-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; The four-door sedan was the only body style offered (the station wagon was dropped due to decreasing sales), and was still a front-wheel drive, V6-powered configuration. Plainer "Custom" and fancier "Limited" trim levels were carried over from the previous generation. The redesign moved Centurys to the [[GM W platform|W-body]] platform, rejoining its former Regal sibling. In this generation, the Century and Regal were nearly the same car, distinguished only by seating configurations, trim and engine differences. Since the Century was lower-priced than the Regal, it was also the lower-powered and plainer of the two, offering only a 3.1&amp;nbsp;L V6. In keeping with its traditional image, the six-passenger Century came equipped with a front bench seat and column shifter, while the more performance-oriented five-passenger Regal came standard with front bucket seats and console shifter. 

After the 1998 discontinuation of the Skylark, the Century became Buick's entry-level car for the first time. For 2003, all trim levels were eliminated, leaving one standard model. Additionally, the "Century" nameplate on the front doors was dropped, and only seen on the vehicle's tail lights.

Changes were relatively few over the Century's nine-year run. The all-new [[Buick LaCrosse]] replaced both the Century and Regal. A limited run of Centurys with special trim were produced for 2005 to mark the end of the name. GM rolled the last Buick Century off the Oshawa assembly line on October 25, 2004.

The Buick Century was produced in China as the New Century from 1998 to 2000, and ran on the 3.0 liter ''[[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#LW9|LW9]]'' V6 engine which was also used in the first-generation [[Buick GL8]]. A four cylinder model was also available paired to a 5 speed manual gearbox. The Century was replaced by the [[Buick Regal]] due to poor sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://carnewschina.com/2012/06/13/spotted-in-china-buick-new-century/|title=Spotted in China: Buick New Century}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Buick Sport Wagon''' was a [[Mid-size car|mid-size]] [[station wagon]] built by [[Buick]] and a corporate sister of the [[Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser]]. Featuring a raised roof and [[Skylight (window)#Skylights|skylights]] over the cargo and second seat area, this model was an extended [[wheelbase]] version of the [[Buick Skylark]] station wagon. Buick Sport Wagons were built in three generations, spanning 1964–67, 1968–69, and 1970–72. During this time period, this was the only luxury level station wagon offered under the Buick model line. The last generation did not receive the skylights.

==1964&amp;ndash;1967==

An innovative model was introduced on February 4, 1964. Using the new [[GM A platform (RWD)]] the Sport Wagon used a {{convert|120|in|0|adj=on}} wheelbase, that was {{convert|5|in|0}} longer than the other Skylark four-door sedans and wagons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/buick8.htm "1964, 1965, 1966 Buicks" by the Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'', 5 June 2007], retrieved on 1 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1964 to 1967 Sport Wagons had a [[sunroof|skyroof]] that consisted of four tinted glass panels surrounding the elevated section of the roof. A forward-facing third row of seats was optional. Sport Wagons were available in standard and more upscale "Custom" [[trim package]].

==1968&amp;ndash;1969==

A body redesign for 1968 featured sweeping "S-shape" side sculpturing, while the wagon's roof replaced the previously-used split main skylight with a one-piece skylight over the second-row seat, which carried over to 1969. The lengthwise skylights along the cargo area remained the same.

The 1964–69 Sport Wagon models rode on a {{convert|121|in|0|adj=on}} wheelbase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/buick9.htm "1967, 1968, 1969 Buicks" by the Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'', 5 June 2007], retrieved on 1 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  This allowed for optional third row seats that was not available on the smaller {{convert|116|in|0|adj=on}} wheelbase Special and DeLuxe wagons.

Engine choices included two 350 ci V-8s shared with the Skylark line and a 400 cubic inch "big block" also available in the GS series.

==1970&amp;ndash;1972==
[[File:1971 Buick Sport Wagon.jpg|thumb|right|1971 Buick Sport Wagon]]
[[File:Buick Sport Wagon, 1971, rear.jpg|thumb|Rear view of 1971 Sport Wagon]]

In 1970, the mid-sized Buick models were redesigned. From 1970 to 1972, the Sport Wagon became a deluxe trim version of the similar, less expensive Buick Skylark wagon. The distinctive skylights were not offered and the Sport Wagons were now built on the {{convert|116|in|0|adj=on}} wheelbase shared with four-door sedans.

==1978&amp;ndash;1980==

In 1978–1980, a Sport Wagon package was available on the Century wagon. It included different exterior trim like a different grille with body color inserts, special paint treatment, sport wheels and sport suspension.

The '''Buick Riviera''' is a [[personal luxury car]] that was marketed by [[Buick]] from 1963 to 1999, with the exception of the 1994 model year. 

As [[General Motors]]' first entry into the personal luxury car market segment, the Riviera was highly praised by automotive journalists upon its high-profile debut. The ground-up design that debuted for 1963 was also Buick's first unique Riviera model, and it pioneered the [[GM E platform]]. 

Unlike its subsequent GM E platform stablemates, the [[Oldsmobile Toronado]] and [[Cadillac Eldorado]], the Riviera was initially a standard front engine/rear-wheel drive platform, only switching to [[front-wheel drive]] starting for 1979. 

While the early models stayed close to their original form, eight subsequent generations varied substantially in size and styling. A total of 1,127,261 Rivieras were produced.

The Riviera name was resurrected for two [[concept car]]s that were displayed at auto shows in 2007 and in 2013.

==Origins==

===The Riviera name===
[[File:1949 Buick Roadmaster Riviera Coupé - Flickr - exfordy.jpg|thumb|1949 Buick Roadmaster Riviera (one of the first [[hardtop]]s)]]
[[File:1959 Buick Elektra 225 Riviera Sedan side.JPG|thumb|1959 Buick Electra 225 Riviera]]

The name ''Riviera'', [[Latin]] for ''coastline'', was chosen to evoke the allure and affluence of the [[French Riviera]]. It first entered the [[Buick]] line in 1949, as the designation for the new two-door pillarless [[hardtop]], described in advertising as "stunningly smart". The [[Buick Roadmaster]] Riviera coupe (along with the [[Cadillac De Ville|Cadillac Coupe de Ville]] and [[Oldsmobile 98]] Holiday coupe) constituted the first mass production use of this body style, which was to become extremely popular over the next 30 years. Buick added a two-door Riviera hardtop to the [[Buick Super|Super]] the following year, the [[Buick Special|Special]] in 1951 and the [[Buick Century|Century]] upon its return, after a 12-year absence, in 1954.

From 1951 to 1953 the ''Riviera'' designation was given to the existing long wheelbase versions of the four-door Buick Roadmaster and Super [[sedan (car)|sedan]]s. The 1951–53 Buick Roadmaster and Super four-door Riviera sedans feature more standard features, more plush interior trim and, most significantly, a wheelbase (and overall length) that is {{convert|4|in|mm|0}} longer than a regular Buick Roadmaster or Super four-door sedan. The 1951–52 Buick Super four-door Riviera sedan is still {{convert|0.75|in|mm}} shorter in wheelbase and length than the regular Buick Roadmaster and {{convert|4.75|in|mm}} shorter than the Roadmaster four-door Riviera sedan. In 1953, with the move from the [[Buick Straight-8 engine|Fireball]] [[straight-eight engine|straight-eight]] to the more compact [[Buick V8 engine|Nailhead]] [[V8 engine|V8]] engine, the Roadmaster and Super four-door Riviera sedans became the same length.

In the middle of the 1955 model year, Buick and [[Oldsmobile]] introduced the world's first mass-produced four-door hardtops, with Buick offering it only on the Century and Special models, and the ''Riviera'' designation was also applied to these body styles. Four-door Riviera hardtops were added to the Roadmaster and Super lines at the beginning of the following model year. However, since it was a body style designation and not a model, the Riviera name does not usually appear on the car.

In 1959, Buick became much more selective in applying the Riviera name. From then until 1962 it only was used to denote a premium trimmed six-window hardtop style which it initially shared exclusively with [[Cadillac]] (the Oldsmobile 98 would receive it in 1961) and was available only on the [[Buick Electra|Electra 225]]. The last usage of the term ''Riviera'' to describe a luxury trim level was 1963, as the formal designation of the #4829 Electra 225 Riviera four-door hardtop, the same year the E-body model two-door hardtop coupe Riviera made its debut.

===Debut as a personal luxury car===
[[File:Sloan Museum at Courtland Center December 2018 06 (1963 Buick Silver Arrow).jpg|thumb|1963 Buick Silver Arrow concept car]]

In the late 1950s, GM lacked a [[personal luxury car]] to compete with the highly successful [[Ford Thunderbird]]—a uniquely styled, two-door that had dramatically increased in popularity when expanded from a two-seater to a four-passenger car. To fill this gap, an experimental [[Cadillac]] design, the '''XP-715''', was created, dubbed the "LaSalle" after a former GM luxury marque. Its angular look was reportedly inspired by GM styling chief [[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]]'s visit to [[London]] during the period, when he was struck by the sight of a custom-bodied [[Rolls-Royce car|Rolls Royce]]. He later said that "knife-edged" styling was what he wanted for the new model, but with a lower profile. The design itself was penned by stylist Ned Nickles.

When Cadillac passed on the venture in 1960 the project was thrown open for competition by the other GM Divisions. Buick, desperate to revive its flagging sales, won the competition by enlisting the aid of the [[McCann-Erickson]] advertising agency to create its presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://cardesignnews.com/articles/concept-car-of-the-week/2017/05/cadillac-personal-luxury-car-concepts |title=Cadillac Personal Luxury Car Concepts|website=Car Design News|access-date=23 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://automobilebrandsofthepast.blogspot.com/2013/07/1961-cadillac-la-salle-xp-715.html?m=1|title=1961 Cadillac LaSalle XP-715|website=Automobile Brands of the Past|access-date=23 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially referred to as the "Buick LaSalle" and later "Buick Riviera" concept cars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://gmphotostore.com/1963-buick-la-salle-concept-car-poster/ |title=1963 Buick La Salle Concept Car Poster |website=GMPhotoStore |accessdate=12 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://gmphotostore.com/1963-buick-riviera-show-car-poster/ |title=1963 Buick Riviera Show Car Poster|website=GMPhotoStore |accessdate=12 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lasallefront"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://gmphotostore.com/1963-buick-la-salle-concept-poster/ |title=1963 Buick La Salle Concept Poster  (front view) |website=GMPhotoStore |accessdate=12 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; the finished design was adapted to a shortened version of Buick's existing [[chassis|cruciform frame]]. It was again introduced as a concept car in 1963 called the Buick Riviera Silver Arrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z15603/Buick-Riviera-Silver-Arrow-I.aspx |title=1963 Buick Riviera Silver Arrow I |publisher=Conceptcarz |first=Daniel |last=Vaughan |date=September 2007 |accessdate=12 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production Riviera was introduced on October 4, 1962, as a 1963 model, its distinctive bodyshell was unique to the marque, unusual for a GM product. The design was substantially the same as the original, less expensively [[hidden headlights|hidden]] headlights concealed in the fender grilles.&lt;ref name="lasallefront" /&gt; The elegant ground-up styling sported the new "[[Coke bottle styling|Coke bottle look]]" introduced the year before on the arresting [[Studebaker Avanti]], with a tapered midsection surrounded by flaring fenders. There was no trace of the "[[Buick#Sweepspear|Sweepspear]]" used on [[Beltline (automotive)|beltline]]s of earlier Buicks with the Riviera package,

It rode a [[cruciform]] frame similar to the standard Buick frame, but shorter and narrower, with a {{convert|2.0|in|mm|abbr=on}} narrower track. Its [[wheelbase]] of {{convert|117|in|mm|abbr=on}} and overall length of {{convert|208|in|mm|abbr=on}} were {{convert|6.0|in|mm}} and {{convert|7.7|in|mm|abbr=on}} shorter, respectively, than a [[Buick LeSabre]], but slightly longer than a contemporary [[Ford Thunderbird (third generation)|Thunderbird]]. At {{convert|3998|lb|kg|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name= Flory2004&gt;{{citation |last= Flory| first= J. "Kelly", Jr.| title= American Cars 1960–1972 | publisher= McFarland | year= 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|210}} it was about {{convert|390|lb|kg}} lighter than either. It shared the standard [[Buick V8 engine]]s, with a displacement of either {{convert|401|cuin|L|abbr=on}} or {{convert|425|cuin|l|abbr=on}}, and the unique continuously variable design [[Dynaflow|twin turbine]] [[automatic transmission]]. Power brakes were standard, using Buick's massive "Al-Fin" ([[aluminum]] finned) drums of {{convert|12|in|mm|abbr=on}} diameter. [[Power steering]] was standard equipment, with an overall [[steering ratio]] of 20.5:1, giving 3.5 turns lock-to-lock.

The Riviera's [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] used Buick's standard design, with [[double wishbone suspension|double wishbones]] up front and a [[live axle]] located by [[trailing arm]]s and a lateral [[Panhard rod|track bar]] in the rear, but the [[roll center]]s were lowered to reduce body lean. Although its [[coil spring]]s were actually slightly softer than other Buicks, the Riviera's lighter weight made its ride somewhat firmer. While still biased towards [[understeer]], contemporary testers considered it one of the most driveable American cars, with an excellent balance of comfort and agility.

Buick's {{convert|325|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{convert|401|cuin|l|1|abbr=on}} "Nailhead" V-8 was initially the only available engine,&lt;ref name= Flory2004 /&gt;{{rp|204}} fitted with dual exhaust as standard equipment, and the turbine drive the only transmission.&lt;ref name= Flory2004 /&gt;{{rp|206}} Base price was $4,333,&lt;ref name= Flory2004 /&gt;{{rp|210}} running upwards of $5,000 delivered with typical options. Buick announced an optional {{convert|340|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|425|cuin|l|1|abbr=on}} version of the Nailhead in December 1962. Total production was deliberately limited to 40,000 vehicles (in a year that Buick sold 440,000 units overall) to emphasize the Riviera's exclusivity and to increase demand; only 2,601 were delivered with the delayed availability larger engine in the 1963 model year.

With the same power as the bigger Buicks and less weight, the Riviera had sparkling all-around performance: ''[[Motor Trend]]'' found it capable of running {{convert|0|-|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 8 seconds or less, the standing quarter mile in about 16 seconds, and an observed top speed of {{convert|115|mph|km/h}}. Fuel economy was a meager {{convert|13.2|mpgus }}. Front leg room was 40.1 inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1965_Buick/1965_Buick_Full_Line_Brochure/1965%20Buick%20Full%20Line-44.html |title=1965 Buick Full Line Brochure |page=44 |website= Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=12 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside, the Riviera featured a luxurious four-place cabin with front [[bucket seat]]s and bucket-style seats in the rear. A center console with floor shifter and storage compartment built into the instrument panel divided the front. Upholstery choices included all-vinyl, cloth and vinyl, or optional leather. A deluxe interior option included real walnut inserts on the doors and below the rear side windows. Extra-cost options included a tilt steering wheel, power windows, power driver's seat, air conditioning, a remote-controlled side view mirror, and white sidewall tires.

Minimal trim and mechanical changes were made for 1964, with the most identifiable distinguishing features being a raised stylized "R" hood emblem and "R" emblems replacing the Buick crests in the taillight lenses. The interior is distinguished by moving the heater controls from controls under the dashboard eyebrow to slide controls in the forward fairing of the center console. Leather was dropped as an option, and the [[Dynaflow]]-based twin turbine replaced by a new three-speed [[Super Turbine 400]]. This was a GM Turbo Hydra-Matic with a variable pitch torque converter like the Dynaflow's. It used a two speed "D,L" selector but could automatically downshift from third to second until the car reached a suitable speed to downshift to first. This was the first year of the stylized "R"] emblem, a trademark that would continue throughout the remainder of Riviera's 36-year production run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rivowners.org/features/evolution/images/64/64hood.jpg |title=Image of Riviera hood ornament |website=Riviera Owners Association |accessdate=12 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine was upgraded to the previously optional {{convert|340|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|425|cuin|l|1|abbr=on}} V8. A {{convert|360|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 'Super Wildcat' version was available, with dual Carter AFB four-barrel [[carburetor]]s.

[[File:1965 Buick Riviera (36637392513).jpg|thumb|left|1965 Riviera at Hastings, Minnesota Classic Car Show (2017)]]
In 1965 the {{convert|401|cuin|l|1|abbr=on}} V8 returned as the standard engine, and the "Gran Sport" version made its debut, powered by the Super Wildcat V8 and outfitted with a more aggressive 3.42 axle ratio and stiffer, heavy-duty suspension. The Super Turbine 400 transmission retained its variable pitch torque converter, but was fitted with a three-speed gear selector. The stock dual exhaust pipes were increased from {{convert|2.0|in|mm}} to {{convert|2.25|in|mm}} inside diameter and had fewer turns to reduce backpressure. Externally, the headlamps, now vertically arranged, were hidden behind clamshell doors in the leading edges of each fender, as had been in the original design. The non-functional side scoops between the doors and rear wheel arches were removed, and the taillights moved from the body into the rear bumper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rivowners.org/features/evolution/images/65/65-rear.jpg |title=Image of rear quarter of car|website=Riviera Owners Association |accessdate=12 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[vinyl roof]] became available as an option, initially offered only in black, and the tilt steering wheel optional in previous years was now standard equipment.

Total sales for the 1963–1965 model years was a respectable 112,244. The Riviera was extremely well received from all quarters and considered a great success, giving the Thunderbird its first real competition as America's preeminent [[personal luxury car]].

It has since earned Milestone status from the Milestone Car Society. [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] founder and designer [[William Lyons|Sir William Lyons]] remarked that Mitchell had done "a very wonderful job," and [[Sergio Pininfarina]] declared it "one of the most beautiful American cars ever built; it has marked a very impressive return to simplicity of American car design." At its debut at the [[Paris Motor Show|Paris Auto Show]], [[Raymond Loewy]] said the Riviera was the handsomest American production car—apart from his own [[Studebaker Avanti]], in his view the Riviera's only real competition for 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1963-1965 Buick Riviera |date=15 October 2007

The Riviera was redesigned for the 1966 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1966_Buick/1966_Buick_Riviera_Brochure/1966%20Buick%20Riviera-04.html |title=1966 Buick Riviera brochure  |website= Oldcarbrochures.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It retained its [[Vehicle frame#X-frame|cruciform X-frame]], powertrain, and brakes, but its curvaceous new body was longer, wider, and {{convert|200|lb|kg}} heavier. Vent windows, a feature GM had introduced in the 1930s, were absent. Headlamps remained concealed, but now pivoted behind the grille when not in use, and they were once again horizontally arranged. The car's added bulk slowed acceleration with the unchanged 425 engine. The Gran Sport package remained available as an option. Rear seat belts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1966_Buick/1966_Buick_Riviera_Brochure/1966%20Buick%20Riviera-11.html |title=1966 Buick Riviera brochure |page= 11 |website=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and AM/FM radio&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1967_Buick/1967_Buick_Riviera_Owners_Manual/1967%20Buick%20Riviera%20Manual%20Page%2018.html |page= 18 |title=1967 Buick Riviera Owners Manual |website=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; were optional.

The new front wheel drive [[Oldsmobile Toronado]] shared the Riviera platform, and, a year later, the also front wheel drive [[Cadillac Eldorado]]; however, the Riviera itself retained the rear wheel drive layout.

Inside, the four-place cabin with front and rear bucket seats and center console was replaced by a choice of bucket seats or conventional bench seats as standard equipment, making the Riviera a full six-passenger car for the first time. Optionally available was a Strato-bench seat with armrest or Strato bucket seats with either a short consolette or a full-length operating console with a "horseshoe" shaped floor shifter and storage compartment. Both the buckets and Strato-bench seat were available with a reclining seat option for the passenger's side. Sales for 1966 rebounded to 45,308, a new record.

The most significant change for 1967 was Buick's replacement of its venerable 425 "Nailhead" with an entirely new {{convert|430|cuin|L|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine|V8]]. Its {{convert|360|hp|kW}} and {{convert|475|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque were a performance improvement. Gasoline mileage improved slightly, but remained low. Powerful [[disc brake]]s with Bendix four-piston calipers became optional for the front wheels but most Riviera continued to be ordered with Buick's highly capable ribbed aluminum brake drums. Cosmetically, changes were few, and were limited to the addition of a wide, full-width, center-mounted horizontal chrome grille bar that stretched over the headlight doors and outboard parking lights. Sales eased to 42,799 for the 1967 model year. The Riviera had full instrumentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1967_Buick/1967_Buick_Riviera_Owners_Manual/1967%20Buick%20Riviera%20Manual%20Page%2029.html |page= 29|title=1967 Buick Riviera Owners Manual |website= Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1967 saw the introduction of U.S. mandated safety equipment to improve occupant protection during a crash, including an energy-absorbing steering column, non-protruding control knobs, 4-way hazard flasher, soft interior surfaces, locking seat backs (on 2-door models), a dual-circuit hydraulic braking system (with warning light), and shoulder belt anchors. The Rivieras complied on all counts and featured the full range of safety features.

1968 models had reshaped loop-type bumpers that surrounded both the vehicle's recessed crosshatch front grille and tail lamps. Hidden wiper arms made their debut. Federally mandated side marker lights appeared, as inverted trapezoids on the lower leading edges of the front fenders, and circular in the rear. The interior was restyled and for the first time shared its instrument panel with the other full-size Buick models. Shoulder belts for front outboard occupants were made standard on all cars built from January 1, 1968.  Mechanically, the transmission lost its variable pitch torque converter. A tilt steering wheel was standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1968_Buick/1968%20Buick%20Riviera/image8.html |website=oldcarbrochures.com |title=1968 Buick Riviera brochure |page=15 |accessdate=12 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales set another new record in 1968, as 49,284 units were sold.

Minor styling changes took place again in 1969, with grilles gaining a pattern of finely spaced, slim vertical bars overlaid by two wider horizontal bars, which jutted forward at their inboard edges. Front marker lights became far shorter, and square. Inside, front outboard passengers received new headrests. The ignition switch was moved from the instrument panel to the steering column, and locked the steering wheel and selector lever when the key was removed (a security feature which became mandatory for the 1970 model year). Chrome side trim was revised, as well. At the rear, the reverse lights moved from the rear bumper to new three-section tail-light lenses. Sales for 1969 improved again, to 52,872.

The 1970 Riviera was restyled. Exposed quad headlamps were nearly flush-mounted, while the new front bumper wrapped around and over the new vertical bar grille, set between the headlamp pods. A newly optional side trim feature accented the large coupe's flowing lines. Skirted rear wheels became standard, with exposed wheels an option. At the rear, a new rear bumper/taillight motif was seen. The engine was upgraded to {{convert|455|cuin|L|abbr=on}}, the largest engine Buick offered to date, rated at {{convert|370|hp|kW}} gross, {{convert|245|hp|kW|abbr=on}} net, and over {{convert|500|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque. Despite the fact that 1970 sales dropped to 37,366, the second-generation Riviera proved more successful than the first, with 227,669 units sold over five the years.

[[File:Buick Riviera GS Heck.jpg|thumb|left|1973 Buick Riviera GS rear]]
The Riviera was radically redesigned for the 1971 model year with flowing and dramatic "boat-tail" styling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.musclecarclub.com/musclecars/buick-riviera/images/buick-riviera-1973a.jpg|title=Muscle Car Club|url-status=dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20030124110238/http://musclecarclub.com/musclecars/buick-riviera/images/buick-riviera-1973a.jpg|archivedate=2003-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed under [[Bill Mitchell (automobile designer)|Bill Mitchell's]] direction, it was penned by [[Jerry Hirshberg]], future head of design for [[Nissan]], mating the two-piece [[Custom car#Language|vee-butted]]&lt;ref name= Flory2004 /&gt;{{rp|792}} [[fastback]] rear window, inspired by the 1963 [[Chevrolet Corvette (C2)|Corvette Sting Ray]] split window coupe, to the Riviera's platform.

The design was originally intended for the smaller [[GM A platform]] (which Buick eventually assigned to the [[Buick Century|Century]] and [[Buick Regal|Regal]] in 1973), and the use of the Riviera's body&amp;mdash;expanded for 1971 by {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}} in wheelbase and more than {{convert|120|lb|kg|abbr=on}} heavier&amp;mdash;produced controversial looks, which made it a sharp departure from those of the Toronado and Eldorado. (''Collectible Automobile'' ran an article about 1971–76 full-sized Buicks in which one sketch design for their 2-door coupes which was rejected resembled the 1971–73 Riviera).

This generation introduced a much more visual representation of the "[[Buick#Sweepspear|sweepspear]]", with a more faithful representation to the version that appeared on 1950s Buicks in both the side molding and [[Beltline (automotive)|beltline]].

The 455 engine had a lower [[compression ratio]] to meet [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] emissions requirements, reducing power to {{Convert|255|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, with {{Convert|265|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in the Gran Sport. Performance remained reasonably brisk, with a 0–60 time of 8.1 seconds for the GS, but the Riviera's sporty image was rapidly fading. One noteworthy advance was Buick's '''Max Trac''' [[limited-slip differential]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1971_Buick/1971_Buick_Riviera_Brochure/1971%20Buick%20Riviera%20Brochure-05.html |title= 1971 Buick Riviera Brochure |page= 5|website= Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1971 Riviera also features GM's "Full-Flo" ventilation system and two large deck lid louvers are prominent on the trunk lid.

Despite these features, Riviera sales for 1971 dropped to 33,810,&lt;ref name= Flory2004 /&gt;{{rp|798}} the lowest to date. The 1972 Riviera was little changed, with the 455 engine switching to net power ratings, {{convert|225|hp|kW|abbr=on}} or {{convert|250|hp|kW|abbr=on}} with the Gran Sport, although the actual drop in net power was only {{convert|5|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. Sales remained moribund at 33,728.&lt;ref name= Flory2004 /&gt;{{rp|876}} 

The 1972 models featured a redesigned ventilation system and the louvers were removed from trunk lid.

For 1973, the {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine became standard, with {{convert|260|hp|kW|abbr=on}} with the '''Stage One''' package, which also included a limited slip [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] and a chrome-plated air cleaner. The "Gran Sport" package was still available as a separate option package consisting of a ride-and-handling package that included a rear stabilizer bar, JR78-15 whitewall steel-belted radial tires, a specially tuned "radial roadability" suspension, additional sound insulation and special "Gran Sport" badging. Sluggish sales of the third generation Riviera led GM to believe that the boattail deck lid was too radical for most customers' tastes, so in 1973 it was blunted and made slightly shorter. The design change however only led to a marginal increase in sales, with 34,080 being produced for the model year.

Although carrying over the same platform, mechanicals, and some body panels seen on the "Third Generation" Riviera, Buick replaced its distinctive 'boat tail' roofline with a more conventional-looking "Colonnade" treatment which was more in line with its [[Buick LeSabre|LeSabre]] and [[Buick Electra|Electra]] brethren than its front-wheel drive cousins. This turned the car from a [[hardtop|hardtop coupe]] into a [[coupe|pillared coupe]], as it featured wide B pillars and fixed quarter [[opera window]]s. A [[vinyl roof|landau half-vinyl roof]] option was available. The car did retain its forward-jutting grille, albeit in slightly modified form. Thus modified, the car looked far less distinctive than its predecessors, and even its platform mates, the [[Oldsmobile Toronado]] and [[Cadillac Eldorado]]. The tamer-looking Riviera was no lighter, and its standard 455 V8 lost more power, dropping to {{convert|230|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|245|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for standard and Stage One models, respectively. Max Trac was dropped from the option list after 1974 due to lack of buyer interest. The revised styling did nothing for sales, which plummeted to 20,129 in 1974. This generation introduced as a novelty what later became a federal mandate in a modified form, two high-mounted taillights above the trunk and below the rear window, which was shared on its platform twin the Toronado.

For 1975, the Riviera received an updated front fascia, which lost its forward-jutting theme through the redesign of the fiberglass front end cap. Quad rectangular headlights were mounted horizontally. The new vertical-bar grille echoed the "stand-up" theme that many GM cars of the day incorporated. Parking lights wrapped around the fender sides. The Stage One performance package was dropped for 1975, though the Gran Sport handling package would continue to be offered. The standard engine's output dipped to {{convert|205|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Sales for 1975 were 17,306.

Minor changes greeted 1976 models, the most notable of which was a new crosshatch grille insert. The Gran Sport handling package was replaced by an 'S/R' package that had similar sporting pretensions. Sales rallied slightly to 20,082 for 1976.&lt;ref name="production"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rivowners.org/features/productn.html |title=Riviera Production Numbers |publisher=Riviera Owners Association |accessdate=2007-03-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307022310/http://www.rivowners.org/features/productn.html |archivedate=2007-03-07 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1978 Buick Riviera rear.png|thumb|left|1978 Buick Riviera rear]]
Buick downsized the Riviera for 1977 onto the new smaller [[GM B platform]]. While the other E-bodies were front wheel drive since 1966 (1967 for Cadillac's Eldorado), the Buick E platform used a rear-wheel-drive B-body undercarriage (along with the cruciform frame of pre-1965 GMs for the 1966–70 generation). All B-bodies (including C and D platform GM RWDs) were downsized for the 1977 model year which prompted the short-lived 1977/78 generation.

It was, in most respects, a [[Buick LeSabre]] coupe with unique styling (with quarter windows mimicking the 1975–78 Cadillac Eldorado). Unlike its LeSabre counterpart, the front fascia is vertical as opposed to slanted. It was reduced to a wheelbase of {{convert|115.9|in|mm|abbr=on}}, down {{convert|6.1|in|mm|abbr=on}}, and an overall length of {{convert|218.2|in|mm|abbr=on}}, down {{convert|4.8|in|mm|abbr=on}}. Weight dropped some {{convert|660|lb|kg}}. The 455 was gone, replaced by a {{convert|350|cuin|L|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine]] with {{convert|155|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} or [[Oldsmobile V8 engine|Oldsmobile-built {{convert|403|cuin|L|abbr=on}}]] with {{convert|185|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. California models had a {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#350|Oldsmobile 350]].&lt;ref name="Evolution"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rivowners.org/features/evolution/index.html |title=Evolution of the Riviera |publisher=Riviera Owners Association |accessdate=2007-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sales were up modestly to 26,138 for 1977 and then fell to 20,535 for 1978,&lt;ref name="production"/&gt; although this was strictly a stopgap model until the all-new [[GM E platform|E-body]] cars would be ready for 1979. To date, 1977 and 1978 Rivieras are considered a rare find since it was only produced for two model years on the downsized GM B platform before the 1979 redesign on the FWD E-platform (there are two reasons why the B-platform was used—the existing 1976 B-platform was phased out for the downsized variant where RWD E-platform vehicles were produced on the B-chassis. Buick could have continued production although the frame stamping facilities and undercarriage/chassis components were being retooled in late 1976 for downsized B-platform production where the FWD E-platform did not downsize since they were produced on a separate assembly line.

Also, with Buick dropping its 455 V8 after 1976, continuing the '77–78 Riviera on the old E-body platform would have forced Buick to either downsize its engine compartment to their 350 V8, which was too small and underpowered for a 5,000-pound car—or "import" larger engines from other GM divisions including 400s from Chevrolet and Pontiac, Oldsmobile's 403 or Cadillac's 425—each of which would have limited sales and production as each division gave first priority to its own vehicles before selling engines to other divisions.

===75th Anniversary Package===
For 1978, a special "LXXV" edition was released to commemorate Buick's 75th anniversary on the market. Production total was 2,889 and included special silver &amp; black paint with gray leather seats with black trim, four-wheel disc brakes, brushed chrome trim, deep pile carpeting and special LXXV name plates.

The 1979 model year was the debut of the first [[front wheel drive]] Riviera, which was also the first front-drive production model in Buick history. Built on a {{convert|114|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase, it once again shared its mechanical design and [[GM E platform|platform]] with the [[Cadillac Eldorado]] and [[Oldsmobile Toronado]]. The Olds 403 and Buick 350 were dropped, but the Olds 350 remained, as did a new [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[Buick V6 engine|Buick]] [[V6]] of {{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} displacement with {{Convert|185|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The Riviera became ''[[Motor Trend]]''{{'s}} [[Car of the Year]]. Sales more than doubled, to 52,181 for 1979 and 48,621 for the similar 1980 models.&lt;ref name="Evolution"/&gt;

[[File:1984 Riviera Convertible.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of 1984 Riviera convertible]]
1981 saw the Turbo renamed '''[[T-Type]]''' and the demise of the 350 engine in favor of the [[Oldsmobile V8 engine|Oldsmobile-built {{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] with {{Convert|140|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} (phased in during the 1980 MY). The standard engine was now Buick's {{convert|125|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|252|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V6]], and a new option was an Oldsmobile [[diesel engine]] with a mere {{convert|105|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} offered through 1985. 1982 also saw the first-ever Riviera [[convertible (car)|convertible]], although relatively few were built, owing to a high price - US$23,944. The Riviera convertible was available in only two color choices-white or red firemist with the only interior color of red leather. A [[:File:Indypacecar1983.jpg|twin-turbocharged Riviera convertible]] was chosen to be the pace car at the 1983 [[Indianapolis 500]], tuned to produce {{convert|410|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=specialed&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Special Edition Coupes – 1983 Buick Riviera, 1985 Ford Thunderbird | url = https://www.hemmings.com/blog/article/special-edition-coupes-1983-buick-riviera-1985-ford-thunderbird/ | magazine = Hemmings | last = Traver Adolphus | first = David | date = September 2012 | publisher = American City Business Journals }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most convertible Rivieras had the [[V8 engine]], which saw an increase in rated SAE net HP to 150 for both convertibles and coupes fitted with it from 1982 through the 1985 model year.

In 1983 a special edition of 500 "Riviera XX" were offered, celebrating twenty years since the introduction of the first Riviera (502 were built in the end). These have a special two-tone paintjob, real wire wheels, a leather and walnut interior, and [[Fineness#Karat|24-karat]] gold plated "Riviera XX" badging.&lt;ref name=specialed/&gt; The Riviera XX also received a special grille, which then became part of the 1984 model year facelift model.&lt;ref name=specialed/&gt; Overall sales made the 1980s Riviera a great success, reaching 65,305 for the 1985 model year.&lt;ref name="production"/&gt;

The [[GM E platform|E-body]] coupes were converted to [[Monocoque|unibody construction]] and further downsized for 1986 to a {{convert|108|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase similar in length to that of the [[Buick Regal]]. The [[V6]] was now the only engine, rated initially at {{convert|142|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} SAE and {{convert|200|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque. It used the Turbo-[[Hydramatic]] 440-T4 [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] with a 2.84:1 final drive ratio.

This generation was noted for advanced electronic instrumentation displayed on a dash-mounted {{convert|9|in|mm|adj=on}} CRT. The CRT controlled the vehicle's climate control system and stereo, and also supplied advanced instrumentation such as a [[trip computer]] and maintenance reminder feature. Four-wheel disc brakes were standard. With a choice of three suspension packages available, up to the performance oriented FE3 setting, handling was notably improved. The Riviera placed fourth for ''[[Motor Trend]]''{{'}}s 1986 Car of the Year contest.

[[File:Buick Riviera -- 07-23-2009.jpg|thumb|left|1989–1993 Buick Riviera]]

Fuel economy was notably improved for the 1986 Riviera, but the investment in the downsized, [[transverse engine]] front wheel drive platform resulted in a substantial price increase, to $19,831 to the base model and $21,577 for the new [[T-Type]]. Downsizing also resulted in a dimensional similarity to smaller, less expensive offerings from GM. The smaller dimensions, generic styling, and lack of a V8 led to sales plummeting to 22,138 for 1986, only 15,223 for 1987, and a dismal 8,625 for 1988. 1988 also saw the introduction of Buick's new Reatta coupe which cannibalized some sales from the Riviera.

A restyle for 1989 that added {{convert|11|in|mm}} to the overall length (on an unchanged wheelbase) helped, but only incrementally, boosting sales to 21,189 for 1989, but dropping to a low of 4,555 for 1993, the abbreviated final model year of that model.&lt;ref name="production"/&gt; The last 1993 Riviera rolled off the [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly]] plant line on December 10, 1992.

After a hiatus in 1994, the Riviera returned in 1995 with radical styling that departed from the previous generations' traditional image. A {{convert|205|hp|abbr=on}} [[naturally aspirated]] 3800 V6 was standard, with a [[supercharger|supercharged]] version rated at {{Convert|225|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|275|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} available as an option. Rivieras were now built in [[Lake Orion, Michigan]], riding the same Cadillac-derived [[GM G platform (FWD)|G platform]] as the 4-door [[Oldsmobile Aurora]]. The first of 41,422 Rivieras made in 1995 rolled off the assembly line on May 23, 1994.

In 1996, supercharged versions saw an increase in power to {{Convert|240|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and 280&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (380 N·m), as well as the 4T60E-HD transmission. 18,036 Rivieras were manufactured in 1996.

1997 saw suspension revisions, removing excess weight. An upgraded [[GM 4T65E-HD transmission#4T65E-HD|4T65E-HD transmission]] featuring a larger {{Convert|258|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} [[torque converter]] and heavy-duty [[gearbox]] were added. 18,827 were made in 1997.

For 1998, the {{convert|240|hp|abbr=on}} supercharged V6 became standard. GM's [[OnStar]] service was added as an option, along with minor interior design changes. 10,953 units were produced for 1998.

With sales of all coupes declining in the North American market, GM decided to discontinue the Riviera. 1999 was the car's last model year with production of 1,956 cars ceasing on November 25, 1998. The final 200 cars had special silver paint and trim, and were denoted "Silver Arrow"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rivowners.org/silver.html |title=Special Report |website=Riviera Owners Association |accessdate=12 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; models, a designation which hearkened back to several Silver Arrow show cars that had been built off Riviera bodies by [[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]].

Eighth-generation Rivieras received the most powerful V-6 Buick engine since the [[Buick Grand National|Grand Nationals]] of the 1980s. The supercharged [[Overhead valve|OHV]] [[V6]] gave impressive [[torque]] and acceleration, pushing the car from 0 to {{convert|60|mph|km/h}} in under 7 seconds, and turning the {{frac|1|4}} mile in 15.5 seconds. Supercharged Rivieras achieved a fuel efficiency figure of 18/27 (city/highway mpg).

The '''Buick LeSabre''' was a [[full-size]] car made by General Motors from 1959 to 2005.  Prior to 1959, this position had been retained by the full-size [[Buick Special]] model (1936–58). The name originated with the 1951 GM [[Le Sabre concept car|Le Sabre]] show car designed by [[Harley Earl]]; that car is often mistakenly attributed to the [[Buick]] division but in fact it was presented as a GM vehicle without reference to a specific GM division.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Buick closely related their 1956-1957 models to the GM LeSabre by replicating the top section of the rear wing into their design.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}. ''LeSabre'' is French for "the [[sabre]]".

==History of model==
The LeSabre nameplate made its first appearance on the 1951 [[Le Sabre concept car|Le Sabre]] [[Concept vehicle|show car]],&lt;ref&gt;Flory,  J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1946-1959'' (Jefferson, NC:  McFarland &amp; Coy, 2008), p.1021.&lt;/ref&gt; which introduced the world to aircraft-inspired design elements such as the wrap-around windshield and tail fins. There is a V12 for the Buick LeSabre (5.00L) which originated in 1953. In 1959 LeSabre became the new moniker for what had previously been known as the [[Buick Special]]. The '''Buick LeSabre''' was offered in a full line of body styles except between 1965-1969 when its [[station wagon]] variant was dropped from Buick's full-size offerings. In 1977, the LeSabre was downsized along with other GM full-size models, and was available only in pillared coupe, sedan and wagon body styles.

In addition to being Buick's entry level vehicle, the LeSabre was consistently Buick's best selling full-size car. Of the four nameplates introduced in 1959 (LeSabre, Invicta, Electra, Electra 225), the LeSabre nameplate lasted the longest.

[[File:Shobuza 2 LeSabre.jpg|thumb|1959 Buick LeSabre, formerly owned by the late king of [[Swaziland]], [[Sobhuza II]]. Photographed at the Sobhuza II Memorial Park in [[Lobamba]].]]
From 1959 to 1961, the LeSabre was powered by a 364 cubic-inch [[V8 engine|V8]], which was smaller than the 401 cubic-inch V8 used in the more expensive Invicta and Electra models. The 364, which was previously used in all Buicks in 1957 and 1958, was rated at {{convert|250|hp}} in standard form with an "economy" {{convert|235|hp}} version offered as a "no cost" option in 1960-61 and an optional power-pack version with four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts that was rated at {{convert|300|hp}}. For 1962-63, the LeSabre came standard with a two-barrel carbureted version of the 401 V8 rated at {{convert|280|hp}}, or a no-cost "economy" low-compression version rated at {{convert|260|hp}}.  Starting in 1964, all LeSabre models except the Estate Wagon shared their drivetrains with the midsize Buick models by switching to those models' smaller-displacement V8s at least as standard equipment for the next few years with cubic-inch displacements of 300 (1964–65), 340 (1966–67) and 350 (1968–76). A large-displacement would not reappear in a LeSabre until 1970 when a 455 cubic-inch V8 was introduced as an option and was offered through 1976. Beginning with the downsized 1977 models and continuing through three subsequent generations of front-drive LeSabres introduced in 1986, 1992 and 2000, Buick's 3.8-liter (231 cubic-inch)V6 would become the standard engine for most LeSabre models and V8 engines were dropped (except in station wagons) after the last of the rear-drive LeSabre sedans and coupes came off the line in 1985.

For most years from 1959 to 1971, a three-speed manual transmission was standard equipment on all LeSabres but rarely ordered. Far more popular was the Turbine Drive automatic transmission (previously known as Dynaflow) along with power steering and power brakes. For 1961 and 1962, the automatic transmission was standard on the LeSabre and all other full-sized Buicks but in 1963 was moved back to the option list on LeSabres. For 1964, the Dynaflow-based Turbine Drive was replaced by two new automatic transmissions, the two-speed [[Super Turbine 300]] and the three-speed [[Super Turbine 400]]. A four-speed [[manual transmission]] was offered as a LeSabre option from 1963 to 1965 but only a small number of cars were so equipped. Automatic transmissions would once again reappear as standard equipment on LeSabres in mid-1971 and continue in such form until the model line's demise after 2005.

LeSabres were rear-drive six-passenger vehicles from 1959 to 1985 (station wagons through 1990) featuring separate body-on-frame construction along with a longitudinally mounted front engine. The first downsized generation of LeSabres introduced in 1977 retained the rear-drive and body-on-frame construction, while the later-generation models introduced in 1986 switched to front-wheel-drive, unit-body construction and transversely mounted engine. Convertibles were offered each year through 1975 while two- and four-door hardtops were dropped after 1976 and only pillared body styles were offered from 1977 to 2005. Station wagons were offered through 1964 and then dropped for several years until being reintroduced in 1970 and continued until 1990 after which year they were moved to the revived [[Buick Roadmaster|Roadmaster]] series. LeSabres come in two versions: Custom and Limited.

'''1959'''

LeSabre and all other 1959 Buicks not only got new names, but all-new styling as well, adopting the new GM B- and C-body used on all of the corporation's full-sized cars (the larger C-body used in the Electra as well as the Oldsmobile 98 and all Cadillacs was basically a stretched out B-body rather than a distinct body and chassis for 1959–60). Wheelbases increased by one inch on all models. The new styling included slanted headlights in front along with a chromey square grille somewhat similar to the 1958 Buick and "Delta-wing" fins back along with round taillights. The appearance was shared with two other Buick models, the mid-level [[Buick Invicta|Invicta]] and the top model [[Buick Electra|Electra]]. 
[[File:Buick Le Sabre Convertible ar.jpg|thumb|left|1959 Buick LeSabre convertible]]
While Invicta and Electra/225 models were powered by Buick's new 401-cubic-inch V8, LeSabre continued with the 364-cubic-inch V8 previously used in all Buicks in 1957 and 1958. In standard form, the engine delivered 250 horsepower with a two-barrel carburetor and 10.25 to 1 compression ratio (with Dynaflow transmission; manual transmission cars had a lower 8.5 to 1 compression ratio but horsepower was still rated at 250). Optionally available was a four-barrel version of the 364 rated at 300 horsepower. A three-speed manual transmission was standard on LeSabre but most cars were built with the optional two-speed Dynaflow automatic transmission that was standard equipment on the Invicta and Electra/225. A three-speed "Triple Turbine" Dynaflow variant was also available. Power steering and power brakes were optional and all 1959 Buicks used the unique 12-inch finned aluminum brake drums for improved stopping power that were originally introduced on the 1957 Roadmaster.

'''1960'''
[[File:Buick Le Sabre 1960 at Schaffen-Diest.JPG|thumb|left|1960 Buick LeSabre Two-Door Hardtop]]
The 1960 LeSabre received a major facelift, the new body design sharing only the roof and trunk lid with the 1959 model. The new Buick now sported a concave grille and horizontal headlights centered by Buick's then-new "Tri-Shield" logo, which is still in use today. Reintroduced to Electras and other Buicks for 1960 were the chrome "[[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPort]]" portholes first introduced in 1940 and last seen in 1957.  LeSabre and Invicta models had three portholes while Electras and Electra 225s were "four-holers".

Inside, a revised instrument panel featured a "Mirromatic" speedometer for which the lens could be adjusted to better visibility to suit the driver. A new two-spoke steering wheel with horn bars was introduced, replacing the time-honored horn ring then still common to most automobiles. The 250- and 300-horsepower 364-cubic-inch V8s were continued from 1959, but a new no-cost option was a 235-horsepower lower-compression two-barrel version of the 364 with a lower compression ratio to permit use of regular-grade gasoline instead of the premium fuel required with all other Buick engines.

'''1961'''
[[File:Buick LeSabre (1).jpg|thumb|left|1961 Buick LeSabre]]
LeSabre and all other full-sized Buicks (joined by the compact Special this year) were completely restyled for 1961 featuring finless rear ends, more restrained use of chrome, and boxier sheetmetal. Wheelbases remained at {{Convert|123|in|mm}} but the new cars were slightly downsized in both length and width, and rode on a new X-frame chassis which included a conventional rear axle and driveshaft replacing the decades-old torque tube design.

Inside were revised instrument panels retaining the "Mirrormatic" speedometer and new upholstery trims. The Station Wagons received an all-vinyl interior as standard, with the regular cloth/vinyl combination interior available as an option.&lt;ref name="buick"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Standard Catalog of Buick, 1903-2004 (3rd ed.) | author = John Gunnell | publisher = Krause Publications, Inc. | location = Iola, WI | pages = 106–107 | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-87349-760-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engines were unchanged from previous years including the standard 250-horsepower 364-cubic-inch V8, no-cost regular fuel 235-horsepower 364 or the four-barrel 300-horsepower option of same engine available at extra cost. The two-speed Turbine Drive Dynaflow automatic transmission was standard equipment on LeSabres and all other full-sized Buicks this year, although a manual transmission was also available.&lt;ref name="buick"/&gt;

'''1962'''

The 1962 Buick LeSabre was only moderately changed from the previous year with bodies taking on a few extra inches to give them a longer look along with new grilles and taillights. Two-door hardtop coupes received a new convertible-like roofline complete with simulated bows.

Under the hood, the 364 cubic-inch V8 was replaced by the larger 401 cubic-inch V8 used in Invictas and Electra 225s. LeSabres came standard with a two-barrel high-compression (10.25 to 1) version rated at 280 horsepower with a low-compression regular fuel version of that same engine rated at 265 horsepower offered as a no-cost option. Optional at extra cost was the four-barrel 325-horsepower 401 which was standard on the Invicta, Electra 225 and the mid-year Invicta-based [[Buick Wildcat|Wildcat]] coupe.

Inside, interiors were mildly revised with the "Mirrormatic" speedometer replaced by a conventional horizontal sweep unit.

'''1963'''
[[File:1963 Buick Le Sabre 4469.jpg|thumb|left|1963 Buick LeSabre four-door sedan]]
The 1963 LeSabre received a major facelift with even boxier body contours than 1961-62 models and revised rooflines on four-door hardtop sedans.

Inside was a new instrument panel with round instruments shared with other big Buicks and the new personal-luxury Riviera coupe. New options this year included a seven-position tilt steering wheel/column, AM/FM radio and Electro-Cruise control.

The same assortment of 401-cubic-inch V8s was carried over from 1962 but the three-speed manual transmission returned as standard equipment with the two-speed Turbine Drive automatic reverted to the option list. A new and rarely ordered option this year was a floor-mounted four-speed manual transmission.

{{clear_left}}
'''1964'''

[[File:1964 Buick LeSabre Custom hb.jpg|thumb|left|1964 LeSabre Custom Sedan, rear view]]
Minor facelifting with new grille and horizontal taillights replacing the 1963's vertical units highlighted the 1964 LeSabre. A somewhat better equipped "Custom" version also joined the lineup this year, easily identifiable by its full length chrome side molding with a brushed metal insert. The regular LeSabre had a narrow trim piece on the rear third of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Gunnell, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the hood, the 401-cubic-inch V8 was replaced in LeSabre sedans and coupes by a smaller 300-cubic-inch V8 designed for the upsized Special/Skylark intermediates that replaced the aluminum V8 in those vehicles. In standard form, the 300 was rated at 210 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and 9 to 1 compression ratio for use of regular fuel. Optionally available was a 250-horsepower version of the same engine with four-barrel carburetor and higher 11 to 1 compression ratio mandating the use of premium fuel. The LeSabre Estate Wagon came standard with the larger 325-horsepower 401 V8 from the Wildcat and Electra 225 models.

Replacing the old Dynaflow-based two-speed automatic transmission were two new Super Turbine automatics. The two-speed Super Turbine 300 (shared with the intermediate-sized cars) was available with the standard two-barrel 300 V8 while the three-speed Super Turbine 400 (shared with other big Buicks and Rivieras) was standard with the 300 four-barrel and optional with the standard engine as well as the 401 in the Estate Wagon. The standard transmission with the base 300 two-barrel V8 was a three-speed column shift manual and a four-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] was available as an option with either engine. The new ST300 transmission carried over the variable pitch torque converter from the Dynaflow that had been used since the mid-1950s, while the first year for the ST400 featured a fixed-pitch converter.

Inside, only minor trim/upholstery revisions were made.

'''1965'''

LeSabre and other full-sized Buicks were completely restyled for the 1965 model year, featuring more rounded bodylines and Coke-bottle profiles with semi-fastback rooflines on two-door hardtop coupes. Wheelbases remained at {{Convert|123|in|mm}}, but a new perimeter frame shared with other GM B-body cars replaced the "X" frame used since 1961. Body styles were unchanged from 1964 except for the station wagon, which was dropped in favor of the stretched intermediate Special-based [[Buick Sport Wagon]] which featured a raised rear roof and glass skylight over the back seat similar to the [[Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser]].

Starting in 1965, the LeSabre was available in two [[trim package|trim levels]], the base LeSabre and the LeSabre Custom, which featured a more luxurious interior trim and also included the convertible body style not available in the base LeSabre line.

[[File:1965 Buick LeSabre convertible in blue, front left.jpg|thumb|left|1965 Buick LeSabre Convertible]]
Interiors were also new for 1965 with a revised instrument panel featuring two round dials nearly identical with the Riviera for speedometer and other instruments much like the 1963–64 models along with new heating/air conditioning controls.

Drivetrains were unchanged from 1964 with the 250-horsepower two-barrel carbureted 300-cubic-inch V8 the standard powerplant on all models with a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional four-speed manual or two-speed Super Turbine 300 automatic. Available at extra cost with the new LeSabre "400" package was the 250-horsepower 300-cubic-inch V8 with four-barrel carburetion and 10.25 to 1 compression which required premium fuel, compared to the standard two-barrel engine that used regular fuel. The 400 package also included the more desirable Super Turbine "400" three-speed automatic transmission also found in Buick's higher-priced Wildcat, Electra 225 and Riviera models.

Buick's engine–transmission practice was similar to that of GM's Chevrolet Division, which at that time only offered  the two-speed [[Powerglide]] automatic with most of its engine offerings in full-sized vehicles, requiring buyers who preferred the similar three-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] (basically the same transmission under a different name) to order one of the larger V8 engines. Both Pontiac and Oldsmobile offered the Turbo Hydra-Matic on all of their full-sized cars with any engine offering, and three-speed automatics were also the norm on big cars from GM's medium-priced competitors such as the [[Chrysler Newport]] and [[Mercury Monterey]], which offered the [[TorqueFlite]] and [[Cruise-O-Matic]] transmissions, respectively.

'''1966'''
[[File:3rd Buick LeSabre sedan front -- 08-29-2009.jpg|thumb|left|1966 Buick LeSabre 4-Door Hardtop]]
New grilles and four-segmented taillights highlighted the facelifted 1966 LeSabre models. Also new was a revised instrument panel with a horizontal sweep speedometer replacing the round pod instruments and new interior door handles. Both base and Custom level series were continued. New standard safety features included a padded instrument panel, outside driver-side rear view mirror and backup lights.

Under the hood, the 300-cubic-inch V8 was replaced by a larger 340-cubic-inch V8 rated at 220 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and available with either a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional two-speed automatic, but the four-speed manual was dropped from the option list. Ordering the LeSabre 400 option upgraded the buyer to a 260-horsepower 340 with four-barrel carburetor and higher 10.25 to 1 compression ratio along with the three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic found in the larger engine Wildcat, Electra 225 and Riviera.


'''1967'''
[[File:'67 Buick LeSabre Coupe (A&amp;W St-Léonard '10).JPG|thumb|left|1967 Buick LeSabre Sport Coupe]]

Somewhat more rounded sheet metal and a swoopier fastback roofline for the two-door hardtop highlighted the 1967 LeSabre but chassis and inner body were unchanged along with drivetrains. Both base and Custom-level LeSabres were continued.

New options for 1967 included front disc brakes and a stereo 8-track tape player. The standard drum brakes were upgraded with more cooling fins and a dual-master cylinder system was introduced.

Engine and transmission offerings were unchanged from 1966.
{{-}}
'''1968'''
[[File:Buick LeSabre 1.jpg|thumb|left|1968 Buick LeSabre Custom Convertible]]
The 1968 LeSabre received a minor facelift including new grilles and taillights along with concealed windshield wipers. Inside was a revised instrument panel with square speedometer surrounded by other instruments with minor trim revisions for both base and Custom models.

A new 350-cubic-inch V8 replaced the previous 340. In standard form the 350 V8 delivered 230 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and 9 to 1 compression ratio and came with a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional two-speed Super Turbine 300 automatic. The "LeSabre 400" option package included a 280-horsepower 350 four-barrel V8 with 10.25 to 1 compression and three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic transmission. The "Switch-Pitch" torque converter used in conjunction with the Super Turbine automatic transmission was discontinued in favor of a standard torque converter.
{{-}}
'''1969'''
[[File:'69 Buick LeSabre (Cruisin' At The Boardwalk '10).jpg|thumb|left|1969 Buick LeSabre Custom 4-door Hardtop]]
The 1969 LeSabre received new sheetmetal with more squared off styling than the 1965-68 models including a formal roofline on coupes replacing the semi-fastback of previous years. Though the 1969 model was extensively restyled with new sheetmetal, the basic 1965 chassis and inner body structure were retained, along with the roofline of the four-door pillared sedans though vent windows were dropped on all models. Wheelbase remained at {{Convert|123|in|mm}}.
Interiors were mildly revised with minor changes to the instrument panel including the movement of the heating/air conditioning controls to the left of the steering wheel, which was new this year. Headrests, previously optional, were now standard equipment due to a federal safety mandate. The 1969 LeSabre and other Buicks also received a new steering column mounted ignition switch (relocated from the instrument panel) that also locked the steering wheel when the transmission was in Park. The ignition/locking steering column appeared on all 1969 General Motors cars one year ahead of the federal mandate requiring all cars to be so equipped.

Also new was a variable-ratio power steering unit along with revised front suspension geometry for improved ride and handling under Buick's tradename of Accu-Drive. Steel rails were also built into the doors (and rear quarter panels on coupes and convertibles) for improved side impact protection as was the case with all 1969 GM B- and C-body cars.

Powertrains were unchanged from 1968 with the 230-horsepower 350 two-barrel V8 standard and available with a three-speed [[manual transmission]] or the two-speed Super Turbine 300 [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] while the LeSabre "400" package once again included a 280-horsepower 350 four-barrel engine and three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic.

'''1970'''
[[File:'70 Buick LeSabre Convertible (Auto classique Pièces auto Jarry Laval '12).jpg|thumb|left|1970 Buick LeSabre Convertible]]
Only minor detail changes including grille and taillight revisions were made to the 1970 LeSabre. New features this year included a hidden radio antenna which amounted to two wires embedded in the windshield. Wheelbase was increased by one inch to {{Convert|124|in|mm}}, matching direct competitors such as Oldsmobile Delta 88, Mercury Monterey and Chrysler Newport.

Both base and Custom models were again offered. Engines were revised with the standard 350 two-barrel V8 increased in horsepower from 230 to 260. A new option for 1970 was a low-compression regular-fuel version of the 350 four-barrel rated at 285 horsepower and the high-compression premium fuel 350 four-barrel V8 was reworked with horsepower upped to 315 on a 10.25 to 1 compression ratio. Added to the lineup was a new LeSabre 455 line which shared interior and exterior trimmings with the LeSabre Custom and was powered by Buick's new 455 cubic-inch V8 with four-barrel carburetor, 10.25 to 1 compression and 370 horsepower, which also required premium fuel.

Transmission offerings included a standard three-speed manual with column shift for the base 350 two-barrel or optional three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic 350 automatic, which was standard equipment with the two 350 four-barrel engines. This transmission completely replaced the old two-speed automatic offered with the smaller base engines in past years, while the 455 was paired with the Turbo Hydra-matic 400. Buick now joined other GM divisions in marketing the automatic transmission under the Turbo Hydra-matic trade name rather than the "Super Turbine" designation used since 1964.

At the start of the model year, variable-ratio power steering and power drum brakes were optional equipment. Those items were made standard equipment on all LeSabres (and Wildcats) effective January 1, 1970. Power front disc brakes remained an extra-cost option.

For the first time since 1964, Buick offered a full-sized station wagon for 1970 under the '''Estate Wagon''' nameplate. Though it used the LeSabre's B-body, it rode on the C-body Electra 225's {{Convert|127|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase chassis. The Estate Wagon came standard with the 455 V8 and interior trims were similar to the LeSabre Custom and Wildcat.

The 1965-70 [[GM B platform]] is the fourth best selling automobile platform in history after the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], [[Ford Model T]] and the [[Lada Riva]].

'''1971'''

Like the other GM divisions, Buick completely restyled its B- and C-body cars for 1971. The full-size cars emerged larger and heavier than before and also ever after. The styling featured curved bodysides, long hoods and wide expanses of glass, similar to that of Chrysler Corporation's 1969 full-sized cars, but with a lower beltline than the Chrysler products. Semi-fastback rooflines were utilized on two-door hardtop coupes and convertibles had a new top design to permit a full-width rear seat.

[[File:LeSabre71.JPG|thumb|left|1971 Buick LeSabre Sedan]]
The same assortment of 350 and 455 cubic-inch V8s were carried over but featured lowered compression ratios and other modifications in order to enable the use of lower-octane low-lead or unleaded gasoline as a result of a General Motors corporate mandate. Variable-ratio power steering and power front disc brakes were made standard equipment on all LeSabres at the start of the 1971 model year. In March, the [[Turbo Hydramatic]] transmission became standard equipment, and all Buick LeSabres would remain so equipped in base form until the nameplate's final year in 2005.

The new body also featured a double shell roof for improved roll-over protection. Also new for '71 was a flow-through ventilation system utilizing vents mounted in the trunklid shared with other full-sized GM cars and the compact Chevrolet Vega. It used the heater fan to draw air into the car from the cowl intake, and force it out through vents in the trunk lid or tailgate. In theory, passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped, as in heavy traffic. In practice, however, it didn't work.

However, within weeks of the 1971 models' debut, Buick and all other GM dealers received multiple complaints from drivers who complained that the ventilation system pulled cold air into the car before the heater could warm up and could not be turned off. The ventilation system was extensively modified for 1972.

Also new for the 1971 was an optional MaxTrac computerized traction control system.

Inside was a new wrap-around cockpit style instrument panel that placed all controls and instruments within easy reach of the driver, along with easier serviceability with instruments and switches accessible from the front when the faceplate was removed. The seats of a new full-foam design with headrests more squared off than 1969-70. Again, base and Custom model LeSabres were offered in the same sedan and coupe bodystyles while the convertible was a Custom-only offering. The LeSabre 455 model line was dropped for 1971 with the larger engine now being offered as an option on the regular base and Custom-series models. LeSabre Customs equipped with the optional 455 engine got a "455" badge underneath the LeSabre nameplates on the front fenders instead of the "Custom" badge normally used.

'''1972'''
[[File:1972-1973 Buick LeSabre sedan -- 12-22-2011.jpg|thumb|left|1972 Buick LeSabre]]
A revised grille and taillights lenses were among the styling changes for 1972. Out back, a small "BUICK" nameplate was located above the right side taillight replacing the larger block letters spelling "B&amp;nbsp;U&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;C&amp;nbsp;K" across the lower trunk lid between the taillights in 1971. Also new for '72 was a one-year only 2 1/2-mph front bumper. All B, C, and E body (large) GM cars received such a bumper for '72.

Interior trims received only slight revisions from 1971. A revised flow-through ventilation system utilizing vents in the doorjambs replaced the troublesome system used in 1971 with the trunklid vents.

Both the 350 and 455 V8s were carried over from 1971 with horsepower ratings switched the new SAE net figures based on an engine as installed in an automobile with accessories and emission controls hooked up, rather than the gross horsepower method of past years based upon a [[dynamometer]] rating from an engine not installed in a vehicle. With that, the standard 350 two-barrel V8 was rated at 160 net horsepower compared to 230 gross horsepower in 1971 while the top 455 V8 was rated at 250 net horsepower in 1972 compared to 315 in 1971. Engines were also revised to meet the 1972 federal and California emission standards with California-bound cars receiving EGR valves, which would be installed on engines of virtually all automobiles for nationwide sales in 1973.

Inside, the instrument panel featured a new "FASTEN SEAT BELTS" light due to a new federal safety regulation and the buzzer which sounded when the key was left in the ignition also sounded upon starting the car to remind the driver and passengers to buckle up.

'''1973'''
[[File:1973 Buick LeSabre 4-door hardtop sedan front.jpg|thumb|1973 LeSabre hardtop sedan, showing the new bigger 5&amp;nbsp;mph bumpers]]
A larger federally mandated "5&amp;nbsp;mph" front bumper and new vertical bar grille highlighted the 1973 LeSabre along with revised taillights set in the somewhat larger rear bumper. Both the 350 and 455 V8s were revised with EGR valves used on both federal and California-emission equipped cars.

The LeSabre Custom convertible was dropped this year leaving the short-lived [[Buick Centurion|Centurion]] as Buick's only ragtop that year as the intermediate Skylark (replaced by the Century for 1973) lost its ragtop completely after the 1972 model year. The engine options continued largely unchanged.

'''1974'''
[[File:1974 Buick Lesabre Luxus.jpg|thumb|left|1974 Buick LeSabre Luxus 4-door sedan hardtop.]]
New grilles and taillights along with a 5&amp;nbsp;mph rear bumper highlighted the 1974 Buick LeSabre. Four-door pillared and hardtop sedans retained the same rooflines as 1973 but the two-door hardtop coupe featured a new roofline with a side rear opera windows.

Inside, the instrument panel was substantially revised but retained the wrap-around theme. A new (and seldom ordered) option was an "Air Cushion Restraint System" which included driver- and passenger-side airbags along with a unique four-spoke steering wheel. This option, also available on Electra 225s and Rivieras as well as full-sized Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs, was not very popular and was dropped after the 1976 model year.

New integrated seat and shoulder belts were introduced this year along with a federally mandated interlock system that required the driver and right front passenger to buckle their seat belts in order to start the vehicle. The interlock was met with such a major public outcry that Congress rescinded the interlock regulation in late 1974 after a few early 1975 models were so equipped, permitting owners of all 1974 and the early 1975 models equipped with the interlock system to legally disconnect it.

With the Centurion line discontinued after 1973, LeSabre was now Buick's only B-body full-sized car. The base LeSabre was continued, but a new LeSabre Luxus series replaced both the LeSabre Custom and the Centurion. The Luxus convertible also returned the ragtop to the LeSabre line after a one-year absence and was Buick's only ragtop.

Engine offerings were revised for 1974. The 350 two-barrel remained standard on all models with optional engines including a 350 four-barrel and 455 four-barrel V8s, both carried over from 1973 with revisions to meet the 1974 emission standards. New engine options for 1974 included a 455 two-barrel and the Stage 1 455 "performance package" which added dual exhausts, suspension upgrades and other equipment.

New options for 1974 included radial-ply tires, GM's High Energy Ignition and a "low fuel" warning light that illuminated when the fuel tank was down to four gallons. This would be the final year for the MaxTrac electronic traction control system as an option.

'''1975'''
[[File:Buick LeSabre Custom convertible silver-black fl-r.jpg|thumb|1975 Buick LeSabre Custom Convertible]]
The upscale LeSabre Luxus designation was dropped and replaced by the LeSabre Custom nameplate. 1975 also was the first year of the catalytic converter, and standard high energy ignition which was part of GM's Maximum Mileage System at the time Introduced in September 1974. The 1975 LeSabre was the first to require use of unleaded gasoline, due to the advent of the catalytic converter. The LeSabre lineup offered a coupe and two sedans while the LeSabre Custom lineup offered the coupe, two sedans, and the only convertible in the Buick lineup. 1975 would be the final year for the LeSabre Custom Convertible with around 5,300 examples rolling off the assembly lines.

Engine offerings were reduced to just two: the standard 5.7-litre V8 (350 CID) and a four-barrel carburetor or optional 7.5-litre V8 (455 CID) with a four barrel.

Bodylines on the 1975 were somewhat softer than the 1974 model featuring round headlights side-by-side and a cross-hatched patterned grille that flowed across the front of the car and under the headlights. Turn signals were located in the front bumper. A Buick tri-shield hood ornament was standard on the Custom Series and optional on the base series. The three-hole 'ventiports' were moved from the hood to the front fenders. Slightly larger taillamps than the 74 draped the back of the car with back-up lights positioned in the center broken up by the license plate. Four-door pillared sedans received a new small third windows to emulate the six-window "Colonnade" styling of GM intermediates while four-door hardtop sedans had new opera windows.

Inside, a new flat instrument panel shared with Electra and Riviera replaced the wrap-around cockpit dash of previous years and featured a horizontal sweep speedometer that read to only 100&amp;nbsp;mph compared to 120&amp;nbsp;mph in previous years and also included kilometer readings. Otherwise, interior trimmings received only minor revisions.

Convertible production for both the LeSabre Custom and the Centurion convertibles were not very abundant in the years 1971 to 1975. The rarest production in that time was the 1971 LeSabre Custom with just over 1,800 units built, and the most produced was the 1973 Centurion with slightly over 5,700 units built. Due to this very low production volume and the end of the full-size convertible era, this may make this series of ragtop LeSabre Custom and Centurion Convertibles quite collectable - depending on the vehicles' overall condition. The convertible mechanism used was called the 'scissor top' that folded inward on itself, instead of straight back. This was featured on all GM full-size convertibles from 1971 to 1976.

'''1976'''

Only minor styling changes highlighted the 1976 Buick LeSabre, which was the final year for the 1971-vintage bodyshell, the unpopular and rarely-ordered driver- and passenger-side airbag option, the 455 V8 and hardtop bodystyles. Changes amounted to rectangular quad headlights, eggcrate grille and turn signals located just below the headlights.

The '76 LeSabre was the only American full-size car with a standard V6 engine, which was Buick's brand-new 3.8-litre (231 CID) V6 engine. The V6 was only offered on the base-level LeSabre and not mentioned in initial 1976 Buick literature issued in September 1975 because the [[V6 engine]] was a last-minute addition to the line. The 350-cubic-inch V8 was the base engine on the LeSabre Custom and the 455-cubic-inch V8 was optional. Both V8s were optional on the base LeSabre.

'''1977'''
[[File:1977 Buick LeSabre sedan, brown.jpg|thumb|left|1977 Buick LeSabre sedan]]

The '''1977 Buick LeSabre''' and other GM B-body full-sized cars were considerably smaller and lighter than their predecessors to the tune of losing 700-800 pounds of weight and overall length of 10 to {{convert|15|in|mm}}. The full-sized cars were the beginning of a "corporate-wide" downsizing of vehicles in order to improve fuel economy ratings following the 1973-74 energy crisis that would filter down to intermediates in 1978, personal-luxury cars in 1979 and compacts in 1980 with subsequent downsizings of each line of vehicles scheduled in subsequent years.

Although the '77 Buick LeSabre was considerably smaller on the outside, headroom, rear seat legroom and trunk space were increased over the much larger 1976 model. The engine lineup consisted of an assortment of engines including the standard 231 cubic-inch Buick-built [[V6]] and various optional powerplants including a Pontiac-built 301 cubic-inch V8, 350 cubic-inch V8s built by both Buick and Oldsmobile, and an Oldsmobile 403 cubic-inch V8. The V6 was standard in base and Custom coupes and sedans, the 301 V8 on the new LeSabre Sport Coupe and the 350 V8 on the Estate Wagon.

[[File:1979 Buick LeSabre Coupe Front.jpg|thumb|left|1979 Buick LeSabre "Palm Beach Edition" Coupe]]
'''1978'''
Following a major downsizing and redesign, the 1978 Buick LeSabre received only minor changes including new grillework. Engine offerings were unchanged from 1977 on most models, but the LeSabre Sport Coupe was now powered by a turbocharged 231 cubic-inch V6 with a four-barrel carburetor producing 165 BHP (SAE Net) at 4000 RPM and a rather useful 285 lb-ft at 2,800 rpm.  

'''1979'''
[[File:1979 Buick LeSabre Coupe Rear.jpg|thumb|left|1979 Buick LeSabre "Palm Beach Edition" Coupe]]
Only minor changes including new grille and rear taillight patterns highlighted the 1979 LeSabre aside from the top-level LeSabre Custom of previous years being renamed the LeSabre Limited. The LeSabre Sport Coupe continued with the turbocharged V6 as standard equipment and a new option for this model only were Strato bucket seats with center console. This would be the final year for the Pontiac 301 and Oldsmobile 403 V8s on the option list.

'''1980'''
[[File:'80 Buick LeSabre Coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1980 Buick LeSabre coupe]]
New sheet metal highlighted by new swept back grilles/headlights, new taillights and revised coupe rooflines were among the changes to the 1980 Buick LeSabre aside from the complete disappearance of Buick's traditional portholes (the C-body Electra would retain them until 1984). The cars were also a bit lighter in weight for improved fuel economy along with the slightly more aerodynamic sheet metal which made the 1980 models look a little bigger than their 1977–79 counterparts but overall dimensions changed very little.

Engine offerings were shuffled a bit for 1980 with the standard Buick 231 V6 and optional 350 V8 carried over from 1979, with the Buick 350 making its last appearance this year. New options included a larger Buick-built 252 V6, an Oldsmobile-built 307 V8 and a 350 Diesel V8, also built by Oldsmobile. The LeSabre Sport Coupe continued with the four-barrel turbocharged 231 V6 as its standard and only available powerplant. The Sport Coupe was dropped from the line after 1980 along with the Turbo V6 engine due to slow sales, but the Turbo V6 continued on the Regal and Riviera.

Following the demise of the Buick 350 V8 after this year, Buick would only build V6 engines as a result of GM's emerging corporate engine policy dictating types of engines built by various divisions for use throughout the corporate lineup. According to the plan, Buick would build V6 engines, Pontiac would manufacture four-cylinder powerplants, Chevrolet would build four-cylinder, V6 and V8 engines, and V8s for larger and higher-priced cars would be sourced from Oldsmobile and Cadillac. This meant that from 1981 onward, V8-powered Buicks would feature Oldsmobile engines, both gasoline and diesel.

'''1981'''
[[File:'81 Buick LeSabre (Auto classique Bellepros Vaudreuil-Dorion '11).JPG|thumb|left|1981 Buick LeSabre]]
Only minor grille and trim changes highlighted the 1981 LeSabre, still offered in base and Limited models. The modified grille now had five (rather than four) rows of openings.&lt;ref&gt;Gunnell, pp. 199-200&lt;/ref&gt; Engine offerings included the 231 cubic-inch normally aspirated Buick V6 (standard on sedans and coupes although decidedly underpowered for a car weighing in at around 4,000&amp;nbsp;lbs.), or optional Olds 307 cubic-inch V8 (standard on wagons, optional on sedans and coupes) and the 350 cubic-inch Oldsmobile-built diesel V8 (optional on all models). All gasoline engines received GM's "Computer Command Control" system to control fuel mixture, spark advance, and emissions controls.

The three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission was standard equipment with the V6 and the diesel V8. New this year was a Turbo Hydra-Matic 200 4-R four-speed automatic overdrive transmission paired with the gasoline V8 engine for improved highway fuel economy.

LeSabre and other GM cars for 1981 received new 35 PSI radial tires for improved rolling resistance and fuel economy.

'''1982-83'''
[[File:1982 Buick LeSabre Limited diesel sedan front.jpg|thumb|left|1982 Buick LeSabre Limited sedan (diesel)]]

Few changes were made for the Buick LeSabre for 1982-83 other than revised grilles and trim items. The base LeSabre sedan and coupe models were dropped for 1983 with the LeSabre Custom now the entry-level model and paired with the upscale LeSabre Limited models in both coupe and sedan models. Engine offerings in these two years included the standard Buick 231 V6 or optional 252 V6, or optional Oldsmobile 307 (gasoline) or 350 (Diesel) V8s.

'''1984'''
[[File:'84 Buick LeSabre (Les chauds vendredis '12).jpg|thumb|left|1984 Buick LeSabre sedan]]
New grilles and wider and lower taillights were among the appearance changes for the 1984 Buick LeSabre, still offered in Custom and Limited models. The 252 V6 was dropped from the option list but all other engines returned including the 231 V6 (standard on coupes and sedans), or optional Oldsmobile 307 gasoline V8 (standard on wagons, optional on sedans and coupes) and Oldsmobile 350 Diesel V8 (optional all models).

'''1985'''

This would be the final year for the rear-drive LeSabre before another downsizing and conversion to front-wheel-drive for 1986 (sedans and coupes only; the rear-drive LeSabre Estate Wagon would soldier on unchanged a few more years). It was also the last LeSabre sedan and coupe to feature body-on-frame construction, V8 power and Buick's traditional all-coil suspension (the 1992–96 Roadmaster sedans would also be similarly built). The top-line LeSabre Limited became the LeSabre Limited Collectors Edition to mark the end of an era for the rear-drive sedan and coupe. Engine offerings included the standard 231 V6 (sedans and coupes) or optional Olds 307 V8 (which came as standard in the wagons) and Oldsmobile 350 diesel V8 (available in all models). 1985 307s received roller lifters for reduced friction. Meanwhile, the Estate Wagon continued on largely unchanged through 1990.

The 1986 LeSabre was introduced on the new [[front wheel drive]] [[GM H platform|H platform]], after departing from [[rear wheel drive]] on the [[GM B platform]].  Joining the LeSabre on the H-body included the [[Oldsmobile 88|Oldsmobile Delta 88]] and the 1987 [[Pontiac Bonneville]], which returned to full-size after a short-lived run as a [[mid-size]] on the [[GM G platform (RWD)|G platform]].  One of the features of the LeSabre version of the H-body was a reverse clamshell hood - one that is hinged at the front (in the same fashion as that of the [[Buick Electra]] and [[Chevrolet Corvette]] of that era) instead of at the back near the cowl and windshield.  The all new styling and implementation of front wheel drive ushered in a new era for the LeSabre, being of a flush aerodynamic design.  The most radical change may have been the removal of Buick's long standing [[Ventiport]]s from the front fenders.

Most Buick LeSabre models from this generation were powered by Buick's 3.8 liter (231 cubic-inch) V6 engine.  It started out with {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. It added balance shafts to become the famous "3800" V6 for 1988, with {{convert|165|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. This engine increased to {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in 1991 with the addition of Tuned Port Injection.  The 1986 model, however, featured the 3.0 liter (181 cubic-inch) V6 as standard.  Each year yielded slightly different design changes.  1986 is notable for its sealed-beam headlights, 1987 for the substition of more modern headlights with exchangeable bulbs as well as the introduction of door-mounted seat-belts.  In 1988 the 3.8 engine was changed over to the 3800 (vin code C) motor, while 1989 saw slight changes in the layout of the engine bay accessories (notably the position of the battery, washer fluid tank, and coolant overflow tank).  For 1990 there was a change in the design of the front bumper/grille assembly and different tail light design, while the 1991s were largely identical to the 1990 model cars aside from a small power increase.

In 1986, a LeSabre Grand National model was built to qualify the coupe body-style for NASCAR competition. The LeSabre Grand National is among the rarest of all Buicks ever made, with production numbers of less than 120 units.  It was only available in black with gray interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lesabret-type.com/LeSabreGN.html|title=1986 LeSabre Grand National Page|accessdate=2012-01-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211083727/http://lesabret-type.com/LeSabreGN.html|archivedate=2012-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of production of the Grand National, a new sporting LeSabre appeared in form of the LeSabre T-Type, which was offered from 1987 until 1989.  The LeSabre T-Type had many unique options that were styled after the Regal Grand National and Regal T-Type models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesabret.com/thecar.html |title=The Buick Lesabre T-type |publisher=Lesabret.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those options included blacked-out trim, gray-on-black seats (1987 only), gray-on-black door panels, gray dash and trim, and T-Type specific front and rear spoilers.  For 1990, the T-Type trim package was dropped due to slow sales and Buick's repositioning within the GM hierarchy as a maker of "Premium American Motorcars" rather than sporty/performance models.

Beginning in 1989 and continuing for several years, the Buick LeSabre received accolades from J.D. Power as one of the highest rated automobiles in customer satisfaction based on factors such as quality and reliability.

This LeSabre was introduced in 1991 for the 1992 model year, and was redesigned along the same lines as the previous year's [[Buick Park Avenue|Park Avenue]]. The LeSabre was available only as a four-door ("[[family]]-style") sedan from this point forward until the car was discontinued in 2005. The headlights were streamlined with a separated amber turn signal strip wrapping around the lower front fascia. The rear fascia featured a wider trunk mouth and lower lift over height to ease loading baggage while the front was smoothed with simplified chrome molding and absent bumperettes. The LeSabre also featured GM's plastic body technologies, with high-stress plastic replacing traditional steel in the front fenders.

[[File:'94-'96 Buick LeSabre.jpg|left|thumb|1994-96 Buick LeSabre with aftermarket vinyl roof]]
The LeSabre's engine from 1992-1995 was the [[Buick V6 engine#Series I|3800]] [[V6 engine|V6]] (L27), which produced {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and 225 [[lb·ft]] (305 [[N·m]]) The 3513&amp;nbsp;lb (1593&amp;nbsp;kg) car got 18&amp;nbsp;mpg (13.1&amp;nbsp;L/100&amp;nbsp;km) in the city and 28&amp;nbsp;mpg (8.4&amp;nbsp;L/100&amp;nbsp;km) on the highway, which was slightly better than the 1991 model. The car accelerated to 60&amp;nbsp;mph (97&amp;nbsp;km/h) in 8.9 seconds and could cover the quarter mile in 16.9 seconds at 80&amp;nbsp;mph (129&amp;nbsp;km/h). Top speed was electronically limited to 108&amp;nbsp;mph (173&amp;nbsp;km/h).

The LeSabre was offered in two trim levels. The Custom trim level was the base level. The Limited was the premium trim level featuring alloy wheels, front hood ornament, and fold down access panels in the rear seat to access the trunk.  The car had an 18-gallon fuel tank, [[Anti-lock brakes]], and a power radio antenna located in the rear passenger side quarter panel. Instrumentation included gas gauge, speedometer, and gear indicator.  Optional instrumentation included a tachometer and temperature, oil pressure, and charging voltage gauges.

In 1993, a special edition LeSabre was sold to commemorate Buick's 90th anniversary.  In addition to Custom trim level standard equipment, this model included "90th Anniversary" badging, cassette player, cruise control, rear window defogger, power driver's seat, carpeted floor mats, exterior pinstripes, and choice of wire or aluminum wheel covers.

For 1996, the LeSabre received the [[Buick V6 engine#Series II|3800 Series II]] powerplant, with a gain of {{convert|35|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The engine increased fuel economy ratings over its predecessor, 19&amp;nbsp;MPG city and 30&amp;nbsp;MPG highway [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] estimates.

The LeSabre was facelifted for 1997, moving the turn signal indicators to the front bumper instead of the headlamp assembly. A new gauge cluster with a tachometer appeared. The front fenders switched from the composite material to a more conventional galvanized steel substrate. Other minor changes also took effect, including a different grille, different rear backup lights and different trim. The overall effect of these changes was that the 1997-99 models looked a little slimmer than their predecessors. Despite the redesign of the exterior, one automotive magazine article around 1996-97 said the interior was "1970-something" meaning it was rather old-fashioned for a car from the mid-late 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

In 1999, Flint, Michigan's Buick City assembly plant, which built the LeSabre as well as the Pontiac Bonneville was shut down and LeSabre production moved to Hamtramck.  The last 1999 LeSabre left Buick City's final line as the last Buick City-built car in June 1999.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The 2000 LeSabre was introduced in March 1999. It was now built on [[General Motors|GM's]] [[GM G platform (FWD)|G platform]]; however GM chose to continue to refer to it as the H platform.&lt;ref name="Frame"/&gt;  The LeSabre was manufactured at GM's [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly]] factory in [[Hamtramck, Michigan]] and Lake Orion Assembly, in Lake Orion, Michigan.

Some of the changes with the redesign included a new grille that did not open with the hood, and slightly smaller exterior dimensions.  Despite its somewhat smaller exterior size, it still offered similar interior room and more trunk space than the previous model.  A [[Air filter#Automotive cabin air filters|pollen filter]] was installed with this generation, and was accessed from inside the engine compartment on the passenger side against the firewall.  Custom and Limited trim levels continued to be offered.

In 2003, a Celebration Edition package was added in recognition of Buick's centennial. The Celebration Edition featured all the standard equipment of the Limited with a choice pearlescent White Diamond or Crimson Pearl tricoat paint schemes, a blacked-out grille, 16" chrome wheels, and special badging. Other features optional or standard on the LeSabre included Stabilitrak, [[OnStar]], EyeCue heads-up display, all-weather traction control, automatic load-leveling, side airbags, tire pressure monitoring system, heated seats, dual-zone climate control, and RainSense automatic windshield wipers.  Although created to commemorate Buick's centennial in 2003, the package remained available in 2004 and 2005.

Among other packages offered on LeSabre included a Platinum Edition package on 2004 Customs.

The standard, and only available, engine for the eighth-generation LeSabre was the 3.8 L [[Buick V6 engine#Series II|Series II Buick 3800]] [[V6]] providing:
* Power: 205 [[horsepower|hp]] (153 [[kilowatt|kW]])
* Torque: 230 [[lb·ft]] (312 [[N·m]])

{{clear}}

==Discontinuation==
The LeSabre was America's best-selling full- size car when it was discontinued at the end of the 2005 model year. It was replaced in 2006 by the [[Buick Lucerne|Lucerne]], Buick's newly designed flagship. The last LeSabre rolled off the [[Lake Orion, Michigan]] assembly line on June 18, 2004 (retooling the plant to build the [[Pontiac G6]]) and the last [[Hamtramck, Michigan]] LeSabre rolled off the assembly line in mid-August, 2005.

The '''Buick GL8''' is a minivan that is made by [[SAIC-GM|Shanghai GM]], a joint-venture between Chinese automaker [[SAIC Motor]] and American automaker [[General Motors]]. The Buick GL8 is only sold in China.

Introduced in 1999, the first generation Buick GL8 is similar to the GM-made minivans that are sold in North America ([[Chevrolet Uplander]], [[Chevrolet Venture]], [[Buick Terraza]], [[Oldsmobile Silhouette]], [[Pontiac Trans Sport]], [[Pontiac Trans Sport|Pontiac Trans Sport Montana]], [[Pontiac Montana]], [[Pontiac Montana SV6]], and [[Saturn Relay|Saturn RELAY]]), and is built on GM's U-body platform, which is also used by the GM-made minivans that are sold in North America, as well as the Buick Rendezvous and the Pontiac Aztek, which are both midsize crossover SUV that is sold in North America by General Motors, also uses GM's U-body platform.

A revamped edition was released in late 2010/early 2011, featuring 2.4&amp;nbsp;L and V6 3.0&amp;nbsp;L engines.&lt;ref name="ChinaAuto_2010-11-28"/&gt; It is based on an old minivan platform from the U.S., but it would likely require costly upgrades to meet  current U.S. safety and requirements. Sales amounted to 52,127 units in 2010, and it was relatively stable over past few years. The previous generation was still available as the '''GL8 First Land'''&lt;ref name="Reuters_2011-04-25"/&gt; until 2017.

The GL8 first entered production in China in December 1999.&lt;ref name="ChinaAuto_2010-11-28"/&gt;

The regular wheelbase GL8 is known as the GL8 2.5 while the extended wheelbase variant is called the GL8 First Land. There are five trim levels available, called the LT, CT1, CT2, CT3 and GT (which is only available on the Firstland). Pricing ranged between 218,000 to 318,000 yuan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://car.autohome.com.cn/config/spec/1566.html#pvareaid=3454541|title=2005 Buick GL8 specs}}&lt;/ref&gt; (31,920 to 46,570 USD). Starting from October 2001, the GL8 was exported to the Philippines, where it was rebadged as the Chevrolet Venture and available in a 10-seater configuration until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.curbsideclassic.com/automotive-histories/obscure-rebadges-from-around-the-world-part-6/|title=Obscure Rebadges From Around The World: Part 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Venture was unsuccessful there and was discontinued in 2007. In 2005, the GL8 underwent a facelift for the 2006 model year, receiving a redesigned front end and new clear taillights.

Production ended in 2017.

The '''Buick Super''' is a [[full-size]]d automobile produced from the 1940 through the 1958 model years (excluding WW II). It was built on [[Buick]]'s larger body shared with the [[Buick Roadmaster|Roadmaster]] and was replaced by the [[Buick Electra|Electra]] in 1959.

Super returned as a performance trim level on V8-powered [[Buick LaCrosse|LaCrosse]] and [[Buick Lucerne|Lucerne]] sedans from 2008 until 2011.

==Series 50 (1930–1935)==
[[File:Buick Coupe 1932.jpg|thumb|right|1932 Series 50 coupe]]
Originally the Series 50 had a {{convert|5431|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on|disp=flip}} six cylinder engine developing 99&amp;nbsp;bhp of power at 2,800 rpm, and Buick manufactured 28,204 cars. In 1931 the model remained almost unchanged, aside from minor appearance changes. Optionally, the model was equipped with a new {{convert|3617|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on|disp=flip}} straight eight-cylinder and 77&amp;nbsp;hp. With the temporary disappearance of the Series 40, Series 50 became the entry level model for Buick.

In 1932 the engine displacement increased to {{convert|3776|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on|disp=flip}}, producing 82.5&amp;nbsp;bhp. In 1933, the aesthetics of the car was completely redesigned. The power delivered by the engine was increased again and now it was up to 86&amp;nbsp;bhp, and in 1934, the model power increased to 88&amp;nbsp;hp. Buick re-introduced the Series 40, which once again became the entry level model. In 1935 the Series 50 remained unchanged and the following year went out of production, having produced 127,416 examples. The model was reintroduced in 1940 under the name "Super".

When introduced in 1940 the new Series 50 Super featured the cutting-edge "torpedo" [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]. The new C-body that the 1940 Buick Super shared with the Series 70 Roadmaster, the [[Cadillac Series 62]], the [[Oldsmobile 98|Oldsmobile Series 90]], and the [[Pontiac Torpedo]] featured shoulder and hip room that was over 5" wider, the elimination of running boards and exterior styling that was streamlined and 2-3" lower. When combined with a column mounted shift lever the cars offered true six passenger comfort, changes that had clearly been influenced by the [[Cadillac Sixty Special]].

The basic formula for the 1940 to 1952 Super was established by mating the Roadmaster's longer behind the engine cowl body to the Series 40 [[Buick Special|Special]]'s smaller [[straight-eight engine]] (and consequently shorter engine compartment). This led to an economical combination of voluminous passenger room and relatively good fuel economy. (In contrast the Series 60 [[Buick Century|Century]] combined the smaller Special body with the larger Roadmaster engine.)

The new Super temporarily shared its {{Convert|121.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase dimension with the 40 Special. Initially four body styles were offered: a 2-door coupe, a 2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]], a 4-door sedan and a 4-door convertible. In the middle of the model year a 4-door [[Buick Estate|Estate]] [[station wagon|wagon]] was added which was exclusive to the Super. Interiors of Bedford cloth (either tan or gray) were offered. The engine was the same {{convert|248|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} 107&amp;nbsp;hp [[Buick Straight-8 engine|Fireball]] [[Straight-eight engine|I8]] as used on the Special which was equipped with an oil filter. The Super was equipped with sealed beam headlights and with Fore-N-Aft Flash-Way directionals. 1940 was the only year the Super could be equipped with sidemounts. A total of 128,736 units were sold in its first year.

The styling changes for 1941 were modest, but the changes under the hood were major. The compression ratio was raised from 6.15:1 to 7.0:1, the "turbulator" pistons were redesigned, smaller spark plugs were substituted for the previous type and “Compound Carburetion” was introduced, as it was on all Buicks except for the Special. Compound Carburetion was the forerunner of the modern four-barrel carburetor, and consisted of twin two-barrel carburetors. One unit operated all of the time, while the other operated only under hard acceleration. The new engine delivered 125 horsepower. All cars available with a choice of axle ratios and with two-tone color combinations with 19 selections at no extra charge. A new feature was a two-way hood that could be opened from either side. The 4-door convertible and the Estate wagon were gone but a new one year only body style was a 3-passenger 2-door Business Coupe which sold 2449 units. Overall sales fell to 92,067.

[[File:Buick Super Eight Serie 51 4-Dorrars Sedan 1948.jpg|thumb|left|1948 Buick Super]]
The 1942 Super coupes adopted the appealing Sedanet [[fastback]] style that had been the sensation of 1941 on [[Buick Century|Century]] and [[Buick Special|Special]]. New wider and lower bodies were offered and "Airfoil" front fenders that flowed into the lines of the rear fenders were introduced on convertibles and sedanet models. The Super had new front fender trim featuring parallel chrome strips. Also featured for 1942 was a handsome new grille with a lower outline and thin vertical strips. A feature shared with other Buicks was a new interior air intake positioned near the front center grille that eliminated the old cowl-level ventilator. The number of body styles was reduced to three with the elimination of the one year only Business coupe.

After the government prohibited the use of chrome on January 1, 1942 a number of body styles were dropped and most trim was now painted. Cast iron pistons were used in the {{convert|248|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick Straight-8 engine|Fireball]] [[Straight-eight engine|I8]] engine. The last of the 1942 Buicks were completed on February 4, 1942. Only 33,034 Supers were built in the abbreviated model year.

In 1946 Buick once again combined the large Series 70 Roadmaster body with the economical Series 40 Special powerplant to create the Series 50 Super line. Basic styling was continued from 1942 now sedans had the front fender sweep across the doors to the rear fenders as did the Sedanet and convertible styles. A stamped grille with vertical bars dominated the frontal ensemble. Single stainless body trim lines began on the front fenders and ended at the rear edge of the standard rear wheelhouse shields. Standard equipment included an automatic choke, clock, ash receiver, turn signals and woodgrained instrument panels.&lt;ref name="Flory, Jr. 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Flory, Jr.|first=J. "Kelly"|title=American Cars, 1946-1959 Every Model Every Year|year=2008|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers|isbn=978-0-7864-3229-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exterior series identification was found on the crossbar between the bumper guards front and rear. Cloisonne emblems carried the Super emblem. Compound Carburetion was eliminated and the compression ratio was reduced to 6.30:1. As a consequence the 1946 Super's horsepower fell from 125 to 110. Torque on the other hand was hardly affected. The number of body styles increased to four with the return of the [[Buick Estate|Estate]] [[station wagon|wagon]] after a six year absence. A total of 119,334 units were sold. The front suspension was independent with coil springs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1946_Buick/1946_Buick_Brochure/1946%20Buick-20.html |title=Directory Index: Buick/1946_Buick/1946_Buick_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 76.98% of Buick sales this year were Supers.&lt;ref name="Flory, Jr. 2008"/&gt;

Combining big Roadmaster room with an economical Special engine continued to make the Super an American favorite in 1947. The Super was little changed from its 1946 counterpart, except for new stamped grille that had separate upper bar and new emblem. Stainless lower body moldings made a single line along the body and continued onto the standard wheelhouse shields. A white Tenite steering wheel was standard while the instruments were round and set into a two-toned dash panel. Exterior series identification was found on the crossbars between the standard bumper guards. A chrome emblem was used with the series script embossed and filled with red. Sales reached a record 159,588. The height was 64.9&amp;nbsp;inches.&lt;ref name="Flory, Jr. 2008"/&gt; Brakes were 12&amp;nbsp;inch drums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1947_Buick/1947_Buick_Brochure/1947%20Buick-23.html |title=Directory Index: Buick/1947_Buick/1947_Buick_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main external change to the 1948 Super from its 1947 counterpart was the Super script on each front fender. Other series identification continued to be earned on the bumper guard crossbar. The car was a bit lower than in 1947 rolling on new 7.60 x 15 tires mounted on wheels with trim rings and small hubcaps. Super script was also found on the center crest of a new black Tenite steering wheel. New cloth interiors featured leatherette scuff pads and trim risers. The instrument panel was redone, using silver-tone instruments on a two-tone gray panel. The sedan was carpeted in the rear with a carpet insert also found in the front rubber mat. The [[convertible (car)|convertible]] also featured cloth and leather interior trim with power top, seat and windows standard. Total sales were 108,521.

The Super shared a new [[General Motors]] [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] with the [[Buick Roadmaster|Roadmaster]] but on a shorter wheelbase. It featured three chrome [[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPorts]] on each front fender to denote its smaller [[straight-eight engine]] and shorter engine compartment when compared with the Roadmaster. The sales brochure noted that VentiPorts helped ventilate the engine compartment, and possibly that was true in early 1949, but sometime during the model year they became plugged. The idea for VentiPorts grew out of a modification Buick styling chief Ned Nickles had added to his own 1948 Roadmaster. He had installed four amber lights on each side of his car’s hood wired to the distributor so as to flash on and off as each piston fired simulating the flames from the exhaust stack of a fighter airplane. Combined with the bombsight mascot, VentiPorts put the driver at the controls of an imaginary fighter airplane. Upon seeing this, Buick chief [[Harlow Curtice]] was so delighted that he ordered that (non-lighting) VentiPorts be installed on all 1949 Buicks.

Super script was found just above the full length body fender molding on the front fenders. New fender edge taillamps were featured while rear fender skins remained a Buick standard. New fender top parking lamps, harkening back to 1941 styling appeared. Full wheel trim discs were standard along with such features as a cigar lighter, ashtray, and automatic choke. Cloth interiors were standard, except on the [[convertible (car)|convertible]] which was trimmed in leather and leatherette and had a power top, seat and windows as standard equipment.

[[Dynaflow]] [[automatic transmission]] was now optional equipment on Supers in 1949. Cars so equipped had 6.9:1 compression ratio and 120 horsepower. Total sales set a record at 190,514 for the first time since the Super's introductory year. The instrument panel was new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1949_Buick/1949%20Buick%20Brochure/1949%20Buick%20Brochure-12.html |title=Directory Index: Buick/1949_Buick/1949 Buick Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1950 Supers shared with all the other series totally new all bumper guard grille and more rounded styling. Super script appeared on front fenders just above the full length lower bodyside moldings. A new body style was a 2-door [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]] [[hardtop]]. Another new bodystyle was a long wheelbase sedan which was stretched an extra four inches (102&amp;nbsp;mm) and featured plusher interior than most Supers, which normally had cloth interiors of finer material than the Special. Supers had three VentiPorts on each hoodside. The convertible had leather power seats plus power windows and top.

The 1950 Super came with a single two-barrel carburetor on a new higher displacement {{convert|263|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick Straight-8 engine|Fireball]] [[Straight-eight engine|I8]] which produced {{Convert|112|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. It was able to achieve speeds over {{convert|90|mph}} with an optional Dynaflow automatic transmission which, rather than changing through gears, used the torque converter to couple the motor to a single gear ratio. The car had 2 splits in the back glass although the windshield was now curved one-piece glass. Models also could be equipped with an AM radio and an antenna that could be adjusted via a knob in the front center above the windshield. In the June 1953 [[Popular Mechanics]], acceleration was rated at 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph in 14.5 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mdwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Popular Mechanics - Google Boeken |date= June 1953|accessdate=2012-05-20|publisher=Hearst Magazines }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Super set an all time record of 251,883 sold.

In 1951 Supers had larger bodies than [[Buick Special|Special]]s but looked similar with three rounded VentiPorts per fender, broad bright fender shields and a full length "[[Buick#Sweepspear|Sweepspear]]" chrome body side molding. This chrome-plated strip started above the front wheel, after which it gently curved down nearly to the rocker panel just before the rear wheel, and then curved around the rear wheel in a quarter of a circle to go straight back to the taillight.  Series script was found on the deck lid and within the steering wheel center. The long wheelbase sedan was named the [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]] sedan although it was not a hardtop. Supers were trimmed with materials similar to Special Deluxes except for in the plush Super Riviera sedan. Front turn signals were within the bumper guard "bombs," while rear signals shared the stop lamps' housing on the rear fender edges. The convertibles and [[Buick Estate|Estate]] [[station wagon|wagon]]
were trimmed in leather. 169,226 Supers were sold.

In 1952 Buick's mid-priced line resembled the Series 40 with three VentiPorts per fender and Sweepspear rocker panel trim. Super script appeared on the rear fenders aided identification. The Super was built with the larger [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]], however. The full flowing fenderline dipped deeper on this body and rear fenders had a rear crest line absent on the [[GM B platform|B-body]] [[Buick Special|Special]]s. A new deck lid gave a more squared off appearance. Like other Buick series it was a near copy year for 1952. Chromed rear fender fins gave distinction to 1952 Supers. Interiors were cloth except on convertibles and Estate wagons which were trimmed with leather. The Super used a different instrument panel than the Special.  It was distinguished by a large center speedometer housing flanked by smaller gauge housings. Series identification was found within the steering wheel center. The Sedanet and the regular wheelbase sedan were cancelled. Sales fell to 135,332.

In 1953 Buick's middle priced line shared the Roadmaster's new V8 and, for this year the Roadmaster shared the Super and Special's {{Convert|121.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase. The Super earned a horizontal trim bar on its rear fenders which distinguished it from the Series 70 Roadmasters. Otherwise its side trim bar on its rear fenders was identical although the Super was had only three VentiPorts on each  front fender. Series identification was found on the deck emblem. Full wheelcovers were now standard. The vee in the bombsight ornament signified the V8 power under the hood. Interiors in most models were nylon and silky broadcloth. The convertible had power windows, seat and top as standard equipment. Dynaflow was now standard equipment. Air conditioning was a new option. A total of 190,514 Supers were sold.

Using the new larger [[GM C platform (RWD)|General Motors C-body]], with vertical windshield pillars and the new Panoramic windshield, the Super for 1954 was a big Buick for the budget minded buyer. Identified by its three [[Ventiport#Distinguishing features|VentiPorts]] per fender, the Super script on the quarters and the series designation within the deck ornament, the Super shared other brightwork with the [[Buick Roadmaster|Roadmaster]]. Interiors were nylon and were plainer than in the Roadmaster. The Buick Super has a design resembling the 1955 Buick Century and Buick Century Riviera. The Super did have the more expensive car's horizontal speedometer instrument panel. The convertible was upholstered in leather and had power-operated windows, seat and top, along with an outside rearview mirror on the left, as standard equipment. New features included a lighted ignition key slot, electric windows, and a roof rail cover.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1954_Buick/1954_Buick_Brochure/1954%20Buick-12.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Buick Estate|Estate]] [[station wagon|wagon]] was discontinued. Total sales fell to 118,630.

In 1955 Buick's popular Super continued to combine the large C-body interior expanse with medium bracket interiors and performance. Supers had four of the new round VentiPorts per fender this year, with additional series script found on rear quarters and within the deck emblem. The side [[Buick#Sweepspear|Sweepspear]] was unchanged from 1954. The larger bodied Buicks were readily identified by their more rounded contours, straight up windshield pillars and sedan rear quarter windows. Series 50 Super and 70 Roadmaster headlamp bezels also housed parking lights. Inside, a new Red Liner speedometer lay horizontally across the instrument panel. Interiors were trimmed in nylon/Cordaveen combinations, except for the convertible which featured leather seats. Standard Super equipment included trip mileage indicator, electric clock and, on convertibles, a power horizontal seat adjuster. Super sales rose to 132,463.

In 1956 although the Super was larger Buick, with vertical windshield posts and four VentiPorts per fender, it had a deep Sweepspear similar to the smaller Series 40 [[Buick Special|Special]] and Series 60 [[Buick Century|Century]] cars. Series script was found on rear quarters and within the deck and grille emblems. Interiors were Cordaveen and patterned nylon, except for convertibles which were all-Cordaveen trimmed and had power windows, horizontal seat adjustment(Six-way power seats were optional&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1956_Buick/1956_Buick_Brochure_1/1956%20Buick-27.html&lt;/ref&gt;), and a power top in its standard form.

The Super used the new [[General Motors]] [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] for 1957. Larger than the Series 40 [[Buick Special|Special]] and Series 60 [[Buick Century|Century]] [[GM B platform|B-body]], the [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]] body styles had different roof treatments as well. Supers had a group of three [[Chevron (insignia)|Chevron]]s on each rear quarter or door for series identification, in addition to the normal wording within the grille and deck emblems. Four [[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPorts]] were used on each front fender. Closed models were upholstered in Nylon/Cordaveen combinations while the convertible had an all-Cordaveen interior and featured power windows and seat controls as part of its equipment. Standard Super equipment included foam rubber seat cushions, automatic trunk lamp, Red Liner speedometer, glovebox lamp, dual horns, trip mileage indicator, directional signals, dual sunshades, color coordinated dash panel, and on the convertible, outside left-hand rearview mirror. The 4-door pillared [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]] body style was gone. Engine displacement was increased to {{convert|364|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} on the [[Buick V8 engine#364|Nailhead]] [[V8 engine|V8]]. Nevertheless, sales fell to 70,250, the lowest level with the exception of the abbreviated 1942 model year.

The once most popular Buick line was reduced to two body styles for 1958 with the elimination of the [[convertible (car)|convertible]]. Side trim was similar to lesser series, except for the Super lettering on the rear fender flashes, but Supers were longer than the Series 40 [[Buick Special|Special]]s and Series 60 [[Buick Century|Century]]s. The Super name was also lettered across the deck lid. Standard equipment included Variable-Pitch [[Dynaflow]], power steering, power brakes, a safety-cushion instrument panel, fully carpeted floor, courtesy lights, full wheelcovers, foam rubber cushions, electric clocks, dual horns, ignition key light, glovebox, cigar lighter, trip mileage indicator, geared vent panes, bumper guards, variable speed wipers, Step-On parking brakes, and, on convertibles, an outside rearview mirror. Interiors were trimmed with gray cloth and vinyl or Cordaveen and vinyl. A plusher Custom interior was available at extra cost. Sales fell further to 42,388, the lowest with the exception of the wartime 1942 model year.

The Super name was resurrected after a 50 year absence as a new performance trim level on  [[Buick LaCrosse|LaCrosse]] (2008-2009) and [[Buick Lucerne|Lucerne]] (2008-2011) models.

The LaCrosse Super was powered by a 300 horsepower 5.3 L small-block V8 engine while the Lucerne Super had a 292 horsepower 4.6 L Northstar V8 engine.  Both came with high levels of standard equipment.

The '''Buick Rendezvous''', introduced in the spring of 2001 as a 2002 model year vehicle, is a [[midsize car|Midsize
]] [[crossover SUV]] that was sold by [[Buick]] for the 2002–2007 model years. The Buick Rendezvous and its corporate cousin the [[Pontiac Aztek]] were GM's entry into the crossover SUV segment. As a four-door crossover with a front engine and optional all-wheel drive (Versatrak), the Rendezvous featured a four-speed automatic transmission with a V-6 engine.  The SUV used the same platform as GM's short version minivan, [[Pontiac Montana]] and [[Chevrolet Venture]]. It assumed the load carrying duties that were previously handled by the [[Buick Estate]] station wagon.

==Technology and notable features==
[[File:2004 Buick Rendezvous 3.4 Rear.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view]]

It was Buick's first truck in its lineup since 1923, and the Rendezvous was billed as a combination of the best attributes of a [[minivan]] (large cargo capacity, seating for up to seven), a [[Luxury vehicle|luxury]] [[automobile]] (ride, handling, smoothness) and a sport utility vehicle (truck styling and available [[all wheel drive]]). 

The Rendezvous was produced at General Motors' [[Ramos Arizpe]], [[Mexico]] assembly plant, where it shared an assembly line with the [[Pontiac Aztek]]. Like the Pontiac Aztek, the Buick Rendezvous is based on a shortened version of GM's second generation [[GM U platform|U platform]] minivans. In lieu of [[four-wheel drive]], the Rendezvous offered [[Versatrak]], a full-time, fully automatic all-wheel drive system which provided sure-footed traction in inclement weather and could handle moderate off-road surfaces, but was not meant for boulder-climbing [[Rubicon Trail]]-type activities.

Buick benchmarked their [[Buick Park Avenue|Park Avenue]] sedan as the prototypical target for ride and handling for the Rendezvous. In order to provide a luxurious and responsive car-like ride, all Rendezvous came equipped with a fully [[independent rear suspension]] system regardless of optional content or trim level.

The Rendezvous' instrument cluster detailing featured teal illuminated needles and numbers set in a silver face accented by [[Chrome plating|chrome]] trim rings that was meant to evoke the luxurious look and feel of an expensive watch or designer bracelet. On the uplevel CXL model, a driver information center on the instrument panel provided the outside temperature, compass functions, a [[trip computer]] that included readings of fuel economy, range and fuel used. An optional second generation [[heads-up display]] was also available. This was also available in the CX model. An optional tire inflation monitoring system provided readings of tire pressure and warned if out of the specified range was a clever feature in the wake of the [[Ford Explorer]]/[[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] [[Firestone vs Ford Motor Company controversy|debacle]] that was in large part attributable to underinflated tires.

The Rendezvous boasted the ability to carry seven passengers when equipped with a third-row bench, a class-leading feature that Buick brought to market before its competitors and is able to carry within its interior a standard 4'x 8' sheet of [[plywood]].

In support of the Rendezvous' intended role as a versatile accoutrement for busy people with families, it provided a center console with storage space and power points for a [[laptop]] computer as well as a separate spots to hold a purse, a cell phone, pager or other small items that the owner would want to keep organized and readily accessible as well as an optional rear cargo organizer system and rear seat stereo system controls with headsets.

==Safety==
The [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS) gives Rendezvous an overall ''Acceptable'' rating in its frontal offset crash test for fair structure performance and fair dummy control.  However the IIHS did not perform a side-impact test on the Rendezvous.

==Sales success==
The Rendezvous was a badly needed success for Buick, given the decline of its aging customer base, and singlehandedly brought a large number of younger, wealthier "conquest" buyers into Buick showrooms who otherwise would not have considered purchasing a Buick. A major contributor to the Rendezvous's success was an aggressive value-pricing strategy that made the Rendezvous US$6,500 less than a comparably equipped [[Acura MDX]] and US$8,000 less than the [[Lexus RX300|Lexus RX]]. The Rendezvous handily exceeded GM's predictions of 30,000 to 40,000 units a year by a large margin, which helped offset the poor sales of the [[Pontiac Aztek]] with which it shared its Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, assembly line.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The last Rendezvous rolled off the assembly line on July 5, 2007.

Commercials featuring [[Tiger Woods]] aired during the [[The Barclays|Buick Classic]] [[golf]] tournament. "Tornado" featured a tornado picking up Woods, three waitresses and their minivan, two [[Storm chasing|storm chasers]] in a competing SUV, and one man in a luxury car. All the participants ended up inside a Rendezvous, with Woods driving and saying, "I guess we're not in Kansas anymore." "Igor" had three vehicles driving from a cemetery at night into a castle, followed by a [[lightning]] strike, and Woods exiting the castle in a Rendezvous as "[[Frankenstein (instrumental)|Frankenstein]]" plays. Woods says, "What? You were expecting Igor?".&lt;ref&gt;http://media.gm.com/news/releases/b010620a.html {{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Retrieved on 2009/01/15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Buick Terraza''' is a luxury [[minivan]] that was marketed by [[Buick]] from 2005 through 2007 model years. The Terraza was a [[badge engineering|badge engineered]] variant of the [[Chevrolet]], [[Pontiac]], and [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]] minivans sharing the [[GM U platform|U platform]]; ([[Chevrolet Uplander|Uplander]], [[Pontiac Montana SV6|Montana SV6]], and [[Saturn Relay|Relay]] respectively) in [[Doraville, Georgia]].

The Terraza retailed at [[USD|US$]]28,110 in 2005. The Buick debuted with one engine, a 3.5&amp;nbsp;[[Liter|L]] [[GM High Value engine#LX9|High Value]] [[V6]] that generates 200&amp;nbsp;[[Horsepower|hp]] (149&amp;nbsp;[[Kilowatt|kW]]) and 220&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (298&amp;nbsp;N·m) of [[torque]], going from 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph in the 9-second range. For 2006, a 3.9&amp;nbsp;L [[GM High Value engine#LZ9|LZ9]] V6, with 240&amp;nbsp;hp (179&amp;nbsp;kW) and 240&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (332&amp;nbsp;Nm) torque. It offered leather seats, and a wood trim on the panels and also offered on the steering wheel and gear shift knob.

For 2007, the 3.5&amp;nbsp;L V6 was dropped, leaving the 3.9&amp;nbsp;L as the base engine. Consequently, the optional [[All-wheel drive|AWD]] system was also dropped, since it could not handle the torque of the 3.9&amp;nbsp;L engine. A [[flexible fuel|flex-fuel]] version of the 3.9&amp;nbsp;L V6 also became available for the Terraza's third season. The 2007 Terraza equipped with side airbags scored a "good" in the frontal offset and an "acceptable" in the side impact [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS) [[crash test]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iihs.org/ratings/ratingsbyseries.aspx?id=536
| title = Buick Terraza IIHS Crash Tests | accessdate = March 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Year-by-year changes==
*'''2005''' • Buick introduces the Terraza, its first minivan for the [[North-American]] market. The Terraza was available in two trim lines: entry-level ''CX'' (FWD or AWD) and top-of-the-line ''CXL'' (FWD or AWD).
*'''2006''' • The 3.5&amp;nbsp;L V6 could now be upgraded to a 3.9 (in FWD only) [[GM High Value engine#LZ9|LZ9]] V6 engine. Second row seat-mounted side airbags were now an option.
*'''2007''' • The Terraza's last year, and all-wheel drive models were dropped. For 2007, the 3.9&amp;nbsp;L V6 was the only engine offered, however it was available with a [[flexible fuel|flex-fuel]] option. More standard features were offered on the new ''CX Plus'' model, which slotted between the ''CX'' and ''CXL''. The Terraza was removed from Buick's website in early fall 2007.

==Discontinuation==
The Terraza was discontinued after the 2007 model year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/carnews/13083/velite-coming-for-buick-velite-name-could-stand-page2.html |title=Velite Coming for Buick - Velite Name Could Stand |publisher=[[Car &amp; Driver]] |accessdate=2007-05-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602121849/http://www.caranddriver.com/carnews/13083/velite-coming-for-buick-velite-name-could-stand-page2.html |archivedate=2007-06-02 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Doraville Assembly|GM's Doraville]] plant closed on 26 September 2008.

The Terraza and related [[Buick Rendezvous|Rendezvous]] [[crossover SUV]] and the truck-based [[Buick Rainier|Rainier]] [[SUV]] were succeeded by the 8-passenger [[Buick Enclave]] crossover for 2008.

The last Terraza rolled off the assembly line on June 21, 2007.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The '''Buick LaCrosse''' is a [[mid-size]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/noframes/36457.shtml|title=Fuel Economy of the 2016 Buick LaCrosse|work=www.fueleconomy.gov|accessdate=September 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; sedan manufactured and marketed by [[Buick]] since 2004. The LaCrosse is now in its third generation, slotted above the [[Buick Regal]] as the brand's flagship vehicle.

The first-generation LaCrosse replaced the [[Buick Century|Century]] and [[Buick Regal|Regal]] in North America beginning in the 2005 model year, serving as the brand's mid-size car. The automobile was originally sold as the '''Buick Allure''' in Canada. For 2010, the LaCrosse was completely redesigned and moved upmarket as a larger premium sedan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/buick_lacrosse_2010|title=2010 Buick LaCrosse - Review|work=The Car Connection Review|accessdate=September 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2010-buick-lacrosse/|title=2010 Buick LaCrosse|work=New Car Test Drive review of redesigned upscale version|date=March 13, 2010|accessdate=September 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model was redesigned again for 2017.

Although production ended on February 15, 2019 for the North American market, the LaCrosse is still produced in China where it received a [[Buick_LaCrosse#2019_facelift|facelift]] for 2019.

[[File:2009 Buick LaCrosse CXL, blue, rear left.jpg|thumb|left|Facelift Buick LaCrosse (US, 2009; rear view)]]
The LaCrosse debuted in late 2004 as a 2005 model, replacing the Century and Regal. The name was borrowed from a Buick concept car shown in 2000 referencing the sport of [[lacrosse (sport)|lacrosse]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Riding on a revised version of the [[GM W Platform|W-body]] known as MS2000, the LaCrosse was initially available with two powerplant choices in three trim levels: a 3.8&amp;nbsp;L ''[[GM 3800 engine#L26 Naturally Aspirated|3800 Series III]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] available in base CX and mid-level CXL forms, and a 3.6&amp;nbsp;L ''[[GM High Feature engine|HFV6]]'' V6 in the top line CXS model. The CXS was replaced by the Super in the US market for the 2008 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.gm.com/us/buick/en/product_services/r_cars/r_c_lacrosse/08index.html |title=2008 Buick LaCrosse &amp; LaCrosse Super |work=GM Media Online |date=August 1, 2007 |accessdate=2009-09-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20081008080926/http://media.gm.com/us/buick/en/product_services/r_cars/r_c_lacrosse/08index.html |archivedate=October 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, sales of the CXS continued in Canada until January 1, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.gm.com/ca/gm/en/products/buick/archives/2008Allure.html |title=2008 Buick Allure &amp; Allure Super |work=GM Media Online }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Power is routed to the [[front-wheel drive|front wheels]] via a [[GM 4T60-E transmission#4T65|4T65-E]] [[automatic transmission]] (4T65-E HD on Supers). The LaCrosse, along with all other GM vehicles powered by the 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6, became the first [[SULEV]]-compliant vehicles for 2006.

This generation of LaCrosse was sold in Canada as the Buick Allure, as the verb ''crosser'' is a [[Quebec French|French Canadian]] vulgarity that can mean either "masturbation" or "scam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.lapresse.ca/actualites/201109/12/01-4442047-la-buick-lacrosse-un-nom-pas-dallure.php |title=La Buick LaCrosse ?

The final first-generation LaCrosse was manufactured on December 23, 2008.{{citation needed|date=January 2009}}

====2008====
The LaCrosse received a [[Facelift (automotive)|facelift]] for 2008. The vehicle's front end design was based on the [[Buick Velite]] concept, which was later used by the Chinese LaCrosse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/11/26/chinas-buick-lacrosse-is-cooler-than-ours/|title=China's Buick LaCrosse is cooler than ours|author=Nunez, Alex|work=Autoblog|date=November 26, 2006|accessdate=September 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All trim levels received a chrome exterior appearance package, factory remote start feature, XM Satellite Radio, telescoping steering wheel column, redundant steering wheel controls and dual-zone climate control as added standard equipment. CX added a leather-wrapped steering wheel, theft deterrent system, illuminated vanity mirrors, driver information center personalization and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2007/03/27/new-york-preview-2008-buick-lacrosse-gets-facelift/|title=New York Preview: 2008 Buick LaCrosse gets facelift|author=Neff, John|work=Autoblog|date=March 27, 2007|accessdate=September 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Super====
[[File:2009 Buick LaCrosse -- 09-07-2009.jpg|thumb|left|2009 Buick LaCrosse Super]]
A ''Super'' trim of the LaCrosse debuted for 2008. The LaCrosse Super was positioned as a higher-performance model of the sedan with revised front end styling, as well as a return of displaying four [[Ventiport]]s under the hood, a rear spoiler, projector beam fog lights, Magnasteer, larger brakes, and revised suspension tuning with standard [[Stabilitrak]]. 

Power came from the 5.3&amp;nbsp;L [[GM LS engine#LS4|LS4 small-block V8]] engine featuring [[Active Fuel Management]] technology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carsandracingstuff.com/library/articles/0424.php|title='Super' Buicks: The Return|work=The Crittenden Automotive Library|accessdate=September 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is routed to the front wheels. The combination of a V8 and [[front-wheel drive]] are not often utilized due to [[torque steer]] which is present in any front-wheel-drive car.  This powertrain was also found on the [[Pontiac Grand Prix|Grand Prix GXP]], [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala SS]], and [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo|Monte Carlo SS]]. The Super model was one of the fastest modern production Buicks ever built, with a factory top speed of {{convert|150|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, and 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph times of 5.7 seconds. Only the 1987 Buick GNX offered a similar level of performance ratings until the Super was introduced. The LaCrosse Super was discontinued in 2009.

Interior changes included special Super badged cluster with blue face, a wood grain shift knob, and dream weave leather seating.  Interior colors for the Super were Platinum and Mocha Brown, while exterior color choices were Mocha Brown Metallic, Black Onyx, Red Jewel Tincoat, and Platinum Metallic.

====Safety====
The LaCrosse received a ''Good'' overall score in the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]'s frontal impact crash test and a ''Marginal'' overall rating in the side impact test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings|title=IIHS-HLDI: Buick LaCrosse|publisher=Iihs.org|date=2008-11-25|accessdate=September 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Injury measurements for the side-impact crash test include a ''Poor'' mark for the driver's torso and a ''Marginal'' score for the driver's pelvis and leg.  Side airbags are limited to the curtain type for both front and rear rows; the torso-type side airbag is unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=962|title=IIHS-HLDI: Buick LaCrosse|publisher=Iihs.org|date=2008-11-25 |accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2007 models also earned one out of five stars in a [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] side-impact crash test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2007/02/13/buick-lacross-shamed-with-one-star-crash-performance-receives-t/|title=Buick LaCrosse shamed with one-star crash performance, receives tweaks|author=Neff, John|work=Autoblog|date=February 13, 2007|accessdate=September 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IIHS also found that the 2006–08 model year LaCrosse had the second-highest fatality rate in the large four-door car class; only the [[Buick Lucerne]] fared worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/externaldata/srdata/docs/sr4605.pdf|title=Dying in a Crash|work=Status Report|accessdate=September 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
[[Shanghai GM]] introduced the Buick LaCrosse in February 2006,  as a more upscale companion to its [[Buick Regal#China|Buick Regal]] sedan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://autoreview.belproject.com/item/17 |title=2007 Buick LaCrosse for the Chinese market |work=Auto Review Automotive Blog |date=2006-02-27 |accessdate=2009-07-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206052217/http://autoreview.belproject.com/item/17 |archivedate=2008-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by Shanghai GM's Pan Asia Technical Automotive Center ([[PATAC]]), the Chinese LaCrosse is based on the same architecture as the North American model, but possesses different exterior and interior designs, and a different engine lineup. The car is also built in Taiwan by a joint [[Yulon]]-GM venture.

In 2008, Shanghai GM introduced a mild hybrid system on the LaCrosse. Using the [[BAS Hybrid|Belt Alternator Starter]] system, it is the first hybrid vehicle in the Chinese market as well as the first hybrid in its segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2008/01/22/buick-lacrosse-hybrid-debuts-in-china/|title=Buick LaCrosse Hybrid debuts in China |author=Ramsey, Jonathon |work=Autoblog |date=January 22, 2008 |accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exterior features Buick's "[[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPorts]]" and the "[[Buick#Sweepspear|Sweepspear]]", Buick styling features dating to 1949. The interior is defined by having "few straight lines and 90-degree joints, if any.

Mechanically, the second-generation LaCrosse employed a long-wheelbase (LWB) variant of the [[GM Epsilon II platform|Epsilon II]] platform, shared with the [[Opel Insignia]] and the 2010 [[Saab 9-5]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leftlanenews.com/buick-lacrosse-invicta.html 2010 Buick Lacrosse revealed (with video)] – Left Lane News&lt;/ref&gt; The design was based on 2008 [[Buick Invicta]] concept, and replaces both the Chinese and North American models.

===Reception===
The receptions by car critics was generally positive, recognizing the LaCrosse as competitive to the [[Lexus ES]], [[Hyundai Genesis]], and [[Acura TL]].  By automotive journalists, comparisons to the [[Lexus ES 350]] generally found both cars to be roughly comparable.&lt;ref name="Buick LaCrosse vs Lexus ES 350"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.carsforsale.com/buick-lacrosse-vs-lexus-es-350/|title=Buick LaCrosse vs Lexus ES 350|work=Cars for Sale Press Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the new LaCrosse combined design elements from classic American cars of the 1930s and 1950s with traditional Chinese aesthetic elements:&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] aggregated the following ratings based on numerous reviews of the models years, also for the 2016 model year.  Results of the analysis were given on a scale of 1 to 10, where a higher number indicates positive reception. The overall result for the 2016 model year was 8.7, critics' rating 8.8, performance 8.1, interior 8.4, and safety 9.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/Buick_LaCrosse/|title=Buick LaCrosse Overview|work=U.S. News &amp; World Reports Car Rankings for Buick LaCrosse|accessdate=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seconding other critics, ''New Car Test Drive'' described the interior as,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2011-buick-lacrosse/|title=Buick LaCrosse 2011 Review|work=New Car Test Drive|accessdate=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... finely detailed, high-quality character. The more you look, the more you see. Throughout the cabin are few straight lines and 90-degree joints, if any. Instead, surfaces and controls are rounded, coved, or arched. Real stitching is used to join seams of the seats, shifter boot and soft material used on the door panels and around the instruments. Chrome and wood trim are used judiciously, tastefully, and the materials in the headliner and upper parts of the cabin look and feel like premium material.}}

===Technology and features===
The 2010 Buick LaCrosse CXS is the first North American car to incorporate a front suspension design, marketed as ''HiPer Strut'', designed to improve ride and handling and reduces [[torque steer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.gm.com/content/media/us/en/news/news_detail.brand_buick.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2010/Mar/0324_hiper_strut |title= Buick LaCrosse's Innovative HiPer Strut Suspension Delivers Improved Ride And Handling |publisher=Media.gm.com |date=March 24, 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buick LaCrosse CXS includes a system marketed as ''Real Time Damping'' that adjusts the damping forces of the shocks and struts for improved ride and handling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buick.com/vehicles/current-vehicles/lacrosse/features-specs/trims.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220143926/http://www.buick.com/vehicles/current-vehicles/lacrosse/features-specs/trims.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-12-20 |title=2012 LaCrosse Luxury Car Specs and Features |publisher=Buick |accessdate=2012-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010, 2012, and 2013 models lacked an interior trunk release mechanism. The trunk was only accessible using the key fob (remote keyless entry) or a touch sensor between the trunk lid and the license plate. The 2011 year model added a remote release button at the left of the steering wheel on the instrument panel. The 2014 model refresh returned the trunk release button to LaCrosse but placed it on the driver door.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2010/09/09/buick-lacrosse-vs-buick-regal/|title = Buick LaCrosse Vs Buick Regal|last = Nunez|first = Alex|date = 10 Sep 2010|work = Fox News|access-date = 28 Apr 2015|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150601131134/http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2010/09/09/buick-lacrosse-vs-buick-regal/|archivedate = 2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://buickforums.com/forums/threads/21272-Opening-trunk-on-a-LaCrosse|title = Buick Forum: Opening trunk on a LaCrosse|date = 30 May 2011|accessdate = |website = Buick Forum|publisher = Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd.|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2016, the LaCrosse added a new Sport Touring Edition which included unique 18" aluminum black pocket wheels and a rear lip spoiler.

====eAssist====
The 2012 LaCrosse features a new [[mild hybrid]] as its base model. Dubbed [[eAssist]], the 2012 LaCrosse introduced GM's second generation [[BAS Hybrid|belted-alternator starter]] system. The non-hybrid 4-cylinder is no longer offered. The system consists of a 115-volt [[lithium-ion battery]] pack, a 15&amp;nbsp;[[kW]] electric motor capable of adding 15 horsepower of assist while accelerating, and the next generation 6T40 GM Hydramatic transmission with reduced friction components over the previous generation. The eAssist LaCrosse delivers a class leading fuel economy of 25 mpg city and 36 mpg highway. In addition to providing additional power to the 182&amp;nbsp;hp 2.4-liter 4-cylinder, the BAS-II system allows for engine start/stop operation when the vehicle isn't moving and allows for complete fuel cut off to the engine during deceleration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cheersandgears.com/topic/73386-understanding-the-2012-buick-lacrosse-with-eassist-system/ |title=Understanding the Technology behind the Buick LaCrosse eAssist |publisher=CheersandGears.com |date=2010-12-05 |accessdate=2010-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The LaCrosse was sold in Mexico starting in 2010, as the Buick brand returned to the country after 13 years of absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insideline.com/buick/lacrosse/2010/buick-prepares-return-to-mexico.html |title=Buick Prepares Return to Mexico |first=Loriana|last=Marietta |work=Edmunds Inside Line |date=August 26, 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2016, the LaCrosse added a new Sport Touring Edition which included unique 18" aluminum black pocket wheels and a rear lip spoiler.

===Canadian market: Allure===
The 2nd generation LaCrosse debuted to the Canadian market at the 2009 [[Montreal International Auto Show]] as the Buick Allure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://autoshow.autotrader.ca/2009/01/20/eight-canadian-premieres-at-ford-and-gm/ |title=Eight Canadian Premieres at Ford and GM |work=AutoTrader.ca |date=January 20, 2009 |accessdate=2009-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon after production began, General Motors Canada renamed the Allure to LaCrosse, to correspond with the car's global marketing.&lt;ref name='Cancilla'&gt;{{cite web | last = Cancilla | first = Patricia | date = September 3, 2009 | url = https://nationalpost.com/cars/story.html?id=1963251 | title = Buick Allure now LaCrosse in Canada | work = [[National Post]] | accessdate = 2009-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; GM Canada has offered existing Allure owners the option to change nameplates to LaCrosse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gminsidenews.com/forums/f70/canada-buick-allure-now-called-lacrosse-83787/ |title=Canada: Buick Allure Now Called LaCrosse |author=Saporito, Nick |work=GM Inside News |date=September 3, 2009 |accessdate=2009-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Quebec French, "la crosse" is slang for "sexual self-gratification", or also a scam.

{{anchor|Alpheon}}

===Korean market: Alpheon===
The '''Alpheon''' was a localized version of the Buick LaCrosse for the South Korean market. ''Alpheon'' was a standalone brand from [[GM Korea]]. The cars were additionally fitted with amenities such as controls in the rear armrest, mood lights and more.  A version of the vehicle (with 3.0-liter V-6 engine, six-speed automatic transmission) was unveiled at the 2010 [[Busan]] International Motor Show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2010/04/30/buick-lacrosse-rebranded-as-daewoo-alpheon-in-south-korea/ Buick LaCrosse rebranded as Daewoo Alpheon in South Korea]&lt;/ref&gt;

Production began on August 9, 2010 at GM Daewoo's factory in [[Bupyeong District|Bupyeong]], Incheon. Market launch began in September 2010. Early model includes a model with 3.0-liter engine (from 2010 Buick LaCrosse) in mid-September, followed by two models each with 2.4-liter engine in October.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2010/08/10/2010081000322.html GM Daewoo Starts Production of Alpheon Luxury Sedan] in ''The Chosunilbo'', 10 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gminsidenews.com/forums/f13/gm-daewoo-announces-alpheon-luxury-sedan-91423/ |title=GM Daewoo Announces Alpheon Luxury Sedan – GM Inside News Forum |publisher=Gminsidenews.com |date=2010-04-28 |accessdate=2010-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alpheon was discontinued in 2015, after monthly sales fell below 500 cars.  GM Korea replaced it with the [[Chevrolet Impala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/gm-launches-impala-in-south-korea-1439258404|title=GM Launches Impala in South Korea|author=In-Soo Nam|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=2015-08-10|accessdate=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Roewe 950}}

===Chinese market: Roewe 950===
The [[Roewe 950]] is a licensed restyled Chinese version of the Buick LaCrosse produced by [[Roewe]] of [[Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation|SAIC]]. It is sold alongside the Buick LaCrosse in China, and has a price range similar to that of the LaCrosse. The sheet metal, while similar in appearance, is unique to the Roewe.

In late February 2012, the Chinese government took the Buick LaCrosse (along with all other foreign vehicles) off of the list of vehicles approved for government procurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/02/28/china-issues-list-of-approved-vehicles-for-government-purchase/ |title=China issues list of approved vehicles for government purchase, excludes imports for first time |first=Jonathon|last=Ramsey |work=Autoblog |date=February 28, 2012 |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though popular among government officials the LaCrosse also thrives via private purchases. Effects on sales remains to be seen.

===2014 facelift===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Buick unveiled a revised 2014 LaCrosse at the 2013 [[New York Auto Show]]. Redesigned front and rear fascias, new wheel designs, a reconfigurable 8 inch TFT instrument cluster, semi-aniline leather seating, and radar- and camera-based safety features such as [[Collision avoidance system|forward collision alert]] and side blind zone alert highlight the changes for this [[Facelift (automotive)|mid-cycle refresh]].

===Production===
Production of North American models moved from Oshawa to the [[Fairfax Assembly]] plant in [[Kansas City, Kansas]], where it runs down the same production line as the [[Chevrolet Malibu]].&lt;ref name='kcstar1'&gt;{{cite news |title=Buick announces starting price of $27,835 for 2010 LaCrosse |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/04/08/buick-announces-starting-price-of-27-835-for-2010-lacrosse |author=Korzeniewski, Jeremy |work=Autoblog |date=April 8, 2009 |accessdate=2009-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delivery of 2010 year models was delayed a few weeks in order to assure quality control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=8467013 |title=GM Delays New Buick Shipments on Quality Concerns |work=ABC News |date=September 1, 2009 |accessdate=2009-09-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919074904/http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=8467013 |archivedate=September 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Production for China started a month later.

The platform switch reduced its weight by about {{convert|300|lb|kg}}, despite slightly growing in length and width. The weight reduction was achieved by use of high-strength steels and better sound-absorbing material. The car is powered by a [[GM Small Gasoline Engine]] and [[GM Ecotec engine]] in China for tax credit purposes and by a Fourth Generation [[GM High Feature engine]] in North America.  Starting 2018, the LaCrosse comes standard with an eAssist drivetrain, consisting of a mild hybrid {{convert|20|kW|hp|adj=on}} electric and 2.5-liter Ecotec gasoline engine sending power to the front wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission.&lt;ref&gt;https://media.buick.com/media/us/en/buick/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2017/jun/0605-2018-lacrosse.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to make room for an upcoming new product in the Kansas City, KS facility, the production of the LaCrosse was moved from [[General Motors Fairfax Assembly Plant|GM Fairfax Assembly]] to [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly]].

*Starting 2018 an all-new 9-speed GM 9T60 (M3G) automatic transmission with the optional V6.

===Safety===

The 2017 LaCrosse received a ''Top Safety Pick'' in the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]'s [[Crashworthiness]] test and a ''Poor'' rating for headlights, which prevented a ''Top Safety Pick Plus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/buick/lacrosse-4-door-sedan/2017|title=2017 Buick LaCrosse|work=IIHS|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LaCrosse comes standard with 10 air bags including front air bags, roof rail-mounted head-curtain air bags, seat-mounted side-impact air bags for both front and rear outboard seat passengers, and knee air bags for front seat passengers. Additional standard safety features include Ultra-sonic rear parking assist, and backup camera. Optional safety features include a following distance indicator, forward collision alert, forward collision braking, front pedestrian detection, blind spot detection, lane keeping assist, and rear-cross traffic alert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2017-buick-lacrosse-in-depth-model-review-2017-buick-lacrosse-safety-and-driver-assistance-review-car-and-driver-page-9|title=2017 Buick LaCrosse|work=Car and Driver|access-date=2018-08-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewers were critical of the gear selector, however, with Consumer Reports stating, "Our biggest gripe about the controls is the new electronic gear selector. Drivers used to a traditional PRNDL configuration—in other words, those drivers who kept the lights on for Buick for many years—will be puzzled, if not angered."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.consumerreports.org/lacrosse/2017-buick-lacrosse-first-drive-review/|title=Redesigned 2017 Buick LaCrosse Walks a Fine Line|work=Consumer Reports|access-date=2018-08-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, reviewers were critical of the sticker price on top trim, heavily optioned models with Bloomberg stating, "by the time you spend the $48,395 it costs to get the LaCrosse to this level, you're creeping into Audi/BMW/Mercedes territory. A [[BMW 5 Series]] costs $50,000; a [[BMW 4 Series|4 Series]] costs $41,000."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-19/2017-buick-lacrosse-review|title=The 2017 Buick LaCrosse Is Better Than You Think|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-08-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discontinuation===

The '''Buick Apollo''' is a [[compact car]] that was manufactured from 1973 to 1975 by [[Buick]]. It was based on the [[GM X platform (RWD)|GM X platform]] [[badge engineering|along with]] the [[Oldsmobile Omega]], [[Chevrolet Nova]], and the [[Pontiac Ventura]]. The car was named for the Greek god [[Apollo]].

It was available as a coupe, two-door hatchback, or four-door sedan. The two-door models were renamed [[Buick Skylark|Skylark]] for 1975; only the sedan carried the Apollo nameplate for that year. A total of 112,901 Apollos were built.&lt;ref name='prod'&gt;The total does not include Buick Skylarks for 1975.

* {{cite web |title=1975 Buick Production Figures |url=http://buicks.net/years/75.shtml |publisher=Buicks.net |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apollo was powered by a standard {{convert|250|cuin|L|1|sing=on}} [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine#250|Chevrolet]] inline six or an optional {{convert|350|cuin|L|1|sing=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#350|Buick]] V8, available with either a two- or four-barrel carburetor. A three-speed manual transmission was standard, with a three-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] optional. The [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#260|Oldsmobile 260]] was added as the base V8 option for 1975. 

Standard equipment on the Apollo included a semi-closed cooling system, manual brakes with finned front drums, coil spring front suspension with stabilizer bar, extensive use of insulation and sound deadening materials, flow-through ventilation system, full-foam seats, front and rear ashtrays, reinforced front bumpers, carpeting, roof drip moldings, and front and rear wheel opening moldings.

Options included variable-ratio power steering, power drum or power front disc brakes, E78x14 bias-belted tires, custom cloth interior trim, convenience center storage compartment, tilt steering wheel, climate control air conditioning with low Freon detector switch, rear window defogger (blower), tinted glass, sport mirrors with drivers remote control, bumper protective strips with white accent stripe- front and rear, bumper guards front and rear, color-coordinated body protective side moldings, deluxe wheel covers, deluxe wire wheel covers, chrome-plated styled wheels (Buick rally wheels) and a custom vinyl top. Steel-belted tires were introduced in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1975_Buick/1975_Buick_Brochure/1975%20Buick-17.html |title=Directory Index: Buick/1975_Buick/1975_Buick_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no conventional antenna mounted on the body of the car. Instead, two wires were embedded in the layers of glass in the windshield.

The 1974 Apollo debuted with only subtle differences. A chrome strip above the grille and roof-mounted safety restraints were added. A '''GSX''' package became available on the coupe for 1974, however, it was purely cosmetic changes, lacking the performance upgrades that distinguished it in previous years. It was available in red or white and featured a blacked-out grille, unique striping, white vinyl bucket seats with red interior accents, and wire wheel covers. The GSX was available with the straight six or either 350 V8, and could be ordered with any of the optional equipment available to other Apollo models.

The 1975 Apollo was only available as a four-door sedan and adopted the redesigned X-body shell with a boxier European look which replaced the former Coke-bottle shape. For 1976, the Apollo nameplate was dropped entirely, with the sedan renamed Skylark to rejoin the coupe and hatchback.

The '''Buick Reatta''' is a low-volume [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|transverse front-engine, front-wheel drive]], two-door, two-seater [[grand tourer]]/[[sports car]] manufactured and marketed by [[Buick]] as a coupe (1988–1991) and convertible (1990-1991) &amp;mdash; both featuring a 3.8 liter V6 engine and [[GM V platform (FWD)|shortened version]] of the [[GM E platform]], the same one that underpinned the [[Buick Riviera]].

As Buick's first two-seater and its first [[convertible]] since the 1985 [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]], the Reatta was manufactured in a highly specialized assembly program at the Reatta Craft Center (later known as the [[Lansing Craft Center]]) in [[Lansing, Michigan]]&amp;mdash;achieving production of over 21,000 units in four years.&lt;ref name="nyt02"&gt;{{cite news
  | title = G.M. Ends Reatta
  | publisher = The New York Times, May 16, 1991
  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/16/business/company-news-gm-ends-reatta.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of the [[Chevrolet Corvette]], [[Pontiac Fiero]] and [[Cadillac Allanté]] at the time of the Reatta's introduction meant that with the exception of [[Oldsmobile]], all of GM's passenger-car divisions offered two-seaters during the late 1980s and early 1990s.

==Overview==
Assembly at the Reatta Craft Center was performed at a series of stations each with a specialized team of workers, rather than on a conventional [[assembly line]].  After a team had completed their portion of the assembly, the car would be moved by robots to the next station.  Paintwork was performed on site under subcontract to [[PPG Industries]].

The Reatta used GM's [[transverse engine|transverse]] "[[Buick V6 engine#Pre-Series I|Buick 3800]]" [[V6]] with 165–170&amp;nbsp;hp (123–127&amp;nbsp;kW) and 210–220&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (285–298&amp;nbsp;N·m) of [[torque]] with the highest output in the last year of production. The car sported a fully [[independent suspension]], 4 wheel [[disc brake]]s with ABS, and [[front wheel drive]]. Top speed was electronically limited to 125&amp;nbsp;mph (201&amp;nbsp;km/h). The Reatta was rated at 18&amp;nbsp;mpg (13.1&amp;nbsp;L/100&amp;nbsp;km) in the city and 27&amp;nbsp;mpg (8.7&amp;nbsp;L/100&amp;nbsp;km) on the highway.

The Reatta was intended as a [[halo car]] for Buick with projected production of 20,000 units a year.  GM announced the end of production in early 1991.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Features==
{{refimprove|date=February 2015}}

[[File:1988 Buick Reatta, rear left.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view (1988 coupe)]]
The Reatta featured twin bucket seats with a storage area behind the seats featuring two lockable bins&lt;ref name="nyt01"/&gt; and a lockable access hatch to the rear trunk.  At introduction, options included 16-way power seats in lieu of 6-way power seats, side moldings in either black or body color and pinstripe delete.  A sunroof became optional in late 1988, and in 1989 keyless entry was added as a standard feature.{{or|date=February 2015}}

Initially (1988-89), the Reatta featured a [[touchscreen]] computer interface, marketed as the ''Electronic Control Center'' (ECC), that included radio and climate control functions, date reminder, [[trip computer]], user-configurable overspeed alarm as well as diagnostic access to the vehicle's electronic systems and sensors.  Later models were equipped with conventional push button stereo and climate controls.  The new system eliminated trip computer functionality and the climate control buttons could access diagnostic information, replacing diagnostic scanner capability formerly provided by the touchscreen.

In 1990, the interior was redesigned, adding a driver's airbag and an optional [[compact disk|CD]] player.  In 1991, the "L27" 3800 engine and 4T60-E transmission replaced the "LN3" and hydraulic 4T60 units and the Reatta received a new ABS system, new 16" wheels, [[headlamp#automatic headlamps|automatic headlamps]] and a cup holder built into the armrest.{{or|date=February 2015}}

Each Reatta included a leather book containing the owner's manual and pen. In 1990 and 1991, a zippered owners folio was included holding the owners manual, pen, flashlight, tire gauge as well as a "Craftsman's Log" with the signatures of the supervisors for the car's assembly.{{or|date=February 2015}}

In 1988, approximately fifty five examples were designated "Select Sixties" and allocated to Buick's top sixty. The models, internally designated model X22, featured a black exterior, tan interior and unique special Select Sixty hood emblem.{{or|date=February 2015}}

In 1990, the Select Sixty program was repeated, as sixty five white convertibles including special emblems, and a flame red interior with white bucket seats, white 16 inch wheels, and cup holder.

==Convertible==
After a delayed introduction due to design difficulties,&lt;ref name="nyt01"&gt;{{cite news
  | title = Buick Introduces Reatta Convertible
  | publisher = The New York Times, September 8, 1989
  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/08/business/company-news-buick-introduces-reatta-convertible.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buick introduced the [[convertible (car)|convertible]] Reatta in 1990 with a manually-operated top designed by [[American Specialty Cars|ASC]], available in vinyl or cloth with a glass rear window and electric defroster.  When retracted, the top was protected by a rigid [[tonneau]] cover.  The 1991 models featured power pull-down motors to assist in tightening the rear bow of the top to the tonneau cover.

A Buick convertible would not be offered again until the four-seat [[Buick Cascada]] debuted in 2016.

==Production==
[[File:Reattaemblem.jpg|right|thumb|Buick Reatta emblem]]
The first pilot car was finished at the Reatta Craft Centre in December 1986.&lt;ref name=PR05&gt;{{citation | type = Press Release | title = 1988 Buick Reatta: Development History | location = Flint, MI | date = 1988-01-15 | publisher = Buick Motor Division | url = https://www.reatta.net/newspaper/pr/010103_pr3.html | page = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Series production began in January 1988 and ended on May 10, 1991. The original car was sometimes referred to as a "1988½ model year", owing to its January introduction. However, various accounts of much earlier and later cars exist, and the handbuilt nature of the car and long development cycle makes accurately dating production difficult.{{or|date=February 2015}}

The '''Buick Model B''' was [[Buick]]'s first model. It was built in [[Jackson, Michigan]] and was introduced in 1905 at the [[New York Auto Show]].{{r|"american-automobiles"}} [[William C. Durant]] introduced the car himself at the exhibit, and took new car orders at the car show. It had a 2-cylinder, horizontally opposed engine – the world's first production OHV (overhead valve) engine – installed lengthwise within the frame, had a planetary transmission, with a cone clutch and two forward speeds and one reverse gear. The engine was rated at 21 bhp.{{r|"Norbye Dunne 1978"}} In later years, it was renamed as improvements were made.

The '''Buick Master Six''' was an automobile built by [[Buick]] from 1925 to 1928. Before then, Buick was using the six-cylinder 242 engine in their high-end cars and a four-cylinder engine in their smaller, less-expensive cars, but for 1925, they dropped the four-cylinder engine and designed a small six, which they called the Standard 6, to replace that end of the market. They coined the name "Master Six" for the high-end cars, now powered by the 255 engine released the year before. 

Buick named their six-cylinder cars "Buick 6" from 1916 through 1924, and in 1925, divided them into Standard 6 and Master 6.&lt;ref&gt;p. 86, "Seventy Years of Buick" by George H. Dammann, Crestline Publishing, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The Master 6 was renamed Series 121 and 129 in 1929 and Series 40 in 1930. All were powered by a [[Buick Straight-6 engine]], with multiple body styles, and starting in 1926 used the newly established [[GM B platform]], which it shared with [[Oldsmobile]]. Although Buick produced mostly four-cylinder cars in the teens and early '20s, as it had been doing, the new six=cylinder cars became more common. Buick first made six-cylinder cars in 1914, with a 331-cubic-inch engine, which was originally a racing engine, later used in limited production as the Series 50. The 331 engine was dropped in 1916 and replaced with the much smaller 40 series engine, starting with a 224-cubic-inch in 1916 and 1917, the 242 engine from 1918, increased to 255 in 1924, increased again to 274 for 1926 through 1928. The engine was increased again to 309 for the Series 121 and 129 in 1929 and Series 40 in 1930, after which all six-cylinder engines were suddenly dropped and all models of Buick were equipped with the legendary [[Buick Straight-8 engine|Straight 8]], starting in 1931 and for decades thereafter.

The Master Six was Buick's high-end offering, above the Standard Six. It was also manufactured from [[knock-down kit]]s at GM's short-lived Japanese factory at [[List of General Motors factories#Closed or sold factories|Osaka Assembly]] in [[Osaka, Japan]]. It was an all-new platform joining the smaller Model 10, and was replaced by the [[Buick Series 50]], and the [[Buick Series 60]].

Starting in 1916, when this generation was introduced, different models were known by a designation that changed yearly. It began as the Series D in 1916, followed by E in 1918, H in 1919, and K in 1920. Beginning with 1921 until 1924, it changed to Series 21, denoting the year, to Series 24 (for 1924). Beginning with the letter designations, the Series D had additional numeric designations for the body style, 44, 45, 46, and 47, designating touring car, roadster, sedan, and coupe. The Series E, H, and K continued using the numeric designations for body styles but added additional designations for longer wheelbases and bodywork (44, 45, 46, 47, 49, 50). The numbered series vehicles added additional body styles called Pullman Saloon, Country Club, and Town Car, adding numeric designations (54, and 55 for 1922, 41 for 1923). The year 1924 continued to use the previous numeric designations without any changes.

Starting with 1925, the series designation changed back to numeric designations, but this time they signified the wheelbase used (120, 121, and 129).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The Master Six was also sold with a smaller vehicle, called the [[Buick Standard Coach|Standard Six]], later the Series 115, and Series 116. They were replaced with the [[Buick Series 40|Series 40]].

{{Refimprove|date=April 2013}}

The '''T-Type''' is a series of [[Buick]] automobiles that were popular during the 1980s. This marketing approach for Buick products was a revival of a similar approach used in the 1960s (and later revived in the 1990s) with the [[Buick Gran Sport|Buick GS]] designation.
{{commons category|Buick T-type}}

==History==
Thes T-Type cars were built as performance-oriented models, the most famous of which was the [[Buick GNX]] (based on the [[Buick Regal|Regal]] platform). During the time that the T-Type cars were in production, [[turbocharger]]s were becoming very popular in the aftermarket performance industry, and in [[Detroit]], they were adopted for use on production vehicles, the most notable of which was the Regal.

The first model to receive the T-Type badge was the 1981 [[Buick Riviera]]. Within a few years, other models from the Buick lineup would follow suit. The Grand National (also referred to as "GN"), an adaptation of the Regal T-Type and introduced in 1982, became an instant success; it inspired the company to extend its T-Type line to its other mid-size offering, the [[Buick Century|Century]] (though without the turbocharged engine). The compact [[Buick Skyhawk|Skyhawk]] and [[Buick Skylark|Skylark]] also received the T-Type treatment in 1983, and in 1986 the [[Buick Somerset|Somerset]] did as well.

The T-Type series reached its peak in 1987. By that time, even the full-size [[Buick LeSabre|LeSabre]] and [[Buick Electra|Electra]] were available as T-Type models, but without the turbocharger. The Lesabre T-Type coupe design was a different approach, pieced together from design highlights of the rare 1986 Lesabre Grand National (116 built), and although odd-looking, was a more cohesive touring car package. Also that year, the GNX made automotive history as "the fastest American car in 1987" (a distinction it held through 1989, which was the Regal's second year as a front-wheel drive car). The GNX recorded a 0-60 time of 4.7 seconds, and its "fast car" reputation led many people to dub it "Corvette killer."  In addition, its turbocharged V6 made it an attractive alternative to its similar-bodied V8-powered siblings, such as the [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo|Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS]] and [[Oldsmobile 442]] (neither of which had the turbocharger available to them).

==Legacy==
The T-Type line met its demise in 1990, as an option on the Buick Electra, and the following year, a new, upsized [[Buick Park Avenue|Park Avenue Ultra]] was introduced with a [[supercharger|supercharged engine]]. The Riviera and Regal also had supercharged engines as an option when they were redesigned in 1995 and 1997, respectively; the current Regal also has a turbocharger as an option, starting with its return to the lineup in 2011, as do the 2012 [[Buick Verano]] and 2014 [[Buick Encore]].

The turbocharged engines were usually [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]]' famous 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 engine, but in the case of the Skyhawk, a turbocharged four-cylinder was available (1.8 sourced from Brazil in the Skyhawk, 2.5 in the Skylark/Somerset). Transmission choices were a five-speed manual (Skyhawk only) and, depending on the year and model, a three- or four-speed automatic. The interiors of T-Type cars differed from most other Buicks in that the front seats were almost always bucket seats, and the shifter was mounted in the center console, except the 1981-85 Rivieras which had the buckets and a consolette but a column shifter. Some T-Type Electras and Centurys kept the front bench seats and column shifter intact and even in bucket seat models, the T-Type Electra and Century still had a column-mounted shifter. By comparison, the turbocharged editions of the 2011 Regal and 2012 Verano use a 2.0&amp;nbsp;L four-cylinder engine that can be mated to either a manual or automatic transmission (both six-speeds), and the Encore uses a 1.4&amp;nbsp;L four-cylinder engine that is mated to a six-speed automatic only.

The T-Type logo consisted of a large red letter "T", and the word "Type" in small black or white letters. The emblems were only placed on the fenders and on some later models (1986) a grille emblem was used. The single T was only used on the turbo Regals and only in 1987. Originally the T-type name was to be an appearance package and used across the line (which it did) but was confused by the turbo Regal when the 3.8 turbo motor could be ordered with the T-type package. In 1987 Buick dropped the T-Type package on the Regal. All turbo Regals in 1987 came with the Y56 T package and have a T badge on the fenders and on the horn button (a similar T badge also appears on the current Regal Turbo and Verano Turbo). This T package is often erroneously thought to designate the Turbo T package, which is solely the WE4 Regal.

As a drag racer, the GN's main opponent is the [[Ford Mustang]], a prime example of GM's long-standing rivalry with [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. In addition, the GNX is featured in the popular [[racing game]] [[Gran Turismo 4]]. In 1984, the GN's legend grew when it defeated a [[Chevrolet Corvette (C5)|Corvette]] in a quarter-mile run featuring GM vehicles, thus creating a rare instance of "the fastest American car" that was not made by Chevrolet (despite the fact that it had two less cylinders than the normally-aspirated sports car).

==Possible Return==
It has been rumored that the T-Type, Grand National and GNX nameplates could return to the Buick lineup, to be sold as 4-door sedans. These new incarnations would share a rear-wheel drive platform with the [[Cadillac ATS]] and be powered by a choice of two engines that would be mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission or 6-speed manual.  The T-Type and Grand National would use a turbocharged 2.0L 4-cylinder (272 HP) or a naturally aspirated 3.6L V6 (321 HP) while the GNX would most likely get a 3.6L Twin-Turbo V6 (400 HP). This would be the  first use of rear-wheel drive since the [[Buick Roadmaster]] was discontinued in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/11/26/buick-dusting-off-grand-national-gnx-and-t-type-nameplates |title=Buick Dusting Off Grand National, GNX and T-Type Nameplates |publisher=Autoblog.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Buick Rainier''' is a [[mid-size]] [[SUV]] that was manufactured by General Motors and marketed by Buick for model years 2004-2007, replacing the [[Oldsmobile Bravada]].

==History==
[[File:2005 Buick Rainier 2.2.18.jpg|thumb|left|2005 Buick Rainier rear]]
The Rainier was introduced on July 28, 2003 for the 2004 model year, in a 5-door, 5-passenger configuration, yet was one of only five [[GM GMT platform#GMT 360|GMT360]] SUVs to offer a V8 [[Internal combustion engine|engine]] &amp;mdash; along with the [[GMC Envoy]] Denali, [[Isuzu Ascender]] EXT, [[Saab 9-7X]] 5.3i and Aero, and [[Chevrolet TrailBlazer]] LT (optional) and SS. Both [[rear wheel drive|rear]] and [[all-wheel drive]] models were offered. An upscale ''CXL'' trim added a better [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] stereo and [[XM Satellite Radio]]. For the 2004 model year only, there was a CXL Plus trim level with a touchscreen navigation system.

[[File:Buick Rainier.JPG|thumb|left|2006–2007 Buick Rainier]]

Buick also debuted the QuietTuning sound insulation on the Rainier, where a vehicle's sound dampening featured triple door seals, acoustic laminate glass, and thicker sound-absorbing pads on the hood and firewall.

The Rainier was discontinued after the 2007 model year and was replaced by the [[Buick Enclave]] in 2008.  GM would end production of the related [[Chevrolet TrailBlazer]], [[GMC Envoy]], and [[Saab 9-7X]] after the 2009 model year.  The last of those three, a white GMC Envoy rolled off the line on December 23, 2008, when the Moraine plant closed.

The [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS) gave the 2004 Rainier an overall ''Marginal'' score for front impacts while the 2005 and newer models are given an ''Acceptable'' score.  In side impacts the Rainier was given an overall ''Marginal'' score with side airbags present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/ratingsbyseries.aspx?id=497 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Buick Rainier |publisher=Iihs.org |accessdate=2009-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924101933/http://www.iihs.org/ratings/ratingsbyseries.aspx?id=497# |archive-date=2012-09-24 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recall==

In 2012, [[General Motors]] had recalled more than 258,000 SUVs in the U.S. And Canada to fix short-circuits in power window and door lock switches that could cause fires. The recall covered Chevrolet TrailBlazer, [[GMC Envoy]], Buick Rainier, [[Isuzu Ascender]], and [[Saab 9-7X]] SUVs from the 2006 to the 2007 model years. The SUVs were sold or registered in 20 U.S. states, Washington, D.C., and in Canada, where salt and other chemicals are used to clear roads in the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GM recalls SUVs for fire hazard|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/18/business/gm-recall/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Buick Regal''' is an upscale [[mid-size]]d [[car|automobile]] that was first introduced by [[Buick]] for the 1973 model year. The model was originally positioned as a [[personal luxury car]], and typically offered in both [[Coupé|coupe]] and [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] forms until 1997, when the Regal became sedan-only due to the decline of the personal luxury coupe market. For certain model years between 1973 and 2004, the Regal shared bodies and powertrains with the similar [[Buick Century]], although the Regal was positioned as a more upmarket vehicle.

The Regal was discontinued in the North American market in 2004, being succeeded by the [[Buick LaCrosse]]. In 2008, a new version of the Regal was introduced for the Chinese market, which is a [[Rebadging|badge engineered]] version of the [[Opel Insignia]]. The new Regal was introduced to the North American market in 2011, positioned as a mid-size vehicle. A new model was introduced for 2018, which is offered in a [[liftback]] sedan and a "TourX" [[station wagon]] version.  GM plans to discontinue the Regal in the North American market after the 2020 model year, making Buick exclusively an SUV/CUV marque there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2019/12/04/buick-regal-discontinued-gm-general-motors/2607182001/|title=General Motors kills the Buick Regal: GM continues to cut passenger cars|last=Bomey|first=Nathan|website=USA TODAY|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motor1.com/news/386005/buick-regal-dead-after-2020my/|title=Buick Regal Dead After 2020MY Because Customers Want Crossovers|work=[[Motorsport Network|Motor1.com]]|last=Padeanu|first=Adrian|date=4 December 2019|accessdate=4 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30120611/buick-regal-dead/|title=Buick Regal Is Dead, Leaving Buick with an All-SUV Lineup|work=[[Car and Driver]]|last=Capparella|first=Joey|date=4 December 2019|accessdate=4 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buick-Regal-(A-body)-Vilnius-Lithuania-back.jpg|thumb|left|1976 Buick Regal sedan]]

[[Buick]] had been the first GM division to bring a [[personal luxury car]] to market with its 1963 [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]], but was otherwise slow to react to the developing lower-priced mid-size personal luxury market, which [[Pontiac]] created with the 1969 [[Pontiac Grand Prix|Grand Prix]] and [[Chevrolet]] with the [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo|Monte Carlo]] the following year, 1970. At the same time, [[Oldsmobile]] added a formal notchback coupé to its intermediate line, the [[Cutlass Supreme]], in 1970 and that model soon became Olds' best selling intermediate. Buick did not get its own personal luxury coupe until the GM intermediates were redesigned in 1973, the so-called "Colonnade" cars that eliminated hardtop models completely. In a curious name swap, the Skylark name was dropped from Buick's intermediate line and instead the Century nameplate, last used in the 1950s, was revived for them.

A highly trimmed, two-door [[coupe]], the first Regal, officially marketed as the "Century Regal Colonnade Hardtop coupe", shared its front and rear styling with its Century parent with distinctions amounting to differing grilles and taillight lenses. The Regal shared the same "Colonnade" [[Hardtop|pillared hardtop]] roofline (a [[hardtop]] with [[Pillar (car)|B-pillars (center pillars)]] but frameless doors unlike a sedan body) and greenhouse (window area) with the Grand Prix, Monte Carlo, and Cutlass Supreme as well as the lower-priced Buick Century Luxus coupe. Like its corporate cousins, the Regal (and Luxus) featured the newly fashionable opera windows, which were small fixed rear-side windows surrounded by sheetmetal, instead of the traditional roll-down windows.

For the first [[model year]] in 1973, the Regal nameplate was only used for Buick's version of the GM intermediate [[personal luxury car|personal luxury]] [[coupe]], but the following year gained a [[sedan (car)|sedan]] companion (there was no Regal [[station wagon]]).

Regal interiors were generally more luxurious than lesser Century models with woodgrain trim on [[dashboard]] and [[door panel]]s, along with door-pull straps and [[bench seat]]s with center [[armrest]]s with cloth, velour, or vinyl upholstery. Optionally available throughout the run was a 60/40 split bench seat with [[armrest]]. For 1976 and 1977, the Regal [[coupé|coupe]] was available with the S/R option that included reclining bucket seats with corduroy upholstery.

The model lasted five years with minimal changes, although there was a fairly substantial facelift in coupes for 1976 (sedans retained their original 1973 sheetmetal through 1977), which incorporated the recently-legalized rectangular headlights (horizontally mounted on coupes, and vertically on [[sedan (car)|sedan]]s—much like the mid-1960s Pontiacs). The Regal coupe sold reasonably well, although it lagged behind the Monte Carlo and Cutlass Supreme which had become the best-selling cars in America by 1976.

The Regal was most commonly powered by [[Buick V8 engine#350|Buick's {{convert|350|cuin|L|abbr=on}} V8]], which was standard equipment on all models for 1973 and 1974, and optional on coupes but standard on sedans from 1975 to 1977, and the larger [[Buick V8 engine#455|{{convert|455|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8]] was optional for 1973 and 1974 models only. Starting in 1975, Regal coupes came standard with Buick's resurrected {{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V6 engine]] previously offered on the 1964–1967 [[Buick Skylark|Skylark]]; the engine's tooling had been sold to [[Kaiser Motors]] for use in [[Jeep]] models (Kaiser was purchased by American Motors in 1970 and Jeep became an AMC division) and sold back to GM by AMC in 1974. For 1975 and 1976, the Century and Regal were the only mid-sized cars in America to offer V6 engines. The bolt pattern for this vehicle is 5×{{convert|4+3/4|in|mm|1}}.

The Century designation was quietly dropped from the Regal for 1975.

A downsized Regal appeared for the 1978 model year with Buick's new {{convert|196|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V6 engine]] as standard equipment and a revised version of the venerable {{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V6 as an option (which became standard for 1980). Initially, a three-speed [[manual transmission]] was standard but this was later replaced by an automatic. At the time of introduction, Regals were available exclusively as [[coupé]]s with the [[Buick Century|Century]] nameplate applied to bread-and-butter sedans and [[station wagon]]s.&lt;ref name="buick"&gt;{{Cite book | ref = SCBuick | title = Standard Catalog of Buick, 1903-2004 | edition = 3 | first = John | last = Gunnell | publisher = Krause Publications, Inc. | location = Iola, WI | page = 182 | date = 2004 | isbn = 0-87349-760-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1982 the Century was replaced by an all-new car on the [[front-wheel drive]] [[GM A platform (1982)|A platform]], which meant that the Regal gained a four-door sedan and five-door station wagon - essentially facelifted and [[Badge|rebadged]] versions of the previous year's [[rear-wheel drive]] Century. It was the first time the name appeared on a full model lineup. The wagon was discontinued after 1983, and the sedan dropped from the lineup the next year.&lt;ref name=stdB&gt;[[#SCBuick|Gunnell]], pp. 218, 224&lt;/ref&gt; This generation Regal lasted ten years. The base model was equipped with softer-riding luxury [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], and did not offer a manual transmission in later years.

The 1978 Regal could be equipped with a {{convert|3791|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} [[Turbocharged]] V6 engine with [[automatic transmission]], and was known as a Regal Sport Coupe. Turbo versions were offered with either a two- or a four-barrel [[carburetor]]. The [[Buick LeSabre]] was also available with the turbocharged engine. The only other turbocharged cars available in the U.S. market in 1978 were imports from [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Porsche 930|Porsche]] and [[Saab Automobile|Saab]]. The Regal Sport Coupe also included a firm [[Car handling|handling]] suspension with larger tires and sport wheels.  Bucket seats and a center console with a T-shifter were also available.

A major facelift for 1981 gave the Regal a much more aerodynamic profile, helping make it possible for the car to compete on the [[NASCAR]] racing circuit. The sloping [[Hood (car)|hood]] and nose of the car made it the favorite of several NASCAR teams. [[Richard Petty]] drove one to victory in the [[1981 Daytona 500]], and the car won a majority of the 1981 and 1982 seasons races and won the NASCAR manufacturers title in 1981 and 1982.

[[V8 engine|V8]]s for street use were still available, but had shrunk to {{convert|265|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} (1980 and 1981 only, [[Pontiac]] built), and the V6 was rapidly gaining popularity. From 1986 to 1987, the [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#307|{{convert|307|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8]] was available as an option. The {{convert|3791|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} 2-bbl V6 was standard. The [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM200-4R|200-4R]] [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] was an option with either engine.

For 1980, the Regal was offered in a special '''Somerset Limited Edition''' [[Trim level (automobile)|trim]] which featured unique tan and dark blue designer exterior paint, wire wheel covers, sport [[Wing mirror|mirrors]], and chrome Somerset badging. The interior had tan and blue plush [[velour]] [[Upholstery#Automobile upholstery|upholstery]], brushed [[Chrome plating#Automotive use|chrome]] trim, and additional Somerset badging. A Somerset Limited Edition model was also offered on the restyled 1981 Regal. It had unique dark sandstone and camel exterior paint, sport mirrors, and turbine wheels. The interior plush velour upholstery was camel with dark brown piping.

=== Grand National, Turbo-T, T-Type, and GNX ===
In February 1982, the Regal Grand National debuted, which was named for the [[NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|NASCAR Winston Cup Grand National Series]] (the "Grand National" term was part of the Cup series nomenclature until 1986).&lt;ref&gt;http://legendarydreamcargarage.com/dreamcargarage/539&lt;/ref&gt; Buick had won the Manufacturers Cup in 1981 and 1982, and wanted to capitalize on its success: "What wins on Sunday, sells on Monday". These 1982 cars were not painted black, which may confuse those not familiar with them. All started out as charcoal gray Regals that were shipped off to a subcontractor for finishing.

Originally intended for a run of 100 units, Cars and Concepts of [[Brighton, Michigan]], retrofitted 215 Regals with the GN package. Most obvious was the light silver gray firemist paint added to each side. Red [[Pinstriping#Automobiles|pinstripes]] and billboard shadow lettering proclaiming "Buick" were applied. The wheel opening moldings and [[rocker panel]] moldings were blacked out using black vinyl tape. Finally, a front air dam and [[rear spoiler]] were installed. On the inside, special "Lear-Siegler" seats were installed. These seats are fully adjustable and were covered with silver brandon cloth with black vinyl inserts. The front seat had Buick's "6" emblem embroidered onto them. Also, a special clock delete plate was added to the [[Dashboard|instrument panel]] which contained the yellow and orange "6" logo and the words "Grand National Buick Motor Division".)

The 1982 GN came with a [[naturally aspirated]] {{convert|252|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V6 engine with {{convert|125|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4000&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|205|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of [[torque]] at 2000&amp;nbsp;rpm. Of the 215 Regal Grand Nationals produced in 1982, at least 35 were based on the Buick Regal Sport coupe package with the turbocharged {{convert|3791|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} V6 engine with {{convert|175|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4000&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|275|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 2600&amp;nbsp;rpm. There were only 2022 Sport coupes produced in 1982, and the number of cars with both the GN and Sport coupe packages is estimated to be fewer than 50.

For 1983, there was no Grand National. The Sport coupe model was renamed the [[T-Type]]; 3,732 were produced ({{convert|190|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 1600&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|280|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 2400&amp;nbsp;rpm). The T-Type had been used on other Buicks, starting with the [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]] in 1981 (in 1979 and 1980, it was the S Type). The 1983 Regal T-Type featured tube [[Exhaust manifold|headers]], Hydro-Boost II [[brake]]s, 200-4R 4-speed overdrive trans and 3.42 [[rear axle]] (7.5").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autotraderclassics.com/car-article/Future+Collectible%3A+1986+Buick+Grand+National*T_Type-66683.xhtml |title=Buick Grand National Buyer's Guide |publisher=Autotraderclassics.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buick T-Type (2669441886).jpg|thumb|Buick Regal T-Type]]

For 1984, the Grand National returned, now in all black paint. The [[turbocharged]] {{convert|3791|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} became standard and was refined with [[sequential fuel injection]], [[distributor]]-less computer controlled [[Ignition system|ignition]], and boasted {{convert|200|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4400&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|300|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 2400&amp;nbsp;rpm. Only 5,204 turbo Regals were produced that year, only 2,000 of which were Grand Nationals. Because this was the first year production of the computer controlled sequential fuel injection and distributor-less ignition, this is often considered the year and model that started the development of the legendary [[intercooled]] Grand Nationals. The performance of this package was well ahead of its time and the "little V6" easily kept up with the bigger V8s. [[Dragstrip|{{convert|1/4|mi|m|0}}]] performance was listed at 15.9 seconds at stock boost levels of {{convert|10|psi|bar|abbr=on}}, while for the same year, the [[Chevrolet Camaro (third generation)|Chevrolet Camaro]] V6 was listed at 17.0 and the [[Chevrolet Corvette (C4)|Chevrolet Corvette]] at 15.2 seconds.&lt;ref name=cd_corvette&gt;

|publisher=Car and Driver
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, performance enthusiasts determined the modifications that worked and the Grand Nationals easily broke into the 13-second territory. All Grand Nationals had the [[Lear Siegler]]-made cloth/leather interior which was only available for this year. An estimated 200 of the 1984 Grand Nationals were produced with the T-Top option which makes these the rarest of the Grand Nationals.

For 1986, a modified engine design with air-air intercooling boosted the performance even further to a specified {{convert|235|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4000&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|330|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 2400&amp;nbsp;rpm. The Grand Nationals (quantity 5,512) and T-Types (quantity 2,384) were both produced in 1986. For 1987, performance reached {{convert|245|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|355|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. Buick dropped the T-Type package for Regal for 1987 models and opted for a "T" sport package instead. There were only 7,896 turbo Regals produced in 1986. In 1987, when turbo Regals reached their peak in popularity, a total of 27,590 turbo Regals were produced through December, with those models produced between September and December of that year window stickered as "1987½ Buick Grand National" vehicles.

[[File:WO2T.jpg|thumb|1987 Regal turbo-T Limited with rare blackout trim package]]

For 1987, a lightweight WE4 (turbo T) option was offered. Only 1,547 of this variant were produced. The differences between a WE4 and the Grand National were the interior trim package, wheels, exterior badging, aluminum bumper supports, and aluminum rear [[drum brake]]s as opposed to the Grand National's cast iron, making the WE4 a lighter and faster car. The rear spoiler was only available as a dealer installed option. Nineteen eighty-seven was the only year that the LC2 turbo option was available on any Regal, making it possible to even see a Limited with a vinyl [[Landau (automobile)|landau roof]] and a [[power bulge]] turbo hood. Turbo Regal Limiteds were one of the rarest models of turbo Regals produced second only to the GNX at 1,035 turbo Limiteds. Turbo Regal Limiteds could be ordered with many options with most having chrome external trim but for $35 could have been built with the full black-out trim option making them extremely rare. Limiteds were treated to a very luxurious interior with plush carpeting and optional bench pillow seats and a [[Gear stick|column shift]]. The 1987 model would be the end of the manufacture of the [[Rear wheel drive|RWD]] "G-Body" Regal, but [[General Motors|GM]] had to extend the build of the Grand National to meet customer demand into December.
[[File:Buick GNX (20206519195).jpg|thumb|Buick Regal GNX]]
[[File:Buick GNX (20180268696).jpg|thumb|Buick Regal GNX]]
For the final year, 1987, Buick introduced the limited production GNX, for "Grand National Experimental", at $29,900. Made in partnership with [[Linamar|McLaren Performance Technologies]]/[[American Specialty Cars|ASC]], Buick produced only 547 GNs with the interior trim package, that were then sent off to [[Linamar|McLaren]] and upgraded into the Buick GNX. Buick underrated the GNX at {{Convert|276|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4400&amp;nbsp;rpm and a very substantial {{convert|360|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3000&amp;nbsp;rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Changes made included a special [[Garrett AiResearch]] T-3 [[turbocharger]] with a ceramic-impeller blowing through a more efficient and significantly larger capacity [[intercooler]] with a "Cermatel (ceramic-aluminum) coated" pipe connecting the intercooler to the engine. A GNX specific E-EPROM, low-restriction exhaust with dual [[muffler]]s, reprogrammed turbo Hydramatic 200-4R transmission with a custom [[torque converter]] and transmission cooler, and unique [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] cover/[[Panhard]] bar included more of the performance modifications. Exterior styling changes include vents located on each front fender, 16&amp;nbsp;inch black mesh style wheels with VR-speed rated tires, and deletion of the hood and fender emblems. The interior changes of the GNX included a serial number on the dash plaque and a revised instrument cluster providing [[Stewart-Warner]] [[Analog device|analog gauges]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Popular Mechanics |date=March 1987 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HOMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; including an analog turbo [[boost gauge]]. Performance was measured faster than the [[Ferrari F40]] and the [[Porsche 930]] with a [[Dragstrip|{{convert|1/4|mi|m|0}}]] time of 12.7 seconds at {{Convert|113.1|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}} (0.3 and 0.8 seconds quicker, 2.9 and {{convert|13.3|mph|0|abbr=on}} faster) and a 0-{{convert|60|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} time of 4.6 seconds (0.4 and 0.3 seconds quicker, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;[http://imgur.com/gallery/uzXOy], ''MotorTrend'', accessed Aug 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
GNX #001 is the 1986 prototype currently owned by Buick and sometimes makes appearances at car shows around the US. The GNX used a unique [[torque arm]] that was mounted to a special, GNX only, rear differential cover, for increased [[Traction (engineering)|traction]]. The torque arm rear suspension alters the suspension geometry, making the body lift while planting the rear tires down, resulting in increased traction.

The stealthy appearance of the all-black GNX and Grand National (and the resemblance of its grill to his helmet's mouthpiece), coupled with the fact that the Grand National was initially released during the popularity of ''[[Star Wars]]'' movies, earned it the title "[[Darth Vader]]'s Car". [[Car and Driver]] covered the GNX model's introduction with the headline "Lord Vader, your car is ready."  Due to the turbocharged six cylinder engine, the Buick make, and the black paint Grand Nationals were sometimes referred to as the "Dark Side". The "Dark Side" contrasted with the more common V8 [[Ford Mustang (third generation)|Mustangs]] and Camaros that were popular at the time.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

A new Regal appeared in October 1987 on the [[GM W platform]] as the first vehicle on that platform;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1987-08-30-8703050938-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; this generation ran with few changes for nine years. Though the new Regal returned to Buick's original concept in being offered only as a coupe and in being aimed once again squarely at the personal luxury buyer, it departed from tradition in being the first front-wheel drive model, and in having no serious performance option or edition. Neither a [[V8 engine|V8]] engine nor a turbocharged [[V6]] was offered; the only engine available for 1988 was the Chevrolet 2.8&amp;nbsp;L V6, producing {{convert|125|hp|abbr=on}}.

From 1990, owing to the declining personal luxury car market, the Regal was again offered as a four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] (as were the Cutlass Supreme and Grand Prix the same year, the latter offered as a sedan for the first time).

The Regal was initially offered in base ''Custom'' and upscale ''Limited'' trim lines. For 1989, the ''[[Buick Gran Sport#Regal GS / Regal Gran Sport|Gran Sport]]'' trim line was added, featuring aluminum wheels, body side cladding and a console mounted shifter attached to the 4-speed automatic. For 1990, the Regal gained the option of the Buick 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6. The 3800 V6 was unique to the Regal, differentiating it from the mechanically similar [[Chevrolet Lumina]], [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]] and [[Pontiac Grand Prix]]. Anti-lock brakes were made standard on all but the base ''Custom'' cars from 1992, and the grille was redesigned again for 1993. Along with the new look came an electronically controlled [[automatic transmission]] and [[Buick LeSabre|LeSabre]]-like rear lights and bumper. For 1993, a driver's side [[airbag]] was added, along with standard [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] on all models, standard power windows, and {{convert|20|hp|0|abbr=on}} more in the base engine due to a revised intake manifold and cylinder head. The ''Limited'' coupe was deleted; only the ''Custom'' and ''Gran Sport (GS)'' coupes remained. Dual airbags were new for 1995 along with a new interior.

For 1996, the larger {{convert|3791|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} V6 engine became the ''3800 Series II'' and gained {{convert|35|hp|0|abbr=on}}. {{citation needed span|Although 1996 was the last model year of this model, sales continued into 1997 as the replacement model was late (arriving in January 1997).|date=October 2018}}

[[File:Buick Regal.jpg|thumb|left|1997–2004 Buick Regal sedan]]

For the 1997 model year, the Century and Regal once again rode upon the same platform; the revised [[GM W platform|W platform]] that was shared with the [[Oldsmobile Intrigue]], the [[Pontiac Grand Prix]], the [[Chevrolet Lumina]] and [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]].&lt;ref&gt;https://adage.com/article/news/buick-s-regal-read-costly-web-launch/263/&lt;/ref&gt; The Regal coupe was discontinued.

Differences between the Regal and Century were mostly cosmetic. As the upmarket version, the Regal offered larger engines and fancier trim, and once again boasted a newer version of the 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6. While the Century was mainly a reliable, economy-minded car based upon the W-body, the Regal was fitted with many amenities, including heated leather seats (optional on the Century), a [[Monsoon speakers|Monsoon]] 8-speaker surround sound system, dual climate control, and expansive interior space. Few changes occurred during this version's seven-year run. It offered 5-passenger seating on all trim levels like the Pontiac Grand Prix and Oldsmobile Intrigue (formerly Cutlass Supreme), unlike their predecessors that had optional 6-passenger seating and the Buick Century (formerly built on the [[GM A platform|A platform]]) which had standard 6-passenger seating.

This period held the fastest Buick since the days of the 1991–1996 Roadmaster, the Buick Regal GS. This car was now [[supercharged]] instead of turbocharged, and produced {{convert|240|hp|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|280|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. When introduced in January 1997,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1996-08-11-9608110276-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; Buick advertised the Regal GS as "The official car of the supercharged family".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoghkBiMmQk&lt;/ref&gt; Buick also released two other model types, the LSE and the GSE. The LSE stayed with the {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on|0}} engine with upgrades and the GSE stayed with the {{convert|240|hp|abbr=on|0}} supercharged engine with upgrades. Also, in 2000 Buick came out with a concept GSX that had an intercooled 3.8&amp;nbsp;L, but was supercharged rather than turbocharged. It had {{convert|295.24|hp|abbr=on}}

The North American Regal was replaced in 2005 by the [[Buick LaCrosse]], also built on the W platform. The final 2004 Buick Regal rolled off the assembly line on June 1, 2004.&lt;ref name="Wards05"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 2005 |publisher=Ward's Communications, Inc |year=2005 |page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regal LS and GS performance ===
[[File:Regal l67.jpg|thumb|left|The 3800 Series II L67 Supercharged engine in a 1998 GS]]

The Regal LS from the factory had a 1/4 mile (≈400 m) elapsed time (ET) of 15.8 seconds and could do 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph in under 8 seconds. The supercharged Regal GS had a 1/4 mile ET of 14.9 seconds, and acceleration to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}} took 6.7 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Albee Digital Communications |url=http://www.albeedigital.com/supercoupe/articles/0-60_Quarter_Mile_Times/B_0-60times.html |title="B" 0-60 and 1/4 mile times for Factory Stock Vehicles |publisher=Albeedigital.com |accessdate=2009-06-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410163805/http://www.albeedigital.com/supercoupe/articles/0-60_Quarter_Mile_Times/B_0-60times.html |archivedate=2013-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Regal GS, equipped with the supercharged 3.8 liter V6 engine (L67) produced {{convert|240|hp|abbr=on|0}} &amp; {{convert|280|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. The Regal GS's PCM has programming that activates torque management to reduce wheel spin at launch. The Regal LS was EPA rated at 19/30 MPG city/freeway while the supercharged Regal GS was EPA rated at 18/27 MPG city/freeway.

=== Regal LSX and GSX (SLP Performance) ===
[[File:Buick_Regal_GSX.jpg|thumb|left|Buick Regal GSX]]
In the 2003 and 2004 model years, Buick, in collaboration with SLP Performance, came out with the Buick Regal GSX. They offered dealer-installed options and dealer supplied accessories for both LS and GS models. Like the GS Buicks that came before it, the SLP GSX came in three power train packages, referred to as stages. The Stage 1 package added 10 horsepower with the addition of a dual stainless steel cat-back exhaust system and free-flowing cold air induction system. If you opted for the Stage 2 package, a Hypertech Power Programmer with an SLP custom calibration tune was included with the Stage 1 components — good for an extra 20 horsepower. The range-topping Stage 3 package added a 3.5-inch smaller diameter supercharger pulley to crank up the boost. With an advertised 30 more horsepower than stock, the Stage 3 GSX was conservatively rated at {{convert|270|hp|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|312|lbft|abbr=on|0}} of torque. Since the parts were available from SLP over the counter for many years, there have been quite a few Regal GS sedans that have been cloned into a GSX for both appearance and performance purposes. Though the model didn’t officially debut until 2003, a licensed SLP dealer could perform the transformation on any Regal GS from 1997 to 2004. A true GSX can be verified from an SLP door jamb label with the correct part number for the kit.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cheatsheet.com/automobiles/buick-regal-gsx-it-lives-up-to-its-performance-heritage.html/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fabini.com/slp/slpbuickgsx.html |title=SLP Buick Regal GSX |work=Fabini's Auto Trim Co |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710215458/http://www.fabini.com/slp/slpbuickgsx.html |archivedate=2011-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joseph Abboud Edition===
From 2001 to 2004 Buick offered a [[Joseph Abboud]] appearance package on both the GS and LS models. This package included either a solid [[taupe]] or two-tone taupe/[[Chestnut (color)|chestnut]] leather seats, two-tone leather wrapped steering wheel, leather shifter handle and boot, 16" aluminum wheels; and Joseph Abboud signature emblems on the front doors, floor mats, front seat head rests, and taillights.

The Regal has sold well in the Chinese market as a large, relatively luxurious model, despite its high price, costing more than the North American version. The Chinese market Regal has different front- and rear-end styling compared to the North American version and different engines, including the 2.0&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Family II engine#L34|L34]]'', the 2.5&amp;nbsp;L ''[[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#LB8|LB8]]'' V6 and the 3.0&amp;nbsp;L ''[[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#LW9|LW9]]'' V6. Gearbox choices were a 4-speed automatic for V6 models, while four-cylinder variants are paired with a 5-speed manual gearbox. V6 models had a set of black dashboard gauges, while the four-cylinder models had white dashboard gauges.  These models also had slightly different names: the entry-level model was the ''New Century'', with more upscale models carrying the ''GL'' and ''GLX'' names. Later, ''G'' and ''GS'' models were added. Production for this generation ended in November 2008 in China being replaced the Opel Insignia based Regal. The Chinese-built Regal was also sold in the Philippines from 2005 to 2008 as the Chevrolet Lumina, where it replaced the [[Opel Vectra]]. The 2.5 V6 was the only engine option.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.curbsideclassic.com/automotive-histories/obscure-rebadges-from-around-the-world-part-6/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== GS ====
[[File:2011 Buick Verano (5490346021).jpg|thumb|left|2011 Buick Regal GS]]
At the [[North American International Auto Show#2010|2010 North American International Auto Show]] in Detroit, GM showed a concept GS version of the Regal based on the Opel Insignia [[Opel Performance Center|OPC]] and the Vauxhall Insignia VXR. The concept featured a 2.0L, {{convert|270|hp|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|295|lbft|abbr=on}} high-output DOHC I4 turbocharged Ecotec engine, a 6-speed manual transmission and all-wheel drive.

The production GS leaves most of the concept specifications intact, but is front-wheel drive. The GS features Buick's Interactive Drive Control System with GS mode, a choice of an FGP Germany F40-6 six-speed manual or Aisin AF-40 (G2) six-speed automatic transmission, high performance brakes with [[Brembo]] front calipers and high performance strut (HiPerStrut) front suspension. 19&amp;nbsp;inch wheels will be standard and 20&amp;nbsp;inch forged aluminum wheels will be available.

==== Sport Touring Edition ====
For 2016, the Regal added a new Sport Touring Edition which included unique 18" aluminum black pocket wheels and a rear lip spoiler.

==== eAssist ====
[[File:2012 Buick Regal eAssist WAS 2012 0830.JPG|thumb|2012 Buick Regal with optional [[BAS Hybrid#Generation II BAS (eAssist)|eAssist]] hybrid system]]
Beginning in 2011, Buick began offering the [[BAS Hybrid#Generation II BAS (eAssist)|eAssist]] system in the Regal, The 2012 [[model year]] Regal is the second GM vehicle to offer eAssist after the 2012 [[Buick LaCrosse]]. The eAssist system is standard in the LaCrosse, but the eAssist powertrain is optional in the Regal.

The eAssist system adds a lithium-ion battery housed in the trunk, along with regenerative braking, engine stop/start, fuel cut-off, grille louvres that close at speed, underbody panels and low-rolling resistance tires. The eAssist system adds up to {{convert|15|hp|kW|abbr=on}} to the standard 2.4L Ecotec engine during acceleration. Fuel economy for the Regal with eAssist is estimated at {{convert|26|mpgus|abbr=on}} city, {{convert|37|mpgus|abbr=on}} highway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://media.gm.com/content/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2011/Feb/11chicago/buick/0208_Regal_eA |title=2012 Regal to Offer New eAssist™ Fuel-Saving Technology |date=2011-02-08 |publisher=General Motors Company |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5z4n9b1i5?url=http://media.gm.com/content/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2011/Feb/11chicago/buick/0208_Regal_eA |archivedate=2011-05-30 |accessdate=2011-05-30 |quote=Mated to Regal’s 2.4L Ecotec direct injection four-cylinder engine and next-generation six-speed automatic transmission... |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2014 Update ===
[[File:2014 Regal.JPG|thumb|2014 Buick Regal eAssist]]
GM revealed an updated 2014 Regal at the [[New York Auto Show#2013|2013 New York Auto Show]]. Changes include a revised interior and exterior, a boost in performance for the CXL Turbo up to 258&amp;nbsp;hp (192&amp;nbsp;kW) and 295&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (400 N·m) of torque, and an available all-wheel drive option offered for the 2.0L engine/6-speed automatic transmission equipped vehicles. Changes for the GS include revised interior and exterior, a drop in power to match that of the CXL Turbo, and available an all-wheel drive option offered for the 2.0L / six-speed automatic transmission equipped vehicles. The six-speed manual transmission is still offered, but only in the front-wheel drive variant. Buick's [[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPorts]] have reappeared starting with 2014 models, a styling feature unique to Buick that dates back to 1949.

Several new safety features were added for the 2014 year, which include forward collision warning, lane-departure warning, blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, and a following-distance indicator. The foregoing are all part of a Driver Confidence package, while collision preparation, which pre-loads the brake system ahead of an imminent collision, and adaptive cruise control are available separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lamm|first=John|title=2014 Buick Regal / Regal GS|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2014-buick-regal-photos-and-info-news|work=Car and Driver|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buick Regal began sales in China on July 21, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.gm.com/media/cn/en/buick/vehicles/All-New-Buick-Regal/2017.html "All-New Buick Regal"], ''Buick News China'', Retrieved on 16 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the previous generation, it is related to the [[Opel Insignia|Opel and Vauxhall Insignia]] sold in Europe and [[Holden Commodore (ZB)|Holden ZB Commodore]] in Australia, and like the previous generation, the vehicles were developed and are produced by Opel in Germany.

===Regal Sportback===
The [[fastback]] version of the Regal, now branded as Regal Sportback, is the replacement for the Regal sedan. While the roofline is similar to that of its predecessor, the new liftback configuration provides added utility.

===Regal TourX===

The station wagon variant, named Regal TourX, was also introduced and went on sale at the same time as the hatchback, marking the first time since the demise of the [[Buick Roadmaster|Roadmaster]] in 1996 that Buick had a station wagon in its lineup. The TourX competes against the [[Volvo V60 Cross Country]], [[Audi A4 Allroad]], [[Subaru Outback]], and [[BMW 3 Series (F30)|BMW 3 Series wagon]], and offers up to 73.5 cubic feet of storage space behind the front seats, but only comes in all-wheel drive, along with a ''[[GM Ecotec engine#LTG|LTG]]'' turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder producing an estimated {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|295|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} mated with an eight-speed automatic transmission.&lt;ref name="wagon" /&gt;

The 2018 GS is the performance version of sixth generation Regal. This generation of GS sports a 3.6 liter [[GM High Feature engine|LGX]] V6 engine producing 310&amp;nbsp;hp.

===Discontinuation===

In December 2019, General Motors announced that it would end production of the Buick Regal for [[North America]] following the 2020 [[model year]], citing the popularity of the brand's [[sport utility vehicle]]s (SUV's), which have contributed to declining sales of Buick's passenger cars.  However, despite the discontinuation of the Regal in [[North America]], Buick will continue to produce the Regal for the [[China|Chinese]] market, where the vehicle recently received a mid-cycle facelift.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2019/12/04/buick-regal-discontinued-gm-general-motors/2607182001/&lt;/ref&gt;

The second-generation Buick Encore was revealed alongside the [[Buick Encore GX]] during the 2019 [[Shanghai Auto Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a27225684/buick-encore-gx-future-crossover/|title=This Is (Probably) the Next-Gen Buick Encore for the U.S.|work=[[Car and Driver]]|last=Golson|first=Daniel|date=22 April 2019|accessdate=22 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will be available with either a 1.0 liter inline-3 turbo petrol engine producing {{convert|92|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} or a 1.3 liter inline-3 turbo petrol engine producing {{convert|121|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}}.

The second-generation Encore will not be exported to North America, because it uses the GEM platform intended for "emerging" markets.  The first-generation Encore will continue to be sold in North America instead.  The larger Buick Encore GX will be added to both the Chinese, Mexican,&lt;ref&gt;https://noticias.autocosmos.com.mx/2019/09/24/buick-encore-gx-2020-estara-disponible-en-mexico-a-inicios-del-ano-que-viene&lt;/ref&gt; and North American markets in 2020.

General Motors of Mexico announced to launch the new generation to replace the smaller Mokka-based model for Mexico in early 2020 to place itself between the [[Buick Enclave|Enclave]] and [[Buick Envision|Envision]], and will carry the GX nameplate just like it will in North America. Although mechanical specifications in the market are not confirmed, it will either come with two motors, a 3-cylinder 137hp 1.2-litre motor with CVT gearbox and frontal traction, or a turbocharged motor with 155 hp, 9-speed gearbox and AWD. In terms of equipment, Buick has confirmed that the Encore GX will come with a robust list of equipment, with Bose 7-speaker audio system with subwoofer, 8" infotainment screen, induction charger, QuietTuning audio cancellation system, and an Onstar 4G LTE system with a maximum connection to 7 devices.

It will also come with 8 airbags, frontal collision alert, pedestrian warning system, and a 360° camera.

Jim Federico, Executive Director and Vehicle Chief Engineer for Verano, led the vehicle development team and David Lyon, Buick design director, styled the exterior.{{Sfn|Schwegman|Federico|2011}}{{Sfn|Lassa|2011}}

The Verano is essentially a North American-market version of the Chinese-market compact [[Buick Excelle GT]]. The Verano's unibody construction uses galvanized steel for its front fenders, hood, roof and door panels and [[Thermoplastic olefin|thermoplastic polyolefin]] (TPO) bumper covers.{{Sfn|General Motors Company|2011}} It incorporates acoustical laminated glass, triple door seals, a five-layer interior roof liner, sound absorbing mats, recycled denim insulation and specially manufactured 18-inch forged alloy wheels, which minimize road noise.{{Sfn|General Motors Company|2011}} Buick's [[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPorts]] reappeared at the Verano's introduction, a styling feature unique to Buick dating back to 1949.

[[File:Buick Excelle GT 02 China 2012-05-20.JPG|thumb|left|Buick Excelle GT (China)]]
The standard powertrain is a 2.4&amp;nbsp;L [[GM Ecotec engine#LEA|Ecotec]] [[Fuel injection#Direct injection|direct-injected]] DOHC [[Inline-four engine|I4]] mated to a six-speed [[automatic transmission]]. The 2.4&amp;nbsp;L engine is rated {{convert|180|hp|kW}} at 6,700 rpm and {{convert|171|ftlb|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,900 rpm. The engine is flex-fuel capable, meaning it can use either gasoline, or E85 ethanol (2012-13)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cleanairchoice.org/fuels/e85_vehicles.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; • 2.4L, or any combination of the two fuels. EPA fuel economy estimates are {{convert|21|mpgus|l/100 km}} city and {{convert|32|mpgus|l/100 km}} highway for gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=32160&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|General Motors Company|2011}}  A 2012 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6tok5np8G4 on-road mixed highway-city review] by the website MPGOMATIC showed an average 26.5 MPG on E85, and 29 for gasoline.

A 2.0 L turbocharged version became available in late 2012, for the 2013 model year, as did a 6-speed [[manual transmission]]. The 2.0 L turbo engine is rated at 250 horsepower and 260&amp;nbsp;lb-ft of torque. GM estimated acceleration from 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph is 6.2 seconds, matching the number posted by the [[Buick Regal]] GS.&lt;ref name="GM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2012/Jun/0611_verano_turbo.html |title=2013 Buick Verano Turbo Debuts with 250 Horsepower|accessdate=2012-06-13 |author=General Motors |date=2012-06-12 |publisher=GM Media Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2016, the Verano added a new Sport Touring Edition which included unique 18″ aluminum black pocket wheels and a rear lip spoiler.

The Verano was phased out from the US market after the 2017 model year. The second generation Verano is sold exclusively in China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weiner|first1=Eric|title=Buick Verano Canceled for U.S. after 2017, Says Report|url=http://www.automobilemag.com/news/buick-verano-canceled-u-s-2017-says-report/|accessdate=9 May 2016|work=Automobile magazine|date=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving Buick without an entry-level sedan in the US market.

The '''Buick Envision''' is a compact  [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover SUV]] built by [[SAIC-GM]].&lt;ref name="WaPo_2014-07-21"/&gt;

==Background==
The Envision was first introduced publicly in China on July 1, 2014, with a photo of the car under a cover and placed between a [[Buick Encore]] and a [[Buick Enclave]].&lt;ref name="GM-China-Buick_2014-07-01"/&gt; On July 21, some specifications and the first official photos, as well as its Chinese name “Ang Ke Wei” (昂科威), were made public. The car is produced in China by [[SAIC-GM]] and went on sale in late 2014.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}  By 2016, the Envision was available in China, the United States, Canada, and Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/americans-embrace-a-made-in-china-buick-suv-1475771438 | title=Americans Embrace a Made-in-China Buick SUV | date=October 6, 2016 | access-date=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/general-motors/2015/08/18/uaw-buick-envision/31912469/ | title=UAW to address possible China-made Buick import | date=August 18, 2015 | access-date=August 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/buick-envision-cuv-almost-definitely-coming-to-u-s-plus-a-subcompact-hatch-too/ | title=Buick Envision CUV Almost Definitely Coming to U.S.—Plus a Subcompact Hatch, Too? | date=July 24, 2015 | access-date=August 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the larger engines offered in North America, Chinese buyers also have the option of a turbocharged 1.5-liter unit.

The Envision made its U.S. debut at the [[North American International Auto Show]] on January 11, 2016, as a compact CUV,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2016/01/11/2016-buick-envision-detroit-2016/ "2016 Buick Envision might be your first Chinese-built crossover"] from Autoblog (January 11, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; sharing the segment with a second generation [[GMC Terrain]] and the [[Chevrolet Equinox]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2016/01/2016-buick-envision-will-be-all-wheel-drive-only/ "2016 Buick Envision Will Be All Wheel Drive Only"] from GM Authority (January 9, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;  It went on sale in the United States in the summer of 2016, making it the first Chinese-built GM vehicle to be sold in America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2015/12/04/buick-envision-cuv-china-confirmed/ "Buick confirms US-market Envision CUV to be built in China"] from Autoblog (December 4, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially only offered in all-wheel drive, but front wheel drive became an option starting in the 2017 model year.

The North American version of the Envision features two powertrains: a 2.5L LCV four-cylinder with {{convert|197|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|192|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} and a turbo-charged 2.0L LTG four-cylinder engine SAE certified at {{convert|252|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|260|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}, paired with a third-generation six-speed transmission, seven active safety technologies, and OnStar/Intellilink connectivity. For the 2016 model year, it was only available in Premium I and Premium II trim levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/gm/buick/envision/2016-envision/ 2016 Buick Envision] from GM Authority (March 28, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; The trim levels expanded to five for the 2017 model year, with the base level Envision starting at US$34,990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2016/04/2017-buick-envision-to-start-at-34990/ "2017 Buick Envision To Start at $34,990"] from GM Authority (April 11, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===2019 facelift===
Debuted in late 2017 in China, and revealed in 2018 for North American market, the 2019 Envision features an updated exterior that now falls more in line with Buick design themes across the rest of the lineup.  The updated model has improved seating, a change in the grille that follows Buick’s American winged/waterfall models, a more chiseled design at the rear end, angular tail lights, and a newly calibrated stop/start feature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/02/2019-buick-envision-bows-with-updated-looks-and-customer-focused-improvements/ “2019 Buick Envision Bows With Updated Looks And Customer Focused Improvements”] from GM Authority (February 26, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2019 Envision has a starting price of US$32,990 in the U.S. market.

==Controversy==
The announcement about selling the Chinese-built vehicle to American consumers has drawn a backlash from the United Auto Workers, who had just finalized a contract agreement with GM and had wanted the automaker to build the Envision stateside: “Today’s announcement by General Motors that they are importing the Envision from China is a slap in the face to U.S. taxpayers and the men and women who worked so hard to save GM during its darkest time,” UAW President Dennis Williams and Vice President Cindy Estrada, who head the GM department for the union, said in a joint statement on December 4, 2015. On the other hand, Buick spokesman Stuart Fowle defended the decision to keep production in China and import it rather than having it built in the United States because it made sense from a business point of view: “We have production already going (in China) and adding a second manufacturing facility for the volumes that we would expect in the U.S. just wasn’t feasible,” he said. “We wanted to take advantage of the manufacturing already in place. We’re very confident in the vehicle.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/general-motors/2015/12/04/buick-envision/76795170/ | title=Buick Envision made in China headed to U.S. next summer | date=December 5, 2015 | access-date=December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 6, 2018, General Motors announced that it might withdraw the Envision from the United States market, should a request to seek a waiver to continue to import the vehicle is denied. GM is seeking the waiver amid a trade war between the United States and China over tariffs that could hurt the sales of the Envision. The automaker sees the potential exemption as “the only way” to continue offering the vehicle to U.S. consumers, according to GM President [[Dan Ammann]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autonews.com/article/20180803/RETAIL/180809889/gm-seeks-tariff-exemption-buck-envision "Buick could pull Envision from U.S. without tariff exemption"] from Automotive News (August 6, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; The exemption was denied on May 29, 2019, but GM has opted to pay the tariffs without raising the price on the vehicle for the time being. Buick is confident that ongoing talks between China and the United States could spare the Envision's future in North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/06/us-denies-gm-exemption-on-tariffs-for-china-made-buick-envision/ "US Denies GM Exemption On Tariffs For China-Made Buick Envision"] from GM Authority (June 5, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/06/buick-envision-may-be-spared-as-china-trade-deal-nears/ "Buick Envision May Be Spared As China Trade Deal Nears"] from GM Authority (June 28, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception==
In 2017, the Envision was Buick's third bestselling model in the U.S. with sales of just over 41,000 units.  Sales in the U.S. dropped 27% in 2018 but rebounded slightly in 2019.

The '''Buick Enclave''' is a [[mid-size]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buick.com/suvs/enclave-mid-size-luxury-suv|title=Buick enclave size|accessdate=February 16, 2018|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[crossover SUV]] launched in 2008. The Enclave, the Saturn Outlook, the [[GMC Acadia]], and [[Chevrolet Traverse]] all share the [[GM Lambda platform]]. The Enclave was previewed at the [[North American International Auto Show#2006|2006 North American International Auto Show]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060108/FREE/60108006/1024/LATESTNEWS|title=Buick shows off Enclave crossover concept; production version due in '07|work=[[AutoWeek]]|date=January 8, 2006|accessdate=January 9, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092951/http://autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20060108%2FFREE%2F60108006%2F1024%2FLATESTNEWS|archive-date=September 29, 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; officially as a [[concept car]], making it the first Lambda vehicle to be displayed. The Enclave is partially based on the [[Buick Centieme]] concept shown at the 2003 Detroit Auto Show.

The Enclave replaced both of Buick's SUVs, the minivan-based [[Buick Rendezvous|Rendezvous]] and the truck-based [[Buick Rainier|Rainier]], as well as the [[Buick Terraza|Terraza]] [[minivan]]. As of February 2014, the 2014 Enclave was the top-ranked Affordable Midsize SUV in U.S. News &amp; World Report's rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/rankings/Affordable-Midsize-SUVs/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124201709/http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/rankings/Affordable-Midsize-SUVs/ |archivedate=2010-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second-generation Enclave was officially revealed at the 2017 [[New York Auto Show]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.autonews.com/article/20170221/OEM04/170229977/buick-enclave-grows-more-muscular-for-2018&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Features ===
[[File:Buick Enclave rear China 2012-05-12.JPG|thumb|left|Rear view]]
The Enclave has seating for seven passengers, with an optional second row bench seat instead of the standard two captain chairs which increases the seating to eight. It comes standard with [[front wheel drive|front-wheel drive]] with an option of [[all wheel drive|all-wheel drive]].

The Enclave shares powertrains with its Lambda siblings. For its first year of production, the Enclave was powered by a {{Convert|275|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.6&amp;nbsp;L [[GM High Feature engine#LY7|High Feature]] [[V6 engine]] mated to a six-speed [[automatic transmission]].&lt;ref name='mt07'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/suvs/112_0708_2008_buick_enclave |author=Lassa, Todd |title=2008 Buick Enclave – First Drive |work=Motor Trend |date=May 29, 2007 |accessdate=October 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2009 model, an upgraded power boost for the 3.6&amp;nbsp;L V6 [[Spark Ignition Direct Injection]] VVT is now at {{convert|288|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|270|lb·ft|0|abbr=on}} of torque standard (also standard on other 2009 Lambdas).  The latter direct-injection engine offers a broader torque curve, and brings fuel economy to {{convert|17|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}}/{{convert|24|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} for FWD models and {{convert|16|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}}/{{convert|22|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} for AWD models, according to the new [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] estimates. The Lambda vehicles are built at [[General Motors|GM]]'s new [[Delta Township Assembly]] plant near [[Lansing, Michigan]], and production of the Enclave commenced on April 11, 2007,&lt;ref name='start'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2007/04/11/canadians-get-out-your-wallets-buick-sets-pricing-for-enclave/ |author=Tutor, Chris |title=Canadians, get out your wallets: Buick sets pricing for Enclave |work=Autoblog |date=April 11, 2007 |accessdate=2009-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the first vehicles reaching certain dealers by the end of the month. The Enclave debuted with a starting price of $32,790.&lt;ref name='mt07' /&gt;

The Enclave is often praised for its subsequently vast cargo space while maintaining the relatively dynamic nature of unibody construction over the conventional [[body-on-frame]].  It is also praised for being one of the quietest vehicles available for sale in the United States, as well as for the quality of the interior.&lt;ref name="edmunds.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/buick/enclave/2009/review.html|title=2009 Buick Enclave Review|accessdate=2009-03-08|work=edmunds.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its first year of production, the Enclave was often criticized for its 6-speed transmission, which was "hesitant to downshift."&lt;ref name="edmunds.com" /&gt; For 2009, though, the powertrain is regarded as more competent with more abundant torque. For its entire production, it has been regarded as too heavy, weighing nearly {{convert|5000|lb}} with all-wheel-drive. Buick's [[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPorts]] have reappeared at the Enclave's introduction, a styling feature unique to Buick dating back to 1949.

Initial sales of the Enclave have been very strong, with demand far exceeding production capacity, forcing GM to add a third shift to the Delta Township plant.

With the arrival of the [[Buick Envision]] (which is slotted between the Enclave and [[Buick Encore]]) to North America in 2016 (for the 2017 model year), the Enclave will be bigger after Envision's debut, and the 2017 model year Enclave will be the last under the first generation platform.

=== 2013 facelift ===
[[File:Buick Enclave facelift China 2018-03-20.jpg|thumb|left|Buick Enclave]]

GM unveiled the 2013 Buick Enclave on April 3, 2012, one day before its official debut at the [[New York Auto Show]].&lt;ref name="autoblog.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/04/03/2013-buick-enclave-debuts-with-new-look-over-same-drivetrain/|title=2013 Buick Enclave debuts with new look over same drivetrain|accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 model features revised exterior styling including a new chrome waterfall grille, xenon headlights with [[LED]] running lights, LED Foglights, and LED taillights.&lt;ref name=BCG&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bestcarsguide.com/2013-buick-enclave-lightning-technology/ | title = 2013 Buick Enclave Lightning Technology | publisher = BestCarsGuide | editor-first = Arman | editor-last = Barari }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interior updates include a redesigned dashboard with more soft-touch materials, wood and chrome accents, blue ambient lighting, and touchscreen [[MyLink|IntelliLink]] infotainment display. Among safety features are seven standard airbags, including an industry-first front center airbag, and available blind-spot monitoring.&lt;ref name="buick.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buick.com/2013-enclave-luxury-crossover-suv.html|title=2013 Buick Enclave|accessdate=2012-04-03|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407035657/http://www.buick.com/2013-enclave-luxury-crossover-suv.html|archivedate=2012-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Markets ===
Sales in the United States and Canada began in 2007 during the 2008 model year. In 2008, General Motors began exporting the Enclave to [[People's Republic of China|China]], to be sold through [[Shanghai GM]]'s Buick network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2008/07/29/buick-enclave-gets-passport-for-sale-in-china/ |title=Buick Enclave gets passport for sale in China |author=Jeremy Korzeniewski |work=AutoBlog |date=July 29, 2008 |accessdate=2009-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buick brand has been relaunched in Mexico for the 2010 model year, bringing the Enclave to that market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insideline.com/buick/lacrosse/2010/buick-prepares-return-to-mexico.html |title=Buick Prepares Return to Mexico |author=Loriana Marietta |work=Edmunds Inside Line |date=August 26, 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2018 Buick Enclave rear 10.12.18.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view]]

On April 11, 2017, exactly 10 years after the first Enclave was produced, Buick unveiled the second generation Enclave at the Pier 59 Studios during the 2017 New York Auto Show. With the introduction of the compact [[Buick Envision]] in 2016 and the launching of the [[Opel Insignia]]-badged [[Buick Regal|Buick Regal TourX]] wagon, the next generation Enclave moved upmarket, competing with the [[Volvo XC90]], [[Infiniti QX60]], and [[Acura MDX]] in the premium crossover SUV market. The second generation Enclave went on sale in the Fall of 2017 as a 2018 model.&lt;ref name="autonews" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motortrend.com/news/2018-buick-enclave-shows-off-new-grille/ "2018 Buick Enclave Shows Off New Front Grille"] from Motor Trend (March 14, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2016/07/18/2018-buick-enclave-spy-shots/|title=2018 Buick Enclave slims down for spy shots|first=Reese|last=Counts|work=Autoblog|date=July 18, 2016|accessdate=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long-wheelbase version of GM’s C1XX chassis sharing the same platform with the [[Chevrolet Traverse]], the second generation Enclave moved away from the egg-shaped design but retains some elements of the previous generation, displaying a sleeker aerodynamic appearance, a lower roofline, and the introduction of the Evonik Acrylite exterior forward lighting flanking Buick's new three-dimensional mesh grille with chrome wings. 

Powered by a 3.6-liter V-6 mated to a new nine-speed automatic transmission, it produces {{Convert|310|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with {{Convert|266|ftlb|Nm|abbr=on}} torque. The second generation Enclave comes in standard Front-drive or available with Intelligent AWD with an active twin-clutch rear differential, which compliments its first switchable all-wheel-drive system. There are three level trims, including a new top of the line premium Avenir sub-brand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/enclave/2018/2018-buick-enclave-avenir-first-look-review/ "2018 Buick Enclave Avenir First Look: Redesigned Flagship Crossover is Ready"] from ''Motor Trend'' (April 11, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 22, 2019, Buick unveiled the Chinese-market Enclave.  It is a "mid-size plus" version of the Enclave which utilizes GM's C1 short wheelbase platform.  It went on sale in that region in late 2019. While it has the similar features as the full-size North American Enclave, the Chinese version is shorter with a design different from its counterpart; there are no plans to make it available in North America. Buick planned to name the Chinese version "Envoy" (a name previously used on [[GMC Envoy|a GMC midsize SUV]] in North America from 1998 to 2007) but elected to use the Enclave name instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/04/buick-pre-announces-all-new-enclave-for-end-this-year/ "Buick Pre-Announces All New Enclave For End This Year"] from GM Authority (April 24, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/08/all-new-buick-enclave-leaked-for-china/ "All-New Buick Enclave Leaked For China"] from GM Authority (August 16, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Chinese Enclave features GM's Electronic Precision Shift technology, and is equipped exclusively with a turbocharged 2.0L LSY engine that makes 233 horsepower, mated to the new GM 9-speed automatic transmission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/10/this-is-the-all-new-buick-enclave-crossover-for-china/ "This Is The All New Buick Enclave Crossover For China"] from GM Authority (October 22, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Buick Excelle''' ({{zh|t=別克凱越}} is the common name for the [[compact car]]s marketed by [[Shanghai General Motors|Shanghai General Motors Company Limited]] ({{zh|t=上海通用汽車有限公司}}) under GM's [[Buick]] brand.

The original Buick Excelle (Chinese "Kai Yue")&lt;ref name="Chinacartimes 2012-01-26"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinacartimes.com/2012/01/26/excelle-selling-car-china/ |title=Excelle the best selling car in China?

While this car was originally sold worldwide under the [[Daewoo]] brand, in 2004, [[General Motors]] rebranded all Daewoo products in Europe as [[Chevrolet]]s.

Parallel to the Lacetti-based Excelle, Shanghai GM introduced a new car called the "[[Buick Excelle GT]]" in China, but called "Ying Lang" in Chinese.&lt;ref name="Chinacartimes_2012-01-26"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinacartimes.com/2012/01/26/excelle-selling-car-china/ |title=Buick China &amp;#124; Excelle the best selling car in China? Yes, and mostly no. |publisher=chinacartimes.com |location=Qingdao, Shandong, 266071, China |author=FrankF |date=26 January 2012 |accessdate=1 October 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on GM's [[GM Delta platform#Delta II|global compact car platform "Delta II"]] which is developed at [[Rüsselsheim]] in [[Opel]]'s International Technical Development Center (ITDC). The [[Chevrolet Cruze]] is based on this same platform.

Since the 2009 economic crises and the subsequent demise of the [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn brand]] and reduction of GM's North American brands to four, the Opel models are aligned no longer with the Saturn brand, but the Buick brand. Consequently, the models built and marketed by Buick China are twins of the Opel variants of GM's global platforms.

In China, a [[hatchback]] called the '''[[Buick Excelle XT]]''' debuted in 2009, which is essentially a rebadged [[Opel Astra#Astra J|Astra J (2009–present)]].  A sedan debuted in 2010 called the '''[[Buick Excelle GT]]''' ({{zh|t=别克英朗GT}}).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2010/01/report-upcoming-buick-premium-compact-sedan-rendered.html&lt;/ref&gt; An estate car based on the second generation Buick Excelle GT debuted in 2018 called the '''[[Buick Excelle GX]]'''.

In August 2016, Buick decided to end Excelle production despite strong sales, with 2.68&amp;nbsp;million units sold over the course of 13 years. Citing its low price while the brand moves upmarket as a main reason, there will be no direct successor, with [[Chevrolet]] and [[Wuling Motors|Wuling]] filling in the low-end market niche left unoccupied by the departure of the Excelle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=De Feijter |first=Tycho |date=9 August 2016 |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tychodefeijter/2016/08/09/gm-retires-its-popular-buick-excelle-in-china-after-13-years/ |title=GM China Retires The Buick Excelle After 13 Years Of Stellar Sales |work=[[Forbes]]  |access-date=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, Buick launched the second generation of the Buick Excelle. Positioning under the Excelle GT, the second generation Excelle was based on a new platform and stand as a completely new model.

The first generation was available in a [[sedan (automobile) | sedan]] or [[Station wagon | wagon]] and Excelle HRV ([[hatchback]]) and was a rebadged [[Daewoo Lacetti]]. The HRV and wagon were produced from 2005 to 2009 while the sedan continued to produced locally in [[Shanghai]] from April 2003 to August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tychodefeijter/2016/08/09/gm-retires-its-popular-buick-excelle-in-china-after-13-years/#66fb80512fc9|title=GM China Retires The Buick Excelle After 13 Years Of Stellar Sales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model year 2008 received a facelift consisting of a new front fascia, new rear end design and updated interior. The facelift was partly inspired by the [[Buick Park Avenue]], and the front light units and bumpers were redesigned while the front fenders remain the same units. A second facelift consisting of a new [[grille (car) | grille]] was released in 2013. A 1.6 litre engine was standard under the trim level LX until 2013 where a 1.5 litre engine replaced it. The new trim levels were 1.5 MT Classical, 1.5 MT Premium, 1.5 AT Classical and 1.5 AT Premium. Pricing was between 96,900 yuan to 118,900 yuan throughout its production run.

In the Taiwanese market, [[Yulon Motors]], being the manufacturer and distributor of GM products in Taiwan introduced a redesigned Buick Excelle produced and sold exclusively in Taiwan starting from 2007. The Taiwanese version consists of a completely different front fascia compared to the version sold in main land China while the rear is still similar to the [[Chevrolet Optra]], [[Daewoo Lacetti]], and [[Suzuki Forenza]] sedans with only the inner taillamp setup being redesigned.

The '''Buick Excelle GT''' ({{zh|t=别克英朗}}) is the name for the [[compact car]] marketed by [[Shanghai General Motors|Shanghai General Motors Company Limited]] ({{zh|t=上海通用汽車有限公司}}) under GM's [[Buick]] brand.

The original [[Buick Excelle]] (Chinese "Kai Yue")&lt;ref name="Chinacartimes 2012-01-26"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinacartimes.com/2012/01/26/excelle-selling-car-china/ |title=Excelle the best selling car in China?

The globally sold [[Chevrolet Cruze]] as well as South Korean market [[Daewoo Lacetti Premiere]] were both based on this same [[GM Delta platform#Delta II|Delta II]] platform.

Since the 2009 economic crises and the subsequent demise of the [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn brand]] and reduction of GM's North American brands to four, certain Opel models were no longer aligned with the Saturn brand, but now with the Buick brand instead. Consequently, the models built and marketed by Buick China were twins of some Opel variants of GM's global platforms prior to the purchase of [[Opel]] and [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] by [[Groupe PSA]] in 2017.

In China, a [[hatchback]] called the '''Buick Excelle XT''' debuted in 2009, which was essentially a rebadged [[Opel Astra#Astra J|Astra J (2009–2015)]].  A sedan debuted in 2010 called the '''Buick Excelle GT''' ({{zh|t=别克英朗GT}}).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2010/01/report-upcoming-buick-premium-compact-sedan-rendered.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

A North American version of the Excelle GT was assembled in the United States from 2011 to 2016, and marketed as the [[Buick Verano]].

In August 2016, Buick China decided to end 13 years of production of the original [[Buick Excelle]] (2003-2016) despite strong sales, with 2.68&amp;nbsp;million units sold over the course of 13 years. Citing its low price while the Buick brand was being moved upmarket in China as a main reason, there was no direct successor, with [[Chevrolet]], [[Baojun]] and [[Wuling Motors|Wuling]] filling in the lower end market niche left unoccupied by the departure of the Buick Excelle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=De Feijter |first=Tycho |date=9 August 2016 |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tychodefeijter/2016/08/09/gm-retires-its-popular-buick-excelle-in-china-after-13-years/ |title=GM China Retires The Buick Excelle After 13 Years Of Stellar Sales |work=[[Forbes]]|access-date=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another version of the [[Opel Astra]] that shares the design cues of the Excelle GT is assembled and marketed in North America as the [[Buick Verano]]. Production of the Verano began in the fourth quarter of 2011 at the General Motors [[Orion Assembly]] plant. The Verano went on sale late in 2011 as a 2012 model.

A new Buick Excelle GT was introduced as a 2015 model. The new model has a completely new look, with new front and rear bumpers, new lights, new grille, and a more luxurious cabin. New engines included are a 1.4-liter turbocharged engine mated to a seven speed dual clutch gearbox or a 1.5-liter {{convert|113|hp|kW|abbr=on}} mated to a five speed manual or six-speed automatic gearbox.

=== 2018 facelift ===

In late 2017, Buick announced a facelift update for the 2018 model year that adds the new Buick grilles with the spreading wings to the Verano and Excelle products. The update applies to the Buick Verano sedan/hatchback, Buick Excelle GT sedan, and added a Buick Excelle GX station wagon as an additional new body style. 1 litre and 1.3 litre three cylinder engines were added to the range along with both 6 speed manual and dual clutch gearboxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://car.autohome.com.cn/config/spec/32189.html#pvareaid=3454541|title=2018 Buick Excelle 15T/18T specs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Buick Park Avenue''' is a [[full-size car]] built by [[Buick]]. The nameplate was first used in 1975 for an appearance option package on the [[Buick Electra|Electra 225 Limited]].  It became an Electra trim level in 1978 and its own model starting in the 1991 model year after the Electra was discontinued. There were two generations of the Park Avenue that were manufactured in the United States until 2005. In 2007, the nameplate was revived on a large Buick sedan built by [[Shanghai GM]] for the Chinese market based on the [[Holden Caprice]] from the [[Holden Caprice (WM)|WM/WN]] range. The nameplate is derived from the affluent [[New York City]] [[boulevard]], [[Park Avenue]].

==As a sub-model (1975-1990)==
{{Main article|Buick_Electra#1971–1976|l1=Buick Electra Park Avenue}}
'''1975-1976'''

Park Avenue first appeared as an appearance package on the [[Buick Electra#1977%E2%80%931984|1975 Buick Electra Limited]].  It included similar seats to the [[Cadillac Sixty Special]], optional full center console, [[Buick_V8_engine|Buick 455ci V8]], posi-traction, 15" rallye sport wheels, rear automatic leveling, optional leather, optional [[Airbag|Air Cushion Restraint System]], remote mirror with thermometer, and automatic climate control.  The 1976 cars were largely the same except for some styling revisions and added emissions systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/buick/75_47.html|title=1975 Buick|website=www.lov2xlr8.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/buick/75_61.html|title=1975 Buick|website=www.lov2xlr8.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1977-1984'''

Park Avenue, previously an appearance option package, became an official trim level on the Electra in 1978. Cosmetically, a different grille and redesigned tail lights were the only notable cosmetic changes that year but 1979 brought a redesigned, flat front end and a subtly different taillight treatment featuring a Buick crest and bisecting horizontal silver line. A more extensive redesign occurred for the 1980 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/buick/79bu/3.html|title=Auto Brochure|website=www.lov2xlr8.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/buick/78bui/bilder/6.jpg |title=Photo |website=www.lov2xlr8.no|format=JPG|access-date=2019-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/buick/82ble/bilder/2.jpg |title=Photo |website=www.lov2xlr8.no|format=JPG|access-date=2019-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/buick/84bel/bilder/3.jpg |title=Photo |website=www.lov2xlr8.no|format=JPG|access-date=2019-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1985-1990'''

Park Avenue remained the top trim on the Buick Electra, it was redesigned along with the rest of the Electra line up moving to the front wheel drive GM C-Body.  It featured upgraded upholstery/seating, premium sound, optional leather, and standard [[Buick_V6_engine#4.1|Buick 3800 V6]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-american/curbside-classic-1985-buick-electra-park-avenue-best-dressed-c-body-of-the-year/|title=Curbside Classic: 1985 Buick Electra Park Avenue – Best-Dressed C-Body Of The Year|first=Tom|last=Klockau}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/buick/85electra/bilder/5.jpg |title=Photo |website=www.lov2xlr8.no|format=JPG|access-date=2019-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/buick/86buce/86buce.html|title=lov2xlr8.no|website=www.lov2xlr8.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Park Avenue Ultra'''

In 1989 and 1990, Buick introduced the Park Avenue Ultra trim level. The Ultra was essentially an upgrade to the Electra Park Avenue line, and featured a standard leather interior with dual 20-way power front seats (shared with Cadillac's restyled 1989 [[Cadillac_Sixty_Special|Cadillac Fleetwood Sixty Special]]), lower-body accent exterior paint treatment, distinctive thick-padded vinyl top with limousine-style rear-window surround (available only on Ultra), simulated burled elm trim on the doors and instrument panel, unique aluminum wheels, anti-lock brakes, chromed B-pillar moldings, specific grille and tail lamps, leather-wrapped steering wheel, electronic instrumentation, padded glove-compartment door, unique interior door panel trim, and a variety of otherwise minor changes. With its long list of standard equipment, the Park Avenue Ultra carried a higher base price than Cadillac's Sedan de Ville. The Park Avenue Ultra did not gain much popular recognition, however, until the following generation of Park Avenue where the "Ultra" badge offered even more features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/buick/90bb.html|title=Brochures|website=www.lov2xlr8.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Essence concept car==
[[File:1989 Buick Park Avenue Essence White 01.jpg|thumb|left|1989 Buick Park Avenue Essence ]]
The '''Buick Park Avenue Essence''' was a [[concept car]] designed and engineered by the [[Buick]] division of [[General Motors]] to showcase advanced technology and styling. First shown in 1989 in a light green metallic color, the Essence made rounds through the auto show circuits later in a light white.  Inside the Essence was a wide, sweeping instrument panel that housed a prototype [[Delco Electronics|Delco]] Navicar navigation system among other innovations. Smooth, graceful body lines forecast the eventual production Park Avenue, introduced in 1990.  The Essence was powered by the then-new 165&amp;nbsp;hp version of Buick's 3800 OHV V6 engine.

The 1991 Park Avenue, introduced in July 1990, utilized GM's [[GM C platform (FWD)|C platform]]. It was previewed by the 1989 Park Avenue Essence show car and the Park Avenue's silhouette was often compared to that of contemporary [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguars]] and many of its styling cues, which included a large 'dollar-grin' grille mounted to the hood, rounded lines, and full-width tail lamps. These styling cues made their way to other Buick models restyled in the 1990s.  The Park Avenue was Buick's largest front wheel drive sedan, but the even larger rear wheel drive [[Buick Roadmaster#1991–1996|Roadmaster]] returned to the lineup in 1991 for the station wagon and 1992 for the sedan. 
While not the largest vehicle offered by Buick, as that distinction belonged to the [[Buick Roadmaster|Roadmaster]], the Park Avenue was the most luxurious and considered the flagship of the marque.{{fact|date=September 2008}}

The base model Park Avenue came with a 3.8 L naturally-aspirated V6 engine and plush velour interior upgradeable to leather. Starting in 1992, the ''Ultra'' came with a 3.8 L Supercharged V6 engine and standard leather interior. The Park Avenue received various exterior and interior cosmetic changes, as well as powertrain updates, during this run.  Some of the new options and features added to the first generation included driver (and later passenger) airbags, dual zone climate control, traction control, and variable-effort steering (Ultra only).

===European Market===
The Park Avenue was available in [[Europe]] from 1991 to 1996 and varied from the North American version by featuring a truncated taillamps with separate amber turn signal indicators and red brake lamps, wider numberplate bezel, fitment of rear red fog lamps, headlamps with different lens pattern, white front side running markers, amber front turn signal indicators, side turn signal repeaters, "flagpole" external rear-view mirrors (mirrors on US version are fixed and do not turn), stronger seat belt and anchors, "softer" air bags, metric speedometer and gauges. They are to comply with the [[World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations|European regulatory and safety standards]]. This generation of the Park Avenue was the last Buick to be officially marketed by GM in Europe. This move was to reduce the "cluttered" model range that confused the European consumers. After 1996, Cadillac and Chevrolet remained the sole General Motors North American brands to be sold in Europe.

An updated Park Avenue was released in October 1996 as a 1997 model and was now built on GM's [[GM G platform (FWD)|G platform]]; however GM chose to continue to refer to it as the C platform, but was stronger and more substantial than its predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frame|first=Phil|title=GM H CARS MOVE TO G PLATFORM|url=http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950116/ANA/501160730#axzz2TYYYR1jT|work=[[Automotive News]]|date=16 January 1995|accessdate=17 May 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130616065939/http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950116/ANA/501160730%23axzz2TYYYR1jT|url-status=dead|archivedate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This new generation was powered by updated Series II variants of the [[Buick V6 engine|3800]] and as before, only Ultra models were supercharged.  The base trim featured a hood ornament while the Ultra had a less conspicuous tri-shield inset on the upper edge of the grille.  The base Park Avenue was the last [[United States domestic market|USDM]] Buick to carry a factory hood ornament.

For 2001, the base model's cloth interior was dropped as an option in favor of now standard leather trim. Ultrasonic rear park assist was a new option that year as well.  For 2003, trademark Buick "[[Ventiport]]s" returned on the Park Avenue Ultra along with a bolder grille that carried a larger monochromatic tri-shield badge in the center. New 17 inch wheels, a revised interior and revised instrument cluster were changed for the 2003 model year on the Ultra.

For 2005, the final model year in North America, base Park Avenues received a revised grille, and the previously Ultra-exclusive Ventiports.  Also, the rear fascia was redone across the model line with a prominent chrome bar above the license plate holder with an embossed ''Park Avenue'' script and amber turn signal flashers.

The last 3,000 of 7,000 Park Avenues carried Special Edition badging that featured the namesake script underneath a silhouette of the [[New York City]] skyline. 300 of these were painted with a special two-tone black-on-platinum finish. Production ended on June 18, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/2005-Buick-Park-Avenue-Overview-c5290|title=Buick Park Avenue|website=CarGurus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Park Avenue was discontinued after 2005 in the North American market and was replaced in 2006 by the [[Buick Lucerne]].

In April 2007, General Motors reintroduced the Park Avenue nameplate in [[China]] on a luxury sedan that replaced the [[Holden Caprice#WL|Buick Royaum]]. Like its predecessor, the vehicle is based on the [[Australia]]n-built [[Holden Caprice]] (this time on the contemporary [[Holden Caprice (WM)|WM/WN generation]]), though, unlike the Royaum, it was assembled by [[SAIC-GM|Shanghai GM]] from [[knock-down kit|CKD]] kits shipped from Holden's Elizabeth factory in South Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dornin|first=Tim|date=11 April 2007|url=http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleId=37768|title=WM Statesman derived Buick to be assembled from CKD kits and sold in China|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=15 April 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816132314/http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleId=37768|archivedate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is offered in five trim levels: 舒适型 (Comfort), 精英型 (Elite), 豪华型 (Luxury - 2.8 only), 旗舰型 (Flagship) and 旗舰版 (Ultimate - 2010 only)

The Park Avenue was powered by Australian-built versions of the [[GM High Feature engine]]. The standard engines were the 2.8&amp;nbsp;L [[GM High Feature engine#LP1|''LP1'']] and the 3.6&amp;nbsp;L [[GM High Feature engine#LY7|''LY7'']] engine available as an option on the Elite and Flagship models from 2007 to 2009. The [[engine control unit]] is a [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] E77 32-bit ECM processor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2007/04/10/buick-reintroduces-the-park-avenue-in-china/|title=Buick reintroduces the Park Avenue...in China|author=Nunez, Alex|work=Autoblog|date=10 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, only one engine option was offered, a 3&amp;nbsp;L SIDI (251&amp;nbsp;bhp) replacing the old 2.8 V6 and 3.6 V6 due to fuel consumption with the 2.8 litre engine rated at 11.4 litres per 100 kilometres (20.6 MPG US) and the 3.6 litre engine rated 11.6 litres per 100 kilometres (20.3 MPG US) respectively. The 3 litre engine was rated 10.9 litres per 100 kilometres (21.6 MPG US). The third-generation Park Avenue remained a China exclusive and was never offered by Buick in North America. A version of the car did eventually see release in the US market as the stripped down, rebadged [[Chevrolet Caprice#Sixth generation (2006–2017)|Chevrolet Caprice PPV]] (Police Patrol Vehicle).

The car was discontinued in China in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chinaautoweb.com/2012/10/buick-park-avenue-is-coming-to-an-end/ |title=Buick Park Avenue Is Coming to an End |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=22 October 2012 |website=ChinaAutoWeb |publisher= |accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{single source|date=November 2018}}
'''''Uncertain T''''' is a [[show car]] built by ''[[Car Craft]]'' photographer Steve Scott in 1965.

== Construction details ==
The chassis is steel tube, painted red.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl records ''Car Craft'' calling it 6061-T6 aluminum, but believes Scott would have polished rather than painted it, in that event. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.76 and caption.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1957 [[Buick]] [[Buick V8 engine#Buick "Nailhead" V8 (2nd generation)|nailhead]],&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt; block painted brown with red detailing,&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.76 caption.&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Hot Rod#Language|bored and stroked]] to {{convert|386|cid|cc|abbr=on}} and equipped with 11:1 [[compression ratio|compression]] [[Jahns]] [[piston]]s, [[Stuart Hilborn|Hilborn]] [[Fuel injection|injector]]s, [[Scheiefer]] [[Ignition magneto|magneto]], 1963 Buick [[cylinder head]]s, and [[Exhaust manifold|open headers]].&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.74 caption and photo.&lt;/ref&gt; The transmission and quick-change rear axle casing were painted brown, the [[rack and pinion]] and [[torsion bar]] tube yellow.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.76 caption.&lt;/ref&gt;

The body was [[fiberglass]],&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; resembling the [[Ford Model T|Model T]] "phonebooth" [[coupé]], steeply raked forward, with a "wind-up key" in the rear section.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.75 photo.&lt;/ref&gt; When it debuted, the body was painted a deep candy red (applied by [[Bill Cushenberry]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; The upholstery was done by [[Lee Wells]].&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; The steering wheel was a four-spoke design, mounted vertically.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.76 photo.&lt;/ref&gt;

The car ran on narrow spoked motorcycle wheels in front and wide five-spoked wheels in back.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Torsion bar front suspension was a rarity in customs (or any cars) at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott's use of a 1960 [[MG MGA|MGA]] rack and pinion to operate the [[drag link]] was also innovative.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.76.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the car ran, it had no suspension, no shock absorbers, and no front brakes, effectively making it a [[Custom car#Language|trailer queen]].&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.76 caption.&lt;/ref&gt;
== History ==

''Uncertain T'' debuted at a carshow as part of the [[1965 NHRA Winternationals|1965 Winternats]] at [[Auto Club Raceway Pomona|Pomona]] in February 1965, and appeared in the  May issue of ''Car Craft''.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was on the cover of November's ''Car Craft'', which had a three-page feature (with only black and white photos) inside.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt;

About a month after completion, Scott had the car repainted metalflake brick orange by [[Junior's House of Color]], before entering "Uncertain T" in the [[1965 Oakland Roadster Show|Oakland Roadster Show]];&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, pp.75-6.&lt;/ref&gt; in this new color scheme, it toured the U.S., and won a number of trophies.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.76.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some time later, the engine and chassis details were repainted yellow.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.76 caption.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Uncertain T" also appeared in [[Hot Rod (magazine)|''Hot Rod'']] in July, August, and September 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt; In the September issue, it was listed as for sale, with a price of US$7000; usual for a used [[custom car]] was $2000 to $3000.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, "Uncertain T" was offered as a [[Monogram]] [[Scale model|model kit]].&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1970, the car, then painted metallic gold, was sold to a California resident. Ownership could not be established, and in 2003 was still unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Ganahl, Pat. "Uncertain T", in ''Street Rodder'', July 2003, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Designed in collaboration with artist Don Varner, ''Silhouette'' was Cushenberry's first full-on show car.  He hand-hammered 20-gauge steel over a shortened 1956 Buick chassis, fitting a front-hinged bubble canopy (supplied by Acry Plastics).{{sfnp|Mauldin|1998|page=83–84, 87}} It was candy-painted, mixed with black, red, and gold.{{sfnp|Mauldin|1998|page=83}} The car was powered by a [[Buick]] [[Buick V8 engine#Buick "Nailhead V8" (first generation)|nailhead V8]] (later fitted with [[Stuart Hilborn|Hilborn]] [[fuel injection]]) and ran on reversed [[Cadillac]] wheels.{{sfnp|Mauldin|1998|page=83}} Like a number of other [[show rod]]s at the time, including [[The Mantaray (show rod)|''The Mantaray '']], it had a bubble canopy.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite magazine

The '''Buick Encore GX''' is a subcompact crossover SUV built by [[General Motors]] starting in 2019. Like the smaller [[Buick Encore#Second generation (2020–present)|Buick Encore]], the Encore GX will be assembled by [[GM Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2020 Buick Encore GX Announced For United States|last=Luft|first=Alex|work=GM Authority|url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/05/2020-buick-encore-gx-announced-for-united-states/|date=2019-05-29|accessdate=2019-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Buick Encore GX 003.jpg|thumb|left|Buick Encore GX rear]]
The Buick Encore GX was revealed alongside the second generation Buick Encore at the 2019 [[Shanghai Auto Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a27225684/buick-encore-gx-future-crossover/|title=This Is (Probably) the Next-Gen Buick Encore for the U.S.|work=[[Car and Driver]]|last=Golson|first=Daniel|date=22 April 2019|accessdate=22 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It shares the VSS-F platform with the new [[Chevrolet Trailblazer (crossover)|Chevrolet Trailblazer]] crossover SUV.

==North America==

In North America, the Encore GX was introduced at the [[Los Angeles Auto Show]] in November 2019, and will make its debut in early 2020 for the 2020 model year. It will slot in between the smaller Buick Encore and the midsize [[Buick Envision]], but will not replace the Buick Encore in that market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2020 Buick Encore GX revealed as a bigger smaller crossover|work=Autoblog|last=Stockdale|first=Joel|url=https://www.autoblog.com/2019/05/29/2020-buick-encore-gx-crossover-revealed/|date=29 May 2019|accessdate=13 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Encore GX will include several standard safety assistance features, such as [[automatic emergency braking]], forward collision alert, and [[lane departure warning]].

The Encore GX will launch in three trims: Preferred, Select, and Essence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Little-bit-bigger 2020 Buick Encore GX gets two three-cylinder engines|url=https://www.autoblog.com/2019/08/08/buick-encore-gx-three-cylinder-engines/|work=Autoblog|last=Ramsey|first=Jonathon|date=8 August 2019|accessdate=15 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  It also gets a Sport Touring package that adds visual enhancements such as a custom grille with Red accents, sporty front &amp; rear bumpers with Red accents, body-colored moldings, and exclusive 18-inch wheels, but no mechanical upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.autodevot.com/2020/03/2020-buick-encore-gx-and-encore-gx-st/|title=Buick Encore GX packs style and technology|website=www.autodevot.com|accessdate=12 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two engines will be available.  The first, a 1.2-liter, turbocharged 3-cylinder engine producing {{convert|137|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|166|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} torque, is standard on front-wheel-drive models with a [[continuously variable transmission|CVT]].  The second, a 1.3-liter, turbocharged 3-cylinder engine producing {{convert|155|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|174|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} torque, is standard on all-wheel-drive models with a 9-speed automatic transmission.  It is also available on Select and Essence trims with FWD.  While the new I3 engine is offered with several GM models in China, it will be the first I3 in a GM car in North America since the [[Geo Metro|Geo/Chevrolet Metro]].

In April 2018, two production-intent models were unveiled; one electric, and the other a plug-in hybrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/04/buick-velite-6-bows-for-china-in-plug-in-and-battery-electric-variants/|title=Buick Velite 6 Bows For China In Plug-In And Battery-Electric Variants|publisher=GM Authority|date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
