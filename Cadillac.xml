The '''Cadillac Series 60''' was [[Cadillac]]'s mid-priced entry in the luxury vehicle market when it appeared in 1936. It was replaced by the [[Cadillac Series 61|Series 61]] in 1939, but a model that was derived from it, the [[Cadillac Sixty Special|Sixty Special]], continued off and on through 1993.

The Series 60 was the brainchild of new Cadillac manager, Nicholas Dreystadt. Debuting in 1936, it filled a gaping price gap between the [[LaSalle (automobile)|LaSalle]]s and [[Cadillac Series 70|Series 70]] Cadillac models. Initially it rode on a {{convert|121.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase and shared the [[GM B platform|B body]] with cars from LaSalle, [[Buick]], and [[Oldsmobile]]. This went up to {{convert|124.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} in 1937-38.

The exterior featured a new [[Harley Earl]]-designed look with a tall, slender grille and split vee-shaped windshield. This body used [[Fisher Body]]'s new Turret Top one-piece roof and [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix]] dual-servo brakes. "[[Dubonnet suspension|Knee-Action]]" [[independent suspension]], first introduced by Cadillac in 1934, was a welcome novelty for the mid-price market at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GSgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1932+plane&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=k79PTYCuA4P78Abo8_3EDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBjge#v=onepage&amp;q=Popular%20Science%201932%20plane&amp;f=true "Knee-Action Front Wheels" GM ad] ''Popular Science Monthly'', March 1934, first introduced on Pontiac automobiles with Straight-Eight engine&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the hood was the new (less expensive) [[Cadillac V8 engine#Monobloc|Monobloc]] [[V8 engine|V8]]. This {{convert|322|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine produced 125&amp;nbsp;hp (93&amp;nbsp;kW), just 10 less than that in the larger Cadillacs. The Series 60 immediately became the company's best-selling model, making up half of all Cadillacs sold the first year.

The next year, displacement on all Monobloc Cadillacs was {{convert|346|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}. This new engine produced 135&amp;nbsp;hp (101&amp;nbsp;kW), more than all V8 Cadillacs of just a few years earlier. The Series 60 was superseded by the [[Cadillac Series 61|Series 61]] and disappeared after 1938.

The '''Cadillac V-16''' (also known as the '''Cadillac Sixteen''') was [[Cadillac]]'s top-of-the-line model from its January 1930 launch until 1940. The [[V16 engine|V16]] powered car was a first in the United States, both extremely expensive and exclusive, with all chassis finished to custom order.  Only 4076 were constructed in its 11-year run, with the majority built in its debut year before the [[Great Depression]] took strong hold. The onset of [[World War II]] reduced the sales, resulting in its demise.

== Genesis ==
In 1926, Cadillac began the development of a new, "multi-cylinder" car. A customer requirement was seen for a car powered by an engine simultaneously more powerful and smoother than any other available. Development proceeded in great secrecy over the next few years; a number of prototype cars were built and tested as the new engine was developed, while at the same time Cadillac chief Larry Fisher and GM's stylist [[Harley Earl]] toured Europe in search of inspiration from Europe's finest [[coachbuilder]]s. Unlike many builders of luxury cars, who sold bare chassis to be clothed by outside coachbuilding firms, General Motors had purchased the coachbuilders [[Fleetwood Metal Body]] and [[Fisher Body]] to keep all the business in-house. Bare Cadillac chassis could be purchased if a buyer insisted, but the intention was that few would need to do so. One Cadillac dealer in England, namely Lendrum &amp; Hartman, ordered at least two such chassis in even rarer right hand drive (RHD) configuration and had [[Vanden Plas]] (Belgium) build first an elegant limousine-landaulet (engine #702297), then a sports sedan with unusual cycle fenders and retractable step plates in lieu of running boards (engine #702298, which was successfully shown in various Concours d'Elegance events in Europe before being bought by the young Nawab of [[Bahawalpur (princely state)|Bahawalpur]]); both these cars have survived. A third RHD chassis was ordered by the Indian Maharaja of [[Orchha State|Orccha]] (Bhopal) and sent to Farina in Italy, in July 1931, for a boat tail body (engine between #703136 and #703152).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://cadillacdatabase.org/Dbas_txt/V6srv30b.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until after the stock market crash of 1929 that Cadillac announced to the world the availability of the costliest Cadillac yet, the new V-16. The new vehicle was first displayed at [[New York City]]'s automobile show on January 4, 1930.

The Cadillac V-16 was distinguished by its pioneering [[V16 engine|V-16]] engine, a narrow 45° V angle [[OHV]] [[Cadillac V-16 engine#Series 452|Series 452]] displacing {{convert|452|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}.

Cadillac’s V-16 Series 452 was announced shortly after the October 1929 stock market crash. It suffered from bad timing.&lt;ref name=Sherman11June2019/&gt;

Upon its introduction the new car attracted rave reviews from the press and huge public attention. January production averaged a couple of cars per day, then ramped up to twenty-two. By April, 1,000 units had been built, and by June, 2,000 cars. These could be ordered with a wide variety of bodywork. The Fleetwood catalog for the 1930 V-16 included 10 basic body styles; there was also an envelope containing some 30 additional designer's drawings. Research by the Cadillac-La Salle Club, Inc. puts at 70 the number of different job/style numbers built by Fisher and Fleetwood on the Sixteen chassis.

Beginning in June 1930, five new V-16s participated in a promotional tour of major European cities including Paris, Antwerp, Brussels, Amsterdam, Utrecht, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Berlin, Cologne, Dresden, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Nuremberg, Vienna (where they won prizes), Berne, Geneva, Lausanne, Zürich, Madrid, San Sebastian, La Baule and Angers. On the return journey from Spain, the V16 caravan stopped also in the town of Cadillac, in south-western France, although that city bears no relationship to the marque, other than its name.

After the peak in V-16 orders in mid-1930, production fell precipitously. During October 1930, only 54 cars were built. The lowest figures for the 452/452A cars of 1930–31 were August 1931 (seven units) and November 1931 (six units). Minimum production continued throughout the rest of the decade with a mere 50 units being built both in 1935 and in 1937. 1940 was only marginally better with a total of 51 units. Not surprisingly, Cadillac later estimated that they lost money on every single V-16 they sold.

Production of the original V-16 continued under various model names through 1937. The body was redesigned in 1933 as the model 452C. Innovations included Fisher no draft individually controlled ventilation (I.C.V. or vent windows).

For 1934, the body was redesigned again and denoted as 452D, and as 452E in 1935. The V-16 now featured the [[Fisher Body|Fisher]] Turret Top all-steel roof, though the cars were still built by [[Fleetwood Metal Body|Fleetwood]]. This same basic design would remain virtually unchanged through 1937. With a wheelbase of {{Convert|154.0|in|mm|0}} and a curb weight of up to {{Convert|6600|lb}} these are perhaps the largest standard production cars ever produced in the United States. Combined production for the 1934 and 1935 model years was 150. It was redesignated the Series 90 in 1936 as Cadillac reorganized their model names. Fifty-two units were sold that year, with nearly half ordered as limousines. Hydraulic brakes were added for 1937, the last year of production. Fifty vehicles were produced.

The V-16 "Series 90" and V-12 "[[Cadillac V-12|Series 80 and 85]]", were essentially merged for 1938 with the introduction of the new [[Cadillac V16 engine#Series 90|L-head V-16]].  The {{convert|431|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine was an in-block valve (i.e. [[flathead engine|flathead]]) design, and featured a wider 135° V-angle, twin carburetors, twin fuel pumps, twin distributors, twin water pumps, and a nine main bearing crankshaft (compared to the OHV V-16's five bearing crank) and produced the same {{Convert|185|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} as later versions of the original V-16 with even greater smoothness and endowed the '38–'40 Sixteens with the swiftest acceleration of any car in the world at the time regardless of weight{{cn|date=December 2017}} as well as slightly improved fuel economy over the OHV V-16 cars. This engine was nearly silent at idle and exceptionally smooth in operation. The wheelbase was reduced to {{convert|141.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, the body remained {{convert|222.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} in overall length. The "Sixteens" (as Cadillac referred to them) were basically series 75 cars with the new V-16 engine although they differed from the firewall forward from the V-8 cars and had several other trim differences. The instrument panels were identical to and changed yearly with the V-8 cars from 1938 to 1940. Only the '38 Sixteens had a horn button which had "Sixteen" in art deco script; the '39 and '40 models, like the V-8, had the Cadillac crest on the button. Three hundred fifteen were sold in the first year, 138 in the next. The production of the 1940 models ended in December 1939.

== Today ==
The Cadillac V-16 is today recognized as one of the finest automobiles of the prewar era by many authorities. The [[Classic Car Club of America]] rates all V-16s as CCCA Full Classics, a rating reserved for only the finest automobiles of the 1925&amp;ndash;1948 period. Values reflect these opinions; particularly fine examples of the 1930 production can change hands for more than US$500,000 {{As of|2004|lc=on}}. As always, convertibles are the most valued, and the earlier cars more so than the 1938–40 vehicles. A good condition 1938 sedan can sell for under US$80,000. Certain custom-bodied vehicles have sold for even more.

==Concept car==
{{main article|Cadillac Sixteen}}
In 2003, Cadillac created a concept car called the Sixteen, which used a 13.6 litre V-16 engine that developed {{convert|1000|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. Even though it used the current "A&amp;S" (Art &amp; Science) style of design that is Cadillac's stylistic hallmark, it shared many small details from the classic V-16. The Sixteen is also known to have the steering wheel logo carved out of solid crystal and a [[Bulgari]] clock.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Cadillac Commercial Chassis''' was basically a strengthened version of the long-wheelbase [[Cadillac (automobile)|Cadillac]] [[Cadillac Series 355|Series 355]] frame and the [[Cadillac Series 75|Series 75]] was intended to carry the extra weight of the bodywork, rear deck and cargo area of [[hearse|funeral coaches]] and [[ambulance]]s.  Specifically designed for [[professional car]] use, it used the [[GM D platform]], and the rear of the Cadillac Commercial Chassis was considerably lower than the passenger car frame, thereby lowering the rear deck height as well for ease of loading and unloading. As shipped from the factory to custom [[coachbuilder]]s for final assembly,  Cadillac's Commercial Chassis typically consisted of the front end sheetmetal with all lighting and trim, dashboard, air conditioning (if specified) and the main road controls. Rear quarter panels and sometimes the front door shells were shipped with the chassis for use in the finished vehicle. Though most Cadillac funeral coaches were based on its commercial chassis, some coachbuilders offered less expensive models constructed from modified Cadillac sedans. For 1977, Cadillac drastically downsized the commercial chassis along with markedly increasing its cost; Custom coachbuilders rushed to design new bodies for the smaller  chassis, and both production and sales dropped dramatically as prices increased. Funeral directors everywhere shied away from the significantly smaller, much more expensive Cadillac funeral cars. This downsizing, along with new [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards]] in the United States and Canada calling for increased weight ratings as of the 1979 model year, spelled the end of the automobile-based ambulance and the beginning of the van and truck-based units seen today throughout North America. 

The downsizing of the Cadillac Commercial Chassis had a devastating effect on the American funeral car and ambulance industry, as sales of the much smaller, but much more expensive Cadillac funeral cars fell dramatically and one by one, the old established firms who built these cars (such as [[Superior Coach Company|Superior]], [[Wayne Corporation|Miller-Meteor]] and [[Centigon (company)|Hess &amp; Eisenhardt]]) either threw in the towel or were sold off and reorganized.
After Cadillac adopted [[unibody]] construction in 1997, practically all Cadillac-based funeral coaches have been  produced from modified sedans. Cadillac supplies incomplete "[[Knock-down kit|kits]]" of its [[Cadillac XTS|XTS]] sedans (and DTS/DeVille until 2011) to Master Coachbuilders which are certified for conversions and assembly of finished funeral vehicles.

Load carrying duties are now shared with the [[Cadillac Escalade]], based on the [[Chevrolet Suburban]].

The '''Cadillac Sixty Special''' is a name used by [[Cadillac]] to denote a special model since the 1938 Harley Earl-[[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]]-designed extended wheelbase derivative of the [[Cadillac Series 60|Series 60]], often referred to as the Fleetwood Sixty Special.  The Sixty Special designation was reserved for some of Cadillac's most luxurious vehicles.  It was offered as a four-door sedan and briefly as a four-door hardtop.  This exclusivity was reflected in the introduction of the exclusive Fleetwood Sixty Special Brougham d'Elegance in 1973 and the Fleetwood Sixty Special Brougham Talisman in 1974, and it was offered as one trim package below the [[Cadillac Series 70|Series 70]] limousine.  The Sixty Special name was temporarily retired in 1976 but returned again in 1987 and continued through 1993.

[[File:1939 Cadillac Series 60 Special rl.jpg|thumb|left|1939 Cadillac 60 Special rear]]
For 1938, the Harley Earl-[[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]] designed Sixty Special was added between Cadillac's lowest-priced line of cars, the "Series 60", and the "Senior" large-bodied Cadillacs. It replaced the model "70" (short-base Series 70). Although all first-generation 60 Specials were built at the Fleetwood Plant, the 60 Special was marketed as a Fisher Body car in 1938 and 1939.

The new four-door sedan, designed to look like a convertible sedan, showcased trend-setting features including a completely integrated, coupe-like trunk (which launched "three-box" sedan styling); no running boards (which all makes soon followed); convertible-style doors with bright metal window frames (Bill Mitchell called the '38 60 Special "the first hardtop"); a "four-window" canopy with more glass area than any Cadillac before; a steeply-raked windshield and four front-hinged doors. Contrary to what was then prevailing practice for luxury automobiles, the new Sixty Special was intended as an owner-driven car, rather than a chauffeur-driven one.&lt;ref name="Odin, L.C. 2015"&gt;Odin, L.C. ''World in Motion 1939 - The whole of the year's automobile production''. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was built on a {{Convert|127.0|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase - {{Convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} longer than the standard Series 60 cars. The new Sixty Special utilized a unique "X" frame underneath, which allowed the {{Convert|4170|lb|abbr=on}}. car to sit within its frame. This not only gave the new Cadillac the stiffest chassis on the market, but it was also 3 inches lower than other Cadillacs - with no sacrifice in headroom.  The disappearance of running boards along the side and its lack of a heavy belt line molding made the sleek car appear even lower.  More important, it allowed shoulder and hip room to increase by over 5 inches without an increase in overall width. When combined with the brand-new column-mounted shift lever, the cars offered true six passenger comfort. The Sixty Special was powered by Cadillac's standard {{Convert|130|hp|abbr=on}}, {{Convert|346|cuin|L|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine]].&lt;ref name="Odin, L.C. 2015"/&gt;

In its debut year, 3,703 Sixty Specials were delivered, at a base cost of $2,090 each - it was a success in every measure.  The new Sixty Special outsold every other Cadillac model in its first year accounting for 39% of all Cadillacs sold.  In 1938, aside from the standard 4-door sedan, two prototype models were built on the Sixty Special body - two very dashing four-door convertibles (one owned by GM executive, Larry Fisher, which was demolished by Harley Earl in a traffic accident and one sent to Europe, which was later recalled and consumed by GM Engineering in structural tests in preparation for the 1940 "Torpedo" bodies), plus one Sixty-Special coupe (driven personally for two years by GM President, Bill Knudsen).

A not well-received new front end, which was patterned on the Lincoln Zephyr and lacked the visual punch expected by Cadillac buyers, a modest change in trim level, and some new options appeared for Sixty Special in 1939. First among the new options was a retractable metal panel above the front seat called a "Sunshine Turret-Top Roof", a predecessor to the type of sunroof that would not become more commonplace until the mid 1970s. The sliding roof, patented by GM's Ternstedt Hardware division, was unlatched and slid back into a recess built into the rear portion of the main roof where it would lock in place.  Second was an optional retractable division glass in between the front and rear seats. This partition did not have a header in the roof, only channels between the door posts for the retractable glass to travel. The 1938 price of $2,090 remained for 1939 as well. More than 5,500 Sixty Specials were built for 1939, accounting for 40% of all Cadillacs sold, but only 280 of them were equipped with the sun roof option (of those 280 sun roof optioned cars, 55 of them were also equipped with the retractable glass partition). Special orders in 1939 included a convertible sedan built on the Sixty Special chassis for Prince Frederik of Denmark.&lt;ref name="Odin, L.C. 2015"/&gt;

Starting in 1940, and for the remainder of its existence, the Sixty Special would be Fleetwood marketed, enjoying higher-priced molding, trim and upholstery like the Series 75 and 90. Thus it took over the Series 70's place, which was dropped for the 1938 model year, as Cadillac's most luxurious owner-driven large model, a role it would fill through 1976.  For 1940, the price (for the third year in a row) and general styling remained the same, with only modest trim changes. Of special note is that 1940 was the last year that side-mounted spare tires (optional on all Cadillacs, including Sixty Special) were offered. The Sixty Special line expanded to four models this year: Touring Sedan (the base model), Imperial sedan (priced at $2,230, it featured a retractable glass partition between the front and rear seats), and two open-front Town Car models (one style with a painted roof, the other with a leather-covered roof). These two very formal cars had a removable roof section over the front seat and a glass division window.  Of the Sixty Specials built in 1940, 4,242 of them were the Touring model.  There were 113 Imperials (including 3 that were also equipped with the sun roof), and lastly, only 15 Town Car models.  Of the 15, 9 had the painted metal roof (priced at $3,465), and 6 were the formal leather-covered roof version (priced at $3,820).

[[File:Cadillac Fleetwood 60S.001 - Monte San Pedro.JPG|thumb|left|1941 Cadillac 60 Special]]
1941 was the last year of Harley Earl and Bill Mitchell's original Sixty Special design, as an all-new 1942 model was in the works.  Many consider the 1941 to the most beautiful of this series, though Mitchell himself favored the clean lines of the original 1938 model.  For the first time, Cadillac had its own front end design—the wider than high "tombstone" grille with a forward-jutting center section flanked by flat side sections — that would identify Cadillacs for years to come; the new grille appeared as a horizontally-oriented rectangle when viewed head-on hence the nickname. Other changes were longer front fenders that terminated with extension caps attached to the front doors, fully engulfed the lowered, widely positioned headlights and (in concert with a new hood) filled the formerly vacant area adjacent to the engine compartment; the rear fenders now held full skirts as standard. For 1941, the wheelbase was reduced by {{Convert|1|in}}, down to {{Convert|126|in|mm|abbr=on}}.  Sixty Specials showed a $105 price increase (for the first time) to $2,195.  Power was still supplied by the same {{Convert|346|cuin|L|abbr=on}} Cadillac engine as before, but was now rated at {{Convert|150|hp|abbr=on}}. Production totals include 3,878 Touring sedans (including 185 with the sun roof option), and 220 Imperial sedans (now priced at $2,345).  Only 1 Sixty Special Town Car was made this year and used on the auto show circuit before being purchased by film director, Cecil B. DeMille.  Featuring the leather-covered roof, it was the last one to come from Cadillac-Fleetwood.

There were nearly 17,900 Sixty Specials made from 1938 to 1941, including about a dozen custom bodied versions.

The completely new Sixty Special for 1942 was {{Convert|7|in}} longer and {{Convert|1|in}} lower than the 1941 model, and now riding an exclusive wheelbase of {{Convert|133|in|mm}}, longer than any other non-limousine Cadillac. This marked the beginning of what would become a central characteristic of the Sixty Special. For 28 of the next 34 model years of its existence the Sixty Special would feature a uniquely stretched GM C-Body with noticeably greater legroom and headroom.

Through 1948, Cadillac advertised the Sixty Special as a five-passenger car.  The new design was more streamlined and less upright in appearance versus its predecessor, featuring "pontoon" fenders front and rear; this was the year that the bumper "bullets" were introduced which would remain a Cadillac styling feature through 1958. The unique, separate bright metal window frames were dropped in favor of bright metal window surrounds on conventional style doors. The slow-selling Sunshine Roof (sun roof) option was discontinued at the end of the 1941 model year, and would not reappear in a Cadillac until the 1970 [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]]. Rear compartment wood-grained door caps now blended into a fixed rear bulkhead just behind the front seat (on all vehicles with or without a glass partition), emphasizing front and rear compartment separation. While the model-specific interior was luxuriously outfitted, Cadillac largely depended on trim to differentiate the exterior of Sixty Special from the shorter but similarly styled Series 62 Touring Sedan. Decorative chrome louvers - which would become a Sixty Special trademark ornament for years to come - were mounted in three locations on the 1942 model: behind the wheel well openings on the front and rear fenders, as well as mounted on the roof behind the rear door opening. In addition to the louvered trim, the Sixty Special had a wider "C-pillar" than other models. Just two variants were now available in the Sixty Special series – the standard sedan priced at $2,435 and a $2,589 Imperial sedan which featured an electrically adjustable glass partition between the front and rear seats.  Productions totals include 1,684 standard sedans and an additional 190 Imperial sedans. Because of [[World War II]], Cadillac ended automobile production in February 1942 and began assembling military equipment.

On October 17, 1945, the first post-war Cadillac rolled off the assembly line. The 1946 Sixty Special was now very similar to the [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] [[Cadillac Series 62|Series 62]], though a mild wheelbase stretch added more room to the rear seat area. The 1946 model showed few changes from the 1942 model, including a mild grille redesign and new bumpers.  Parking lamps and turn signals were now mounted below the headlights.  This was the first year the "V" was used underneath the Cadillac crest (the last vehicle to use this emblem would be the 1984 [[Cadillac DeVille|DeVille]]).  Only one model remained in the Sixty Special lineup – the $3,054 standard sedan.  Both sets of fender-mounted chrome louvers were gone, but roof-mounted ones remained.  Cadillac now used a negative-ground battery on a 6-volt system. Sixty Special would only reach 5,700 units for 1946, as it did not go into production until later in the model year. An electric clock was standard.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt;

Few changes greeted Sixty Special for 1947, as an all-new design was coming in 1948.  Cadillac's famed "sombrero" wheel covers – in bright stainless steel - debuted this year. Behind the redesigned grille was the same {{Convert|346|cuin|L|abbr=on}} engine that Cadillac had been using since 1936, now rated at {{Convert|150|hp}}. Bright metal stone shields – mounted on the forward edge of the rear fenders - replaced the black rubber pieces used on the 1946 model. The new grille was made up of five bars versus the previous six.  Lastly, Cadillac script nameplates replaced the block letters used previously.  Price was up to $3,195 – a pretty substantial jump from the 1942 price of $2,435 considering it was practically the same vehicle.  Despite the steep price hike, production hit a new height at 8,500 units, but this represented only 14% of Cadillac's sales, down sharply from the 40% share they had represented in 1939. This was largely due to the tremendous sales success of the Series 61 and 62, whose low, runningboardless bodies, with broad shoulder room, had been inspired by the original Sixty Special.

Nearly every model was redesigned for 1948, including the $3,820 Sixty Special.  With all-new sheet metal, but still riding an exclusive 133-inch wheelbase, the luxurious Sixty Special weighed in at 4,370 pounds shipping weight (over 4,500 pounds curb weight).  Inside, window lifts and a two-way adjustable bench seat with hydro-electric assist were standard equipment; the system utilized a central electrically driven pump that provided pressurized fluid to hydraulic cylinders attached to the seat and window regulators. A clever rainbow-shaped instrument cluster which put all the gauges directly above the steering column in front of the driver was used for 1948 only, while a new curved dashboard design added to passenger roominess.  The roof-mounted decorative chrome louvers and individually framed side door glass (a Sixty Special design element since 1938) were carried over to this latest model as well.  With trim inspired by the [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[P-38 Lightning]], the new Sixty Special featured simulated side-scoops and curious tail-fins - resembling the P-38's vertical stabilizers.

1949 brought new power to Cadillac, in the form of the {{Convert|331|cuin|L|abbr=on}} OHV [[V8 engine]].  This new powerplant featured a short-stroke, high-compression design that provided both quiet, economical operation and smooth, high performance.  Although the engine was smaller and shorter than its predecessor, it was {{Convert|10|hp|abbr=on}} more powerful and 188 pounds lighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1949_Cadillac/1949_Cadillac_Brochure/1949%20Cadillac-04.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1949_Cadillac/1949_Cadillac_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With near-annual improvements, this engine was used through the 1955 model year.  A new grille was in order for 1949 – this one wider and more substantial than the previous year; the bottom and middle horizontal members framing the bright trim surrounding the parking lights and wrapping around the front fenders. The unusual 1948 instrument panel was replaced by a simplified, more conventional but less exciting arrangement. With only a slight price increase, the $3,859 Sixty Special was now advertised as a six-passenger car, and sales reached a record 11,399 units.  1949 was the last year Sixty Special used a two-piece windshield with a vertical divider mounted in the center.  Four Cadillacs were custom-made this year for the General Motors Automobile Show in New York.  Three of them used the Sixty Special body – including a two-door pillar-less hardtop, the first "[[Cadillac De Ville|Coupe DeVille]]", built on a 133-inch Sixty Special wheelbase.  The other two were specially outfitted and equipped standard Sixty Special sedans.  The fourth car built for the show was a stock 1949 Cadillac Series 62 convertible – but with a custom western motif interior.

Throughout the 1950s, the Sixty Special would continue as a stretched and optioned-up version of the Cadillac Series 62, but lost the [[manual transmission]].

For 1950, Cadillac showed all-new styling on every car in the lineup, including the $3,797 Sixty Special. While the opulent interior rivaled no other Cadillac, the exterior styling was nearly identical to the less-expensive Series 62 models. The chrome louver trim that was mounted on the rear roof panel since 1942 was now moved to the lower rear doors, just forward of the rear wheel wells. Although Cadillac utilized a wheelbase  {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} longer than the Series 62, the {{convert|130|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase was down {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}} from the previous year. The 1950 Sixty Special's shipping weight was {{convert|4136|lb|kg|abbr=on}} in base form (over {{convert|4300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} curb weight), and was powered by the same engine introduced for 1949 - the {{Convert|331|cuin|L|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#OHV|Cadillac OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]] producing {{Convert|160|hp}}. For the first time in their history, over 100,000 Cadillacs were sold this year, and 13,755 of them was the Sixty Special – a new record for that model. Of historical note is that the actual 100,000th Cadillac that rolled off the assembly line was a 1950 Sixty Special.

1951 showed little change from 1950, apart from a new grille and bumper design, borrowing bumper bullets (or [[Custom car#Language|dagmars]]) from the 1951 [[Le Sabre concept car|GM Le Sabre]] show car.&lt;ref&gt;Flory,  J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1946–1959'' (Jefferson, NC:  McFarland &amp; Coy, 2008), p. 1021.&lt;/ref&gt; Inside, red warning "idiot" lamps replaced the gauges for secondary instruments like voltage and oil pressure.  The same {{Convert|331|cuin|L|abbr=on}} engine, introduced in 1949, was utilized for the 1951 Cadillacs, but with minor revisions for the drivetrain.  Despite a price jump to $4,060, the {{convert|4155|lb|kg|abbr=on}}-shipping-weight Sixty Special broke records for the second year in a row, as sales now hit 18,631.

Cadillac celebrated its Golden Anniversary in 1952.  Changes were minimal – and mostly in back where the reverse lamps were now integral with the fin-mounted tail lamps, and the "Fleetwood" script returned to the trunk lid. In addition, the rear exhaust outlets were now in the form of two wide horizontal slots on the outer edges of the rear bumper.  Also new for 1952 were winged crest emblems, mounted on the grille extensions below the headlights. With the addition of a down-draft carburetor, the {{Convert|331|cuin|L|abbr=on}} engine now produced {{Convert|190|hp}}.  A revised [[automatic transmission]] was standard on Sixty Special, while power steering was offered at extra cost.  Sales fell to 16,110 units, while the price and weight both rose, to $4,269 and {{convert|4,258|lb|kg|abbr=on}} shipping weight. Cadillac won ''Motor Trend's'' "Car of the Year" again in 1952.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt;

Just more of the same for 1953 Sixty Special, as all the attention was towards the new Eldorado convertible.  Minimal trim changes to the Sixty Special included wider rocker panel moldings, which moved the chrome louvers higher up on the rear doors, and a revised grille and bumper.  However, significant engineering changes were made to the 1953 models, including a new 12-volt electrical system and a jump in power for the {{Convert|331|cuin|L|abbr=on}} engine – now rated at {{Convert|210|hp|abbr=on}}. Two new notable options debuted this year. First, the $619.55 trunk-mounted air conditioning unit – developed by Frigidaire – was available in all closed-body Cadillac models.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; Second, the dashboard-mounted "Autronic Eye" became available. This automated system, which automatically dimmed the high-beam headlights when a forward-facing sensor indicated oncoming traffic, would become a Cadillac option for nearly the next forty years. Also available – for $325 – was a set of five wire wheels, which hadn't been seen on factory Cadillacs since the 1930s. Wire wheels would occasionally continue to be optionally available through 1992. The minor changes for the 1953 Sixty Special worked wonders, as sales of the $4,304 car was now up to a record 20,000 copies. Weight was up to {{convert|4415|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, and optional wire wheels would add an additional {{convert|30|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.

All 1954 Cadillacs wore new sheet metal, but unfortunately the $4,683 Sixty Special still looked too much like its lower-priced sibling, the Series 62.  Wheelbase for Sixty Special was back up to {{convert|133|in|mm|abbr=on}} – where it had been in 1949.  Refined power steering, from Saginaw, became standard equipment, along with electric windshield washers.  New options included a four-way electrically power bench seat, and power brakes from Bendix.  As they had been doing since its introduction in 1949, Cadillac was able to pull more power out of its {{Convert|331|cuin|L|abbr=on}} engine, and now it was rated at 230.  The eight chrome trim louvers moved lower onto the rear doors, back where they were in 1952.  Sales dropped to 16,200 this year – down from 20,000 in 1953.

Sixty Special arrived with revised trim and more power ({{Convert|250|hp|abbr=on}}, to be exact) for 1955, and while the $4,342 price was lower than last year, production rose slightly to 18,300 units.  The eight chrome louvers – mounted on the lower rear doors since 1950, were replaced by 12 louvers mounted just ahead of the bumper on the rear fenders.  Chrome rocker panel moldings – taller than the ones used on Series 62s - stretched from the back of the rear wheel well to the rear bumper.  A new grille held a bold eggcrate design, while the rear roof support fashioned a delicate Florentine curve – this design was also shared with the lower-rung Series 62. In back, six vertical chrome louvers were mounted on the panel below the trunk lid – three spaced on each side of the license plate mounting.  The tinted band across the windshield header changed from green to gray this year.  A new option, the remote control trunk release, debuted this year.

1956 was the last year for the knobby, P-38 inspired tail fins on the rear of most Cadillacs, including the $4,587 Sixty Special.  While the Cadillac division broke records by surpassing 150,000 units, Sixty Special slipped to an even 17,000 this year. Revamped trim included Cadillac crests on the front fenders, and a new grille (with a finer eggcrate design from last year) bearing a Cadillac script emblem, mounted at an angle, on the driver's side.  Sixty Special script appeared on the front fenders below the Cadillac crest for the first time in the series history. Rear fenders held a chrome bead running along the top, while massive chrome spears with hash marks replaced the 1955's delicate chrome louvers on the rear sides.  This chrome side trim morphed into the oval exhaust ports in the redesigned rear bumper. An anodized gold grille was optionally available on Sixty Special, while power brakes became standard equipment.  New for 1956 was a larger {{Convert|365|cuin|L|abbr=on}} powerplant producing {{Convert|285|hp}} combined with a revamped automatic transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=the Auto Editors of Consumer Guide |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1950-1959-cadillac2.htm |title=HowStuffWorks "1954, 1955, 1956 Cadillac" |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=2007-03-13 |accessdate=2011-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sabre Spoke wheels - standard on Eldorado - became available for Sixty Special, while inside, passenger seatbelts appeared on the option list.

Cadillac introduced its first production four-door hardtop, the Sedan DeVille, in 1956.  When Cadillac redesigned all of its standard models for 1957, the Sixty Special adopted the pillarless design as well. Priced at a hefty $5,539, the {{convert|4761|lb|kg|abbr=on}} (shipping weight) Sixty Special production reached an impressive 24,000 units - a sales plateau that the nameplate would never achieve again.  The chrome fender louvers, a Sixty Special trademark since 1942, were gone in favor of a giant ribbed metallic panel that occupied the entire lower half of the rear fender. The Sixty Special script was located on the lower half of the front fender, and was relocated to the top of the rear fin for 1958, and the word "Fleetwood" was 
spelled out in block lettering across the trunklid. Engineering treats included moving the optional air conditioning unit from the trunk to a space under the hood, and a foot-operated parking brake that released when the car was put in gear.  The {{Convert|365|cuin|L|abbr=on}} engine introduced last year was now bumped up to {{Convert|300|hp|abbr=on}}. In spite of all-new sheet metal on the 1957 models, much of Cadillac's attention was focused on the new limited production [[Cadillac Series 70#1957–1958|Eldorado Brougham]]. This new four-door model did not pose a threat to Sixty Special production, since the new Brougham was a hand-built, limited-production specialty model with a stupendously steep $13,074 price tag – more than double a new Sixty Special. Power windows and brakes were standard.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; A pre-selector radio was optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1958_Cadillac/1958_Cadillac_Brochure_1/1958%20Cadillac-15.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1958_Cadillac/1958_Cadillac_Brochure_1 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1958 saw extensive design changes, even though the cars were entirely revamped for 1957.  Horsepower from the {{Convert|365|cuin|L|abbr=on}} engine was now at {{Convert|310|hp|abbr=on}}.  Sparkling "studs" decorated the wide new grille, while the rubber-tipped bumper guards were moved further out towards the edges of the car – leaving a lower, wider look.  Four headlights, a style that appeared on last year's Eldorado Brougham, were adopted for all Cadillacs, including the $6,117 Sixty Special. Full fender skirts practically hid the rear wheels from sight, and the massive ribbed stainless steel trim occupied the lower half of the rear fender. Small vent windows were added to Sixty Special's rear doors, and newly available power door locks were optional. This marked the last year that the Sixty Special would maintain a stretched GM C-Body until its return in the 1965 model year. The model year 1958 would also be the last that the Sixty Special script would actually appear anywhere on the car. Sales for the 4,930 pound (shipping weight) car slid to 12,900 units – nearly half of last year's production.

In 1959, the memorable fins appeared on nearly all Cadillacs this year, including the Sixty Special.  Now riding a {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}}-shorter wheelbase ({{convert|130|in|mm|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt;), the {{convert|225|in|mm|abbr=on}}-long Sixty Special continued as a pillarless hardtop with its own distinct [[molding (automotive)|molding]]s - including a side-mounted dummy air-scoop on the rear fender, and a thin chrome bead that ran from the front fender back to the rear bumper, and then forward again to the front wheel well.  The fin-mounted tail lights pods (which were body-colored on lesser Cadillacs) were chromed.  The {{convert|390|cuin|L|abbr=on}} engine provided {{convert|325|hp}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Willson|first=Quentin|title=The Ultimate Classic Car Book|year=1995|publisher=DK Publishing, Inc.|isbn=0-7894-0159-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ultimateclassicc00quen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air suspension, utilizing freon-filled shock absorbers, was optional on Sixty Special.

However a front fender-mounted cloisonne "Sixty Special" emblem would appear the following year and last through 1962.

1960 saw new (shorter) rear fins, and a cleaner side-trim design, as well as a rear "grille" design shared with Eldorado. The Sixty Special was also distinguished by a new front fender-mounted cloisonne "Sixty Special" emblem. Wheelbase remained {{Convert|130|in|mm|abbr=on}}, and the $6,233 price was the same as the 1959. New for 1960 was a standard vinyl roof covering, and the small chrome "louvers" returned (first seen in 1942, last seen in 1956) mounted on the rear fenders, just ahead of the tail lights. Power steering and brakes were standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1960_Cadillac/1960_Cadillac_Brochure/1960%20Cadillac-16.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1960_Cadillac/1960_Cadillac_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1961, Cadillac's Sixty Special received all-new sheet metal, with a crisp, limousine-like formal roofline and a mildly shorter {{convert|129.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase. The small decorative louvers were back, this time just ahead of the tail lights. Sales were up to 15,500 units. With the cancellation of the four-door Eldorado Brougham at the end of 1960, the 1961 Sixty Special now became the sedan companion to the Eldorado convertible. Power steering was standard.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1961"/&gt;

1962's styling remained similar to 1961, and Sixty Special's fender louvers were moved up to the roof, directly behind the rear door opening. A revised grill up front, and a new trim panel below the rear deck lid rounded out the subtle changes. Sales slipped to 13,350 this year at a base price of $6,366. A power trunk lid was an option.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1962_Cadillac/1962_Cadillac_Brochure/1962%20Cadillac-11.html 1962 Cadillac Brochure, p. 11]&lt;/ref&gt; The heater was now standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1962_Cadillac/1962_Cadillac_Brochure/1962%20Cadillac-12.html 1962 Cadillac Brochure, p. 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

1963 had all-new styling (on the same {{convert|129.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase), with a new mechanically streamlined 390 cu. in. engine producing the same {{convert|325|hp|abbr=on}} of the previous generation of OHV Cadillac V8. Sixty Special shared its lack of body-side trim with Eldorado - appearing very clean and formal compared to standard Cadillac models.  While the small decorative louvers continued on the C-pillar, a new Cadillac "wreath and crest" ornament was on the rear fender. The front fender-mounted "Sixty Special" emblem (which appeared for 1960) was gone. The formerly standard vinyl top had now become a $125 option on Sixty-Special. Price was down to $6,300, and sales were up slightly 14,000.

Other than a slightly revamped grille and rear bumper, 1964 Sixty Special saw few exterior changes. The Cadillac wreath and crest ornament was moved to take the place of the C-pillar mounted louvers. The Sixty Special  (and companion Eldorado convertible) featured almost no side trim, except for a wide rocker-sill molding which ran from the rear-edge of the front fender wheel well to the rear of the car. Engine displacement was enlarged to {{Convert|429|cuin|L|abbr=on}}, and the venerable [[Hydra-Matic]] transmission, first introduced in the 1940 model year, was replaced with the new [[Turbo-Hydramatic#Super Turbine 400 / THM400 / 3L80 / 3L80HD|Turbo-Hydromatic]] [[automatic transmission]]. The cost was back up to the 1962 price of $6,366, and sales were up to 14,500 units.

1965 featured all-new styling on a longer {{convert|133|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase, on a stretched [[GM C platform (1936)|GM C-body platform]]. The Sixty Special was now back to being a pillared sedan (the B-pillar had been absent since 1957). Also new for 1965 was the available "Brougham" option package, adding $194 to Sixty Special's base price of $6,479, which included padded grained-vinyl roof covering with "Brougham" badging on the C-pillar.  18,100 Sixty Specials were built for 1965. With Eldorado having joined the Sixty Special in 1963 as the only other non-limousine Cadillac bodied by Fleetwood, the addition of the Brougham script made things a little more consistent in nomenclature, for the Eldorado was originally only available as a convertible, and its later four-door sedan companion was denoted "Brougham". Also, Cadillac got rid of the X-frame and replaced it with a full-perimeter frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1965_Cadillac/1965_Cadillac_Brochure_1/1965%20Cadillac-20.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1965_Cadillac/1965_Cadillac_Brochure_1 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standard equipment now included a warning lamp in the instrument cluster indicating an unlatched trunk lid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1965_Cadillac/1965_Cadillac_Owners_Manual/1965%20Cadillac%20Manual-10.html Directory Index: Cadillac/1965_Cadillac/1965_Cadillac_Owners_Manual&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Rear seat belts were also standard.&lt;ref name="krause publications"&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975|publisher=krause  publications|isbn=0-87341-027-0|editor=Gunnell, John A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With minor trim changes, in 1966 Cadillac offered buyers two models in this series: the standard Fleetwood Sixty Special (priced at $6,378) and the new Fleetwood Brougham ($6,695). The Brougham option package proved so popular the previous year it was made a separate model for 1966. The Fleetwood Brougham included a formal-looking vinyl roof covering, and luxurious appointments inside such as genuine walnut trim and, for rear seat passengers, lighted writing tables (through 1967), foot rests, and reading lamps.  This was the last year that the Sixty Special would serve as a body-sharing companion to the Eldorado convertible, as the 1967 Eldorado moved to front-wheel drive and all-new sheet metal. The new Sixty Special Brougham sold over 13,630 copies, surpassing the standard Sixty Special which sold only 5,445.

[[File:'68 Cadillac Fleetwood (Auto classique Pointe-Claire '11).JPG|thumb|left|1968 Cadillac 60 Special]]

Cadillacs had all-new styling in 1967, but the Sixty-Special continued with an exclusive {{Convert|133|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase. The $6,739 Sixty Special Brougham continued to outsell the $6,423 Sixty Special - 12,750 units versus 3,550. AM/FM radio was a $188 option.&lt;ref name="krause publications"/&gt;

1968 featured mostly carry-over styling from 1967, but the hood was longer this year, as it extended all the way to the base of the windshield to cover the "hidden" windshield wipers. Also new for 1968 was a stylish beveled deck lid. The $6,867 vinyl-roofed Sixty Special Brougham sold 15,300 models this year, while the standard Sixty Special with its painted metal roof (priced at $6,552) sold just 3,300 cars. Most Cadillac buyers clearly considered the $315 price difference worthwhile.

[[File:Cadillac fleetwood 1969.jpg|thumb|left|1969 Cadillac 60 Special Brougham]]

All-new styling appeared in 1969, and the two Sixty Special models had distinct rooflines from the other Cadillacs.  A 60/40 split bench seat was standard in the Sixty Special Brougham, optional in Sixty Special.  Safety was a new priority at Cadillac, which introduced a new steering column that not only was designed to absorb impact and collapse in a collision, but also had new Federally-mandated theft-deterrent features such as an ignition key switch activated steering wheel and transmission shifter lock mechanism.  As also mandated, head rests were standard on front seats, while seat belts were provided for all six passengers. The {{Convert|375|hp|abbr=on}} {{Convert|472|cuin|L|abbr=on}} engine carried over from 1968. Also of note this year was the disappearance of the small vent windows on the front and rear doors. Sixty Special Brougham, at $7,092, included a vinyl roof top (available in six colors), as well as rear-seat foot rests and an automatic level control for the rear wheels which kept the car level despite the weight of fuel, passengers, or cargo. Sixty Special Brougham's sales of 17,300 units easily surpassed the 2,545 copies of the standard $6,761 Sixty Special.

The 1970 Sixty Special received few changes, aside from the usual new grille and tail lamps. Sixty Special had long been recognized for its bold, bare side body, but this year the models received a 'chrome with vinyl insert' [[body-side molding]] &amp;ndash; the model's first prominent side molding since the 'rocket-ship' 1958.  Sales were 16,913 units of the Sixty Special Brougham at $7,284; and just 1,738 M Sixty-Specials at $6,953. This would be the last year for the standard, metal-roofed Sixty Special.

The new GM full-size bodies for 1971, at 64.3 inches front shoulder room (62.1 inches on Cadillac) and 63.4 inches rear shoulder room (64.0 inches on Cadillac) set a record for interior width that would not be matched by any car until the full-size GM rear-wheel-drive models of the early to mid-1990s. Following this remodel, the Sixty Special remained basically unchanged through 1976, save for periodic front and rear-end facelifts. The car shared the same styling cues with the lesser Calais and DeVille models. The most dramatic of these changes was the addition of rectangular headlamps in 1975 along with a completely new grille. This configuration was carried through until 1977's dramatic down-sizing, marking the temporary end of all full-size Cadillacs except for the Eldorado.

For 1971, the lineup was trimmed down to just one Sixty Special model, the Sixty Special Brougham. It still rode on an exclusive {{Convert|133.0|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase, but with all-new sheet metal and a distinctive roof design.  The formal new roof was clearly reminiscent of Bill Mitchell's original 1938 Sixty Special, with individually framed, rounded-corner side glass (outlined by a thin chrome bead). Also new on the vinyl top were C-pillar mounted opera lamps and a thick B-pillar, which, along with a narrow body filler panel between the front and rear side doors, heightened the car's custom limousine look. Despite the formal new look and higher levels of luxury, sales dropped slightly from 1970, down to 15,200 units. As before, while the coupe and sedan DeVille remained Cadillac's bread-and-butter cars, the Sixty Special was an exclusive low-volume item sold to its most affluent buyers and the fleet and livery business for conversion to formal limousines and airport cars.

Engine performance began to decrease with EPA restrictions on tailpipe emissions and grams per mile emissions requirements, forcing gear ratios to taller and taller ratios, dropping to as low as 2.73:1 for 1975-1976. A new common frame/suspension design was introduced in the latest generation Sixty Special which was also used in other GM full size cars. While the other GM divisions used a front-steer setup (steering linkage in front of the engine crossmember), all Cadillac RWDs retained the 1961-vintage front suspension (rear steering linkage, eccentric cams in the steering knuckle in lieu of shims, strut rods attached to the framerails for caster adjustment). Rear suspensions were now driven by the Pontiac-designed {{frac|8|7|8}}-inch ring-gear 10-bolt Salisbury live axle. A new trailer towing package was added allowing larger trailer loads to be pulled. Coupled with heavy duty cooling, 3.23 gearing, high output 80 amp large frame alternator and heavy-duty THM400 transmission, the long wheelbase was ideal to pull trailers weighing up to 7,000&amp;nbsp;lb (3,200&amp;nbsp;kg).

1972 marked Cadillac's 70th anniversary. One of the few changes that year was the addition of a chrome molding around the rear window. Sales were a robust 20,750 units at a base price of $7,585. The 1972 Sixty Special Brougham weighed in at an impressive 4,858 pounds shipping weight (over 5,000 pounds curb weight). Standard equipment included rear-seat reading lamps, automatic level control, and dual-comfort front seats.  A wide range of upholstery was available in nine colors of "Sierra" grain leather, four colors of "Matador" cloth, a combination of "Matador" cloth and leather, a "Minuet" fabric in three colors, or a plush "Medici" crushed velour.

The 1974 model year saw the introduction of the "Air Cushion Restraint System",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1975_Cadillac/1975_Cadillac_Brochure/1975%20Cadillac-25.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1975_Cadillac/1975_Cadillac_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which activated [[airbag]]s hidden in the steering wheel and passenger side of the instrument panel when the car was hit from the front only. The option replaced the glove box with a lockable compartment under the dashboard. The system was very unpopular and was dropped as an option after 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1974_Cadillac/1974_Cadillac_Brochure_1/1974%20Cadillac-23.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1974_Cadillac/1974_Cadillac_Brochure_1 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 1975 model year, the 472ci v8 was replaced by the 500ci v8 previously only available on the Eldorado. As a mid-year change, a Bendix electronic fuel injection was available for the first time, it was the same system used on the Seville introduced at the same time. A new fascia with the now legal square headlights was introduced. Air conditioning was made standard equipment (even if it was usually ordered in the vast majority of Cadillacs by then).

For 1976 automatic door locks (which locked the car when the transmission was shifted out of park and unlocked them as it was shifted into park) and a reclinable passenger seat were offered as optional equipment. The Sixty Special Series was temporarily retired in 1976 but returned again in a new front-wheel drive model for 1987.&lt;ref name="gunnel2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flammang|first=James|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1976–1999|year=1999|publisher=Krause publications|isbn=0-87341-755-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fleetwood Brougham d'Elegance===

[[File:76fwb.JPG|thumb|left|1976 Cadillac 60 Special Brougham d'Elegance]]
An option package available for the first time in 1973 was the "d'Elegance" package. Adding US$750, this package included a unique "pillow-style" velour seating trim as well as a more plush carpeting and a few additional features optional on the standard models. The same package was offered on the Coupe/Sedan DeVille models in 1974 with a different seating design. The package would become available on various DeVille, Fleetwood Brougham, Brougham, and Fleetwood models in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s with standard features adjusted to suit the decades.
{{clear}}

===Fleetwood Talisman===
Even more exclusive than the "d'Elegance" was the "Talisman" package, available for the 60 Special for the 1974, 1975, and 1976 model years. A ''talisman'' is "anything whose presence exercises a remarkable or powerful influence on human feelings or actions". The package was so exclusive that it superseded  both the "Brougham" and "d'elegance" luxury designations. For 1974 the interior featured a center console spanning the entire interior,  with the front section housing a writing tablet and the rear a storage space. This seating arrangement turned the spacious Fleetwood Brougham into a four-seat automobile, which possibly led to the discontinuation of the rear seat console in the 1975/76 editions. Seating was initially available in four colors of either leather ($2450) or "Medici" crushed velour ($1800), with the leather dropped after 1974. Matching deep-pile interior carpeting and floormats completed the look. The exterior featured a standard fully padded elk grain vinyl roof, exterior badge identifications, and a stand-up, full-color wreath and crest hood ornament.

The Sixty Special returned in 1987 as the top owner-driven Cadillac in the [[front-wheel-drive]] GM [[GM C platform (FWD)|C-body]] lineup, with a planned production run of just 2,000 cars. The 1987 and 1988 Sixty Specials were unique,  custom-crafted automobiles, which featured a five-inch (127&amp;nbsp;mm) longer wheelbase over the DeVille/Fleetwood on which they were based.  Similarly equipped to the standard-size Fleetwood d'Elegance - the model on which it was based - the Sixty Special also included an anti-lock braking system (a $925 Fleetwood option) and a [[stainless-steel]] exhaust system not available on other Cadillacs. In 1987, the Sixty Special carried a base price of $34,850 - more than $8,700 over the price of the Fleetwood d'Elegance. The price dropped by $100 for 1988. With their special, longer wheelbase, these cars were akin to "mini-limousines" that could be either  owner- or chauffeur-driven. In addition to 5 inches of extra rear seat leg room, they included exclusive amenities such as dual rear-seat headrests, three-position footrests (mounted onto the backs of the 55/45 split front seat) and two illuminated vanity mirrors located in an overhead console. A padded vinyl roof, which hid the seams  where the additional section was added, carried over onto the elongated rear doors. Door sill plates and wide, ribbed lower body side moldings were positioned to hide the cobbled body work along the rocker panel.

For 1989, the Sixty Special lost its exclusive longer wheelbase, and it now shared the same {{Convert|113.8|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase with the DeVille and Fleetwood. The Sixty Special now had a lower base price of $34,230. When the Fleetwood nameplate was restored to the large [[rear-wheel-drive]] [[Cadillac Brougham]] in 1993, the front-drive model that had been named Fleetwood (which was really just a variant of the front-wheel-drive [[Cadillac DeVille|DeVille]]) since 1985, was renamed, simply, "Sixty Special". This was the first and only time in 53 years that the "Fleetwood" name was not used with the "Sixty Special" designation.

While the 1987 and 1988 Sixty Special had their unique longer wheelbase, the 1989 through 1993 models were differentiated from the DeVille by the special interior trim package that included 22-way power driver and passenger seats. Italian designer [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] created the glove-soft leather seating which included built-in heating elements and multiple lumbar adjustments, a center clamshell armrest in front and a rear armrest with dual slide-out cup holders, and an electrically powered slide-out storage bin between the front seats that also housed two cup holders. This seating package was standard from 1989 through 1992, and became optionally available in 1993.

For 1989, Cadillac produced 2,007 Sixty Special sedans.  Exterior color choices nearly doubled from the previous year, now with eleven colors offered, instead of the previous six. Interiors featured standard leather upholstery, available in three colors (Dark Blue, Deep Red, and Medium Gray). The 'clam-shell' front seat center armrest opened from the rear, allowing better access to back seat passengers, while the rear seat center armrest held a slide out console with two cup holders and a storage cubby.

The 1990 Sixty Special had a base price of $36,980, and 1,817 were manufactured.  A driver's-side airbag was now standard (optional last year), and the telescoping steering column was discontinued, although the tilt feature remained. Exteriors were available in eleven colors (including three shades of gray that were new for 1990 - Slate Gray, Medium Slate Gray, and Dark Slate Gray).  Interiors were available in just three 'Ultrasoft' leather colors: Garnet Red, Very Dark Sapphire (Blue), and a new shade - Medium Slate Gray.

For 1991, the electrically powered slide out storage drawer was replaced with a storage armrest containing a flip-out cup holder, removable coin holder, and compact disc storage. Adjustable air ducts for rear-seat passengers were added to the back of the revised front seat arm rest base. Cadillac manufactured 879 Sixty Specials for 1991, with a base price of $38,325.

For the 1992 model year, only 554 Sixty Special sedans (base price $39,860) were produced.

In 1993, the Fleetwood nameplate was restored to the new, restyled rear-wheel-drive replacement for the Cadillac Brougham, where it had last been used in 1986. The  front-drive Sixty Special dropped the Fleetwood designation for 1993, and was   available only as a four-door sedan.  This was a step-down in furnishings and standard equipment for the Sixty Special, as the car was similarly equipped to the 1992 Fleetwood sedan it had replaced. Velour upholstery was now standard, with leather optional.  While the Sixty Special retained genuine American walnut trim on the doors and dashboard, the custom seating that made the Sixty-Special unique since 1989 was now optional, available as part of a $3,550 "Ultra" package. Only 686 of the 5,286 Sixty Specials (priced at $37,230) built in 1993 were ordered with the "Ultra" interior. A 1993 Sixty Special Coupe was planned, and is referred to in the "Advance Preview Book" (a supplement that Cadillac dealer's received in July 1992 offering information about the upcoming 1993 model year). However, by September 12 of that year, the coupe was dropped from production after just one car was built (in Royal Maroon Metallic). Sixty Special sedan production (by color) is as follows:  3 Mary Kay Pink / 59 Dark Plum / 110 Light Sapphire Blue / 206 Slate-Bronze / 220 Academy Gray / 228 Carmine Red / 250 Platinum / 310 Sapphire Firemist Blue / 326 Taupe / 445 Royal Maroon / 477 Light Beige / 518 Slate Green / 578 Black / 707 Navy Blue / 849 White. While it was based upon the Sedan DeVille, the Sixty Special sedan included eleven items as standard equipment that were optional on the DeVille. In addition, there were several options for the Sixty Special not available on the DeVille, such as a driver's side 2-position memory seat and individual power recliners for the front seats. On the exterior, the most noticeable difference were the rear wheel fender skirts, giving the Sixty Special a much heavier, more formal appearance than the DeVille. The last Cadillac Sixty Special rolled off the assembly line on June 18, 1993.

The '''Cadillac Calais''' was the entry-level [[Cadillac]] model that was sold from 1965 to 1976. Cadillac renamed its low-priced [[Cadillac Series 62|Series 62]] in 1965 as the "Calais", after the French city of [[Calais]] that overlooks the narrowest point in the [[English Channel]]. In [[Greek mythology]], [[Boreads|Calais]] was one of two winged sons of [[Boreas (god)|Boreas]], god of the North Wind, and [[Oreithyea]]. With the exception of no convertible model, the Calais shared the same styling as the better-equipped, more expensive [[Cadillac de Ville series|De Ville]].

In 1965, Calais tailfins were canted slightly downward, and sharp, distinct body lines were featured. The rear bumper was straight and the rear lamp clusters were vertical. The headlight pairs were vertical, permitting a wide grille. Side windows were curved and frameless. Perimeter frame construction allowed positioning of the engine forward in the frame, thus lowering the transmission hump and increasing interior room. The Calais was available as a 2- or 4-door [[hardtop]] as well as a "formal-roof" 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]], which was a hybrid with frameless, hardtop-like windows, but with a pillar between them.

The primary differences between the Calais and the De Ville were trim levels and standard equipment. While the De Ville was delivered with such amenities as [[power windows]] and 2-way [[power seat]]s as standard equipment, hand-cranked windows and manual seat adjusters were standard on the Calais, with power windows a US$119 option in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960-1972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), p.348.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, however, AM radio was a US$165 extra, as was [[air conditioning]] (More than 90% of Cadillac buyers ordered air conditioning), at US$495, on either.&lt;ref name="Flory, p.348"&gt;Flory, p.348.&lt;/ref&gt; Standard equipment included power brakes; power steering; automatic transmission; cornering lights; dual back-up lights; windshield washers and dual speed wipers; full wheel covers; remote controlled outside rear view mirror; visor vanity mirror; oil filter; five tubeless blackwall tires; heater; defroster; lamps for  glove and rear passenger compartments  and front and rear seat belts.&lt;ref name="Oldcarbrochures.com"/&gt;

Unlike the De Ville, the Calais did not offer leather seating areas and vinyl roof trim was not offered initially. A high-grade cloth and vinyl, similar to what was seen on top-line [[Buick Electra]]s and [[Oldsmobile 98]]s, was standard. Another item not initially available on the Calais was the Cadillac-exclusive "firemist" paint, an extra-cost high gloss metallic paint. Both the high-end [[Buick]] and [[Oldsmobile]] models shared the [[GM C platform (RWD)|GM C platform]] with Cadillac. Cadillac, always [[General Motors]]' technology leader, offered most De Ville options on the Calais, such as [[Twilight Sentinel]] and the [[automatic headlight dimmer|GuideMatic headlight dimmer]]. In 1965, the new Turbo-Hydramatic, standard on the 1964 De Ville, but not the lower-priced Series 62, became standard throughout the Cadillac line, including the Calais. The {{convert|340|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|429|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]] also remained the standard engine.&lt;ref name="Flory, p.348"/&gt;

Pricing of the Cadillac Calais started at nearly US$5,000, almost US$1,000 (or about 25%) more than the [[Buick Electra|Electra 225]] and [[Oldsmobile 98]],&lt;ref&gt;Flory, pp.346, 389, 422, 425, &amp; 467.&lt;/ref&gt; and about US$500 more than the top-line [[Buick Riviera]].&lt;ref&gt;Flory, pp.348, 349, 423, 425, 497, &amp; 500.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, changes included a somewhat coarser mesh for the radiator grille insert, which was now divided by a thick, bright metal horizontal center bar housing rectangular parking lamps at the outer ends. Separate rectangular side marker lamps replaced the integral grille extension designs. There was generally less chrome on all Cadillac models this year. Cadillac "firsts" this season included variable ratio steering and optional front seats with carbon cloth heating pads built into the cushions and seatbacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1967_Cadillac/1967_Cadillac_Brochure/1967%20Cadillac-21.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1967_Cadillac/1967_Cadillac_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comfort and convenience innovations were headrests, reclining seats and an AM/FM stereo system. Automatic level control was available. Engineering improvements made to the perimeter frame increased ride and handling ease. Newly designed piston and oil rings and a new engine mounting system and patented quiet exhaust were used. Head rests became an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975|publisher=krause publications|isbn=0-87341-027-0|editor=Gunnell, John A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1967 Cadillac Calais coupe rvr.jpg|thumb|left|1967 Cadillac Calais 2-door hardtop]]
The Calais was extensively restyled for 1967. Prominent styling features were given a powerful frontal appearance with "forward-leaning" front end, long sculptured body lines, and redefined rear fenders that had more than just a hint of tail fins in them. The full-width forward-thrust "eggcrate" grille was flanked by dual stacked headlights for the third consecutive year. The squarer cornered grille insert had blades that seemed to emphasize its vertical members and it appeared both above the bumper and through a horizontal slot cut into it. Rectangular parking lamps were built into the outer edges of the grille. Rear end styling revisions were highlighted by metal divided taillamps and a painted lower bumper section. For 1967, power windows became standard on the Calais line, although [[power seat]]s were still optional even in the 1970s models. Coupes got a new roofline, inspired by the Florentine show car created for the 1964 [[New York City|New York]] World's Fair, that gave rear seat passengers added privacy. As on that show car, the quarter window glass retracted rearward into a sail panel. New standard Calais features included non-glare [[rear-view mirror]], electric clock, Automatic Climate Controls, padded dashboard, Hazard Warning system, outboard seatbelt retractors and rear cigarette lighters in all styles. A slide-out fuse box and safety front seat back lock for two-door models were additional Cadillac advances for the 1967 model year. Technical improvements included a revised engine valve train, different carburetor, Mylar printed circuit instrument panel, re-tuned body mounts, and a new engine fan with clutch for quieter operation. An energy absorbing steering column became optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1967_Cadillac/1967_Cadillac_Brochure/1967%20Cadillac-22.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1967_Cadillac/1967_Cadillac_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1967 was the last model year for pillared sedans.

In 1968 grilles had an insert with finer mesh and step down outer section which held the rectangular parking lights just a little higher than before. Rear end styling was modestly altered with the deck lid having more of a rake. The hood was re-designed to accommodate recessed windshield wiper-washers, which now came with three speeds standard. Of 20 exterior paint color combinations, 14 were totally new. On the inside, enriched appointments included molded inner door panels with illuminated reflectors and a selection of 147 upholstery combinations, 76 in cloth, 67 in leather and four in vinyl. New standard features included a Light Group, a Mirror Group, a trip odometer and an ignition key warning buzzer. Like all other Cadillacs, the Calais received the {{convert|472|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]] in 1968. 1968 was also the last year for the "stacked" dual headlights, which were replaced with side-by-side dual headlights in 1969. This was also the last year for vent windows.

In 1969, the Calais was restyled. A new front fender treatment similar to the Eldorado  helped to emphasize a stronger horizontal design line. Rear quarters were extended to give the car a longer look. For the first time since 1964, there were dual horizontal headlamps which were positioned in the outboard step down areas of the all-new grille. The roofline was squarer and the rear deck and bumper more sculptured. A new ventilation system eliminated the need for vent windows, which provided a longer sleeker look and improved visibility. New standard features included front center seat armrests.
Front seat headrests were mandatory this year and the ignition switch was moved from the instrument panel to the steering column, which locked both the steering wheel and transmission selector lever when the key was removed. 

In 1970, a facelift included  a grille with 13 vertical blades set against a delicately cross-hatched rectangular opening. The bright metal headlamp surrounds were bordered with body color to give a more refined look. Narrow vertical taillamps were seen again and had smaller bottom lenses pointing downward in the bumper. Standard wheel covers and winged crest fender tip emblems were new. Exterior distinctions came from a Calais signature script above the rear end of the horizontal belt molding just ahead of the taillight dividers and from the use of small square back-up light lenses set into the lower bumper as opposed to the long rectangular lenses used on the De Ville. The traditional 'V' emblem beneath the Cadillac crest on the hood and decklid was removed from both the Calais and De Ville this year, not to return until 1972.

The Cadillac Calais was completely restyled, inside and out, for 1971. The new 1971 GM full-size bodies, at 64.3" front shoulder room (62.1" on Cadillac) and 63.4" rear shoulder room (64.0" on Cadillac) set a record for interior width that would not be matched by any car until the full-size GM rear-wheel drive models of the early to mid-1990s. Pairs of individually housed round [[headlamp]]s were wider apart, with a winged Cadillac crest set between each pair. The V-shaped grille had an eggcrate style insert and was protected by massive vertical guards framing a rectangular license plate indentation. A wide hood with full-length windsplints, a prominent center crease and hidden windshield wipers was seen. A larger Cadillac crest decorated the hood face and new lamp indicators appeared atop each front fender. A horizontal beltline molding ran from behind the front wheel housing, almost to the rear stopping where an elliptical bulge in the body came to a point and where thin rectangular side markers were placed above and below the chrome strip. The rear wheel openings were again covered by fender skirts. Taillamps were new and no longer divided by a chrome bar. Long horizontal back-up lamps were set in the bumper, on either side of a deeply recessed license plate housing. The Calais wheelbase was extended to {{convert|130|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Inside, interiors were redesigned featuring a  new curved instrument panel with brushed aluminum trim and revised seating areas, available in either standard cloth or optional vinyl upholstery.

In 1972, a modest frontal revision placed more emphasis on horizontal grille blades. The parking lamps were moved from the bumper to between the square bezeled headlamps, which were now set wider apart. V-shaped emblems made a return on hood and deck lid. New standard features included a bumper impact system, automatic parking brake release, passenger assist straps and flow through ventilation system. Externally the Calais was identified by front fender model script; thin horizontal belt moldings and a script on the right side of the trunk lid.

New energy absorbing bumpers were seen on all GM cars in 1973. Styling refinements to the Calais included a wider grille with an intricate eggcrate design. Larger vertical rectangles housed the parking lamps between wide spaced headlamps which had square bezels but round lenses. Bumpers ran fully across the front and wrapped around each end. Vertical guards were spaced much further apart at a point outboard of the grille. The rear end had a bumper with a flatter upper section housing an angled license plate recess. Border outline moldings vertically "veed" paralleled the fender edge shape at the rear bodysides. Single horizontally mounted rectangular rear side marker lamps were placed over and under the rear tip of the thin beltline trim. Cadillac script was seen on the front fender sides below the belt molding behind the wheel opening. Interiors were new this year, with revised seat patterns featuring standard cloth or optional vinyl upholstery. Also new were "soft-pillow" door panels with larger, sturdier pull-straps.

In 1974, a wider eggcrate grille was used. Dual round headlamps were mounted close together in square bezels. Further outboard were double deck wraparound parking lamps. Shorter vertical grille guards appeared in about the same position as before. Rear fendersides were flatter without the elliptical bulge. The thin beltline molding was positioned lower by several inches. The rear end had vertical chrome bumper ends with integrated side-marker lights. New taillamps were positioned horizontally beneath the trunk lid. Both bumpers, especially the rear, protruded further from the body.  Coupes were no longer hardtops, instead sporting large wide "coach" windows giving a thick center pillar look. A new "space-aged" curved instrument panel housed a new standard quartz controlled digital clock. Other standard features included an integral litter receptacle and bias belted blackwall tires.

1974 also saw the introduction of the optional "[[Air Cushion Restraint System]]". Known today as airbags, this option provided protection for front seat occupants in the case of a frontal collision. One bag was located in the steering wheel hub, while the other sat in place of the glove compartment on the lower passenger side of the dashboard. The glove box was replaced with a rectangular storage compartment, complete with a lockable wood-tone hinged front panel, centrally located under the dashboard. Additionally, there was a driver's side knee bolster panel with an ashtray to the right of the steering column and a small hinged-door storage compartment on the left side.
Although the "ACRS" system (also available on senior Buicks and Oldsmobiles) saved lives, the option was quite expensive and therefore unpopular with customers. It was discontinued after 1976, and unfortunately Cadillac would not offer airbags again until the 1990 model year. 

Styling changes for 1975 brought dual rectangular headlamps flanked by rectangular cornering lights wrapped around squared-off front fenders. A new cross hatched grille also appeared with Cadillac script on the header. Sedans now featured slim fixed triangular quarter windows. New standard equipment included front fender lamp monitors, power door locks, high energy ignition and steel-belted radial tires. The big {{convert|500|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} engine used exclusively in the Eldorado since 1970, was now standard in all Cadillacs except the [[Cadillac Seville|Seville]]. Seating areas were revised, with new interior trims and cloth upholstery  available in more colors.

In 1976, the grille saw a new finer crosshatching pattern. Cornering lamps received new horizontal silver trim, while taillamps bezels also gained chrome-like trim. Eight different color accent stripes were available. Optional padded vinyl roof coverings were now stamped with an Elk grain pattern. New interior trim included sporty plaids, plush velours and knits. Coupe models equipped with the available cabriolet vinyl top, covering the rear-half of the roof, were trimmed with a lower molding that served as a continuation of the door "belt" molding. A Controlled (limited-slip) Differential was included for extra traction. An optional illuminated entry and theft deterrent system was available. A new [[ACDelco|Delco Freedom]] battery never needed water. Simulated wire wheel covers were newly available. Other new options included a push-button Weather Band built into the AM/FM stereo signal-seeking radio, plus power passenger and manual driver seatback recliners for 50/50 front seats. Of the 15 standard and six optional Firemist body colors, 13 were new this year. New standard features included Soft-Ray tinted glass, spare tire cover, trunk mat,  washer fluid level indicator, and steel belted radial whitewall tires. 1976 was the 11th and final year for the Cadillac Calais. Sales of the Calais had  never been strong and had been declining steadily for years. The cost of the entry-level Calais and the base De Ville had become much narrower and Cadillac customers saw little reason to purchase a Calais, when a better equipped De Ville cost only slightly more. For 1977, Cadillac would be extensively restyled and downsized; prices would also increase significantly, leaving the slow-selling, lowly Calais unnecessary in the Cadillac lineup.

The '''Cadillac XLR''' is a front-engine, rear-drive, two passenger  [[roadster (automobile)|roadster]] manufactured and marketed by [[Cadillac]] from 2003–2009 across a single generation &amp;mdash; and noted for its power [[retractable hardtop]], [[Bulgari]] designed interior instruments, [[Automotive head-up display|head-up display]], [[active suspension|adaptive suspension]] marketed as ''Magnetic Ride Control'', rear-mounted transmission and near 50/50 front-to-rear weight distribution.  As Cadillac's [[Flagship car#Automotive|flagship]] model, the XLR was introduced at the 2003 [[Detroit Motor Show]] and began production with [[model year]] 2004 &amp;mdash; foreshadowed by the 1999 [[Cadillac Evoq|Evoq]] concept.

Sharing the [[GM Y platform]] and manufactured alongside the [[Chevrolet Corvette]] in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]], the two cars also share [[hydroforming|hydroformed]] perimeter frame and composite bodywork construction &amp;mdash; though each have unique exterior and interior styling, suspension settings and engine.  The XLR and was the first production Cadillac with [[radar]]-based [[adaptive cruise control]] (ACC)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/delphis-adaptive-cruise-control-technology-featured-on-cadillac-xlr-71376412.html Delphi's Adaptive Cruise Control Technology Featured On Cadillac XLR&lt;/ref&gt; and the first to offer both heated and cooled seats.

The XLR was nominated for the ''[[North American Car of the Year]]'' award for 2004.

==Design==
The [[Cadillac]] XLR was marketed as a luxury roadster and offered numerous features either as standard equipment or as options, including a touchscreen GPS navigation radio with an AM/FM radio, CD changer, [[XM Satellite Radio]], full voice control, and a full [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] premium amplified audio system, adaptive cruise control, [[Bulgari]]-branded instrument panel cluster,&lt;ref name=Bulgari&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com:80/2002/10/18/travel/driving-bells-whistles-bulgari-touch-in-cadillacs.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225081903/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/18/travel/driving-bells-whistles-bulgari-touch-in-cadillacs.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 25, 2010|date=October 18, 2002|work=The New York Times|access-date=December 25, 2010|title=DRIVING: BELLS &amp; WHISTLES; Bulgari Touch In Cadillacs|first=Michelle|last=Krebs|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[OnStar]], High Intensity Discharge (HID) front headlamps, perforated luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces with power-adjustable, heated and cooled bucket seats with a driver's memory system, luxury carpeted floor mats with embroidered 'XLR' logos, premium aluminum-alloy wheels, and wood interior trim.

The XLR's featured adaptive suspension with [[magnetorheological damper|magneto-rheological shock absorber fluid]] for enhanced ride control.  The system uses four wheel-to-body displacement sensors to measure wheel motion over the road surface and responds by adjusting the shock damping almost instantly. The shock absorbers are filled with a fluid that contains suspended iron particles that respond to magnetic signals. The system responds by constantly monitoring motion and changing the damping forces at all four corners of the vehicle &amp;mdash; to modulate body motion during aggressive maneuvers or on uneven road surfaces.

Where [[Chevrolet Corvette (C6)]] was powered by a 6.0L LS2 V8 engine and offered a six-speed manual transmission, the XLR featured [[Cadillac]]'s 4.6L [[Northstar V8]] (supercharged in the XLR-V) and either a five-speed 5L50 automatic transmission, or a six-speed 6L80 automatic transmission. Optional XLR equipment included polished aluminum-alloy wheels, exterior and interior color options, and different interior trim options.

The XLR featured a silver-painted upper "Egg Crate" (XLR) or chrome wire mesh (XLR-V) front grille, angular front High Intensity Discharge (HID) front head lamps, vertical rear tail lamps, and chrome exterior details. Inside, the XLR featured wood interior trim in addition to the C6 [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]]'s aluminum trim, and different seats.

For model year 2009, the XLR added a new front fascia, new rear fascia, and chrome side fender vents.  Inside, [[Alcantara (material)|Alcantara]] - a suede-like [[microfiber]] material - was added for the headliner.  The interior added new instrument cluster trim rings with revised graphics, (removal of the Bulgari logo) and new wood dashboard trims. XLR production ended on March 31, 2009.

MSRP - $86,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Riswick |first=James |url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=140607 |title=Edmunds InsideLine: Cadillac Killing XLR |publisher=Edmunds.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203081053/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId%3D140607 |archivedate=2009-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cadillac XLR-V''', was a high-performance (443 HP) version of the XLR. Cadillac gave the public its first glimpse of the supercharged XLR-V in its [[Super Bowl]] commercial, which aired February 6, 2005. Super Bowl [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]] [[Deion Branch]] was also awarded an XLR. The car was formally introduced at the 2005 [[New York International Auto Show]]. Contrary to popular belief, it was not intended to compete with the BMW M6 or the Mercedes-Benz AMG SL-Class.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a18202477/2006-cadillac-xlr-v-instrumented-test/&lt;/ref&gt;

The XLR-V used the same [[supercharged]] ''[[Cadillac Northstar engine|Northstar]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] as the [[Cadillac STS-V|STS-V]], though output was down somewhat. For the XLR-V, the engine was certified by the SAE to produce 443&amp;nbsp;hp (330&amp;nbsp;[[kilowatt|kW]]) and 414&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (561&amp;nbsp;N·m). The supercharger and four [[intercooler]] cores were built into the intake manifold. A six-speed [[automatic transmission]], larger brakes from the Z51 Corvette, and 19-inch wheels were used.

The XLR-V could accelerate to 60&amp;nbsp;mph (96&amp;nbsp;km/h) in 4.6 [[second]]s according to ''[[Car and Driver]]'''s tests. The magazine also timed it at 11.3 seconds to 100&amp;nbsp;mph (161&amp;nbsp;km/h) and recorded a 13.0 second quarter mile at 110&amp;nbsp;mph (177&amp;nbsp;km/h). Its top speed was electronically limited to 155&amp;nbsp;mph (249&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Road Test: Cadillac XLR-V|author=Barry Winfield|journal=[[Car and Driver]]|issue=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The XLR-V went on sale in the [[United States]] in early 2006 with a base price of $110,000. Pricing for the 2008 model started at $111,300; making it at the time one of [[General Motors]]' most expensive vehicles.

The XLR had sales projections of 5,000 to 7,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cadillac Revival at Crossroad |date=June 1, 2003 |author=Ed Garsten |publisher=The Detroit News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cadillac Seville''' is a luxury car manufactured by [[Cadillac]] between 1975 and 2004, as a smaller-sized, premium Cadillac.  Despite its smaller size, the Seville typically carried the highest price tag among Cadillac's sedan models.  It was replaced by the [[Cadillac STS]] in 2004.

==Origin of the name==
[[File:59svl.JPG|thumb|left|1959 [[Cadillac Eldorado]] Seville]]
The name of "Cadillac's first small car" was selected over a revival of [[LaSalle (automobile)|LaSalle]] and the GM design staff's preference, [[La Scala|LaScala]], primarily because, notes GM Marketing Director Gordon Horsburgh, "It had no negatives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Witzenburg|first=Gary|title=The Name Game|journal=Motor Trend|date=April 1984|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial suggestion was in fact the name "Leland", honoring the make's founder, but it was rejected because most buyers wouldn't understand the reference and because [[Henry Leland]] had also founded Cadillac's rival, [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln]].

Hundreds of suggestions were considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autosofinterest.com/2012/05/22/design-notes-1975-cadillac-seville/4/ |title=Design Notes: 1975 Cadillac Seville » Page: 4 |publisher=Autos of Interest |date=2012-05-22 |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;After painstaking research, LaSalle was the top pick, with St. Moritz a distant second, trailed farther behind by Seville. A troubled past and difficult pronunciation, respectively, cleared the way for Seville's use.

[[Seville]] is a [[province of Seville|Spanish province]] and the capital city of that province, renowned for its history and its treasures of art and architecture. The Spanish master painters [[Diego Velázquez]] and [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo]] were from Seville. The Seville name first entered use by Cadillac as the designation for the two-door [[hardtop]] version of the 1956 [[Cadillac Eldorado]]. 1960 was the last model year for the Eldorado Seville (it returned in 1967 but with a different name).

[[File:Cadillac Seville 1977 rear.jpg|thumb|Rear view of 1977 Cadillac Seville]]
The Seville, introduced in May 1975 as an early 1976 model, was Cadillac's answer to the rising popularity of such European [[luxury car|luxury imports]] as [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[BMW]]. GM planners were becoming concerned that the division's once-vaunted image as "The standard of the world" was fading as the 1970s unfolded, especially among the younger generation of car buyers. Seeking to counter Cadillac's heavy slant towards the over-50 age group, the Seville was a bold attempt to both rejuvenate the make's image and win over young import buyers.

Over time European luxury cars had become quite luxurious and even more expensive than the much larger Cadillacs. As the market share of these imports continued to climb, it became obvious that the traditional American automotive paradigm of "bigger equals better" had begun to falter. The Seville became the smallest and most expensive model in the lineup, turning Cadillac's traditional marketing and pricing strategy upside down. 
Full size design prototypes were created as early as winter of 1972–73 (wearing the tentative name [[LaSalle (automobile)|LaSalle]], reviving the Cadillac junior brand from 1927–1940).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autosofinterest.com/2012/05/22/design-notes-1975-cadillac-seville/5/ |title=Design Notes: 1975 Cadillac Seville » Page: 5 |publisher=Autos of Interest |date=2012-05-22 |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent design prototypes looked edgier (specifically a 1973 named LaScala which forwardly hinted at the 1992 Seville).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://autosofinterest.com/2012/05/22/design-notes-1975-cadillac-seville/6/ |title=Design Notes: 1975 Cadillac Seville » Page: 6 |publisher=Autos of Interest |date=2012-05-22 |accessdate=2017-07-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904070214/http://autosofinterest.com/2012/05/22/design-notes-1975-cadillac-seville/6/ |archive-date=2017-09-04 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Styling took strong cues from the [[Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow]]{{source?|date=September 2018}}.  [[Unibody]] construction included a bolt-on subframe, with a rear suspension based on the [[rear-wheel drive]] 1968–74 [[GM X platform (RWD)|X-body]] [[automobile platform|platform]] that underpinned the [[Chevrolet Nova]], including rear differential, with a thicker bushinged front subframe similar to the second generation F platform shared by the Camaro and Firebird and the 1975–79 GM X platform.  Substantial re-engineering and upgrades from these humble origins earned it the unique designation [[GM K platform (RWD)|"K-body"]] (rather than "X-special" following the format of the A-special Chevrolet Monte Carlo/Pontiac Grand Prix and B-special Buick Riviera).

Also shared with the corporate X platform was part of the roof stamping and trunk floor pan (for 1973 and newer X platform vehicles). Cadillac stylists added a crisp, angular body that set the tone for GM styling for the next decade, along with a wide-track stance giving car a substantial, premium appearance. A wide chrome grille flanked by quadruple rectangular headlamps with narrow parking and signal lamps just below filled the header panel, while small wrap-around rectangular tail lamps placed at the outermost corners of the rear gave the appearance of a lower, leaner, and wider car. The wrap-around taillights might have come from a design sketch of a rejected [[Coupe DeVille]] concept.&lt;ref&gt;March 2008 issue of ''Collectible Automobile'' detailing the 1977 GM full-size cars.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seville engineers chose the X-body platform instead of the German [[Opel Diplomat]] in response to GM's budget restrictions—GM executives felt re-engineering an Opel would be more costly than the corporate X-car. Another proposal during the development of the Seville was a front-wheel drive layout similar to the [[Cadillac Eldorado]]. This proposal also met with budget concerns since the [[transaxle]] used for the Eldorado was produced on a limited basis solely for [[GM E platform|E-body]] ([[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]]/[[Oldsmobile Toronado|Toronado]]) production, alongside the [[GMC motorhome]] of the mid-1970s (which has a derivative of the E-platform drivetrain).

Introduced in mid-1975 and billed as the new "internationally-sized" Cadillac, the Seville was almost {{convert|1000|lb|kg}} lighter than the full-sized Deville. The Seville was thus more nimble and easier to park, as well as remaining attractive to customers with the full complement of Cadillac features. More expensive than every other Cadillac model (except the Series 75 Fleetwood factory limousines) at [[United States dollar|US$]]12,479, the Seville was modestly successful in the marketplace. It spawned several imitators including models like the [[Lincoln Versailles]], and later the [[Chrysler LeBaron]] ([[Chrysler Fifth Avenue|Fifth Avenue after 1982]]). To ensure the quality of the initial production run of Sevilles, the first 2,000 units produced were identical in color (Georgian silver) and equipment. This enabled workers to "ramp up" to building different configurations. Total 1976 Seville production was 43,772 vehicles.

Early Sevilles produced between April 1975 (a total of 16,355) to the close of the 1976 model year were the first Cadillacs to use the smaller GM wheel bolt pattern (5 lugs with a {{convert|4.75|in|mm|abbr=on}} bolt circle; the 2003–2009 [[Cadillac XLR|XLR]] also uses this pattern). The first Sevilles shared only a strict minority of components with the engineering starting point, the GM X-Body. The rear drums measured {{convert|11|in|mm|abbr=on}} and were similar to the ones used with the Nova ''9C1'' (police option) and [[GM A platform|A-body]] ([[Chevrolet Chevelle|Chevelle]], [[Oldsmobile Cutlass|Cutlass]], [[Buick Regal|Regal]], [[Pontiac LeMans|LeMans]]) intermediate [[station wagon]]s. Starting with the 1977 model year, production Sevilles used the larger 5 lug — 5&amp;nbsp;inch bolt circle common to full-size Chevrolet passenger cars (1971–76), Cadillacs, Buicks, Oldsmobiles, Pontiacs, and 1/2 ton Chevrolet/GMC light trucks and vans. It also received rear disc brakes, a design which would surface a year later as an option on the F-body [[Pontiac Trans Am]]. 1975–76 models had a mandatory vinyl top due to the fact that the roof section was originally tooled up in two parts; the rear section around the C-pillar was pressed especially for Cadillac, and a regular X-body sedan roof pressing was used for the forward parts. Due to customer demand, a painted steel roof was offered beginning in 1977, which required a new full roof stamping. 1977 Seville production increased slightly to 45,060 vehicles.  The following year, production increased to 56,985 cars and ended up being the peak production year for the first generation Seville.

The engine was an [[Oldsmobile]]-sourced [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#350|{{convert|350|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8]], fitted with [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix]]/[[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] electronically controlled [[fuel injection]]. This system gave the Seville smooth drivability and performance that was usually lacking in other domestic cars of this early emissions control era. Power output was {{convert|180|hp|abbr=on}}, gas mileage was 17 MPG in the city and 23 MPG on the highway {{citation needed|date=January 2011}} (the larger [[Cadillac Deville|Deville]] and [[Cadillac Fleetwood|Fleetwood]] were still getting single digit gas mileage) and performance was good for the era zero to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} taking 11.5 seconds. A [[Diesel engine|diesel]] {{convert|350|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile Diesel engine|LF9]]'' V8 was added in 1978, the first diesel engine offered in passenger vehicles in America.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The '''Cadillac [[trip computer|Trip Computer]]''' "Tripmaster" was a unique optional feature available midyear during the 1978 and also the 1979 model years at a cost of US$920. This option replaced the two standard analogue gauges with an electronic digital readout for the speedometer and remaining fuel. It also replaced the quartz digital clock with an LED display clock. The trip computer also included numerous calculations at the touch of a button on a small panel located to the right of the steering wheel. These included miles to empty, miles per gallon, and a destination arrival time (which needed to be programmed by the driver, to estimate arrival time based on miles remaining). Though preceded by the British 1976 [[Aston Martin Lagonda]] sedan, the Seville was the first American automobile to offer full electronic instrumentation.  Although the 1978 [[Lincoln Continental Mark V|Continental Mark V]] was available with a "Miles-To-Empty" feature (i.e., an LED readout of miles left to travel based on the fuel remaining), Lincoln did not offer full electronic instrumentation until 1980. The trip computer proved an unpopular option and was rarely ordered, probably due to its rather high cost. A digital instrument cluster was not available on the Seville and Eldorado again until 1981. Although the "Trip Computer" itself was no longer available, the new electronic fuel data system introduced in 1980, as well as the new electronic heating and air conditioning controls, replaced some of the trip computer functions that were provided previously.

A number of custom coach builders made modifications to the 1975–1979 Seville, to include shortened 2-seat 2-door convertibles, a 2-door convertible with a back seat, a 2-door pickup truck, 2-door coupes, 2- and 4-door lengthened-hood Sevilles with a fake spare tire in each front fender, and a lengthened-wheelbase standard 4-door Seville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://milanroadster.weebly.com/ |title=Cadillac Seville Milan Roadster Convertible - Home |website=Milanroadster.weebly.com |date=2010-05-06 |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seville was manufactured in Iran under the brand name of "Cadillac Iran" from 1978 to 1987 by [[Pars Khodro]], which was known as "Iran General Motors" before the Islamic Revolution. A total of 2,653 Cadillacs were made in Iran during this period. This made Iran the only country assembling Cadillacs outside the U.S. until 1997 when [[Cadillac Catera]] was based on Opel Omega and built in Germany for U.S. market. [[Cadillac BLS]], built in Sweden for European market, but never available in U.S. market, was introduced in 2006. Even though the [[Cadillac Allante]] had an Italian-sourced body and interior, its final assembly was done in the U.S.

[[File:1978 Cadillac Seville Elgante.jpg|thumb|right|1978 Cadillac Seville Elegante with Ruidoso Brown Metallic over Western Saddle Firemist paint option]]
From 1978, through the third generation in 1988, Seville was available with the ''Elegante'' package. For 1978, this package added a unique black/silver two-tone exterior paint combination and "perforated-style" leather seats in light gray only. Real wire wheels were standard as were a host of other features which were optional and/or unavailable on the base Seville.

In 1979, a second color combination was added, a two-tone copper shade with a matching leather interior. For the second generation Seville Elegante in 1985, a monotone paint combination became available, however dual-shade combinations, which were now available in various colors, remained more popular. The price for this package increased over time beginning at US$2,600 in 1978 and peaking at US$4,005 in 1987.

=== Market performance ===
Overall, the first-generation Seville was quite successful, but not the paradigm-changing boost GM had hoped for. Buyers were turned off by a smaller Cadillac having a higher price tag than the larger standard models (which rose rapidly each year during the inflation-plagued late '70s). It also failed to attract the younger import-buying audience, especially since luxury makes tended to sell based on brand loyalty rather than price or features. One rather embarrassing study of Seville buyers discovered that the car was most popular with senior citizens who wanted a traditional Cadillac in a smaller, more maneuverable package.

While the first-generation Seville had proved quite successful, it failed in its primary mission of winning over younger import buyers.  Marketing research indicated that the car was most popular with older women who wanted a Cadillac in a smaller, more maneuverable size.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} For the 1980 model year, the Seville's [[GM K platform (FWD)|K-body]] platform became [[front-wheel drive]], based on the [[GM E platform|E-body]] of the Eldorado, [[Buick Riviera]] and [[Oldsmobile Toronado]]. Length and wheelbase were similar, with the car losing .3" in wheelbase and gaining .8" overall. The new model featured independent rear [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] and  was the first American car to have a standard [[diesel engine]], which had carried over from the previous generation. Cadillac's new {{convert|368|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#368 and V8-6-4|L62]] V8 with Digital Fuel Injection was a no-cost option except in California, where the fuel-injected [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#350|Oldsmobile 350]] remained available, also as a no-cost option.

The razor-edged bustle-back rear styling drew inspiration from English coachbuilder [[Hooper &amp; Co.]]'s "Empress Line" designs from the early 1950s; themselves a dramatic, modernized take on the mid-'30s style of trunk/body integration.  In addition, long hood/short deck proportions were in the later half  of a revival that had manifested on large, exclusive luxury cars from the 1960s onwards, as in [[halo car|halo]] [[personal luxury cars]] such as the Buick Riviera, Oldsmobile Toronado, and reconfigured Cadillac Eldorado.  The Seville's "statement" styling was one of the last vehicles designed by GM's [[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]], appointed by [[Harley Earl]] in 1936 as the Chief Designer in the then newly created Cadillac design studio,{{Sfn|General Motors Design Impact|1977|p=1}} was swiftly imitated by the 1982–1987 [[Lincoln Continental#Seventh generation (1982–87)|Lincoln Continental]] sedan, and the 1981–1983 [[Imperial (automobile)#Sixth generation (1981–1983)|Imperial]] coupe.  Sales were strong at first, but disastrous flirtation with [[diesel engine]]s and the ill-fated [[Cadillac V8 engine#L62 V8-6-4|V-8-6-4]] variable displacement gasoline engine, coupled with poor quality control, began to erode Seville's standing in the marketplace.

The Seville initiated features that would become more traditional in later years. In 1981, "memory seats" — a feature not seen on a Cadillac since the Eldorado Broughams of the late 1950s — became available again. This option allowed two memorized positions to be recalled at the touch of a button. Also new for 1981 was a digital instrument cluster. The "Cadillac Trip Computer" was a precursor to this option in 1978. For the 1981–1985 Seville and Eldorado, it was considerably less expensive at US$200 in 1981 and did not contain the many features of Trip Computer, just a digital speedometer and fuel gauge. Engine options changed for 1981; the Cadillac V8 was now equipped with the V8-6-4 [[variable displacement]] technology. However, the engine management systems of the time proved too slow to run the system reliably. A {{convert|252|cuin|L|1|order=flip|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine#LC4|Buick]] V6 was added as a credit option. "Puncture-sealing" tires were also new for 1981.

In 1982, Seville offered heated outside rear-view mirrors with the rear defogger option. Inside, a "Symphony Sound" stereo cassette tape system was available. The previously standard diesel engine became an option, as Cadillac's new {{convert|250|cuin|L|1|order=flip|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac High Technology engine|HT-4100]] was introduced. This engine, especially in its early years, had a number of reliability issues, such as weak, porous aluminum block castings and failure-prone intake manifold gaskets.  For 1983, the Buick V6 was dropped and a new "Delco/Bose" stereo cassette system was offered at US$895. Initially, looking like a standard Delco radio in 1983, from 1984 on it featured a brushed gold-look front panel and bulbous lower interior door speaker assemblies. This was also the last year for the availability of an 8-track stereo system for Seville. On the outside, from 1983 through 1985, Seville was available with a fake "Full Cabriolet Roof" option, which gave Seville the look of a four-door convertible.

− 	
In 1985, an all-new, much smaller body attempted to combine the crisp angularity of the original Seville with the rounded edges of the new [[aerodynamic]] aesthetic. The series featured a transverse-mounted [[V8 engine|V8]] driving the front wheels. The smaller exterior size and cautious styling were regarded by some traditional Cadillac customers as being too similar to secondary cars produced by other GM divisions.  The new Seville also came with a 15% price increase over the 1985 model.

The new Seville/Eldorado chassis featured an advanced transmission and engine control system that offered [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] fuel consumption figures of nearly {{convert|30|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} on the highway using a small fuel injected V8. The new model featured a worldwide production car first—a computer system that monitored the car's systems and the engine. The BCM/ECM (Body Control Module/Engine Control Module) was paired with an electronic dashboard using high intensity vacuum fluorescent displays and utilized GM's expertise derived from the acquisition of Hughes Electronics, makers of communications and spy satellites. With sales way below expectations, an exterior refresh was rushed for 1987 as a 1988 model.  This was the final Cadillac Seville generation to have annual facelifts for the grilles.

The big news for 1988 was the introduction of the '''''Seville Touring Sedan''''' ('''STS''') which came equipped with GM's FE2 Touring Suspension. It featured special 15&amp;nbsp;inch alloy wheels, special springs, rear sway bar, and a special 15.6:1 steering ratio for enhanced handling, a grille mounted Cadillac emblem, special cloisonne trunk lock cover, and a unique four-place interior. 1988 Seville Touring Sedan production totaled 1,499 units. The first 1988 STS's were custom built in June 1988 by Cars and Concepts and announced at the 1988 Detroit Grand Prix.  These initial run models were available to VIP's within General Motors, the Cadillac Division, some major shareholders and a short list of dignitaries.  A special label was affixed to the lower corner of the driver-side front door by Cars and Concepts identifying it as one of the original STS's.

For 1989, the first "regular production" STS's were sold as a "Limited Edition" with an option code of YP6. Features from the 1988 model were carried over to the 1989 production model year with the addition of a retuned European-feel suspension package for more precise steering control and firmer feel of the road. The features of the STS over the standard Seville included hand-stitched beechwood ultrasoft leather seats, anti-lock braking, touring suspension, a 3.3:1 drive ratio; 15-inch cast aluminum alloy wheels and Goodyear Eagle GT4 blackwall tires.

The additional STS features were: grille with flush-mounted wreath-and-crest, modified driver's front fender with the cornering light moved to the front fascia and headlight monitors removed, matching body color front lower airdam and bodyside moldings, matte black export license pocket with bright bead, matte black front bumper impact pads and rear bumper guard vertical inserts, matching body color outside rearview mirrors with black patch, modified (from Eldorado) rear reflexes (moved to the bumper), modified export taillamps with three-color European-style lenses, STS nameplate on the decklid and an STS exclusive cloisonne deck lid lock cover.

The STS interior had a 12-way power front seat, manual articulating front seat headrests, center front armrest with cassette and coin/cup storage console trimmed in ultrasoft leather, net-type map pockets, rear bucket seats with integral headrests, center rear console and rear storage compartment, leather-wrapped front and rear door trim panels, door pull straps and overhead pull straps, high-gloss elm burl real wood appliques on door trim panels and switch plates, horn pad and bar, instrument panel and front and rear consoles, Beechwood Thaxton floor carpet and a decklid liner in tara material with STS logo. Other standard STS features (these were options on the standard Seville) were: automatic door locks, illuminated driver and passenger side visor vanity mirrors, illuminated entry system, rear window defogger, theft-deterrent system and trunk mat.

Only 4 exterior colors were available for the STS this year: White Diamond; Sable Black; Black Sapphire; or Carmine Red. 1,893 Seville Touring Sedans (STS) were produced for the 1989 model year. The first 1989 STS's were leftovers from the Cars &amp; Concepts run of the 1988 production year and had the special sticker located on the lower part on the inside of the driver's door. These were produced prior to December 1988 for the 1989 production year and are very rare. The last 6 digits of these VIN numbers would be below 808000. As with the 1988 model, a special 3.25" x 2" black/silver chrome label was affixed to the lower inside area of the driver-side front door by Cars and Concepts identifying it as one of the original STS's.

In 1990, the Seville got a new fuel injection system which brought the horsepower up to 180. Front park lamps were no longer mounted in the fender on any models, and the Seville STS underwent some major changes. These included new side and rear body color fascias which gave the car a sportier, more aggressive look. Also added was dual exhaust with bright stainless outlets, a larger STS trunk script, standard Teves anti-lock braking system with rear discs, and 16-inch machine finished alloy wheels on Goodyear Eagle GT+4 tires. A driver's side airbag was also added to Seville and STS. While the engine was the same as used in regular Seville models, the transmission had a special final drive ratio of 3:33:1 for better acceleration. The 1990 STS also received its own body designation of 6KY69, and prices started at $36,320. 1990 STS limited production totaled 2,811 vehicles.

There were no body changes in 1991, but mechanically there was a new 4.9 liter V8 under the hood coupled to a 4T60E electronically controlled transmission. The new V8 no longer used the A.I.R. system, and additional refinements to the internals brought the horsepower up to 200. The only change to the STS was the removal of the rear bucket seats for a full-width bench, and new front seats with larger side bolsters taken from last years [[Cadillac Eldorado#1990–1991 Eldorado Touring Coupe|Eldorado Touring Coupe]]. 2,206 were produced.

For 1992, Cadillac delivered a new, European-flavored Seville with positive reviews as well as customers. The Seville Touring Sedan was ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Car of the Year]] for 1992. It also made ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] that year.  The Seville STS adopted styling cues from the 1988 Cadillac Voyage concept car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.supercars.net/cars/3503.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20150119151345/http://www.supercars.net/cars/3503.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2015-01-19 |title=1988 Cadillac Voyage Concept |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Supercars.net |accessdate=2015-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1993 addition of the [[Northstar System]], including the [[Cadillac Northstar engine|Northstar]] quad-cam [[multivalve|32-valve]] aluminum V8 and a new unequal-length control arm rear suspension to the STS helped the Seville increase sales.  The rear suspension previously featured a single transverse [[leaf spring]] like the [[Chevrolet Corvette]]. The wheelbase was back up to {{convert|111|in|mm|abbr=on}} with a {{convert|203.9|in|mm|abbr=on}} overall length. 
The Seville was divided into two sub-models:

In 1996, the [[Cadillac Catera]] took over from the Seville as Cadillac's smallest car.

A redesigned Seville was introduced in late 1997 for 1998 MY, and was now built on [[General Motors|GM's]] [[GM G platform (FWD)|G platform]]; however GM chose to continue to refer to it as the K platform.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; It was the first Cadillac launched with a European type approval number in Europe such as United Kingdom first, and then Germany, Belgium, France, Spain, Italy, Finland and other in markets. All [[transverse engine]] [[front-wheel drive]] Sevilles were built in [[Hamtramck, Michigan]].

The wheelbase was extended to {{convert|112.2|in|mm|abbr=on}} but the overall length was down slightly to {{convert|201|in|mm|abbr=on}}. The car looked quite similar to the fourth-generation model, but featured numerous suspension and drivability improvements. The Seville ''STS'' (and companion Eldorado ''ETC'') became the most powerful front-wheel-drive cars on the market at 300&amp;nbsp;hp (224&amp;nbsp;kW). The top STS model runs 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph in 6.4 seconds&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cadillac 0–60 Times &amp; Cadillac Quarter Mile Times|url=http://www.zeroto60times.com/vehicle-make/cadillac-0-60-mph-times/|website=Zeroto60times.com|accessdate=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has a 14.8 second quarter-mile time.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The fifth generation Seville was the first Cadillac engineered to be built in both left- and right-hand-drive form; becoming the first modern Cadillac to be officially imported and sold in South Africa along with other right-hand-drive markets such as Japan and the United Kingdom. In the past, right-hand-drive Cadillacs were built from [[Complete knock down|CKD]] kits or special conversion kits shipped for local conversion.

In addition, this Seville had two lengths: one for US market and one for export market, namely Europe. The export version had thinner bumpers as to bring the overall length under five metres since some countries place higher taxation for passenger cars longer than five metres.

In January 2002, Seville STS received a new ''[[MagneRide]]'' adaptive suspension system. Though the new MagneRide system was standard on Seville STS models, it was not available for Seville SLS models.

Production of the Seville STS ended on May 16, 2003. Seville SLS production ended seven months later on December 4, 2003. In 2004, only the Seville SLS model was available for purchase. The Seville model name was discontinued for 2005 and replaced with the [[Cadillac STS]].

The '''Cadillac BLS''' is a [[compact executive car]] marketed in [[Europe]] by [[Cadillac]], sharing [[General Motors]]' [[GM Epsilon platform|Epsilon]] architecture, as a restyled variant of the [[Saab 9-3]]. Development was carried out by [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] and the car was manufactured in [[Trollhättan Assembly|Trollhättan]], [[Sweden]], alongside the [[Saab 9-3]] and the [[Saab 9-5]]. Sales of the [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] began in March 2006, with a [[station wagon]] joining the line for 2007. Starting in 2007, the BLS was sold in the [[Middle East]], [[Mexico]], [[South Africa]] and [[South Korea]]. It was never sold in the [[United States]] nor [[Canada]].

BLS production reached 3,257 in 2006&lt;ref name="Automobil Revue 2008, p. 47"/&gt; and 2,772 in 2007.&lt;ref name="Automobil Revue 2008, p. 47"&gt;''Automobil Revue'', catalog 2008, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;auto ''motor und sport'', #3/2008, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; Production ended in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821094956/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId%3D155287 |url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=155287 |title=It's the End of the Line for the Cadillac BLS in Europe |publisher=[[Edmunds Inc.]] |work=Edmunds Inside Line |date=2009-08-18 |accessdate=2013-08-16 |archivedate=2009-08-21 |first=Anita |last=Lienert |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The BLS was available with a diesel engine (a 1.9&amp;nbsp;L turbocharged four-cylinder) and two [[petrol]] engines (a 2.8&amp;nbsp;L turbocharged V6 and a 2.0&amp;nbsp;L available with two power levels).

At {{convert|184.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} in overall length, the BLS was almost six inches shorter than the [[Cadillac CTS|CTS]], the smallest Cadillac available in North America.

==Name==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}

The BLS is known by many as the "Bob Lutz Special" - a reference to Vice Chairman [[Bob Lutz (businessman)|Bob Lutz]] who oversaw all GM product development at the time. Lutz, a supporter of badge engineering, wanted to leverage the SAAB 9-3 to fill holes in Cadillac's product range.

The reference to Bob Lutz can be viewed both as support and as criticism of his strategy. While the BLS was a market failure, many of the techniques of badge engineering employed in the BLS resulted in other GM product successes, most notably a significant improvement in overall passenger car product quality and performance output.

Under Lutz's revamped strategy, most Cadillac model names had no meaning (aside from preceding models, such as DTS for Deville Touring Sedan, or CTS for Catera Touring Sedan). Hence, the BLS has no official name for its abbreviation - fueling the community namesake.

While GM has never formally said why the BLS bore its name, it is likely the B was chosen for being smaller than the CTS mid-size sedan, L for Luxury, and S for Sedan. This is consistent with the Seville Luxury Sedan, or later the Cadillac SLS.

The '''Cadillac Cimarron''' is an [[Compact executive car#History in the United States|entry-level luxury car]] manufactured and marketed by the [[Cadillac]] division of [[General Motors]] from 1981 to 1988 as a four-door sedan across a single generation.  

Marking Cadillac's entry into the compact segment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ewAAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=Cadillac+Cimarron+compact#v=onepage&amp;q=Cadillac%20Cimarron%20compact&amp;f=false|title=Popular Science|last=Corporation|first=Bonnier|date=August 1985|publisher=Bonnier Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and using the [[GM J platform]], the Cimarron was introduced and marketed concurrently with  [[badge engineering|rebadged]] J-platform variants from each of its divisions, and was manufactured at [[South Gate Assembly]] and [[Janesville Assembly Plant|Janesville Assembly]].  Following South Gate's closure in 1982, assembly continued in Janesville.

The Cimarron is noted as a [[wikt:nadir|nadir]] of GM's product planning for its low sales, poor performance and ill-conceived badge engineering.

== Background ==
As General Motors prepared for the 1980s, Cadillac product planners considered a sedan smaller than the [[Cadillac Seville|Seville]].  While the Seville had sold well, in its research of buyers, Cadillac learned that in place of import buyers, many Sevilles were purchased by traditional luxury-car buyers wanting a smaller car.  To diversify and modernize their product range, and complement the Seville which competed with premium European luxury sedans, Cadillac dealers requested a smaller car that could compete with compact European sedans.&lt;ref name="Yates, page 71"&gt;Yates, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ySZhMJrzhw4C&amp;lpg=PT83&amp;dq=Cadillac%20Cimarron&amp;pg=PT83#v=onepage&amp;q=Cadillac%20Cimarron&amp;f=false |title=GM Designs for the '80s |work=Popular Science |last=Dunne |first=Jim |page=88 |date=January 1981 |publisher=Bonnier Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the shortest development programs undertaken by General Motors, development of the Cimarron began in early 1980,&lt;ref name="RD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rideanddrive.com/disasters/cimarron.html|title=Trouble In Paradise: The Story of the Cadillac Cimarron|author=Bonsall, Thomas E.|year=1997|work=RideAndDrive.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010118205200/http://www.rideanddrive.com/disasters/cimarron.html|archivedate=January 18, 2001|url-status=dead|accessdate=2009-10-04|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  even though other vehicles of the GM J-platform had been in development since 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brock Yates|Yates, Brock]]: ''The Decline and Fall of the American Automobile Industry'', p. 24. Empire Books, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;  While General Motors wanted Cadillac to better compete with other luxury brands, the use of the J-platform to do so was met with heavy resistance.  [[Pete Estes]], GM's president at the time, warned Ed Kennard, Cadillac's general manager: "Ed, you don't have time to turn the J-car into a Cadillac."&lt;ref name="RD" /&gt;

Originally scheduled for mid-1980s release,&lt;ref name="Yates, page 71" /&gt; the Cimarron was released in early 1981 along with the Chevrolet Cavalier, Buick Skyhawk, Oldsmobile Firenza, and Pontiac J2000 (later marketed as the Sunbird).  With the Seville competing with mid-size/large European luxury sedans, the Cimarron was marketed as a sportier sedan, competing with the [[Audi 80#4000 (1980–1987) &amp; 4000 5+5|Audi 4000]], [[BMW 3 Series (E21)#North American models|BMW 320i]], [[Saab 900#Saab 900 "Classic"|Saab 900]], and [[Volvo 200 Series|Volvo 240]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1982_Cadillac/1982%20Cadillac%20Cimarron%20Brochure/image9.html|title=1982 Cadillac Cimarron Brochure|last=Ristic-Petrovic|first=Dusan|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Model name ==
At its 1981 introduction, the copy text of original sales brochures associated the Cimarron nameplate with "fortitude, adventure and pioneering".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1982_Cadillac/1982%20Cadillac%20Cimarron%20Brochure/image2.html|title=1982 Cadillac Cimarron Brochure|last=Ristic-Petrovic|first=Dusan|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nameplate was chosen from a list that included J2000 (used on predecessor of [[Pontiac Sunbird]]); Carmel; Cascade; Caville (blend of Cadillac and [[Cadillac de Ville series|De Ville]]); Envoy; and [[Cadillac Series 62|Series 62]] (predecessor of [[Cadillac Calais]]).&lt;ref&gt;Witzenburg, Gary. "The Name Game", ''Motor Trend'', 4/84, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Witzenburg, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;  For 1982, the brand nomenclature was "Cimarron by Cadillac", although initially the Cadillac name did not appear on the car.  &lt;ref name="RD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="buzz1" /&gt;  For 1983, the nameplate was simply "Cadillac Cimarron".&lt;ref name="RD" /&gt;

==Design==
The Cimarron was built using the front-wheel drive [[GM J platform]], using a {{Convert|101.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase.  Using [[Vehicle frame|unibody]] construction, the front suspension consists of a [[MacPherson strut]] configuration (mounted to a front subframe), with a rear suspension using [[torsion beam]] axle, along with front and rear stabilizer bars.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1983_Cadillac/1983_Cadillac_Cimarron_Brochure/1983%20Cadillac%20Cimarron-15.html|title=Cimarron '83|publisher=Cadillac Devison of General Motors|accessdate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1982, the Cimarron was equipped with a 1.8&amp;nbsp;L four-cylinder engine, producing {{convert|88|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} (the first four-cylinder Cadillac since 1914 and the first engine below 2.0&amp;nbsp;L displacement since 1908).  For 1983, the engine was enlarged to 2.0&amp;nbsp;L and given fuel injection, though engine tuning would drop peak output to {{convert|86|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.  For 1985, a 2.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 (shared with the Chevrolet Cavalier and Oldsmobile Firenza) was added as an option, producing {{convert|130|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}; for 1987, the V6 became standard.  The four-cylinder engines were paired with a 4-speed manual (later a 5-speed), with a 3-speed automatic as an option; the 3-speed automatic was the sole transmission with the V6.

To distinguish the Cimarron from the Chevrolet Cavalier and its Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac counterparts, Cadillac standardized many of the available features offered on J-platform cars at the time, including air conditioning, leather seats, alloy wheels, power mirrors, full instrumentation (including tachometer; the only Cadillac to do so at the time), courtesy lights, intermittent wipers, rear window defogger, and AM/FM stereo.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Its interior featured simulated aluminum trim, notably foregoing simulated wood trim.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1982_Cadillac/1982%20Cadillac%20Cimarron%20Brochure/image6.html|title=1982 Cadillac Cimarron Brochure|last=Ristic-Petrovic|first=Dusan|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1983_Cadillac/1983_Cadillac_Cimarron_Brochure/1983%20Cadillac%20Cimarron-13.html|title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1983_Cadillac/1983_Cadillac_Cimarron_Brochure|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Available options included automatic transmission, cruise control, tilt steering wheel, power windows, power door locks, power driver and passenger seats, sunroof, and a cassette player.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  With the exception of its upholstery and model-specific special suspension tuning, other J-platform models could be optioned nearly identically to a Cimarron though doing so would raise prices close to the $12,131 base price of the Cadillac in 1982.&lt;ref name="RD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="buzz1" /&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
The Cimarron's market failure is one in a series of events throughout the 1980s and 1990s which caused Cadillac's share of the US market  to decline from 3.8% in 1979 to 2.2% in 1997;&lt;ref&gt;Flammang and Kowalke, pp. 149-189&lt;/ref&gt; it is routinely cited as the nadir of GM's product planning:

:*Noted automotive journalist [[Dan Neil]] included the Cimarron in his 2007 list of ''Worst Cars of all Time'', saying "everything that was wrong, venal, lazy, and mendacious about GM in the 1980s was crystallized in this flagrant insult to the good name and fine customers of Cadillac."&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web

  | author = Dan Neil
  | url = http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/0,28757,1658545,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that the Cimarron "nearly killed Cadillac and remains its biggest shame."&lt;ref name=time/&gt;

:*''[[Forbes]]'' placed the Cimarron on its list of "Legendary Car Flops," citing low sales, poor performance and the fact the car "didn't work, coming from a luxury brand."&lt;ref name="buzz1"&gt;{{cite web

  | url = http://www.carbuzz.com/news/2012/11/11/Rebadged-Disasters-Cadillac-Cimarron-7711547/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*CarBuzz called the Cimarron a "textbook example of what goes wrong when a carmaker tries to badge engineer an economy car into a luxury car."&lt;ref name="buzz2"&gt;{{cite web

  | url = http://www.carbuzz.com/news/2012/11/11/Rebadged-Disasters-Cadillac-Cimarron-7711547/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Author Hannah Elliott said the Cimarron "appealed neither to Cadillac's loyal followers, who appreciated powerful V8s and Cadillac's domestic luxury edge, nor to buyers who favored Europe's luxury brands, whose cars out-handled and out-classed the Cimarron in every way."&lt;ref name="autos.yahoo.com"&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=Jan 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*[[CNNMoney.com|CNN Money]] described the Cimarron as "in all important respects, a Chevrolet Cavalier. It also added thousands to the price tag. In all, it was neither a good Cadillac nor a good value. Today, GM executives will readily admit that this was a bad idea."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

:*''[[Car and Driver]]'' said a subsequent Cadillac product director, John Howell, kept a picture of the Cimarron on his wall captioned, "Lest we forget."&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, Ray, [http://www.caranddriver.com/carnews/11058/upfront-news-2006-cadillac-bls.html 2006 Cadillac BLS], Car and Driver, June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cadillac would again offer a compact sedan developed through the badge engineering of vehicles designed by other GM subsidiaries, firstly in [[1996]] with the [[Cadillac Catera]] which was essentially a lightly reworked [[Opel Omega|Opel/Vauxhall Omega]] produced in Germany. The Catera met with a lukewarm reception (being branded the "Cimarron Ii" by the press at its launch but sold a reasonable 95,000 units. Cadillac tried yet again between 2005-2009 by introducing the [[Cadillac BLS]] as its smallest model line.  Derived from the [[Saab 9-3]], the BLS was manufactured by Saab in Sweden as a four-door sedan and as a station wagon.  While Cadillac used "Art and Science" design language to style unique front and rear fascias and elements of its roofline, the BLS visibly shared all four doors with the 9-3.

Sized slightly smaller than the CTS, the BLS was never offered in the United States and Canada and was sold in Europe, the Middle East, South Africa, South Korea, and Mexico.

[[File:Cadillac 30-40 photo 19060414.jpg|thumb|Model D 1905]]
The '''Cadillac Model D''' is an American brass age car that was introduced by [[Cadillac]] in January 1905, and sold throughout that year.  It was a larger [[automobile]] than previous Cadillac offerings, and their first four-cylinder production model.  Priced at $2800,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carsandracingstuff.com/library/m/modeld.php Model D at The Crittenden Automotive Library]&lt;/ref&gt; it can be seen as the first luxury car from the company.

The engine was a 300.7&amp;nbsp;in³ (4.9&amp;nbsp;L) [[straight-4|four-cylinder]] L-head design producing a claimed {{Convert|30|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.  The car used a complicated 3-speed [[planetary transmission]] and had a governed throttle, essentially a primitive [[cruise control]].  The engine was designed by [[Alanson P. Brush]], who left Cadillac shortly afterwards.

[[File:Cadillac 1907 Model M Coupe.jpg|thumb|Model M Coupé 1907&lt;br&gt;Cadillac's first coupé]]

==Model H &amp; L==
The Model D was replaced for 1906 with the '''Model H''' and larger '''Model L'''.  Both were based on the Model D, though the departure of Brush led [[Henry Leland]] to begin to purge his patented designs from the cars.  Thus, the variable intake valve lift system and hydraulic governor were abandoned for more conventional designs.

The Model L used a large 392.7&amp;nbsp;in³ (6.4&amp;nbsp;L) engine with 5&amp;nbsp;in (127&amp;nbsp;mm) square bore and stroke, rated at {{Convert|40|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.  The smaller Model H continued with the {{Convert|30|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 300.7&amp;nbsp;in³ (4.9&amp;nbsp;L) engine size used in the Model D.

Both came in two or more body styles. 

The Model H continued in production through 1908, while the Model L was cancelled, and a Limousine was added as a body style.
[[File:Cadillac 1908 Model G Limousine.jpg|thumb|Model G limousine 1907]]

==Model G==
The '''Model G''' was a smaller version of the Model H, with a wheelbase of 100&amp;nbsp;in (2540&amp;nbsp;mm).  It could be purchased as a tourer, roadster or limousine. 

The engine was a 226.2&amp;nbsp;in³ (3.7&amp;nbsp;L) [[straight-4|four-cylinder]] L-head design producing {{Convert|20|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, which was re-rated to 25 for 1908 with no changes made.  The Model G eschewed the complicated [[planetary transmission]] used on other luxury four-cylinder cars of the era for a less-complicated sliding gear system.

For the 1909 model year, Cadillac introduced the new [[Cadillac Model Thirty|Model Thirty]].  This new car was based on the Model G and replaced all 1908 Models.  The Model 30 was bodied in various configurations and passenger capacities.

[[File:1915 Cadillac 51 (10793180364).jpg|thumb|Type 51&lt;br&gt;(4-passenger) Phaeton 1915]]
The '''Cadillac Type 51''' is a large, luxurious [[automobile]] that was introduced in September 1914 by [[Cadillac]] as a 1915 model.&lt;ref name='hsw'&gt;{{cite web |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1915-cadillac-v-8-type-511.htm |author=The Auto Editors of Consumer Guide |title=1915 Cadillac V-8 Type 51 |work=HowStuffWorks.com |accessdate=2010-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Cadillac's first V8 automobile, replacing the four-cylinder [[Cadillac Model 30|Model 30]]. The similar '''Types [[Cadillac Type 53|53]], 55, 57, 59, and 61''' lasted through 1923, when the design was substantially updated as the [[Cadillac Type V-63|Type V-63]]. It used the [[GM A platform]] for the entire series. It was built at the [[Henry Ford Company|Cass Street and Amsterdam Avenue]] factory in Detroit, with the body provided by a number of coachbuilders, including [[Fleetwood Metal Body]] in Fleetwood, Pennsylvania.

All of these models used a new [[Cadillac V8 engine|L-head V8 engine]], one of the first V8 engines ever mass-produced and a substantial differentiator for the [[marque]].  All bodies were built by [[Fisher Body|Fisher]].  The Type 51 was also the first left-hand drive Cadillac&amp;mdash;all previous models had been right-hand drive, which was continued as an option.  Wheelbases varied in those years, with 122&amp;nbsp;in (3099&amp;nbsp;mm) at the low end and 145&amp;nbsp;in (3683&amp;nbsp;mm) as the longest.

In May 1916, [[Erwin George Baker|Erwin "Cannonball" Baker]] and William Sturm drove a Cadillac from [[Los Angeles]] to [[New York City|New York]] in 7 days, 11 hours, and 52 minutes.

In July 1917, the [[United States Army]] needed a dependable staff car and chose the Cadillac Type 55 Touring Model after exhaustive tests on the Mexican border. 2,350 of the cars were supplied for use in France by officers of the [[American Expeditionary Force]] in [[World War II|World War I]].

      <comment>Corrected year and type (model) in photo caption. This photo is misidentified on the front as a 1924 model. The 1924 models had a black grille and headlights. The car here has a nickel plated grille and headlights which indicate a 1925 year car. Many of the photos from the New York Public Library have similar incorrect writing on the front. The correct designation for these cars is "Type V-63" and not "Model 63" as shown in the previous caption.</comment>

The '''Cadillac Type V-63''' is a large [[luxury automobile]] that was introduced in September 1923 by [[Cadillac]] as a 1924 [[model year|model]], replacing the previous [[Cadillac Type 61|Type 61]]. It used the [[GM C platform]] and was replaced by the [[Cadillac Series 355]].

The V-63 used an improved version of the [[Cadillac V8 engine|L-head V8 engine]] that made Cadillac famous.  The main innovation was a [[V8 engine#Cross-plane and flat-plane|cross-plane]] [[crankshaft]] which improved balance and smoothness.  This design required complex mathematical analysis, and was simultaneously patented by [[Peerless]].  Both companies agreed to share the innovation, which has now become common.  Another innovation in the V-63 was front-wheel brakes.  

A line of "Custom" bodies was added for 1925, but the vehicle was otherwise largely unchanged.  The line was refreshed for 1926 as the [[Cadillac Series 314|Series 314]]. It was built at the [[Henry Ford Company|Cass Street and Amsterdam Avenue]] factory in Detroit, with the body provided by a number of coachbuilders, including [[Fleetwood Metal Body]] in Fleetwood, Pennsylvania.

[[File:Cadillac Model A 1902 (6829591487).jpg|thumb]]
The first [[Cadillac]] automobiles were the 1903 Model built in the last quarter, 1902.  These were 2-seater "[[horseless carriage]]s" powered by a reliable and sturdy {{Convert|10|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[piston engine|single-cylinder engine]] developed by [[Henry Martyn Leland]] and built by [[Leland and Faulconer Manufacturing Company]] of Detroit, of which [[Henry Leland]] was founder, vice-president and general manager.

Reformed as the [[Cadillac Automobile Company]] in August 1902, it began manufacturing the runabouts and named them "Cadillac" after the city's founder Antoine Laumet, the self-styled [[Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac]] at the re-purposed [[Detroit Assembly]].  The 1904 Model B was a refinement of the 1903 and while still a mid-engined, one cylinder automobile, it now had an extended front and transverse front suspension.  With the introduction of the Model B, the 1903 style became known as the Model A .  Both the Model A and B were available as a two-passenger runabout or four passenger rear tonneau. Catalogs also show a light delivery.

The one cylinder Cadillac continued to be offered through 1908 in the runabout, tonneau or delivery bodies under a variety of Model designations which are delineated below.

==Single-cylinder engine==

The Models A, B, C, E, and F shared a single-cylinder {{Convert|98.2|cuin|cc|abbr=on}} engine rated from 6.5 to around {{Convert|9|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} depending on model.  The cylinder was horizontal, pointing rearward, and was cast from iron with a copper water jacket.  Bore and stroke were square at {{Convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}}. The engine was named by its manufacturers, Leland and Faulkner, "Little Hercules".

The engine employed a patented [[variable valve timing|variable-lift intake valve]] licensed from [[Alanson P. Brush]].  The restrictions of this design using Brush's patents led the company to develop their own four-cylinder engine for the later [[Cadillac Model D|Models D, L, G, and H]].

==Rear entrance tonneau==
When the street was muddy or dirty the car would be backed up to the sidewalk so tonneau passengers did not need to walk in the mud.

==Model A==

[[File:Cadillac 1903 Rear Entrance Tonneau Auto on London to Brighton Veteran Car Run 2009.jpg|thumb|Tonneau 1903&lt;br/&gt;rear-entrance]]
Three cars were completed in time for the [[New York Auto Show]] staged in January, 1903.  All three cars were sold at the show and by mid-week orders had been taken for 2,286 further units, each one requiring a deposit of $10.  The cars had many similarities to the [[Ford Model A (1903–04)|Ford Model A]]; both were the products of the mind of Henry Ford.

Throughout 1903, 2,497 units were built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carsandracingstuff.com/library/m/modela_c.php  Model A at The Crittenden Automotive Library]&lt;/ref&gt; Production began in March 1903 and output totalled 1,895 units from March 1903 to March 1904. The 2-seater [[Runabout (car)|runabout]] cost $750; an optional rear entrance detachable [[tonneau]] cost $100 and doubled the occupant capacity. The entire body was bolted to the chassis and could be lifted without removing or disconnecting any plumbing or wiring.{{Sfn|Clark|1985|p=189}}

Cadillacs of 1903 sometimes are identified erroneously as the Model A; in fact, they were known simply as the "Cadillac Runabout" and the "Cadillac Tonneau". When a new Cadillac was introduced in 1904, it was designated the "Model B"; meanwhile, production of the earlier runabout and [[tonneau]] models continued through a second year.  Only at that time did [[Cadillac]] began to designate them as '''Model A''' cars to distinguish them from the new, 1904 models.

The front of the car had a sloping, curved, false hood and radiator. The car was advertised as having {{convert|6+1/2|hp|kW}}. Power was transmitted the rear wheels by chain-drive through a planetary transmission. Pedal operated brakes on rear axles were supplemented by engaging reverse gear. The 22-inch wood wheels had 12 spokes and the car's wheelbase was {{Convert|72|in|mm|abbr=on}}.{{Sfn|Gunnell|2005|p=10}}
[[File:Cadillac Special Delivery 19040220.jpg|thumb|Delivery]]
;Options
* Bolt-on rear-entrance tonneau containing two more seats $100
* Leather top, side curtains etc. $50
* Rubber top, side curtains etc. $300
* Head and side-lamps
* Alternative chain sprockets to adjust road speed{{Sfn|Gunnell|2005|p=10}}

===Reputation===
The Cadillac earned a reputation for reliability, ease and economy of maintenance and for being a car with a remarkable ability for climbing and pulling. In 1903, F. S. Bennett, Cadillac's importer into the UK, entered the car in the Sunrising Hill Climb, where it was the only single-cylinder car to finish, and in the 1,000 Miles Reliability Trial, where it came fourth in its price class in overall points but first in its class in points scored for reliability. {{Sfn|Gunnell|2005|p=10}}

Production continued into 1904 but with an {{convert|8+1/4|hp|kW}} engine. A pressure-fed multiple oiler was added.

==Model B (1904)==
[[File:Cadillac 1904 9HP Limousine on London to Brighton VCR 2010 15-52-37.jpg|thumb|left|Model F 1905&lt;br/&gt;custom bodied open-drive limousine with running boards and full fenders]]
[[File:Cadillac 1904 10HP Tonneau on London to Brighton VCR 2013.jpg|thumb|Model B 1904 Tonneau&lt;br/&gt;rear-entrance (C front)]]
Introduced in January 1904 Cadillac's '''Model B''' was similar to their Model A, sharing its engine but using a pressed-steel frame and axles and the Model B was on a longer {{convert|76|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase.  The front axle is described as girder-style. It supported the car through a single transverse half-elliptic spring.{{Sfn|Gunnell|2005|p=11}} The sloping dash was replaced by a detachable box-like front to the body and a vertical radiator. All body styles lost as much as 70 pounds weight. Prices went up $50.{{Sfn|Gunnell|2005|p=11}} The car was advertised as having {{Convert|8+1/4|hp|kW}} but there were no changes to the design of the engine.{{Sfn|Gunnell|2005|p=11}}

The Model B was available as a runabout or a [[touring car]] with a detachable rear-entrance [[tonneau]] and optional [[Surrey (carriage)|surrey]] top, or with a delivery body. The passenger cars were both priced at $900 and weighed roughly {{Convert|1450|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. Options now included a bulb horn and a deck to replace the tonneau. The Model B continued in production through 1905 when an alternative tubular front axle was available and the power was advertised as {{Convert|9|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.{{Sfn|Gunnell|2005|p=11}}

==Model C (1905)==
[[File:Cadillac Model C Tonneau 1905.jpg|thumb|Model C touring car 1905&lt;br/&gt;rear-entrance tonneau, surrey top]]

The '''Model C''' was a short-wheelbase car intended to replace the old Models A and B for the summer of 1905.  It shared much of the Model B chassis components, but used the hood and radiator of the Model F.  The [[tonneau]] was detachable, unlike the Model F.

Riding on a {{Convert|72|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase, Model C was available as either a runabout, priced at $750, or touring car, priced at $850, with a detachable rear-entrance tonneau and optional surrey top.  The lightweight runabout weighed just {{Convert|1330|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, {{Convert|120|lb|kg}} less than the touring model.

==Model D (1905)==
Four cylinder engine, see separate article [[Cadillac Model D]]

==Model E (1905)==
[[File:Cadillac 1905 Model E Runabout.jpg|thumb|left|Model E Runabout 1905]]
The '''Model E''' was released in January, 1905.  It was a featherweight {{Convert|1100|lb|kg|abbr=on}} runabout model with seating for two, priced at $750 in 1905.  It used a {{Convert|74|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase, splitting the difference between the C and the B/F.

No detachable tonneau to make it a four-seater was available. The arched front axle was tubular. The axle was given a truss and added mid-year was a rocker shaft between it and the spring. Single cylinder 98.2 cu. inch engine with an advertised output of 9 horsepower.

The planetary transmission which had balanced linkage on its bands provided two speeds and reverse. Drive was taken to the back axle by chain.

==Model F (1905)==
[[File:1905 Cadillac Model F Touring, front left (Hershey 2019).jpg|right|thumb|Model F touring car 1905&lt;br/&gt;side-entrance tonneau]]
The '''Model F''' was the primary new Cadillac model of 1905.  It had a sharper hood and radiator, prompting the update of the Model B (which became the Model C) and even spawning an aftermarket of updates to existing Model A and Model B cars.  Models E and F shared the same chassis, though the latter was lengthened by two inches

The Model F was available as either a 4-seater 2-door [[touring car]] with side-entrance to the fixed tonneau or a 2-seater delivery vehicle. Both were priced at $950 in 1905. The Model F shared the same {{Convert|76|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase as had been used on the Model B.

==Model G, Model H and Model L (1906)==
Four cylinder engine, see separate article [[Cadillac Model D]]

==Model K and Model M (1906–1908)==
[[File:Cadillac K (1907) at Autoworld Brussels (8394291773).jpg|thumb|left|Model K runabout 1907]]
[[File:1907 Cadillac Model M Touring -- Shanghai Automobile Museum 2012-05-26.JPG|thumb|Model M touring car 1907]]
Cadillac's single-cylinder lineup was consolidated into two models for 1906, the short wheelbase '''Model K''' and long wheelbase '''Model M'''.  Priced at $750 for the Model K or $950 for the Model M, 3,650 units were sold that year.  The K and M were essentially similar to the Models E and F from 1905 but with updated bodies.  Production and sale of the Models K and M continued in 1907 in both the Tulip and straight lined body styles.  The  Model M was offered with a delivery body in 1906 and again for the 1907 model year.

Three 1907 Model Ks were used in the famous [[Dewar Trophy]] test of the [[Royal Automobile Club]] in England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carsandracingstuff.com/library/m/modelk.php  Model K at The Crittenden Automotive Library]&lt;/ref&gt;  They were disassembled, the parts mixed, and then reassembled without problems.  This test cemented the Cadillac's reputation for precision and quality and brought fame to the marque.

The Model M continued only as a commercial delivery vehicle for 1908, priced at $950.

==Model S and Model T (1908)==
[[File:1908 Cadillac Model S runabout (6105660060).jpg|thumb|left|Model S runabout with dickey seat]]
The '''Model S''' and '''Model T''' of 1908 were essentially versions of the K/M from previous years with the wheelbase extended to {{Convert|82|in|mm|abbr=on}}.  These would be the last single-cylinder Cadillacs.  For 1909 the lineup standardized on the four-cylinder [[Cadillac Model Thirty|Model Thirty]].  The main difference between the S and T was that the latter lacked [[running board]]s.

For the 2010 model year, Cadillac introduced an all-new SRX based on the [[Cadillac Provoq|Provoq]] concept vehicle. The production used its own unique platform with ties to [[GM Epsilon platform|Epsilon II]]. The [[V8 engine|V8]] has been dropped for this generation. The second generation SRX began production in Summer 2009 as a 2010 model, and has a starting price of $34,155.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tony |last=Borroz | date=May 27, 2009|url=http://www.automoblog.net/2009/05/27/caddy-rolls-out-all-new-srx-crossover-cts-sport-wagon/|title=Cadillac Rolls Out All-New SRX Crossover|publisher=Automoblog.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SRX was officially unveiled in January 2009. It was launched with the choice of a 3.0 liter [[V6 engine|V6]] with direct injection derived from the 3.6 liter unit in the [[Cadillac CTS]], or a 2.8 liter turbocharged V6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Paul|last=Tan|date=January 6, 2009|url=http://paultan.org/archives/2009/01/06/2010-cadillac-srx-with-30l-v6-or-28l-turbo-v6/ |title=2010 Cadillac SRX: with 3.0L V6 or 2.8L turbo V6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2016 was the last model year for the SRX as Cadillac replaced it with the [[Cadillac XT5|XT5]] which went on sale in the spring of 2016 as a 2017 model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2015/06/25/cadillac-xt5-uncovered-spy-shots/#image-2|title=Cadillac XT5 caught uncovered during photo shoot|publisher=Autoblog|accessdate=June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2011 changes ====
For the 2011 model year, a rear backup camera and Cadillac Premium Care Maintenance program became standard and full keyless access became standard on Luxury and Performance models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kbb.com/cadillac/srx/2011/|title=2011 Cadillac SRX {{!}} Pricing, Ratings &amp; Reviews {{!}} Kelley Blue Book|website=Kbb.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, General Motors discontinued production of the 2.8 liter turbo-charged V6 engine in the SRX, citing poor sales numbers. Less than 10 percent of SRX buyers opted for the turbo-charged engine. This left the naturally aspirated 3.0 liter V6 as the only engine available for the rest of the 2011 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/2011/01/cadillac-srx-turbo-charged-model-discontinued/|title=Report: GM Discontinues Turbo-Charged Cadillac SRX|author=Alex Luft|date=2011-01-01|publisher=GM Authority|accessdate=2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety recall===
In May 2010, General Motors had to recall about 550 of its 2010 Cadillac SRXs with the turbocharged 2.8-liter V-6 because of a possible engine failure if owners use regular gas and then drive aggressively. The automaker said the fuel-filler lid and owner's manual warn that the engine should not be worked hard if regular fuel is used. Failures in several vehicles owned by GM and one external user led it to discover that using regular fuel and driving hard could cause possible internal engine damage including connecting rod failures. The automaker decided to conduct a "customer satisfaction program" to recalibrate the engine computer, but the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|NHTSA]] considered engine failures to be a safety issue and argued that a recall was required. The 2.8 liter V6 was permanently removed from production after the 2010 model year due to safety recalls. 3.0L V6 was the only engine option available for the 2011 model year. The 3.0L V6 was replaced by a 3.6L V6 engine for the 2012 model year as the only engine option available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/lamborghini-recalling-murcielagos/#more-56531 |title=Lamborghini Recalling Murciélagos |author=Christopher Jensen |publisher=The New York Times - Wheels blog |date=2010-05-28  |accessdate=2010-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/can-using-the-wrong-octane-fuel-lead-to-disaster/ |date=2010-03-30 |title=Can Using the Wrong Octane Fuel Lead to Disaster? |author=Paul Stenquist |publisher=The New York Times - Wheels blog |accessdate=2010-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cadillac Catera''' is a four-door, five passenger, rear-wheel drive luxury sedan marketed from 1996 to 2001 by [[Cadillac]] over a single generation in the United States.  As a [[badge engineering|rebadged]] variant of the [[Opel Omega#Omega_B1_(1994–1999)|Opel Omega B]] &amp;mdash; the Catera was manufactured by [[Opel]] in [[Rüsselsheim]], [[Germany]], shared GM's [[GM B platform]] and reached a production of approximately 95,000 over five model years.

==History==
[[File:00-01 Cadillac Catera.jpg|250px|thumb|left|2000–2001 Cadillac Catera]]
The Catera was first introduced in the United States in 1994 as the Cadillac LSE concept car, a new entry level model for Cadillac that would compete with sedans from [[Acura]], [[BMW]], [[Infiniti]], [[Lexus]], and [[Mercedes-Benz]].  Cadillac eventually began selling the Catera in the United States in the fall of 1996 as a 1997 model with a base price of $29,995 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|29995|1996}}}} in current dollars).

Some of the standard features on the Catera included [[cloth]] interior, front [[bucket seats]], dual-zone automatic climate control, AM/FM stereo [[car radio|radio]] with [[cassette player]] and eight-speaker sound system, [[airbag]]s, [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]], [[Traction control system|traction control]], [[keyless entry]], [[security system]], [[alloy wheels]], compact [[spare tire]], and full instrumentation. Optional equipment included [[leather]] interior, heated seats, [[cassette player]] and [[CD player]] combination, [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] premium sound system, power [[sunroof]], [[HomeLink Wireless Control System|Homelink]], [[OnStar]], and [[chrome plating|chrome]] wheels. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

A ''Sport'' model was offered beginning in 1999 with eight-way power adjustable seats, heated front seats, 17-inch wheels, driver's seat memory, audible theft-deterrent system, three-channel garage door opener, high-intensity discharge [[headlamp]]s, and a rear spoiler.  The Catera received a [[facelift (automotive)|facelift]] in 2000 with revised nose, tail, wheels, interior trim, mirrors, optional HID headlamps, stiffer suspension settings, and side airbags.

The model's engine was a {{Convert|200|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} ''[[General Motors 54° V6 engine#L81|54° L81]]'' [[V6]] manufactured in [[England]] at GM's [[Ellesmere Port]] facility, using an  [[FR layout]].  The [[GM 4L30-E transmission|GM 4L30-E]] [[automatic transmission]] was manufactured at GM's plant in [[Strasbourg]], [[France]].

==Marketing==
[[File:Cadillac Catera 002.JPG|thumb|right|Cadillac Catera]]
Catera launch marketing used the tagline "the Caddy that zigs," with advertising featuring supermodel [[Cindy Crawford]] and a small animated bird named "Ziggy," a reference to the heraldic ''merlettes'' (adaptations of the [[swallow|martin]], without legs or beaks) featured in the various iterations of Cadillac's logo from its inception through 1999.&lt;ref name="logo"&gt;{{cite web
 |title        = Cadillac’s Wreath and CrestCadillac’s Wreath and Crest
 |publisher    = Hemmings Motor News
 |author       = Mike McNessor
 |date         = February 1, 2012 
 |url          = https://www.hemmings.com/blog/article/cadillacs-wreath-and-crest/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ziggy was featured in Catera marketing through model year 1998, with Cadillac saying: 
::"like Catera, Ziggy was hatched in Germany and has the sole mission of bringing fun to the luxury of Cadillac.  He was one of six mythical, beakless, footless martins or 'Merlettes' in the Cadillac Crest before we gave him big feet, a giant beak, and turned him around. He's quite a departure from his five brothers who have been part of the Cadillac Crest since the days of the crusades when the crest was the proud symbol of [[Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac|Le Sieur Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]] Family."  

In 1997, John Tinker, a producer of television medical drama ''[[Chicago Hope]]'', was inspired by an inadvertent [[pun]] in a Catera commercial, saying "Who is Lisa Catera?" &amp;mdash; in response to the Catera tagline "Lease a Catera."  He introduced a character named Dr. Lisa Catera, played by [[Stacy Edwards]]. Coincidentally, the main demographic of ''Chicago Hope'' viewers were exactly the same demographic Cadillac hoped to attract with the Catera, and Cadillac/General Motors management responded extremely positively to the reference, becoming the main advertiser on the show and giving Edwards a complimentary three-year lease on a Catera. In one episode, Edwards' character said "when you can't zig, you zag," a reference to the Catera's original marketing tagline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Lisa Catera' Comes to Life on Chicago Hope|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/%27Lisa+Catera%27+Comes+to+Life+on+Chicago+Hope-a019929689}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rechtin|first1=Mark|title=CADILLAC SAYS NAME GAME IS NO PLOT|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/19980216/ANA/802160714/cadillac-says-name-game-is-no-plot|website=[[Automotive News]]|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related vehicles==
A close relative of the Catera, utilizing the same [[Automobile platform|platform]], continued to be in production until 2006. In the US market, the platform was used for the [[Pontiac GTO]], which was an almost identical derivative of the [[Holden Monaro]] coupe. Both were manufactured by GM Holden in [[Australia]]. These performance coupes were themselves derived from the sedan platform that originated in the Australian market as the VT-series [[Holden Commodore]] in 1997. The European version, known as the [[Opel Omega]], was discontinued in 2003.

The '''Cadillac Model Thirty''' is an [[automobile]] that was introduced in December 1909 by [[Cadillac]], and sold through 1911.  It was the company's only model for those years and was based on the 1907 [[Cadillac Model G|Model G]].  The 1912 '''Model 1912''', 1913 '''Model 1913''', and 1914 '''Model 1914''' were similar but used larger engines.  
==Engine and bodies==
The 1910 model was available with a closed body, the first time a US automobile manufacturer had offered this type.

|[[File:Cadillac Model 30 (14177551209).jpg|thumb|1912]]
|}

The engine was the same 226.2&amp;nbsp;in³ (3.7&amp;nbsp;L) [[straight-4|four-cylinder]] L-head design used in the Model G, and that car's simple sliding-gear transmission was also adopted.  The engine was bored out to 255.4&amp;nbsp;in³ (4.2&amp;nbsp;L) for 1910 and 286.3&amp;nbsp;in³ (4.7&amp;nbsp;L) for 1911 and 1912.   The engine was reworked, with a longer stroke, for 1913, giving 365.8&amp;nbsp;in³ (6.0&amp;nbsp;L) of displacement.  This same engine served in 1914.
==Self starter==
The 1912 model was awarded the [[Dewar Trophy]] for its electrical system, including its [[electric starter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.carsandracingstuff.com/library/m/model30.php|title= Model 30|website= The Crittenden Automotive Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Type 51 and the V8 engine==
The entire range was extensively revamped and given a [[V8 engine]] for 1915 (on sale from September 1914) and renamed [[Cadillac Type 51|Type 51]]

The '''Cadillac DTS''' (short for ''DeVille Touring Sedan'') is a [[full-size car|full-size]] [[luxury car|luxury]] [[sedan (car)|sedan]] that was produced by [[Cadillac]]. It replaced the [[Cadillac DeVille]] as [[Cadillac]]'s largest [[luxury car]] for the 2006 model year. This renaming followed new nomenclature conventions set by the earlier [[Cadillac CTS|CTS]] and [[Cadillac STS|STS]].

The first version of the DTS was initially shown at the 2005 [[Chicago Auto Show]] on February 9.  The DTS remained in production until 2011.

==Production and specifications==
[[File:CADDY DTS.jpg|thumb|Cadillac DTS]]
The front-wheel drive DTS was manufactured at [[General Motors|GM]]'s [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly]] factory from July 2005 through May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://media.gm.com/content/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2011/May/0527_lastdts|publisher=GM Media|title=Cadillac DTS Awaits Place in Bulgari Collection|date=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Base price of the entry DTS at time of introduction was [[USD|US$]]41,195 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|41195|2005}}}} in current dollars) which was over 10% lower than the DeVille model it had replaced.  One major feature change from the DeVille to the DTS was the elimination of standard 6-passenger seating configuration for non-[[limousine]] models. However, such capability remains an optional feature for fleet clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://prod3.gmautobuilder.com/BuildYourOwnFleet/FeaturesAndSpecs?year=2011&amp;mmc=6KD69 |title=GM Fleet Cadillac DTS specs |publisher=Prod3.gmautobuilder.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711102230/http://prod3.gmautobuilder.com/BuildYourOwnFleet/FeaturesAndSpecs?year=2011&amp;mmc=6KD69 |archivedate=2011-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even though priced less than the [[rear-wheel drive]] [[Cadillac STS|STS]], the DTS is longer than the [[Cadillac STS|STS]].

The DTS has standard industry features including multiple airbags, bi-functional xenon high-intensity discharge [[High-intensity discharge|HID]] [[headlamp]]s, leather seating, and power seats. Options include navigation system, [[Magnetic Ride Control]] (magnetic ride control on performance models only), [[Sunroof|moonroof]], chrome wheels, heated/cooled seats, and a heated [[steering wheel]].  A new DTS Platinum edition was released in 2007 with special interior trim, badging, and other luxury amenities.

The DTS incorporates the updated [[GM G platform (FWD)|GM G-platform]] (GM chose to continue referring to it as the K platform,&lt;ref name="Frame"/&gt; as denoted by the 4th letter in the [[Vehicle Identification Number|VIN]]), and is powered by a [[Front-engine,_front-wheel-drive_layout#Front-engine_transversely_mounted_.2F_Front-wheel_drive|transverse]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consumerguide.com/used/2006-11-cadillac-dts/|title=2006-11 Cadillac DTS|date=17 June 2014|publisher=|accessdate=8 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 32V [[Northstar engine series|Northstar]] [[V8 engine|V8]], which produces {{convert|275|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in  "Standard", "Luxury" and "Premium" trims.

===DTS-L===
[[File:2008 Cadillac DTSL.jpg|thumb|right|2008 Cadillac DTS-L]]
Especially for the [[limousine]] market, the lightly stretched '''DTS-L''' was released in November 2006 for the 2007 model year. Developed and finished by [[Superior Coach Company|Accubuilt]], this version was being touted as having greater rear legroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2007 Cadillac DTS-L|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/auto_shows/2006_los_angeles_auto_show_auto_shows/production_and_concept_debuts/2007_cadillac_dts_l_auto_shows|work=[[Car and Driver]]|date=November 2006|accessdate=2008-07-31|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605080854/http://www.caranddriver.com/news/auto_shows/2006_los_angeles_auto_show_auto_shows/production_and_concept_debuts/2007_cadillac_dts_l_auto_shows|archivedate=2008-06-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early DTS-L Cadillacs are easily recognized by the wider rear C-pillar, similar to the one used on the older Fleetwood 75 Series. This was necessitated by the use of the standard length DTS rear door, which left a strange-looking space between the rear wheelwell and door. In 2008 a new version, with longer rear doors, was introduced. This change also meant that the C-pillars became considerably slimmer. Despite these efforts, the low production DTS-L soon disappeared from the marketplace.
====Other uses====
[[File:Cadillac DTS hearse by Superior.jpg|thumb|right|Cadillac DTS hearse]]
The DTS was available as a 'coachbuilder' chassis for aftermarket conversion into either limousines, or hearses. The limousine model was designated V4U, and the hearse model was designated B9Q. These were only available to manufacturers named as Cadillac Master Coachbuilders, meaning they were certified by General Motors to modify them. The coachbuilder chassis are an incomplete car, with no rear doors, trunk, rear windshield, and other parts not used during the conversion. These models also included 8 lug wheels, upgraded suspension components, as well as a transmission cooler.

===End of production===
The last DTS rolled off the assembly line at 11:51&amp;nbsp;a.m. on May 27, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ganz |first=Andrew |url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/last-cadillac-dts-rolls-off-line-and-into-bulgari-collection.html |title=Last Cadillac DTS rolls off line… and into Bulgari Collection |publisher=Leftlanenews.com |date=2011-05-27 |accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2005 Cadillac DTS presidential limousine.jpg|thumb|right|The official limousine of former [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]]]]

A specially designed and outfitted armored vehicle with DTS styling and a high-roof fitted to a GM four-wheel drive chassis was debuted in the [[George W. Bush 2005 presidential inauguration|second inauguration of U.S. President George W. Bush]], which also served as the debut for the DTS before its official debut at the Chicago Auto Show. While details of the modified vehicle, codenamed "Stagecoach", remain classified, previous such vehicles indicate that it would have been upgraded with advanced armor and safety features in order to protect the president from various threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automobilemag.com/features/news/0501_george_bush_inauguration_cadillac_dts_limousine/index.html|title=Cadillac Unveils the 2006 Cadillac DTS Presidential Limousine for George Bush's Inauguration|author=Automobile|accessdate=2011-04-02|date=April 2009|publisher=Automobile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shorter armoured DTS are also the [[Vice President of the United States]] cars in the USA at least since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhGSTOmCCNQ|title=The Vice Presidential Limousine - Chicago 10/12/10|first=|last=Better With A Drone|publisher=|accessdate=8 December 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modified DTS was also used by former [[Prime Minister of Canada]] [[Stephen Harper]].

==Next generation==
The next [[full-size car|full-size]] front-wheel drive [[Cadillac]] sedan was the [[Cadillac XTS|XTS]] which went on sale in June 2012 as a 2013 model.  A second full-size sedan, the rear-wheel drive [[Cadillac CT6|CT6]], was added to the lineup in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motorauthority.com/cadillac-replacing-dts-and-sts-with-single-model.html |title=Cadillac exec confirms sub-CTS model and STS/DTS replacement |author=Ralph Hanson |work=Motor Authority |date=2009-04-10 |accessdate=2009-07-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728063733/http://www.motorauthority.com/cadillac-replacing-dts-and-sts-with-single-model.html |archive-date=2009-07-28 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cadillac CTS''' is an [[executive car]] that was manufactured and marketed by [[General Motors]] from 2003 to 2019 across three generations. Historically, it was priced similar to cars on the [[Compact executive car|compact luxury]] spectrum; but it has always been sized closely to its mid-size rivals. The third generation competes directly with the mid-size luxury cars. Initially available only as a 4-door sedan on the [[GM Sigma platform]], GM had offered the second generation CTS in three body styles: 4-door sedan, 2-door coupe, and 5-door sport wagon also using the Sigma platform — and the third generation was offered only as a sedan, using a stretched version of the [[GM Alpha platform]].

The third-generation CTS's indirect successor is the smaller CT5, which, like the first- and second-generation CTS, takes on the BMW 3 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class, while maintaining its 5 Series/E-Class size.

[[Wayne Cherry]] and Kip Wasenko designed the exterior of the first generation CTS, marking the production debut of a [[design language]] (marketed as "Art and Science") first seen on the [[Cadillac Evoq|Evoq]] concept car. Bob Boniface and Robin Krieg designed the exterior of the third generation CTS.

Introduced in early 2002 as a 2003 model, the CTS sedan was built on GM's new [[rear-wheel drive]] [[GM Sigma platform|Sigma platform]] and sported a fully independent suspension. It was the first Cadillac to be offered with a [[manual transmission]] since the 1988 [[Cadillac Cimarron|Cimarron]]. The CTS was designed as a replacement for the [[Opel]]-based [[Cadillac Catera|Catera]]. [[Wayne Cherry]] and Kip Wasenko designed the exterior of the first generation CTS and this vehicle marked the production debut of the "Art and Science" [[design language]] first seen on the [[Cadillac Evoq|Evoq]] concept car.&lt;ref name=edmunds&gt;{{cite web|author= |date= |website=Edmunds.com |publisher=Edmunds |url=http://www.edmunds.com/cadillac/history.html |title=Cadillac History |accessdate=April 21, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403135013/http://www.edmunds.com/cadillac/history.html |archivedate=April 3, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  CTS vehicles are built at GM's [[Lansing Grand River Assembly]] in Lansing, Michigan.

Originally powered by a 3.2&amp;nbsp;L [[GM 54-Degree V6 engine|LA3]] [[V6]] producing {{Convert|220|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, the CTS received an updated 3.6&amp;nbsp;L [[DOHC]] [[V6]] with [[variable valve timing]] as an option in 2004, producing {{Convert|255|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|252|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The 3.2&amp;nbsp;L engine went out of production in 2005, when a new 2.8&amp;nbsp;L version of the [[DOHC]] V6 debuted in an entry-level version of the CTS. In Europe, the 2.8&amp;nbsp;L replaced the previous entry-level 2.6&amp;nbsp;L engine.

The CTS was originally offered with either GM's in-house five-speed [[GM 5L40-E transmission|5L40-E]] [[automatic transmission]] or a five-speed [[Getrag]] [[Getrag 260 transmission|260]] [[manual transmission]]. For the 2005 model year, the Getrag was replaced with an [[Aisin]] [[Aisin AY transmission|AY-6]] six-speed.

In 2004, GM introduced the CTS-V, a high performance version of the CTS intended to compete with luxury performance sedans like the BMW M3/M5, Audi S4/S6, and Mercedes-Benz C and E-class AMGs. The 2004 and 2005 CTS-Vs were equipped with the 5.7L LS6 V-8 ({{convert|400|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000&amp;nbsp;rpm, {{convert|395|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,800&amp;nbsp;rpm), a Tremec T56 6-speed manual transmission, 14+" rotors and Brembo 4-piston calipers front and rear, suspension upgrades (higher spring rates, stiffer anti-roll bars, two available damper packages), and subtle exterior changes. As the LS6 was phased out, the 2006 and 2007 CTS-Vs received the 6.0L LS2 V-8, which carried the same HP and torque ratings (with peak torque coming 400 rpm sooner).

A prototype first generation CTS station wagon was made but it was never put into production.

GM revealed the all-new 2008 CTS at the [[North American International Auto Show#2007|North American International Auto Show]] in January 2007. The 2008–2009 base model featured a 3.6 L LY7 V6 with {{Convert|263|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|253|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque carried over from the previous generation. A second engine, a new 3.6 L direct-injection V6 VVT engine with {{Convert|304|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|273|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque was also offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/cadillac/cts/2008/performance|title=2008 Cadillac CTS Performance Review|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. News &amp; World Report LP|access-date=December 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2010, the base engine changed to a 3.0L [[variable valve timing]] (VVT) V6 with {{Convert|270|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|224|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. A 6-speed manual transmission was standard equipment on the second generation CTS and GM's 6-speed Hydra-matic [[GM 6L50 transmission|6L50]] automatic transmission was available as an option on all variants. On-demand all-wheel drive was offered with both engines when equipped with an automatic transmission.&lt;ref name="hellwig2007"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hellwig |first=Ed |date=January 8, 2007 |title=Detroit Auto Show: 2008 Cadillac CTS |url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=119071 |website=Edmunds Inside Line |publisher=Edmunds |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318151630/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId%3D119071 |archivedate=March 18, 2008 |accessdate=April 12, 2009 |quote=Both transmissions will be offered with the high-output engine, along with another new option for 2008 — all-wheel drive. |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suspension, braking, and steering improvements from the previous generation CTS-V were designed into the new standard CTS.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The second generation CTS was wider and longer than the original, measuring {{Convert|191.6|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} long, {{Convert|72.5|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} wide and {{Convert|58|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} in height. Wheelbase remained unchanged at {{Convert|113.4|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=4}}, but with a wider front/rear track of 61.8 / 62.0&amp;nbsp;inches (1575 / 1585&amp;nbsp;mm), donated by the larger [[Cadillac STS|STS]]. Other changes included a revamped exterior, with a new, larger grille, slimmer headlights and taillights, side air extractor [[air vent|vents]] located forward of the front doors, and new nine-spoke 18-inch wheels, surrounding larger high-performance brake calipers and rotors. Available features on the second-gen CTS included a [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] 5.1 surround sound system, GM's [[Stabilitrak]] [[Electronic stability control|ESC]] system, a tire pressure monitoring system, a navigation system with real-time traffic and weather data, an integrated 40 [[Gigabyte|GB]] hard drive for music storage, swiveling headlights, and remote starting.

In 2008, the General Motors chose the CTS to re-launch the Cadillac brand in Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref name=porter2007&gt;{{cite news |last=Porter |first=Ian |date=December 4, 2007 |title=Caddie Revs Up for Australian Assault |url=http://business.theage.com.au/caddie-revs-up-for-australian-assault/20071203-1emm.html |url-status=dead |newspaper=The Age |publisher=Fairfax Media |location=Melbourne, Australia |at=Business Day |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925001639/http://www.theage.com.au/business/caddie-revs-up-for-australian-assault-20071203-1emm.html |archivedate=September 25, 2012 |accessdate=November 19, 2010 |quote=AUSTRALIA's crowded car market is about to expand further after General Motors announced plans to launch its famous Cadillac here late next year....Initially, the GM Premium Brands division will offer the Cadillac CTS four-door sedan... |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in early 2009, amidst the global financial crisis, a last-minute decision was made not to go ahead with the launch. As a result, a small batch of cars which had already been shipped to Australia were transferred to New Zealand and sold via selected [[GM Holden]] dealers. Owing to their popularity, some dealers sourced further UK market spec models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ebbett Cadillac NZ |url=http://www.ebbettcadillac.co.nz |website=ebbettcadillac.co.nz |accessdate=February 10, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2010 model year, the GM badges were dropped, although early 2010 models still had GM badges.
[[File:'12 Cadillac CTS Sedan (MIAS '12).jpg|thumb|left|2012 Cadillac CTS sedan]]
For the 2012 CTS, the front grille used higher quality materials to give a more vertical design, and the Cadillac logo was being subtly changed to give a more vibrant appearance. The biggest change was to the engine. Although kept the same 3.6-liter displacement, the [[V6]] was able to produce {{convert|323|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} while dropping weight thanks to some modified engine internals. For 2012, GM also offered some new technology and option packages with the Cadillac CTS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pimpo |first=Tony |date=April 19, 2011 |title=Cadillac Tweaks CTS Lineup for 2012 |url=http://www.automoblog.net/2011/04/19/cadillac-tweaks-cts-lineup-for-2012/ |website=Automoblog.net |publisher=Automoblog.net |accessdate=April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[North American International Auto Show#2008|2008 North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]], [[General Motors]] unveiled a [[coupe]] concept version of the CTS, alongside the new CTS-V performance sedan. The coupe's unveiling surprised the media and public, stealing a great deal of attention away from the CTS-V. In November 2009, the production version was unveiled in a press release. The coupe went into production in spring 2010 for sale in August 2010 as a 2011 model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=November 23, 2009 |title=2011 Cadillac CTS Coupe: New Sports Coupe Is Cadillac's Most Dramatic Design |url=http://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2009/Nov/1123_CTS_Coupe_CAD.html 
|publisher=General Motors |location=Los Angeles |accessdate=December 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the production model is very similar to the concept, with the B-pillars still removed. The standard engine was a 3.6L direct injected V6 rated at 304&amp;nbsp;hp. Like the sedan, both six-speed manual and automatic transmissions, in either RWD or AWD configurations, were available. A CTS-V Coupe was introduced, first shown at the 2010 North American International Auto Show in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Riches |first=Erin |url=http://blogs.insideline.com/straightline/2009/11/2011-cadillac-cts-v-coupe-will-debut-in-detroit.html |title=2011 Cadillac CTS-V Coupe Will Debut in Detroit |website=Blogs.insideline.com |date=November 19, 2009 |accessdate=December 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CTS Coupe was Cadillac's first coupe since the [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]], which was discontinued in 2002.  The CTS Coupe was discontinued after the 2014 model year, and the CTS-V Coupe discontinued after the 2015 model year.

=== Sport Wagon ===
[[File:2010 Cadillac CTS wagon rear -- 10-30-2009.jpg|thumb|left|2010 Cadillac CTS wagon]]
At the 2008 [[Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance]], Cadillac presented the 2010 CTS Sport Wagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.autoblog.com/2008/08/15/embargo-8-15-pebble-beach-2008-cadillac-unveils-2010-cts-v-spo/ |title=Monterey 2008: Cadillac unveils 2010 CTS Sport Wagon |date=August 15, 2008 |accessdate=August 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wagon became available in late 2009 as a 2010 model. A CTS-V version was added for 2011.

The CTS Sport Wagon is available in either [[rear-wheel-drive]] or [[all-wheel-drive]] layouts, and is powered by either a 3.0-liter [[DOHC]] V6 engine or a 3.6-liter V6 with [[variable valve timing]]. The 3.0-liter engine produces {{convert|270|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, and the 3.6-liter produces {{convert|304|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.automoblog.net/2009/05/27/caddy-rolls-out-all-new-srx-crossover-cts-sport-wagon/ |title=Cadillac Rolls Out All-New SRX Crossover &amp; CTS Sport Wagon |website=Automoblog.net|date=May 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The car is made for primarily the European market, where in some countries, wagons are preferred to sedans.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

With the third generation, Cadillac ceased production of the CTS wagon.

In 2008, ''Motor Trend'' named the CTS Car of the Year.

On March 26, 2013, Cadillac unveiled the third generation of the CTS. The 2014 CTS uses the 2.0L turbocharged I4 and 3.6L V6 from the ATS and also offers an all-new twin turbocharged V6 producing {{convert|420|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|430|lb.ft|N.m|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The twin turbocharged engine is only available in the CTS Vsport, a new trim that serves as a step between the 3.6L V6 and the high-performance CTS-V.&lt;ref name=ewing&gt;{{cite web|last=Ewing |first=Steven J. |date=March 26, 2013 |title=2014 Cadillac CTS Debuts New Design, Twin-Turbo Power, VSport Model [w/video] |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2013/03/26/2014-cadillac-cts-pictures-video-new-york-2013/ |url-status=live |website=Autoblog |publisher=AOL |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208142550/http://www.autoblog.com/2013/03/26/2014-cadillac-cts-pictures-video-new-york-2013/ |archivedate=December 8, 2013 |accessdate=December 7, 2013 |quote=On the powertrain front, we already told you about the brand-new twin-turbocharged 3.6-liter V6 that will make its debut in the 2014 CTS, pumping out 420 horsepower and 430 pound-feet of torque through a new eight-speed automatic transmission. |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
''Motor Trend'' named the third-generation CTS its [http://www.motortrend.com/oftheyear/car/1401_2014_motor_trend_car_of_the_year_cadillac_cts/ 2014 Car of the Year]. As customary with award winners, the magazine acquired a CTS (in Vsport trim) [http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/oneyear/sedans/1503_2014_cadillac_cts_vsport_review_verdict/?web=SIM:MT|WOT:MT|Reviews for a long-term test]. Its verdict lauded the car's driving dynamics and reliability but criticized its CUE multi-media interface.

In a four-way comparison in the December 2013 issue of ''Car and Driver'' the 2014 CTS 3.6 placed second overall. The article praised the handling of the CTS stating "[The CTS] is the only car in this group that didn't just put up with hard driving, it indeed goaded its driver to go faster." and praised the stopping ability, stiff structure and light weight of the car. The article criticized the engine for being "coarse in the upper ranges", the acceleration times, the fuel economy and the CUE entertainment system.&lt;ref name=pund2013&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pund |first=Daniel |date=December 2013 |title=Parlor Games: Comparo |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/2014-cadillac-cts-36-vs-audi-a6-bmw-535i-mercedes-e350-comparison-test-review |journal=Car and Driver |publisher=Hearst Communications |volume=59 |issue=6 |pages=58–59 |issn=0008-6002 |oclc=38224673 |accessdate=December 2, 2013 |quote=2014 Cadillac CTS 3.6 Second place}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sales concerns led Cadillac to offer rebates to the 2014 models and lower sticker prices on the 2015 models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20150107/RETAIL/150109928/cadillac-drops-price-on-cts-sedan-by-up-to-$3000|title=Cadillac drops price on CTS sedan by up to $3,000|publisher=autonews.com|date=January 7, 2015|accessdate=February 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Powertrains===
All engines available in the 2014 CTS are constructed from cast aluminum blocks and heads and use direct injection and variable valve timing.&lt;ref name=specs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.gm.com/content/media/us/en/cadillac/vehicles/cts_sport_sedan/2014.tab1.html |title=2014 Cadillac CTS Preliminary Specifications |author= |date=September 2013 |website=Cadillac News |publisher=General Motors |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233209/http://media.gm.com/content/media/us/en/cadillac/vehicles/cts_sport_sedan/2014.tab1.html |archivedate=December 2, 2013 |url-status=live |accessdate=September 28, 2013 |quote=Block material: cast aluminum |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2016 model year, the 6-speed 6L45 automatic transmission was replaced by the new 8-speed 8L45 automatic transmission, with the 8L45 also taking over duties with the naturally aspirated 3.6L V6 from the 8-speed Aisin TL-80SN automatic transmission.  V-Sport models will continue to use the 8-speed Aisin TL-80SN. A new 3.6L V6, the LGX, replaced the 3.6L V6 LFX.

The success of the CTS has been attributed in part to the car's placement in the 2003 sci-fi action film ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''.

====Chassis====
The first generation CTS-V is based on the same rear-wheel-drive [[GM Sigma platform]] as is the base model CTS. The use of a V8 engine required a unique engine cradle distinct from the base CTS V6.  Larger anti-roll bars and larger shocks were also added.  The spring rate was significantly increased.  The 2006-2007 update also included a stronger rear differential and [[half shaft]] design. Unique front and rear treatments also included mesh grilles over the front openings, a track-ready suspension, and 18×8.5&amp;nbsp;inch wheels inside of P245/45R18 Z-rated [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] Eagle F1 Supercar [[run-flat tire]]s. Brakes were {{Convert|13.97|in|mm|abbr=on}} rotors in the front, with {{Convert|14.37|in|mm|abbr=on}} rotors in the rear - each with four-piston [[Brembo]] calipers on the front and rear wheels.  In addition, GM badges were added on 2006 models. For performance enthusiasts, a high performance suspension package (RPO FG2) was available as a dealer installed option.

====Engine====
The [[Cadillac CTS|CTS sedan]] is enhanced with GM performance parts like a [[GM LS engine]] [[V8 engine|V8]] from the C5-generation [[Chevrolet Corvette]] Z06, as well as the Corvette Z06's six-speed [[Tremec]] [[manual transmission]] gear ratios. From 2004 and 2005, the CTS-V came with the 5.7&amp;nbsp;L pushrod [[OHV]] [[GM LS6 engine|LS6]] engine producing {{Convert|400|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|395|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,800&amp;nbsp;rpm. The {{convert|5|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} torque reduction of the CTS-V vs the LS6 used in the C5 Z06, was due to the exhaust manifold that needed to be used on the CTS-V.  From 2006 to 2007, the previous [[GM LS6 engine|LS6]] engine was superseded by the new 6.0&amp;nbsp;L OHV [[GM LS2 engine|LS2]] [[Internal combustion engine|engine]] as used in the base 2005 [[Chevrolet Corvette]]. The new LS2 engine was rated at the same {{Convert|400|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000&amp;nbsp;rpm with the peak torque of {{convert|395|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 4,400&amp;nbsp;rpm.  While both engines offer the same HP and torque specifications, the LS2's benefit was a wider torque band, due to the  higher displacement it offered.

====Transmission====
The only available transmission was the six-speed manual [[Borg-Warner T-56 transmission|Tremec T56]].  The transmission used the [[skip-shift]] feature to conserve fuel during light loads by preventing drivers from using the second and third gears, and a dual mass flywheel to reduce "rattle" in no load conditions.  The rear axle was a Getrag limited slip IRS unit with a 3.73:1 ratio.

====Performance====
General Motors states a 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph time of 4.6 seconds for the first generation CTS-V, with the quarter mile time estimated at 13.1 seconds at {{Convert|109|mph|0|abbr=on}}, onward to a stated top speed of {{Convert|163|mph|0|abbr=on}}. The 14 inch diameter Brembo brakes can slow the vehicle from 60&amp;nbsp;mph in 110 feet. The first generation CTS-V also posted a lap time of 8 minutes 19 seconds at Germany's famed Nürburgring Nordschleife, competitive with rivals such as the Mercedes-Benz E55 AMG, BMW M5, and Lexus IS-F.

====Chassis====
The second generation CTS-V is based on the new [[GM Sigma platform|GM Sigma II platform]].  The rear-wheel-drive platform is the basis for the 2008 to present Cadillac CTS base model with which the CTS-V shares most of the body work.  The suspension features coil springs front and rear.  The front suspension is a [[control arm]] arrangement while the rear is an independent [[multi-link suspension]].  To improve the handling and comfort, the 2009 CTS-V uses [[BeijingWest Industries|BWI Group's]] [[MagneRide]] technology. The dampers, filled with [[magnetorheological fluid]], are adjusted based on sensor readings that happen at 1&amp;nbsp;ms intervals.&lt;ref name=edmundstest1&gt;{{cite news |title=Performance Tested: 2009 Cadillac CTS-V Runs 12.5-Second Quarter-Mile |url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=131106 |date=August 25, 2008 |work=edmunds.com |accessdate=October 14, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912001753/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId%3D131106 |archivedate=September 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sedan has four-wheel disc brakes similar to the first generation.  The front brakes were increased in size to {{Convert|14.567|in|mm|abbr=on}} ventilated discs with six piston [[Brembo]] fixed calipers.  The rear brakes are {{Convert|14.37|in|mm|abbr=on}} ventilated rotors with four piston calipers.  Steering is speed-sensing hydraulic-assist rack-and-pinion.  The steering ratio is 16.1:1.  Tire sizes are 255/40ZR19 front and 285/35ZR19 rear on 19×9.0&amp;nbsp;inch and 19×9.5&amp;nbsp;inch wheels front and rear.

====Engine====
The powerplant in the 2009 CTS-V is a [[supercharged]] {{cvt|6162|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} [[LS based GM small-block engine#LSA|LSA V-8]], based on the [[LS based GM small-block engine#LS9|LS9 V-8]] from the [[Chevrolet Corvette C6 ZR1]].

The engine is produced in GM's [[Silao, Guanajuato]], Mexico engine assembly plant. The LSA engine has a [[Bore (engine)|bore]] x [[Stroke (engine)|stroke]] of {{convert|103.25x92|mm|3|abbr=on|order=flip}}.&lt;ref name=GMpress1/&gt; The [[engine block]] is cast aluminium 319-T5 alloy with cast iron [[cylinder liner]]s. The [[crankshaft]] is forged steel using powdered-metal [[connecting rod]]s. [[Piston]]s are high-silicon [[Hypereutectic piston|Hypereutectic]] Aluminium alloy replacing the forged aluminum used in the LS9 engine. The [[compression ratio]] is 9.1:1. The [[cylinder head]]s are based on the Corvette's LS3 head and are cast from type 356-T6 Aluminum alloy. The [[exhaust manifold]]s are cast iron. The supercharger is a twin four-lobe [[screw compressor]]-type unit [[Engine displacement|displacing]] {{cvt|1.9|L|CID|0|abbr=on}}. It is [[Eaton Corporation|Eaton's]] [[TVS Supercharger|Twin Vortices Series]] (TVS) generating a maximum boost of {{Convert|9.0|psi|kPa|1|abbr=on}}. [[Intake]] air is cooled with a water-to-air [[intercooler]] built directly into the supercharger unit.

====Transmissions====
There are manual and [[automatic transmission]] choices.  The manual is a Tremec TR-6060 six-speed transmission with a short-throw shifter, twin disk clutch and dual-mass flywheel. The [[GM 6L80 transmission|6L90]] automatic is a paddle shift conventional ([[planetary gearing]] and [[torque converter]]-based) automatic six-speed.&lt;ref name=caranddriverautoshows1&gt;{{cite news | last=Gall | first=Jared | title=2009 Cadillac CTS-V - Auto Shows | url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/hot_lists/car_shopping/what_s_new_for_2009_car_news/browse_by_model/2009_cadillac_cts_v_auto_shows |work=[[Car and Driver]] |date= |accessdate=October 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====CTS-V sedan====
[[File:Cadillac CTS-V (14022827875).jpg|thumb|left|Cadillac CTS-V sedan]]
Production of the CTS-V sedan began in the summer of 2008 in the [[Lansing, Michigan]] GM plant. Total production of the CTS-V for the 2009 model year was approximately 3,500 out of approximately 59,716 CTS model production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=General Motors Passenger Car Production |url= http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9MjE5MTZ8Q2hpbGRJRD0tMXxUeXBlPTM=&amp;t=1 |work=gm.com |date=October 17, 2008 |accessdate=December 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2009 CTS-V has a base price of US$59,995, and was available for purchase as of November 1, 2008.

Standard features include: leather seats, lateral acceleration gauge, 19-inch aluminum alloy wheels, Michelin Pilot Sport PS2 tires, a built-in 40GB hard drive to store music, and [[LED]] flash tracers to tell the driver when to shift.

Options include polished wheels, [[sunroof]], navigation system and, for the first time, Cadillac offers 14-way adjustable performance [[Recaro]] seats.

The official 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph (97 km/h) time for the second-generation CTS-V is 3.9 seconds, while the quarter mile is run at 12.0 seconds at {{convert|118|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Neff | first=John | title=2009 Cadillac CTS-V will officially make 556 horsepower | url=http://www.autoblog.com/2008/06/09/2009-cadillac-cts-v-will-officially-make-556-horsepower/ |work=autoblog.com |date=June 9, 2008 |accessdate=October 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These numbers were duplicated by ''Road and Track'' magazine (0-60 mph in 3.9 seconds for the automatic and 4.1 seconds for the manual).

Coinciding with the release of General Motors' Viability Plan, the automaker has disbanded its [[GM Performance Division|High Performance Vehicle Operations]] team, the crew responsible for the line V-series Cadillacs, the Chevrolet Cobalt SS, the HHR SS, and the V8 version of the Colorado. According to Vince Muniga, a spokesman for GM, "All high-performance projects are on indefinite hold. The engineers are moving into different areas of the organization, and they will work on Cadillacs, Buicks, Chevrolets and Pontiacs." Muniga went on to say that there are no plans for high-performance versions of upcoming plans, but once GM is in a better financial position, the team could be reinstated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lavrinc |first=Damon |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/02/18/breaking-gm-disbands-high-performance-vehicle-operations/ |title=BREAKING: GM disbands High Performance Vehicle Operations |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=February 18, 2009 |accessdate=May 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2010 model year, GM badges were dropped from near the doors, although earlier models still had the badges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detnews.com/article/20090825/AUTO01/908250320/1148/rss25 |title=GM to drop corporate logo from vehicles - Detroit News |publisher=The Detroit News |date= |accessdate=October 30, 2011}}{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====CTS-V Sport Wagon====
[[File:Cadillac CTSV Wagon (20583986271).jpg|thumb|Cadillac CTS-V Sportwagon]]

When asked in 2009 about the possibility of a CTS-V wagon, the GM Vice Chairman at that time, [[Bob Lutz (businessman)|Bob Lutz]], replied, "... should sufficient demand materialize, there is no reason why we couldn't do a V-Series wagon, and I would be standing in line for one, just ahead of you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lavrinc |first=Damon |date=July 13, 2009 |title=Lutz Confirms Cadillac CTS-V Coupe Is Coming, Sport Wagon...

===Reception===
''[[Motor Trend Magazine]]'' has run three comparison tests (see July/October, and August 6 (first gen) issues) involving first the CTS-V vs. the RS4, then vs. the [[BMW M5]] (July), and the [[Jaguar XF#XFR (2009–)|Jaguar XF-R]] (October), with the CTS-V winning against the M5 marginally and Jaguar but losing to the Audi. Another comparison, involving the [[Mercedes E63 AMG]], was set in January, the CTS-V lost to the E63 AMG on the basis of the E63 being more refined, sharper. Edmunds tested the 2009 CTS-V against the similarly priced Mercedes-Benz C63 and BMW M3 with the CTS-V winning in almost all (November 26, 2008).  ''Road and Track'' tested the 2009 CTS-V against the Jaguar XFR on June 10, 2009 with the Cadillac winning.  ''[[Car and Driver]]'' tested the 2009 CTS-V against the 2010 Jaguar XFR and 2010 Mercedes E63 AMG in November 2009 losing to the Mercedes. [[Top Gear (U.S. TV series)|''Top Gear'' (U.S.)]] track tested the 2011 CTS-V Coupe [[Top Gear (U.S. TV series)#Power Lap Times|(1:27.4)]] and 2011 CTS-V Wagon [[Top Gear (U.S. TV series)#Power Lap Times|(1:27.2)]] around their track with [[The Stig]] at the wheel, defeating sport cars like the [[Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG]] and the [[Lotus Evora]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Top Gear (U.S. TV series)#Power Lap Times|Top Gear Power Lap Times]]&lt;/ref&gt; with in the [[List of Top Gear (U.S.) episodes#Season 2|Season 2 episode 6]] titled "The $500 Challenge." The CTS-V Wagon also beat the [[Ferrari California]] in an informal drag race in the same episode. The CTS-V was recognized in all the comparison tests for being the most affordable car by several thousands of dollars against all the others high-performance cars.

===Awards===
The 2009 CTS-V was added to the ''[[Car and Driver]]'' 10 Best Cars list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/hot_lists/high_performance/best_worst_lists/2009_10best_cars_10best_cars+page-3.html |title=2009 10Best Cars - 10Best Cars/Best/Worst Lists/High Performance/Hot Lists/Reviews/Car and Driver |publisher=Car And Driver |date=March 23, 2008 |accessdate=May 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nürburgring record====
The CTS-V sedan achieved a [[Nürburgring lap times|lap time of 7:59.32]] at the [[Nürburgring Nordschleife]], which was the fastest documented time for a production sedan on factory tires, until the [[Porsche Panamera]] Turbo clocked a time of 7:56 in July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wot.motortrend.com/6558855/auto-news/porsche-panamera-laps-nurburgring-in-7-56-faster-than-cts-v/index.html |title=Porsche Panamera Laps Nurburgring in 7:56; Faster Than CTS-V - Wide Open Throttle - Motor Trend Magazine |publisher=Wot.motortrend.com |date=July 13, 2009 |accessdate=April 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autobloggmpress75932&gt;{{cite news |last=Nunez |first=Alex |title=Green Hellraiser: Caddy CTS-V storms Nordschleife in 7:59.32 | url=http://www.autoblog.com/2008/05/09/green-hellraiser-caddy-cts-v-storms-nordschleife-in-7-59-32/ |work=autoblog.com |date=May 9, 2008 |accessdate=October 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle was driven by [[John Heinricy]] during the attempt.

The '''Cadillac Brougham''' was a line of [[Luxury vehicle|luxury car]]s manufactured by the [[Cadillac|Cadillac Motor Car Division]] of [[General Motors]] from the 1987 through 1992 model years and was previously sold from 1977 to 1986 as the [[Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham]].  The optional "d'Elegance" trim package that was introduced during the Fleetwood era remained available. The model received a [[facelift (automotive)|facelift]] in 1990 and was replaced by an all-new [[Cadillac_Fleetwood#Rear-wheel_drive_1993–1996|Cadillac Fleetwood]] in 1993.  

==History==
Originally used for a single horse drawn enclosed carriage for 2-4 people, the “[[Brougham (carriage)|Brougham]]” owes its name to British statesman, [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]].&lt;ref name="cadillacdatabase.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadillacdatabase.net/Dbas_txt/Facta-c.htm |title=Cadillac Terms and Definitions A - C |publisher=Cadillacdatabase.net |year=1996 |accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cadillac]] first used the name in 1916 to designate an enclosed 5-7 passenger sedan body style.&lt;ref name="cadillacdatabase.net"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kimes 1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kimes|first=Beverly|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1805-1942|year=1996|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=0-87341-428-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunnell|first=John|title=Standard Catalog of Cadillac 1903-2005|year=2005|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=0873492897}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the thirties, the name was given to a formal body style with open chauffeur compartment and enclosed rear quarters, metal roof and often "razor-edged" styling.&lt;ref name="cadillacdatabase.net"/&gt; When Cadillac started offering [[Fleetwood Metal Body|Fleetwood]] bodies on some of its cars in 1925, the Brougham body style was Fleetwood bodied every year with the exception of 1926.&lt;ref name="Kimes 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2005"/&gt; After 1937 the Brougham name was not applied to any Cadillac for the remainder of the pre-World War II period.&lt;ref name="Kimes 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2005"/&gt;

The Brougham name would eventually reappear on the 1955 [[Cadillac Eldorado]] Brougham show car&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kowalke|first=Ron|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975|year=1997|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=0-87341-521-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/standardcatalogo00beve}}&lt;/ref&gt; which preceded the 4-door Eldorado Brougham hardtops of the 1957 to 1960 model years.&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; The 1957 [[Cadillac Series 70]] Eldorado Brougham joined the Sixty Special and the Series 75 as the only Cadillac models with Fleetwood bodies although Fleetwood script or crests did not appear anywhere on the exterior of the car,&lt;ref name="Bonsal2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonsall|first=Thomas|title=The Cadillac Story|year=2003|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0-8047-4942-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SIA1970"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Special Interest Autos|issue=2 |date=Nov–Dec 1970|title=Mark II Meets Eldorado Brougham}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so this would also mark the first time in 20 years that a Fleetwood bodied car was paired with the Brougham name.

After a five-year absence, the Brougham name reappeared as an option package on the 1965 [[Cadillac Sixty Special]].&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; The following year the Brougham moved up to becoming a subseries of the Fleetwood Sixty Special.&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; This continued through 1970.&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Starting in 1971 the Sixty Special was only available as the well equipped Fleetwood Sixty Special Brougham.&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; When the Sixty Special Series was retired in 1977, the [[Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham]] took its place as Cadillac's largest owner-driven sedan model through 1986.&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flammang|first=James|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1976-1999|year=1999|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=0-87341-755-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single name "Brougham" began to be used as specific Cadillac model in 1987, when the term "Fleetwood" was dropped from the former [[Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham|Fleetwood Brougham]].  It was otherwise the same as the 1986 model.  The reason for the change was that Cadillac had introduced a new, smaller, front-wheel drive model in 1985 and named it simply the [[Cadillac Fleetwood|Fleetwood]].  Compounding the confusion, the optional "d'Elegance" package (introduced in the upscale Fleetwood trim line in the 1970s, offering even more luxurious appointments, including button-tufted seating and rear-seat reading lamps), was available on and appended to the names of both models, resulting in a traditional [[body-on-frame]]/[[rear-wheel drive]] ''"Fleetwood Brougham d' Elegance"'' and a [[unibody]]/[[transverse engine]]d ''"Fleetwood d' Elegance"''.  The solution was dropping the term "Fleetwood" from the rear-wheel drive model, leaving just the "Brougham". Since it was body-on-frame, it was popular among coachbuilders who manufactured stretched [[limousine]]s, along with the similar but somewhat smaller [[Lincoln Town Car]], as well as traditional Cadillac buyers who preferred the familiar combination of exterior size, heft, and rear-wheel drive.&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; This was the last Cadillac to be produced without airbags.

[[File:257773 2030637598504 1021034280 2383948 6570269 o.jpg|thumb|1988 Cadillac Brougham]]
The 1987 Brougham was built at the [[Detroit Assembly|Clark Street Cadillac Assembly Plant]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], as the Fleetwood Brougham had been in 1985-86. Before the shift to the [[Arlington Assembly]] plant in [[Arlington, Texas]], some early model year 1988s were produced at Detroit Assembly in late 1987 and construction continued at Arlington through 1992. The 11th digit of the VIN indicates plant assembly. A "9" as the 11th digit indicates a Detroit Brougham; a "R" indicates an Arlington Brougham. Many of the Arlington assembled examples also had a state of Texas/GM Arlington decal on the rear side quarter glass.

VIN "9" Broughams were actually produced in 1987-1990 (and in 1986 as well), and, although rare, can be found as "[[Cadillac Commercial Chassis|commercial chassis]]" vehicles, and generally have a higher output [[Oldsmobile V8 engine|Oldsmobile 307 LG8 Engine]] and different transmissions (typically the TH400 three speed), depending on the use. Generally speaking, minor differences between 1987 and 1988 (VIN 9 and Y) can be found, such as carburetor assembly. While these cars all used [[Quadrajet|Rochester Quadrajet]] Electronic four-barrel carburetors, differences include an electronic (Detroit) versus vacuum (Arlington) Idle Load Compensator, as well as an electronic (Detroit) versus climactic (Arlington) choke system. The vin "9" engine is the high output version of the base LV2 307 vin code Y and shares most parts with it. The HO engine is the same engine that was used in the rear wheel drive Oldsmobile 442. While the engine was not powerful, it proved to be a reliable engine with proven, but dated, technology.

The Brougham wore a cross-hatch grille in 1987 and 1988 which was an identical re-cast of the 1981 grille. The Brougham received a new vertical-slat grille for 1989, which was equal to the 1982-86 with 3 horizontal sections. A 1990 facelift, the first one since 1980, was necessitated by a redesigned Town Car from rival Lincoln. For 1990, Brougham received a new digital dash cluster inside, and composite headlamps, contemporary taillamp lenses, flush bumper moldings, and an optional [[Chevrolet small-block engine#350|Chevrolet 350]] V8.  Additionally that year, door-mounted front seatbelts became standard in order to meet federal safety standards as no driver's side airbag was available. 

For 1991, the ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#307|LV2]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] was replaced by a ''[[Chevrolet small-block engine#305|Chevrolet]]'' [[fuel injection|FI]] V8 that produced {{convert|170|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, while the ''[[Chevrolet small-block engine#350|Chevrolet 350]]'' produced {{convert|185|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. The 1992 models received no major changes, as it was its final year. The fuel injected engines proved to be reliable contenders and provided a tremendous power improvement over the Oldsmobile 307 carbureted engines.

==="Premier Formal Vinyl Roof" option===
[[File:1985-1992 Cadillac Brougham.jpg|thumb|right|1988 Cadillac Brougham with Premier Roof option]]
In 1988, the "Premier Formal Vinyl Roof" option became available which gave the standard Brougham a very formal look.  Though costly at US$1,095, it altered the overall appearance greatly.  It included a vinyl covering of not only the entire roof of the car but also the B-pillar and the rear quarter window surround.  This option was available in 1988 and 1989.  For 1990, a variation of roof treatment became standard in conjunction with the model's restyling that year.

==Discontinuation==
The last Cadillac Brougham rolled off the assembly line on June 5, 1992. The Fleetwood name returned as a RWD model with a major redesign for 1993 (the FWD Fleetwood had been renamed Sixty Special that year) and Brougham again became an option package, as it had been in 1965.

The '''Cadillac Eldorado''' is a premium [[luxury car]] that was manufactured and marketed by [[Cadillac]] from 1952 to 2002 over twelve generations. Competitors and similar vehicles included the [[Lincoln Mark series|Continental Mark series]], [[Buick Riviera]], [[Oldsmobile Toronado]] and [[Imperial (automobile)|Chrysler's Imperial Coupe]].

The Eldorado was at or near the top of the Cadillac line. The original 1953 Eldorado convertible and the Eldorado Brougham models of 1957&amp;ndash;1960 had distinct bodyshells&lt;ref name=CCbrougham&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z11289/cadillac-eldorado-brougham-concept.aspx|last=McMullen|first=Jeremy|title=1956 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham Concept|publisher=Conceptcarz.com|accessdate=4 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were the most expensive models that Cadillac offered those years. The Eldorado was never less than second in price after the [[Cadillac Series 75]] limousine until 1966.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kowalke|first=Ron|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975|year=1997|publisher=Krause publications|isbn=0-87341-521-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/standardcatalogo00beve}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunnell|first=John|title=Standard Catalog of Cadillac 1903–2005|year=2005|publisher=Krause publications|isbn=0873492897}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1967 on, the Eldorado was built in high volumes on a unique two door [[personal luxury car]] platform.&lt;ref name=CCbrougham/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hemmings67&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hemmings.com/blog/2016/10/06/cadillacs-first-front-wheel-drive-production-car-the-1967-eldorado-turns-50/|title=Cadillac’s first front-wheel drive production car, the 1967 Eldorado, turns 50|last=Ernst|first=Kurt|date=6 October 2016|publisher=Hemmings Motor News|accessdate=4 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Eldorado carried the [[Cadillac Fleetwood|Fleetwood]] designation from 1965 through 1972, and was a modern revival of the pre-war [[Cadillac V-12]] and [[Cadillac V16 engine|Cadillac V16]] roadsters and convertibles.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

==Name==
The [[Car model|nameplate]] ''Eldorado'' is a contraction of two [[Spanish language|Spanish]] words that translate as "the gilded (i.e., golden) one" &amp;mdash; and also refers to [[El Dorado]], the mythical South American "Lost City of Gold" that fascinated Spanish [[conquistadors|explorers]].&lt;ref name="name"&gt;{{cite news

  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/10/travel/driving-the-eldorado-sips-its-last-tanker-of-gas.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chosen in an internal competition for a 1952 [[concept vehicle]] celebrating the company's [[golden anniversary]], the name ''Eldorado'' was proposed by Mary-Ann Marini (née Zukosky), a secretary in Cadillac's merchandising department&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;{{cite news
  | title = 1953 Cadillac Eldorado
  | publisher = Topspeed.com 
  | url = http://www.topspeed.com/cars/cadillac/1953-cadillac-eldorado-ar34062.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; and was subsequently adopted for a limited-edition convertible for model year 1953.

''Palm Springs Life'' magazine incorrectly attributes the name to the Eldorado Country Club in [[Indian Wells, California]], a favorite resort of [[General Motors]] executives in the [[Coachella Valley]] &amp;mdash; though the resort opened in 1957, five years after Cadillac's own naming competition.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Cadillac began using the nameplates "Eldorado Seville" and "Eldorado Biarritz" to distinguish between the [[hardtop]] and [[convertible (car)|convertible]] models (respectively) while both were offered, from 1956 through 1960 inclusively. The "Seville" name was dropped when the hardtop was initially discontinued (1961), but the Biarritz name continued through 1964. Beginning 1965, the Eldorado became the 'Fleetwood Eldorado'. 'Biarritz' returned as an up level trim package for the Eldorado for 1976. {{Clear}}

The [[Cadillac Series 62]] Eldorado joined the [[Oldsmobile 98]] Fiesta, Chevrolet Corvette and [[Buick Roadmaster]] [[Buick Skylark|Skylark]] as top-of-the-line, limited-production specialty convertibles introduced in 1953 by [[General Motors]] to promote its design leadership. A special-bodied, low-production convertible (532 units in total), it was the production version of the 1952 El Dorado "Golden Anniversary" [[concept car]].  Along with borrowing bumper bullets (aka [[dagmar bumpers|dagmars]]) from the 1951 [[Le Sabre concept car|GM Le Sabre]] show car,&lt;ref&gt;Flory,  J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1946-1959'' (Jefferson, NC:  McFarland &amp; Coy, 2008), p.1021.&lt;/ref&gt; it featured a full assortment of deluxe accessories and introduced the wraparound windshield&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/new/New-Brochures---July-2011/1953-Cadillac-Eldorado-Folder/1953-Cadillac-Eldorado-Folder-02-03 |title=1953 Cadillac Eldorado Folder-02-03 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a cut-down beltline to Cadillac standard production.

The expansive frontal glass and distinctive dip in the sheet metal at the bottom of the side windows (featured on one or both of GM's other 1953 specialty convertibles) were especially beloved by [[General Motors]]' styling chief [[Harley Earl]] and subsequently widely copied by other marques. Available in four unique colors (Aztec red, Alpine white, azure blue and artisan ochre &amp;mdash; the last is a yellow hue, although it was shown erroneously as black in the color folder issued on this rare model). Convertible tops were available in either black or white [[Acrylic fiber|Orlon]]. AC was an option,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Cadillac/1953-Cadillac/1953-Cadillac-Accessories-Booklet/1953-Cadillac-Accessories-03|title=1953 Cadillac Accessories-03|work=oldcarbrochures.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128113344/http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Cadillac/1953-Cadillac/1953-Cadillac-Accessories-Booklet/1953-Cadillac-Accessories-03|archivedate=2015-01-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as were wire wheels. The car carried no special badging other than a gold-colored "Eldorado" nameplate in the center of the dash. A hard tonneau cover, flush with the rear deck, hid the convertible top in the open car version.

Although technically a subseries of the [[Cadillac Series 62]] based on the regular Series 62 convertible, sharing its engine, it was nearly twice as expensive at US$7,750. The {{convert|220.8|in|mm}} long, {{convert|80.1|in|mm}} wide vehicle came with such standard features as windshield washers, a signal seeking radio, power windows, and a heater.&lt;ref name="Flory, Jr. 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Flory, Jr.|first=J.

In 1954, Eldorado lost its unique sheet metal and shared its basic body shell with standard Cadillacs. Distinguished now mainly by trim pieces, this allowed GM to lower the price and see a substantial increase in sales. The Eldorados had golden identifying crests centered directly behind the air-slot fenderbreaks and wide fluted beauty panels to decorate the lower rear bodysides. These panels were made of extruded aluminum and also appeared on a unique one of a kind Eldorado coupé built for the Reynolds Aluminum Corporation. Also included in the production Eldorado convertible were monogram plates on the doors, wire wheels, and custom interior trimmings with the Cadillac crest embossed on the seat bolsters. Two thousand one hundred and fifty Eldorados were sold, nearly four times as many as in 1953.

For 1955, the Eldorado's body gained its own rear end styling with high, slender, pointed [[Car tailfin|tailfins]].  These contrasted with the rather thick, bulbous fins which were common at the time and were an example of the Eldorado once again pointing the way forward. The Eldorado sport convertible featured extras such as wide chrome body belt moldings and twin round taillights halfway up the fenders. Sales nearly doubled to 3,950.

For 1956, a two-door hardtop [[coupé]] version appeared, called the '''Eldorado [[Cadillac Seville|Seville]]''' at which point the convertible was named the "Eldorado Biarritz". An Eldorado script finally appeared with fender crest on the car which was further distinguished by twin hood ornaments. An extra feature on the Eldorado convertible was a ribbed chrome saddle molding extending from the windshield to the rear window pillar along the beltline. With the addition of the Seville, sales rose yet again to 6,050 of which 2,150 were Sevilles. Eldorados accounted for nearly 4% of all Cadillacs sold.

Cadillac was restyled and re-engineered for 1957, with stylistic updates in 1958.

[[File:Cadillac De Ville 1957 2.jpg|thumb|left|1957 Cadillac Eldorado Seville]]

===1957===
1957 saw the Eldorado (in both Biarritz convertible and [[Cadillac Seville|Seville]] hardtop bodystyles) receive new styling with an exclusive rear-end design featuring a low, downswept fenderline capped by pointed in-board fins. Just behind the open rear wheel housings the lower rear quarters were trimmed with broad, sculptured stainless steel beauty panels that visually blended into the split rear wraparound bumper assemblies. A form of this unique rear-end treatment first appeared (sans fins) on the Cadillac "Interceptor" prototype from the immediate post-war era. [[Cadillac Series 62|Series 62]] Eldorados (as distinct from the [[Cadillac Series 70|Series 70]] Eldorado [[Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham|Brougham]]) were further distinguished by the model name above a V-shaped rear deck ornament and on the front fenders. The three section front bumper was shared with the rest of the redesigned Cadillac model line, as in previous years the Eldorados came with a long list of standard features. Four specially-built 4-door hardtop Eldorado Sevilles were also built in 1957.

[[File:Cadillac Eldorado Convertible 1958.jpg|thumb|left|1958 Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz]]

===1958===
For 1958, the car received quad headlights as the front clip was again shared with this years updated standard Cadillacs. GM was promoting their fiftieth year of production, and introduced Anniversary models for each brand; Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Chevrolet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmphotostore.com/1958-Chevrolet-Impala-50th-Anniversary-Art-Poster/productinfo/P8367/ Image of 50th Anniversary promotional photo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017224216/http://www.gmphotostore.com/1958-Chevrolet-Impala-50th-Anniversary-Art-Poster/productinfo/P8367/ |date=2015-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1958 models shared a common appearance on the top models for each brand; Cadillac Eldorado Seville, Buick Roadmaster Riviera, Oldsmobile Holiday 88, Pontiac Bonneville Catalina, and the all-new Chevrolet Bel-Air Impala.

This years revised front clip incorporated a new hood, a new front bumper with "dagmars" mounted lower and further apart combined with a full width jeweled grille. On the Biarritz and Seville, a V-shaped ornament and model identification script was asymmetrically mounted to the deck lid. Other styling updates included the addition of ten vertical chrome slashes ahead of the open rear wheel housings and crest medallions on the flank of the tailfins. The split rear bumper assemblies were each updated with a low-profile combined reverse light/grille unit that replaced the previous years separate, round exhaust exits and reverse lights; the round brake/tail light units at the base of the fins remained unchanged. The rear license plate housing was now flanked on each side by five vertical hash marks.

Announced in December 1956 and released around March 1957, the '''Series 70 Eldorado Brougham''' was a distinct, hand-built four door [[Luxury vehicle#Ultra-luxury|ultra-luxury]] vehicle, derived from the Park Avenue and [[Cadillac Orleans|Orleans]] show cars of 1953–54. Designed by Ed Glowacke, it featured the first appearance of quad headlights and totally unique trim. Like the later 1961 fourth-generation [[Lincoln Continental]], it had rear doors that were rear-hinged ([[suicide door]]s); unlike the Continental the Brougham was a true pillarless hardtop as the doors latched onto a stub pillar that did not extend beyond the beltline

It cost an astonishing $13,074—twice the price of any other 1957 Eldorado and more than competitors [[Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud]] and [[Continental Mark II]]. Sales were 400 in 1957 and 304 in 1958. 1958 was the last year for the domestic production of the handbuilt Brougham at Cadillac's Detroit factory, as future manufacturing of the special bodies was transferred to [[Pininfarina]] of [[Turin, Italy]].

The car featured a roof trimmed in brushed stainless and [[Self-levelling suspension|self leveling]] [[air suspension]]. The exterior ornamentation included wide, polished lower rear quarter beauty panels extending along the rocker sills and rectangularly sculptured side body "cove" highlighted with five horizontal windsplits on the rear doors. Tail styling treatments followed the Eldorado pattern. It also had the first automatic two-position "memory" [[power seat]]s, a dual four-barrel V-8, low-profile tires with thin white-walls, automatic trunk opener, cruise control, high-pressure cooling system, polarized sun visors, electric antenna, automatic-release parking brake, electric door locks and a dual heating system. Other unique features included an automatic starter with restart function, [[Automatic highbeam headlamp|Autronic Eye]], drum-type electric clock, power windows, forged aluminum wheels and [[automobile air conditioning|air conditioning]], six silver magnetic glovebox drink tumblers and finally, an Evans leather trimmed cigarette case and vanity kit containing a lipstick holder, ladies' powder puff with powder, comb, beveled mirror, coin holder, matching leather notebook, gold mechanical pencil, atomizer filled with Arpege Extrait De Lanvin perfume.&lt;ref name="Flory, Jr. 2008"/&gt; Buyers of Broughams had a choice of 44 full-leather interior and trim combinations and could select such items as [[Sheepskin|Mouton]], [[Karakul (sheep)|Karakul]] or lambskin carpeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1957_Cadillac/1957_Cadillac_Eldorado_Brougham_Press_Release/1957%20Cadillac%20Eldorado%20Brougham-02.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1957_Cadillac/1957_Cadillac_Eldorado_Brougham_Press_Release |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were serious difficulties with the air suspension, which proved troublesome in practice. Some owners found it cheaper to have it replaced with conventional coil springs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=the Auto Editors of Consumer Guide |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1950-1959-cadillac3.htm |title=HowStuffWorks "1957, 1958 Cadillac" |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=2007-03-13 |accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1957 Eldorado Brougham joined the Sixty Special and the Series 75 as the only Cadillac models with [[Cadillac Fleetwood|Fleetwood]] bodies although Fleetwood script or crests did not appear anywhere on the exterior of the car,&lt;ref name="Bonsal2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonsall|first=Thomas|title=The Cadillac Story|year=2003|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0-8047-4942-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SIA1970"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Special Interest Autos|issue=#2 Nov.–Dec. 1970|title=Mark II Meets Eldorado Brougham}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so this would also mark the first time in 20 years that a Fleetwood-bodied car was paired with the Brougham name.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;

The 1957-58 Eldorado Brougham also marked the return of the [[Cadillac Series 70]], if only briefly. [[File:Cadillac Eldoradio Brougham all-transistor car radio-1957 dash.JPG|thumb|left|Cadillac Eldoradio Brougham all-transistor car radio-1957 dash]]An all-transistor signal-seeking car radio was produced by GM's Delco Radio and was first available for the 1957 Eldorado Brougham models, which was standard equipment and used 13 transistors in its circuitry.&lt;ref name="GM Heritage Center"&gt;{{cite web|title=1957 &amp; 58 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham|url=http://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/1957_%26_58_Cadillac_Eldorado_Brougham|work=Generations of GM History|publisher=GM Heritage Center|accessdate=26 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309204448/http://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/1957_%26_58_Cadillac_Eldorado_Brougham#|archive-date=2012-03-09|url-status=dead|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1956 GM Year-End Annual Report, 1957 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham car model introduction announcement, pg 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Radio &amp; TV News'', August 1957, "Delco's All-Transistor Auto Radio", pg 60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Cadillac Serviceman'', Volume XXXI, No.4, April 1957 issue, Pg 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eldorado Brougham received minor changes for 1958. The interior upper door panels were finished in leather instead of the metal finish used in 1957. New wheel covers also appeared. Forty-four trim combinations were available, along with 15 special monotone paint colors.

[[File:Cad fins.jpg|thumb|left|1959 Cadillac "rocketship" taillights and flamboyant fins]]

===1959===
Along with the rest of the General Motors divisions, the bulky, originally proposed 1959 styling was abandoned in favor of a significantly lower, longer and wider theme as an overdue response to Virgil Exner's striking redesign of the 1957 Chrysler products. The 1959 Cadillac is remembered for its huge sharp tailfins with dual bullet tail lights, two distinctive rooflines and roof pillar configurations, new jewel-like grille patterns and matching deck lid beauty panels.

For 1959 the [[Cadillac Series 62|Series 62]] became the '''Series 6200'''. [[Cadillac De Ville|De Ville]]s and 2-door Eldorados were moved from the Series 62 to their own series, the '''Series 6300''' and '''Series 6400''' respectively, though they all, including the 4-door Eldorado [[Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham|Brougham]] (which was moved from the '''[[Cadillac Series 70|Series 70]]''' to '''Series 6900'''), shared the same {{convert|130|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase. New mechanical items were a "scientifically engineered" drainage system and new shock absorbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Cadillac/1959_Cadillac/1959_Cadillac_Comparison_Folder/1959-Cadillac-Comparison-Folder-04 |title=Comparison Folder |accessdate=2015-03-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114350/http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Cadillac/1959_Cadillac/1959_Cadillac_Comparison_Folder/1959-Cadillac-Comparison-Folder-04 |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All Eldorados were characterized by a three-deck, jeweled, rear grille insert that replicated the texture of the front grille; this front/rear grille treatment was shared with the Fleetwood Sixty Special and would continue through 1966 with textures being revised each year. The Seville and Biarritz models had the Eldorado name spelled out behind the front wheel opening and featured broad, full-length body sill highlights that curved over the rear fender profile and back along the upper beltline region. Engine output was an even 345&amp;nbsp;hp (257&amp;nbsp;kW) from the {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, back-up lamps, windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows, six way power seats, heater, fog lamps, remote control deck lid, radio and antenna with rear speaker, power vent windows, air suspension, electric door locks and license frames.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Cadillac/1959_Cadillac/1959_Cadillac_Brochure/1959-Cadillac-15 |title=1959 Cadillac 15 |accessdate=2015-03-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402131846/http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Cadillac/1959_Cadillac/1959_Cadillac_Brochure/1959-Cadillac-15 |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eldorado Brougham also came with Air conditioning, automatic headlight dimmer, acruise control standard over the Seville and Biarritz trim lines.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures.org"/&gt;

===1960===
[[File:1960 Cadillac Eldorado (6787873429).jpg|thumb|left|1960 Cadillac Eldorado]]
1960 Cadillacs resemble 1959 Cadillacs, but with smoother, more restrained styling.

General changes included a full-width grille, the elimination of pointed front bumper guards, increased restraint in the application of chrome trim, lower tailfins with oval shaped nacelles and front fender mounted directional indicator lamps. External variations on the Seville two-door hardtop and Biarritz convertible took the form of bright body sill highlights that extended across the lower edge of fender skirts and Eldorado lettering on the sides of the front fenders, just behind the headlamps. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual back-up lamps, windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows, six-way power seats, heater, fog lamps, Eldorado engine, remote control trunk lock, radio with antenna and rear speaker, power vent windows, air suspension, electric door locks, license frames, and five whitewall tires. Technical highlights were finned rear drums and an X-frame construction. Interiors were done in Chadwick cloth or optional Chambray cloth and leather combinations. The last Eldorado [[Cadillac Seville|Seville]] was built in 1960.

The 1960 Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz 6467E is featured as [[Maurice Minnifield]]'s vehicle in the 1990s television series ''[[Northern Exposure]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_108238-Cadillac-Eldorado-Biarritz-6467E-1960.html 1960 Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz &amp;#91;6467E&amp;#93;] at IMCDb (Internet Movie Car Database)&lt;/ref&gt;

===1959-60 Eldorado Brougham - made in Italy===
[[File:1959 Eldorado brougham.jpg|thumb|left|1959 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham, showing the more modest tail fin design to come to all Cadillacs in 1960]]
For 1959 and 1960, the Eldorado Brougham was updated along the same theme as the rest of the Cadillac model line - longer, lower and wider. Unlike the lesser Cadillacs the Brougham featured discreet, narrow taillights integrated into modest tailfins and an angular rear roof line with rear ventiplanes that contrasted sharply to the rounded roof lines and the somewhat baroque dual "rocketship" taillights/tall fins of the standard 1959 models. Front and rear bumper assemblies where shared with the standard Cadillacs.

Although designed in-house, body construction was contracted out to [[Pininfarina]] of Italy, with whom the Cadillac had a long-running relationship; this arrangement made sense for a unique, low-production model. While the Eldorado Broughams were the only Cadillacs that featured the caché of a hand-built Italian body the quality did not quite measure up to the Detroit-built 1957–1958 Broughams or current production line standards.

Priced at $13,075, the Brougham cost $1 more than their older siblings and did not sell as well as their forebears.

Ironically, only now did the Brougham acquire [[Cadillac Fleetwood|Fleetwood]] wheel discs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1957-1960-cadillac-eldorado-brougham5.htm |title=1957-1960 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham - page 5 |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and doorsill moldings,&lt;ref name="1957-1960Cadillac EldoradoPage6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1957-1960-cadillac-eldorado-brougham6.htm |title=1957-1960 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham - page 6 |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; presumably because the design work&lt;ref name="1957-1960Cadillac EldoradoPage6"/&gt; and final touches&lt;ref name="Bonsal2003"/&gt; were still being done by Fleetwood.

A vertical crest medallion with Brougham script plate appeared on the front fenders and a single, thin molding ran from the front to rear along the mid-sides of the body. The Brougham did not sport Eldorado front fender letters or Eldorado-specific body edge highlight trim. For 1960 new standard model bumpers were incorporated and a fin-like crest or "skeg" ran from behind the front wheel opening to the rear of the car on the lower bodysides with the crest medallions relocated to the trailing edge of the rear fenders. The Brougham's styling cues would prove to indicate where standard Cadillac styling would head from 1960 through the early-mid-1960s. The standard equipment list was pared down to match those of other Eldorados, plus Cruise Control, [[Automatic highbeam headlamp|Autronic Eye]], [[Automobile air conditioning|air conditioning]] and E-Z Eye glass.

The Eldorado Brougham was moved to its own unique Series 6900 from Series 70 for its remaining two years.

}}

===1961===
All Cadillacs were restyled and re-engineered for 1961. The Eldorado Biarritz convertible was technically reclassified as a subseries of the [[Cadillac De Ville|De Ville]] ('''Series 6300'''), a status it would keep through 1964. An Eldorado convertible would remain in the Cadillac line through 1966, but its differences from the rest of the line would be generally more modest. The new convex jewelled grille slanted back towards both the bumper and the hood lip, along the horizontal plane, and sat between dual headlamps. New rear-slanting front pillars with a reverse-curved base as first used on the 1959-60 Broughams with a somewhat less expansive windshield was incorporated. The Eldorado Biarritz featured front series designation scripts and a lower body "skeg" trimmed with a thin three quarter length spear molding running from behind the front wheel opening to the rear of the car. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual back up lights, windshield washer, dual speed wipers, wheel discs, plain fender skirts, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows, 6-way power bench seat or bucket seats, power vent windows, whitewall tires, and remote control trunk lock. Rubber-isolated front and rear coil springs replaced the trouble prone air suspension system. Four-barrel induction systems were now the sole power choice and dual exhaust were no longer available. With the [[Cadillac Seville|Seville]] and [[Cadillac Brougham|Brougham]] gone sales fell to 1,450.

===1962===
A mild facelift characterized Cadillac styling trends for 1962. A flatter, upright grille with a thicker horizontal center bar and more delicate cross-hatched insert appeared. Ribbed chrome trim panel, seen ahead of the front wheel housings in 1961, were now replaced with cornering lamps and front fender model and series identification badges were eliminated. More massive front bumper end pieces appeared and housed rectangular parking lamps. At the rear tail lamps were now housed in vertically-oriented rectangular nacelles designed with an angled peak at the center. A vertically ribbed rear beauty panel replicating the grille treatment appeared on the deck lid latch panel. Cadillac script also appeared on the lower left side of the grille. Standard equipment included all of last year's equipment plus remote controlled outside rearview mirror, heater and defroster and front cornering lamps. Cadillac refined the ride and quietness, with more insulation in the floor and behind the firewall.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p.147.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1963===
In 1963, the Eldorado Biarritz joined the [[Cadillac Sixty Special]] and the [[Cadillac Series 70|Cadillac Series 75]] as the only Cadillac models with [[Cadillac Fleetwood|Fleetwood]] bodies, thus acquiring the Fleetwood wreath and crest on its rear quarters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.car-nection.com/yann/Dbas_txt/Phocad63.htm |title=Cadillac photos - 1963 |publisher=Car-nection.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926223203/http://www.car-nection.com/yann/Dbas_txt/Phocad63.htm |archivedate=2011-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fleetwood rocker panel moldings.&lt;ref name="Bonsal2003"/&gt; The 1963 Eldorado was also the first Fleetwood bodied convertible since the Cadillac Series 75 stopped offering four- and two-door convertible body styles and production of the [[Cadillac V-16|Cadillac Series 90]] (V16) ceased in 1941.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kimes1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kimes|first=Beverly|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1805-1942|year=1996|publisher=Krause publications|isbn=0-87341-428-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In overall terms the 1963 Cadillac was essentially the same as the previous year. The completely redesigned body imparted a bolder and more angular look. The front fenders projected 4.625&amp;nbsp;inches further forward than in 1962 while the tailfins were trimmed down somewhat to provide a lower profile. Body side sculpturing was entirely eliminated in favor of smooth, flatter slab sides. The slightly V-shaped radiator grille was taller and now incorporated outer extensions that swept below the dual headlamps and housed small circular front parking lamps. The Eldorado also had a rectangular front and rear grille pattern that it again shared with the Fleetwood Sixty Special. A total of 143 options including bucket seats with wool, leather or nylon upholstery fabrics and wood veneer facings on dash, doors and seatbacks, set an all-time record for interior appointment choices. Standard equipment was the same as the previous year. The engine was entirely changed, though the displacement and output remained the same, {{convert|390|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|325|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p.211.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1964 Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz Convertible type 6367.jpg|thumb|left|1964 Eldorado Biarritz Convertible]]

===1964===
The Eldorado received a minor facelift for 1964. The main visual cue indicating an Eldorado Biarritz rather than a De Ville convertible was simply the lack of [[fender skirts]]. New up front was a bi-angular grille that formed a V-shape along both its vertical and horizontal planes bisected by a central body-colored horizontal bar. Outer grille extension panels again housed the parking and cornering lamps. It was the 17th consecutive year for the Cadillac tailfins with a new fine-blade design carrying on the tradition. Performance improvements including a larger 429 cubic inch V8 engine were the dominant changes for the model run. Equipment features were same as in 1963 for the most part. Comfort Control, a completely automatic heating and air conditioning system controlled by a dial thermostat on the instrument panel, was introduced as an industry first. The engine was bumped to {{convert|429|cid|l|0|abbr=on}}, with 340&amp;nbsp;hp (253.5&amp;nbsp;kW) available. Performance gains from the new engine showed best in the lower range, at {{convert|20|to|50|mph|km/h|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} traffic driving speeds. A new technical feature was the Turbo-Hydramatic transmission, also used in the De Ville and the Sixty Special.  Series 62, 75. and the Commercial Chassis continued with the old Hydra-Matic until 1965.

Standard Catalogue of American Cars 1946-1975, 4th Edition, page 130&lt;/ref&gt; It was consequently marketed as the Cadillac Fleetwood Eldorado, in a similar fashion to the [[Cadillac Series 75|Cadillac Fleetwood Series 75]] and the [[Cadillac Sixty Special|Cadillac Fleetwood Sixty Special]].&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1965_Cadillac/1965_Cadillac_Brochure_1/1965%20Cadillac-18-19.html 1965 Cadillac sales brochure, page 18] Retrieved on 7 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Biarritz nomenclature was finally dropped from sales literature, probably because there was no need to distinguish the convertible from the long defunct Eldorado [[Cadillac Seville|Seville]] and [[Cadillac Brougham|Brougham]] (The Biarritz nameplate would be revived in 1976 as a trim option for the Eldorado coupe). This was the last generation Eldorado to be equipped with rear wheel drive.

The redesigned Eldorado still rode on the same {{convert|129.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase. The elevated tailfins were removed, with fins planed flat, and sharp, distinct body lines replaced the rounded look. Also new were a straight rear bumper and vertical lamp clusters. The headlight pairs switched from horizontal to vertical, thus permitting a wider grille. Curved frameless side windows appeared with a tempered glass backlight. New standard features included lamps for luggage and glove compartments and front and rear safety belts. Power was still supplied by the 340 horsepower {{convert|429|CID|cc|abbr=on}} V8. Perimeter frame construction allowed repositioning the engine six inches forward in the frame, thus lowering the transmission hump and increasing interior room.

In 1966, changes included a somewhat coarser mesh for the radiator grille insert, which was now divided by a thick, bright metal horizontal center bar housing rectangular parking lamps at the outer ends. Separate rectangular side marker lamps replaced the integral grille extension designs. There was generally less chrome on all Cadillac models this year. Cadillac "firsts" this season included variable ratio power steering and optional front seats with carbon cloth heating pads built into the cushions and seatbacks. Comfort and convenience innovations were headrests, reclining seats and an AM/FM stereo system. Automatic level control was available. Engineering improvements made to the perimeter frame increased ride and handling ease. Newly designed piston and oil rings and a new engine mounting system and patented quiet exhaust were used.

The Eldorado was radically redesigned in 1967, becoming the brand's first entry to capitalize on the era's burgeoning [[personal luxury car]] market.&lt;ref name=Hemmings67/&gt; Promoted as a "personal" Cadillac, it shared the [[GM E platform|E-body]] with the second-generation [[Buick_Riviera#Second_generation_(1966–1970)|Buick Riviera]] and the [[Oldsmobile_Toronado#First_generation_(1966–1970)|first-generation Oldsmobile Toronado]], which had been introduced the previous year.&lt;ref name=Hemmings67/&gt; To enhance its distinctiveness, Cadillac adopted the Toronado's [[front-wheel drive]] '''Unified Powerplant Package''', adapted to a standard [[Cadillac V8 engine|Cadillac 429 V8]] coupled to a [[Turbo-Hydramatic 425]] [[automatic transmission]]. Based on the Turbo-Hydramatic 400, the THM425 placed the [[torque converter]] next to the [[epicyclic gearing|planetary gearbox]], which it drove through a metal, motorcycle-style [[roller chain]].&lt;ref name=Hemmings67/&gt; [[Disc brake]]s were optional, and new standard safety equipment included an energy absorbing steering column and generously padded instrument panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1967_Cadillac/1967_Cadillac_Brochure/1967%20Cadillac-22.html|title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1967_Cadillac/1967_Cadillac_Brochure|work=oldcarbrochures.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Unified Powerplant Package''' was later shared with the [[GMC Motorhome]] starting in 1972.

The 1967 Eldorado was a great departure from previous generations, which shared styling with Cadillac's [[Cadillac De Ville|De Ville]] and [[Cadillac Series 62|Series 62]], the exceptions being the rare 1953 model, and the even more rare 1957-60 Eldorado Brougham.&lt;ref name=CCbrougham/&gt; The front drive Eldorado's crisp styling, initiated by GM styling chief [[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]], was distinctive and unique, more angular than the streamlined Riviera and Toronado. The rear end was inspired by the [[GM-X Stiletto]] concept car.&lt;ref name="klassiker"&gt;{{cite news |title=I framtidens studio 1964 |url=http://www.klassiker.nu/reportage/i-framtidens-studio-1964 |accessdate=18 June 2019 |work=Klassiker |date=12 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the only production Cadillac to be equipped with concealed headlights behind vacuum operated doors.&lt;ref name=CCbrougham/&gt;

[[File:Lars Jacob's 1970 Cadillac Eldorado 1983.jpg|thumb|left|1970 Cadillac Eldorado (front)]]

Performance was 0&amp;ndash;60&amp;nbsp;mph (0&amp;ndash;97&amp;nbsp;km/h) in less than nine seconds and a top speed of 120&amp;nbsp;mph (192&amp;nbsp;km/h). Roadability and handling were highly praised by contemporaneous reviews, and sales were excellent despite high list prices. Its sales of 17,930 units,&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p.501.&lt;/ref&gt; nearly three times the previous Eldorado high, helped give Cadillac its best year ever.&lt;ref&gt;Ludvigsen, p. 297. He also says "over 200,000 built"; Flory, pp. 500-502, counts only 197,667, albeit not including small numbers of coachbuilt cars.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the Eldorado received Cadillac's new {{convert|375|hp|kW|abbr=on}} (SAE gross) {{convert|472|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, and [[disc brake]]s became standard.  Only slight exterior changes were made to comply with new federal safety legislation. Sales set another record at 24,528, with Eldorados accounting for nearly 11% of all Cadillacs sold.

In 1969 hidden headlamps were eliminated, a halo [[vinyl roof]] was available as an option, as was a rim-blow steering wheel - the only year Cadillac offered it.

In 1970 the Eldorado introduced the new {{convert|500|cid|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine,&lt;ref name=CCbrougham/&gt; Cadillac's largest-ever production V8, rated SAE gross {{convert|400|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|550|lb.ft|N.m|0|abbr=on}}, which would remain exclusive until it became standard on all full size Cadillacs in the 1975 [[model year]].  A power sunroof became an available option.

The 1971 Eldorado was substantially redesigned, growing two inches in length, six in wheelbase and featuring standard [[fender skirts]], all of which gave the car a much heavier appearance than the previous year. An Eldorado convertible model was available for the first time since 1966. Door glass remained frameless, and the hardtop rear quarter windows were deleted, replaced by a fixed "[[opera window]]" in the widened "C" pillar.
Inside, there was a new curved instrument panel and redesigned seat configurations. A fiber-optic "lamp monitor" system, which displayed the functionality of the headlamps, parking lamps, taillamps, brakelights and turn signals was mounted on each front fender and the shelf below the rear window. This {{convert|126.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase version Eldorado would run through 1978, receiving major facelifts in 1973, 1974 and 1975. Sales in 1971 set a new record at 27,368.

In 1972, sales rose to 40,074.

In 1973, the Eldorado was removed from the [[Cadillac Fleetwood|Fleetwood]] series and reestablished as its own series.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="John Gunnell 1975, page 130"/&gt; The 1973 models received a major facelift, featuring a massive egg-crate grille, new front and rear bumpers, decklid, rear fenders and taillamps. Interiors featured new "soft pillow" door panels, with larger, sturdier pull-straps. The rear "lamp monitor" display which showed the driver the function of the turn signal, brake and taillamps, was relocated (except on the convertible) from the rear shelf, to the headliner just above the rear glass.

The Cadillac Eldorado was chosen as the official pace car for the [[Indianapolis 500]] in 1973. Cadillac produced 566 of these special pace car convertibles. Thirty-three were used at the track during the race week, with the remainder distributed to U.S. Cadillac dealers one per dealership. Total sales soared to 51,451, over a sixth of all Cadillac sales.

Performance was not competitive with contemporary premium [[personal luxury car]]s, but the Eldorado did have the unusual feature seating for six adults.

1974 Eldorados featured a redesigned rear bumper with vertical ends, housing sidemarker lamps. This new bumper was designed to meet the new [[Bumper (automobile)#Zero-damage standards 1976|5 mile impact federal design regulation]]. Other styling changes included new horizontal taillamps placed beneath the trunk lid, a new fine mesh grille with Cadillac script on the header and new standard wheel covers. Inside, there was a new, quartz controlled digital clock, and a redesigned instrument panel, marketed in sales literature as "space age" and shared with all 1974 Cadillacs.

For 1975, the Eldorado was given rectangular headlamps, a new egg-crate grille, full rear wheel openings sans [[fender skirts]] and sharper lines, all of which resulted in a much sleeker appearance, reminiscent of the 1967–70 models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ateupwithmotor.com/model-histories/cadillac-eldorado-convertible-1971-1976/ |title=Last Time Around: The 1971–1976 Cadillac Eldorado Convertible &gt; |publisher=Ate Up With Motor |date=2008-04-08 |accessdate=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1976 was to be the final year for the Eldorado convertible and the car was heavily promoted by General Motors as "the last American convertible". Some 14,000 would be sold, many purchased as investments. The final 200 convertibles were designated as "Bicentennial Edition" commemorating America's 200th birthday. All 200 of these cars were identical, painted white with a dual red/blue pinstripe along the upper bodyside and inside, a commemorative plaque was mounted on the dashboard. When Cadillac reintroduced the Eldorado convertible for the 1984 model year, several customers who had purchased 1976 Eldorado convertibles as investments, felt they had been deceived and launched an unsuccessful class action lawsuit against General Motors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=the Auto Editors of Consumer Guide |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1982-1985-cadillac-eldorado-convertible-and-touring-coupe.htm |title=HowStuffWorks "1982-1985 Cadillac Eldorado Convertible &amp; Touring Coupe" |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=2007-07-12 |accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Having received a major facelift the previous year, the Eldorado for 1976 received only minor styling changes, including a new grille, a small Cadillac script on the hood face, revised taillamp lenses and new black painted wheel covers.

For 1977, the Eldorado received a new grille with a finer crosshatch pattern. New vertical taillamps were relocated to the bumper-fender extensions. New 'Eldorado' block-lettering appeared on the hood face and new rectangular side marker lights with 'Eldorado' block-lettering replaced the 'Eldorado' script on the rear fenders. The convertible was dropped (although Custom Coach of Lima, Ohio converted a few new 1977 and 1978s Eldorados into coach convertibles using salvaged parts from earlier models). The mammoth 500 cu in. (8.2L) V8 of 1970–76 gave way to a new 425 cu in. (7L) V8 with {{convert|180|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. For the first time in 1977, all GM E-body cars were front-wheel drive, as the Riviera underwent a two-year hiatus before joining them in 1979.

A new grille was the only major change for 1978; the Eldorado would be completely redesigned and downsized for 1979.

===''Eldorado Biarritz''===
Unlike the [[Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham]] and [[Cadillac Sedan de Ville|De Ville]],  which both boasted the opulent ''d'Elegance'' [[Trim level|luxury package]], Eldorado did not offer a similar plush option. This was rectified late in the 1976 model year with the '''''Biarritz''''' (a name last used for the 1964 Eldorado convertible) package. The car featured unique exterior trim and the rear half of the cabriolet roof was covered with a heavily padded landau vinyl top accented with large "opera" lights. Body colored wheel covers were also featured.  The 1977–1978 interior featured "pillowed"-style, "tufted" leather seating, while the 1976 interior did not.  As with other Cadillac models, special order contrasting upholstery piping and exterior colors were available.

The 1978 ''Biarritz'' option packages consisted of the Eldorado Custom ''Biarritz'' ($1,865.00); w/Astroroof ($2,946.00); w/Sunroof ($2,746.00) and Eldorado Custom ''Biarritz'' Classic ($2,466.00); w/Astroroof ($3,547.00); w/Sunroof ($3,347.00).

2000 Eldorado Custom ''Biarritz'' Classics were produced for 1978 only, in Two-Tone Arizona Beige/Demitasse Brown consisting of 1,499 with no Astroroofs or no Sunroofs; 475 with Astroroofs; 25 with Sunroofs and one (1) was produced with a Power Sliding T-Top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://automotivemileposts.com/eldorado/eldorado1978biarritzclassic.html |title=1978 Cadillac Fleetwood Eldorado Custom Biarritz Classic |publisher=Automotivemileposts.com |date=1978-04-11 |accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only nine of the latter are known to have been retrofitted by the American Sunroof Company under the direction of General Motors' Cadillac Motor Car Division.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The ''Biarritz'' option was available on the Eldorado through the 1991 model year and was replaced with the "Touring Coupe" (ETC)  option for 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/NA/Cadillac/1992-Cadillac/1992-Cadillac-Full-Line-Prestige-Brochure/1992-Cadillac-Full-Line-Prestige-31 |title=1992 Cadillac Full Line Prestige-31 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.org |date= |accessdate=2018-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180723034049/http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/NA/Cadillac/1992-Cadillac/1992-Cadillac-Full-Line-Prestige-Brochure/1992-Cadillac-Full-Line-Prestige-31 |archive-date=2018-07-23 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the original ''Biarritz'' styling cues vanished after 1985, such as the brushed stainless steel roofing (1979–85) and the plush "pillowed" interior seating designs, but the ''Biarritz'' remained unique just the same.

Cadillac introduced the tenth generation Eldorado in 1979, largely as a [[rebadging|rebadged]] variant of the Buick Riviera and Oldsmobile Toronado. A smaller, more fuel efficient 350 ci (5.7 L) V8 replaced the  425 ci (7.0 L) engine from the previous year.    A diesel 350 was available as an option.

[[File:'80 Cadillac Eldorado (Cruisin' At The Boardwalk '10).jpg|thumb|left|1980 Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz]]
In 1980, the gas 350 was replaced with the 368 except in California, where the Oldsmobile 350 was used. In both the 1980 Eldorado and Seville (which now shared frames) the 368s came with DEFI (later known as throttle body injection when it was later used with other GM corporate engines), whereas in the larger rear drive Cadillacs it came only with a 4-barrel Quadrajet carburetor. [[Independent suspension|Independent rear suspension]] was adopted, helping retain rear-seat and trunk room in the smaller body. The most notable styling touch was an extreme notchback roofline. The Eldorado ''Biarritz'' model featured a unique stainless-steel roof, similar to the 1957–1958 Eldorado Brougham. The Eldorado featured frameless door glass, and rear quarter windows, similar to those from 1967-70, without a thick "B" pillar. The cars were not true hardtops, as the rear quarter windows were fixed. Sales set a new record at 67,436.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

For 1981, the Eldorado was powered by Cadillac's [[Cadillac V8-6-4 engine|V8-6-4]] [[variable displacement]] variant of the 368 engine, which was designed to deactivate two or four  cylinders when full power was not needed, helping meet GM's [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy|government fuel economy ("CAFE") averages]]. It was a reduced bore version of the 1968 model-year 472, sharing that engine's stroke and also that of the model-year 1977–1979 425. The engine itself was extremely reliable and durable, but its complex electronics were the source of customer complaints.

1981 was the first year full electronic "digital" instrumentation was an available option on the Eldorado and Seville. In addition to the digital electronic climate control that was standard on all Cadillacs, the standard analog speedometer and fuel gauges could be replaced with digital displays with features displaying gallons of remaining fuel and approximate range.

For 1982, Cadillac unveiled the 4.1 L [[Cadillac High Technology engine#HT-4100|HT-4100]]. This engine, used in all full-size 1982 Cadillacs (except limousines) was an in-house design that mated cast-iron heads to an aluminum block. Many HT-4100s were replaced under warranty because it was prone to failure of the intake manifold gasket due to scrubbing of the bi-metal interface, aluminum oil pump failure, cam bearing displacement, weak aluminum block castings and bolts pulling the aluminum threads from the block. .{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

[[File:1984-85 Eldorado Convertible.jpg|thumb|left|1984–1985 Cadillac Eldorado convertible]]

From 1982 through 1985, Cadillac offered the 'Eldorado Touring Coupe', with heavier duty 'Touring' suspension, aluminum alloy wheels, larger blackwall white-letter tires, cloisonné hood ornament, body-colored headlamp and taillamp bezels, wide-ribbed rocker moldings and available only with saddle leather interior and three exterior colors. These Eldorados were marketed as 'driver's cars' and included reclining front bucket seats with lumbar support, leather wrapped steering wheel, a center console and standard digital instrument cluster.

In 1984, Cadillac also introduced a convertible version of Eldorado Biarritz. It was 200 pounds (91&amp;nbsp;kg) heavier featuring the same interior as other Biarritz versions. The model year of 1985 was the last year for the ASC, Inc., aftermarket conversion Eldorado convertible. Total sales set an all-time record of 77,806, accounting for about 26% of all Cadillacs sold.

Prior to the 'official' 1984 and 1985 Eldorado convertibles marketed by Cadillac, some 1979–1983 Eldorados were made into coach convertibles by independent coachbuilders e.g. American Sunroof Corporation, Custom Coach (Lima, Ohio—this coachbuilder turned a few 1977 and 1978 Eldorados into convertibles), Hess &amp; Eisenhardt.  The same coachbuilders also converted the Oldsmobile Toronado and Buick Riviera into a ragtop.

Late in the 1985 model year, an optional 'Commemorative Edition' package was announced, in honor of the last year of production for this version of the Eldorado. Exclusive features included gold-tone script and tail-lamp emblems, specific sail panel badges, gold-background wheel center caps, and a "Commemorative Edition" badge on the steering wheel horn pad. Leather upholstery (available in Dark Blue or White, or a two-tone with Dark Blue and White) was included in the package, along with a Dark Blue dashboard and carpeting. Exterior colors were Cotillion White or Commodore Blue.

The Eldorado was downsized again in 1986, losing about 16" in length and 350 pounds in weight and once again sharing a platform with the [[Oldsmobile Toronado]] and [[Buick Riviera]], as well as Eldorado's four-door companion, the [[Cadillac Seville]]. The coupés from Buick and Oldsmobile both used Buick's 3.8 liter V6 engine, while Cadillac continued to use their exclusive 4.1 liter V8. The convertible bodystyle ceded to the [[Cadillac Allanté]] roadster.  The ninth generation Eldorado carried a base price of $24,251 which was nearly 16% higher than the 1985 model.

Despite its smaller exterior size, the Eldorado's interior volume remained comparable to the previous generation model as well as Lincoln's [[Lincoln Mark VII|Mark VII]].  For the first time, the Eldorado abandoned its "hardtop" heritage and featured framed door glass.  News reports later indicated that GM had been led astray by a consultant's prediction that gasoline would be at $3 per gallon in the U.S. by 1986, and that smaller luxury cars would be in demand.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} In fact, gasoline prices were less than half that. With a sales drop of 60%, seldom has any car model experienced a more precipitous fall. Production was only about a fourth of what it had been just two years earlier.

Aside from a longer, 5 year/50,000 mile warranty, Eldorado was virtually unchanged for 1987. A slight price drop, to $23,740, did not raise sales, as only 17,775 were made this year compared to 21,342 for 1986. The standard suspension, with new taller 75 series (previously 70) tires and hydro-elastic engine mounts, was slightly retuned for a softer ride, while the optional ($155) '''Touring Suspension''', with deflected-disc strut valves and 15" alloy wheels, remained for those desiring a firmer ride. As part of a federal requirement to discourage "chop-shop" thieves, major body panels were etched with the [[VIN]]. Also new, a combination cashmere cloth with leather upholstery, and locking inertia seat belt reels for rear seat passengers, which allowed for child-seat installation in the outboard seating positions in back. The formal cabriolet roof was added this year. Available for $495 on the base Eldorado, it featured a padded covering over the rear half of the roof, and turned the rear side glass into smaller opera windows. One of Eldorado's most expensive singular options was the [[Motorola]] cellular telephone mounted inside the locking center arm rest. Priced at $2,850, it had been reworked this year for easier operation, and featured a hidden microphone mounted between the sun visors for hands-free operation. Additionally, the telephone featured a clever radio mute control: activated when the telephone and radio were in use at the same time, it automatically decreased the rear speaker's audio volume, and over-rode the front music speakers to be used for the hands-free telephone. On an interesting note, the rectangular marker lamp, located on the bumper extension molding just behind the rear wheel well on 1986 and '87 Eldorado models, would suddenly re-appear on the 1990 &amp; '91 Seville (base models only) and Eldorado Touring Coupé.

The Eldorado received a major facelift for 1988, and sales nearly doubled from the previous year, up to 33,210. The wheelbase, doors, roof, and glass remained relatively unchanged and body panels were revised. Now available in 17 exterior colors (previously 19), the Eldorado was 3" longer than the previous year. Underneath the restyled hood was Cadillac's new 155 horsepower 4.5 liter V8. A comprehensive anti-lock braking system, developed by Teves, was newly available. Longer front fenders held "bladed" tips, and a new grille above the revamped front bumper. In back, new three-sided tail lamps - reminiscent of the 1987 Deville - appeared along with a new bumper and trunk lid. Bladed 14" aluminum wheels remained standard, while an optional 15" snowflake-pattern alloy wheel was included with the '''Touring Suspension''' option. The interior held wider front seat headrests and swing-away door pull handles (replacing the former door pull straps). New upholstery patterns, along with shoulder belts for outboard rear-seat passengers, appeared for both base and '''Biarritz''' models, with the latter returning to the tufted-button design - last seen in the 1985 Eldorado Biarritz. A new vinyl roof option, covering the full roof top, featured a band of body color above the side door and windows - similar to the style used until 1978. This replaced the "cabriolet roof" option, which covered the rear half of the roof, introduced just a year earlier. With the Biarritz option package, the padded vinyl roof covered just the rear quarter of the roof top, behind the rear side windows.  Biarritz also included slender vertical opera lamps, as in 1986 and '87, but now added a spear molding (similar to the style used on the 1976 - 1985 Eldorado Biarritz) that ran from the base of the roof top, continuing horizontally along the door, and down to the front fender tip. The standard power antenna was moved from the front passenger fender to the rear passenger fender. Pricing went up this year - to $24,891. This 1988 restyle would be the last, until the model was replaced by an all-new Eldorado for 1992.

[[File:Eldorardo-7th generation.jpg|thumb|1986–1991 Cadillac Eldorado with after-market grille]]
With such big changes for Eldorado just a year earlier, 1989 saw little that was new. The optional automatic rearview mirror went from an electrically operated mechanical tilting mechanism to the new [[electrochromic]] style, using a clear fluid filled between the mirror and a thin sheet of glass, which tints upon activation. A new exterior color, White Diamond, brought the color choices up to 18.  Gone were the 14-inch wheels, as the previously optional 15-inch "snowflake"-style aluminum wheel, introduced last year, was made standard for the base Eldorado. A compact disc player, available only with the Delco [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] Gold Series music system, was a new option this year, as was reversible floor mats, and gold-plated ornamentation ("Cadillac" grille and trunk scripts, sail panel ornaments, deck lid engine plaque, trunk lock cover, tail lamp emblems, and available wire wheel cover wreath and crest). New standard items include an express-down module for the driver's window, electronic oil-life indicator, a more powerful Delco Freedom II battery, a revised factory warranty, and GM's PASS (Passive Automotive Security System) KEY theft-deterrent system, which activated the fuel system based upon a coded pellet within the ignition key. Previously optional items that were now added as standard equipment included a cassette player with graphic equalizer, remote fuel filler door release, and a front license plate mounting. In an effort to use up existing warehouse stock, the brushed chrome lower bodyside accent molding, optional through last year, was added as standard equipment for 1989 (revamped moldings would appear in 1990). New high-gloss Birdseye Maple trim (replacing the satin-finished American Walnut used from 1986 to 1988) on the instrument panel and console was standard on Eldorado Biarritz, and available (for $245) on the base Eldorado. The optional full cabriolet roof, which re-created the dashing look of a convertible top, was offered this year in limited colors. Pricing rose again, now at $26,738. Production slipped slightly, down to 27,807 (including 7,174 Biarritz models). The dip in sales was partly due to competition from GM's own [[Buick Riviera]], which grew 11" this year in a dramatic restyle, and had a production increase from 8,625 units in 1988 to 21,189 in 1989.

Aside from the new-for-1990 '''Touring Coupe''' model (see entry below) introduced later in the model year, it was a year of enhancement for Eldorado. A driver's side airbag was introduced as standard equipment, but as a result, the telescoping steering column was discontinued (although the tilt feature remained). Cruise control buttons were mounted on the center of the previous steering wheel, but with the advent of the air bag (mounted on a smaller diameter steering wheel), they were now moved to the turn signal stalk. A new multi-point fuel injection replaced the throttle-body style from last year, and horsepower rose from 155 to 180, although the new system required the use of premium fuel. A new cast aluminum wheel design (not available with the '''Touring Suspension''' package) was optional for those customers who desired something different than the standard "snowflake" alloy wheel on the base Eldorado. Seating received numerous enhancements, including new molded trim panels, additional lateral and lumbar support, French seams, and revised front headrests. Full leather upholstery (formerly leather and cloth) was now standard on the '''Biarritz''' model, but the base model lost the seat-back map pockets. The cellular telephone disappeared from the option list, and the vinyl center armrest was revamped. The electronic climate control received an update in the form of three automatic and two manual settings. The optional leather upholstery package on the base model now included a power passenger seat recliner. Last year's "Eldorado Option Package" (which included new-style carpeted floor mats, body-color door edge guards, illuminated driver and passenger visor, trunk mat, and the illuminated entry system) was now standard. Additionally, previously optional items that were added as standard equipment this year included the rear window defogger with heated outside mirrors, and bodyside accent striping. New options for 1990 included a central-unlocking feature (from the outside door locks using the key) added to the automatic door locks. A revised deck-lid engine plaque now mentioned the port fuel injection, and the deck-lid itself held a chromed handle above the license plate opening. Also, the rear safety reflectors moved from the bumper onto the panel below the decklid this year. A new charcoal-colored vinyl strip accented the chrome bumper and bodyside moldings this year, while the front bumper guards changed from body-color to charcoal. In the front suspension, the stabilizer shaft was revised for ride and handling, while the tire jack located in the trunk had a new carpeted storage container. Price for 1990 was $28,885, with the '''Biarritz''' model an additional $3,180. Production dropped to 20,874 units, about 1/3 of which were the '''Biarritz''' model. An additional 1,507 '''Eldorado Touring Coupe''' models were made.

1991, the last year for this body style, was also the first year for Cadillac's new 4.9 liter V-8 engine with port fuel injection, teamed up with GM's 4T60-E electronically controlled 4-speed transmission. Cadillac set apart its GM transmission from other corporate models it was shared with by use of a Cadillac-exclusive '''viscous converter clutch''' which provided even smoother shifting under hard acceleration. Engine controls were monitored by the GMP4 Powertrain Control Module (PCM), an on-board 64-kilobyte computer. A new exhaust set-up with a wider catalytic converter reduced restriction by 38% from last year, while the 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph speed went from 9 seconds in 1990 to 8.2 for '91. Revised engine mounts prevented engine noise and vibration from affecting the cabin, while the new [[Computer Command Ride]] (CCR) system, optional on most other Cadillac models, was standard on Eldorado. CCR would automatically adapt the suspension mode with regard to vehicle speed for better handling and ride comfort. A $309 electrically heated windshield was new to the option list this year, as was the available ($480 on base Eldorado, no charge on Biarritz or Touring Coupe) "Security Package" which now included remote keyless entry along with automatic door locks with central unlocking, and the theft-deterrent system. The Bosch II anti-lock braking system, previously a $925 option, was made standard this year, as well as a more powerful 140-amp alternator. A revised windshield washer system rounded out the changes for 1991. Base price was $31,245, almost $2,400 up from 1990, but the jump was not nearly as dramatic when considering the new powertrain and sophisticated suspension system, and that anti-lock brakes were now standard equipment, as well as other previously optional items that were now available at no-charge. In an effort to exhaust parts inventory - and to make the Eldorado appear to be a better value in its last year of current style production, several optional items were available at no-charge on the base Eldorado, including choice of full vinyl roof covering or full-cabriolet (convertible-look) roof (an otherwise $1,095 option), leather upholstery with power passenger recliner, and the Delco-[[Bose Corporation|Bose]] sound system - with choice of CD or cassette. Additionally, both the $2,050 '''Touring Coupe''' and the $3,180 '''Biarritz''' packages included the power moon roof and Delco-BOSE stereo at no additional charge. This would be the last year for the '''Eldorado Biarritz'''. Production dropped to just 16,212 (including 2,249 Touring Coupe models), the lowest output seen since 1966.

The 1992 Eldorado was all new, drawing both interior and exterior styling cues from the 1988 Cadillac Solitaire show car. It was significantly larger than its predecessor—approximately 11" longer, 3" wider, and substantially heavier. Window glass was once again frameless, and shortly after introduction Cadillac's new [[Cadillac Northstar engine|Northstar]] [[V8 engine|V8]] became available in both 270 and {{convert|295|hp|abbr=on}} variants, replacing the previous generation's {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac High Technology engine#L26 4.9|4.9&amp;nbsp;L L26]]. The car was sold under ESC (Eldorado Sport Coupe) and ETC (Eldorado Touring Coupe) trim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.new-cars.com/2002/cadillac/cadillac-eldorado.html |title=2002 Cadillac Eldorado review, specs |publisher=New-Cars.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former was distinguished by a stand-up hood ornament, Cadillac crests on the rear roof pillar, and 16" multi-spoke alloy wheels, and concealed exhausts. It came standard with cloth upholstery, [[Zebrano]] wood dashboard trim, 6-way power front bucket seats, climate control, digital instrumentation, column-mounted automatic transmission shifter, and three-position electronically adjustable "Speed-Sensitive Suspension". The more handling-oriented Touring Coupe could be recognized by the grille-mounted Cadillac wreath and crest, "Touring Coupe" scripts on the doors, integrated fog lamps, flat-face 16-inch alloy wheels, and quad exhaust outlets. Its standard equipment included "Nuance" gathered leather seating areas, 12-way power seats, Zebrano-trimmed full-floor console with shifter, analog instrumentation, and specially tuned suspension. Sales of the Eldorado were up, though never again at record heights.

The Eldorado continued for the rest of the decade with incremental changes and tapering sales. For 1993 the Touring Coupe received a new two-spoke steering wheel and a body-color grille, and lost the 12-way power seats in favor of 6-way ones. A new Eldorado Sport Coupe model was introduced, featuring the new Northstar V8 and some of the accoutrements of the more expensive Touring Coupe. The most notable ones were quad exhaust, full-floor console with shifter—albeit stripped of the Zebrano trim, and even the Touring-tuned adaptive suspension, which was now touted "Road Sensing Suspension". A passenger side airbag was added as standard equipment on all models, and new 16-inch chromed alloy wheels became available.
For 1994 the lineup went back to just Eldorado and Eldorado Touring Coupe. The steering wheel was changed again, this time to a four-spoke design. Both models came with quad exhausts. A "Sport Appearance Package" allowed the buyer to get most of the Touring Coupe's cosmetic features on the base Eldorado.

Styling was freshened in 1995, with updated bumpers front and rear, side cladding, a new chrome eggcrate grille, and new seven-spoke alloy wheels. For 1996, the interior received attention, with a larger analog gauge cluster, relocated climate control system, updated stereo faces, a new upholstery style—perforated instead of the out of fashion gathered leather on the Touring Coupe. The Touring Coupe received rain-sensing wipers called "Rainsense", and once again a body-color radiator grille. Daytime running lights were standard.

In 1997, the [[Integrated Chassis Control System]] was added. It involved microprocessor integration of engine, [[Traction control system|traction control]], Stabilitrak [[electronic stability control]], [[steering]], and adaptive [[continuously variable road sensing suspension]] (CVRSS), with the intent of improving responsiveness to driver input, performance, and overall safety. It was similar to the Toyota/Lexus [[Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management]] (VDIM). In the wake of declining sales, circulating reports that the Eldorado would get a redesign for 1999—similar to that which the Seville underwent for 1998—would prove false as the car soldiered on largely unchanged into the new millennium, although it did get some upgrades from the 1999 Seville.

By 2000, the Eldorado was the last of a dying breed: its [[Buick Riviera]] and [[Oldsmobile Toronado]] stablemates had been discontinued, as had its perennial rival the [[Lincoln Mark VIII]], while its [[Cadillac Seville|Seville]] and [[Cadillac Deville|Deville]] sedan counterparts no longer shared its platform. At this point, the Eldorado was the last production K- or E-body, and its assembly was moved to the [[Lansing Craft Center]].

[[File:2002 Eldorado Collector Series 262 of 1596.JPG|thumb|left|A 2002 Collector Series Cadillac Eldorado]]
In 2001, GM announced that the Eldorado's 50th model year (2002) would be its last. To mark the end of the nameplate, a limited production run of 1,596 cars in red or white—the colors available on the original 1953 convertible—were produced in three batches of 532, signifying the Eldorado's first year of production. These last cars featured specially tuned exhaust notes imitating their forerunners from a half-century earlier, and a dash-mounted plaque indicating each car's sequence in production. Production ended on April 22, 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Flores |first=Dan |title=Cadillac Commemorates the End of an Era as the Last Eldorado Rolls Off the Assembly Line |work=Press release |publisher=[[General Motors|GM]] Media Online |date=2002-04-22 |url=http://archives.media.gm.com/us/cadillac/en/news/press/020422_last_eldo.html |accessdate=2007-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Lansing Craft Centre]] retooled to build the [[Chevrolet SSR]].

[[Image:Cadillac V8 Cabriolet 1916.jpg|thumb|right|Cadillac Type 53 Cabriolet 1916]]

The '''[[Cadillac]] Type 53''' was the first car to use the same control layout as modern automobiles- with the gear lever and hand brake in the middle of the front two seats, a key started ignition, and three pedals for the clutch, brake and throttle in the modern order. This Cadillac was driven by a 77 [[horsepower]] V8 engine. The Type 53 remained in production for one year only, in 1916. When this car debuted in 1916 it succeeded the [[Cadillac Type 51]]. The following year the [[Cadillac Type 55]] replaced the Type 53. It was built at the [[Henry Ford Company|Cass Street and Amsterdam Avenue]] factory in Detroit, with the body provided by a number of coachbuilders, including [[Fleetwood Metal Body]] in Fleetwood, Pennsylvania.

Although this car did not gain great popularity, it created the modern layout of an automobile that is still used today. This layout became popular with the [[Austin 7]], which copied the control layout from the Cadillac Type 53.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The one with ...

The '''Cadillac Series 65''', after the [[Cadillac Series 60|Series 60]], represented [[Cadillac]]'s second, and, being built on the [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] instead of the [[GM B platform|B-body]], somewhat physically larger entry into the mid-priced vehicle market when it appeared in 1937. It was slightly higher in status than the [[LaSalle (automobile)|LaSalle]], also offered by [[General Motors]].

In 1937 it was offered in only one body style, a 4-door 5-seat [[sedan (car)|sedan]], built by [[Fisher Body|Fisher]] on the same  {{convert|131.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase as used by the [[Cadillac Series 70]] and the [[Buick Roadmaster]].

Under the hood was the [[Cadillac V8 engine#Monobloc|Monobloc]] [[V8 engine|V8]]. The only displacement that was available was the {{convert|346|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}. This engine produced 135&amp;nbsp;[[Horsepower|hp]] (101&amp;nbsp;kW) at 3400 [[Revolutions per minute|R.P.M.]] The car had [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix]] dual-servo brakes, "[[Dubonnet suspension|Knee-Action]]"&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; [[independent suspension]] in front and a Stromberg carburetor ('37: AA-25; '38: AAV-25) with an electric choke.

In 1938 the Series 65 and the Series 75 shared a new front end style featuring a massive [[grille (motor vehicle)|vertical cellular grille]], three sets of horizontal bars on the [[hood (automobile)|hood sides]], [[hood (automobile)|alligator hood]], and [[headlight]]s on the filler space between the [[fender (vehicle)|fender]]s and the [[hood (automobile)|hood]]. Optional sidemount covers were hinged to the fenders. Quarter windows were of sliding rather than hinged construction. The rear of the body had rounder corners and more smoothly blended lines.

[[Image:Cadillac Northstar LMP Mosport.jpg|thumb|300px|Cadillac Northstar LMP]]
The '''Cadillac Northstar LMP''' was a series of [[Le Mans Prototype]]s built by [[Cadillac]] for use in the [[American Le Mans Series]] as well as an attempt to return Cadillac to the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] since they first entered in {{24hLM|1950}}.  The Northstar LMPs were named after the [[GM Premium V engine|Northstar V8 engines]] which powered them.  The Cadillac project ran from 2000 until 2002 when [[General Motors]] decided to cancel the project to concentrate solely on their [[Chevrolet Corvette]] program. Cadillac returned to prototype racing in 2017 with the [[Cadillac DPi-V.R]] in the [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]].

==Development==
===2000===
In planning the new Cadillac LMP project, GM turned to [[Riley Technologies|Riley &amp; Scott]], builders of the successful [[Riley &amp; Scott Mk III|Mk III]] chassis.  Riley &amp; Scott developed a from-scratch LMP based around a bespoke carbon fiber monocoque.  The new design featured elements of Cadillac's new Art &amp; Science design theme such as the functional egg-crate grill on the nose, as well as the addition of large side scoops to feed the turbochargers.

A highly modified {{Convert|650|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version of this engine was used by General Motors racing division initially for [[Indy Racing League]] competition starting in 1995, then was later used in the Cadillac Northstar LMP program in 2000.  Both engines retained the 4.0&amp;nbsp;L capacity, but the Northstar LMP version was twin-turbocharged.&lt;ref name=Aurora&gt;Weitzman, Larry (2001).[http://www.theautochannel.com/vehicles/new/reviews/2001/lweitzman_oldsmobile_aurora.html The Aurora by Oldsmobile (2001), Better in every respect]. ''Autochannel''. Retrieved on June 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The engine for the Northstar LMP was based on a smaller 4.0 Liter variant of the Northstar used in Cadillacs, known as the L47, used in GM's [[Oldsmobile Aurora]] sedan.  It had already been adapted for racing in 1995 for use in the [[Indy Racing League]], but was thoroughly modified in order to not only increase power, but increase longevity.  McLaren Engines assisted in the development of the new prototype engine, while [[Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries]] (IHI) produced twin turbochargers to increase output.

A total of seven monocoques were built, with two going to Team Cadillac in the United States, three to [[DAMS]] in France, one assigned as the crash test car (became the show car), and one spare tub that was delivered to GM at the end of the program.

===2001===
For 2001, the Northstar LMP was evolved in order to make it more competitive against the Audi R8s.  Although still based on the Riley &amp; Scott chassis, the bodywork was completely redesigned by Nigel Stroud.  A more angular approach was used, especially on the sides of the car, with the sidepods no longer being flat horizontal but instead diving downward towards the front wheel arch.  The air cooling ducts were also relocated from the side of the car, and instead placed inside the wheel wells, allowing for air exits from the wheel wells to be added to the new side.  The Cadillac-theme grill was also revised, no longer being a functional open piece.

Beyond the bodywork, not much else was changed on the new car, known as the Northstar LMP01.  Two of the previous 2000-spec cars were upgraded to the 2001 bodywork, while a third car was built fresh.

===2002===
[[File:Cadillac Northstar LMP 900.jpg|thumb|right|Cadillac Northstar LMP 900 at the Le Mans Museum.]]
Following two years of development of the Northstar V8 engine, Cadillac used 2002 to debut their new custom-built chassis.  No longer relying on Riley &amp; Scott, the new Northstar LMP02 was designed by Nigel Stroud to be a completely different machine.  Although retaining some of the aerodynamic features of the Northstar LMP01, the new car featured a much more angular design.  Among the most noticeable features is the use of a raised footbox in the nose, allowing for a large air intake in the center and no longer employing the use of a stylized grill.  The air exits on the side were also closed down to a minimum width, leaving the design much cleaner.

In the engine department, the Northstar V8 was slightly altered, with the use of new [[Garrett AiResearch|Garrett]] turbochargers replacing the IHI units.  A new pneumatic shift system was also employed for the X-Trac gearbox.

A total of three all new chassis were built for the Northstar LMP02.

==Racing history==
===2000===
For Cadillac's debut in 2000, GM decided to employ the use of two teams in two different championships in an attempt to maximize their preparation for Le Mans.  Riley &amp; Scott would run the factory team in the [[American Le Mans Series]] under the name Team Cadillac, while Team [[DAMS]] of France would run a customer team in the European [[Sports Racing World Cup]].

For the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], the first race of the year, Team Cadillac would debut their two cars.  Alongside their [[Chevrolet Corvette]] teammates, the Northstar LMPs performed well early on, taking second and third in qualifying.  During the race the cars ran on pace, although after problems they found themselves nearly 100 laps behind the leading grand tourer cars.  Although one car suffered a gearbox in the closing moments of the race, both cars were classified as finishers, taking 13th and 14th places.  This was followed by the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], which saw both Team Cadillac and Team DAMS would be entered, with Cadillac running two cars and DAMS one.  The teams suffered some difficulties, with the DAMS entry breaking a clutch and one of the Team Cadillac entries being involved in an accident.  However, the third Northstar LMP was able to finish the race and take an encouraging sixth place, although it was 29 laps behind the winning [[Audi R8 (race car)|Audi R8]].

Returning to Europe, DAMS debuted their first two car effort at the initial race of the Sports Racing World Cup.  There, the team managed to take home seventh and eighth places, a mere three laps behind the winning [[Ferrari 333 SP]].  DAMS would go on to take a fourth-place finish at the next round, although the other team car failed to finish.  At this time, the American Le Mans Series was having their first races in Europe.  DAMS entered their two car effort in place of Team Cadillac, managing to take fifth at [[Silverstone Circuit]].  DAMS would make one more Sports Racing World Cup appearance in May prior to going to Le Mans, where both cars did not finish.

Team Cadillac on the other hand, believing that private testing would be better for the Northstar LMP, would not return to the American Le Mans Series prior to flying to France for the [[2000 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans]].  The cars lacked the pace necessary to compete with the major manufacturers in their class.  Although a DAMS entry managed to qualify ninth, the sister car could muster only the 20th fastest lap time.  The pace was equally off in the race, and mechanical woes saw only three Northstar LMPs finish, a disappointing 19th, 21st, and 22nd.

Following Le Mans, DAMS participated in the second ALMS event in Europe, again taking fifth place, this time at the [[Nürburgring]].  Returning to America, Team Cadillac finally returned to action with a single car at [[Portland International Raceway]], managing eighth place.  [[Petit Le Mans]] would see DAMS return to the United States as well, with the four car Cadillac effort seeing better results.  All cars managed to finish, with the result of 6th, 7th, 8th, and 13th.  Team Cadillac would record one final finish for the year at [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca|Laguna Seca]] with a seventh-place finish before the time retired for the season, skipping the Las Vegas round.  DAMS made Cadillac's final appearance of the year at the [[Adelaide Street Circuit]] in [[Australia]].  DAMS would finish a distant 19th and 20th places.

At the end of the season, due to Team Cadillac's private testing, DAMS actually finished higher in the [[American Le Mans Series]] championship, taking seventh place over Cadillac's eighth.  In addition to this, DAMS points in the [[Sports Racing World Cup]] would earn them eighth in that championship.

===2001===
For the new season, General Motors decided to alter their strategy.  Cadillac would prepare solely for the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] with private testing, with [[DAMS]] running only a two-car effort at the race.  Team Cadillac would assist in the effort, but then would run the [[American Le Mans Series]] only after Le Mans, when testing of the new Northstar LMP01 would be no longer necessary since General Motors was already aware that the all new Northstar LMP02 was in development.

At Le Mans, the DAMS entries showed the speed potential of the Northstar V8s by taking eighth in qualifying, beating out a new [[Bentley Speed 8|Bentley EXP Speed 8]], two of the [[Chrysler LMP]]s, and the [[Panoz]] squad.  During the race, one of the Northstar LMP01s was taken out in an early accident, but the sole surviving car managed to improve on the teams performance from last year by taking 15th place.

Now returning to the United States, Team Cadillac began their involvement in the American Le Mans Series season at [[Infineon Raceway|Sears Point]].  Both cars suffered problems, and were only able to finish 12th and 24th.  Skipping Portland, the Cadillacs returned at [[Mosport]] and recorded their best finish ever, taking third and fourth places.  After a seven- and eighth-place finish at Mid-Ohio, the cars would take fourth and fifth at Laguna Seca, before finishing the season with another fourth- and fifth-place finish at the [[Petit Le Mans]].  Although Cadillac ran only half of the season, the team managed to be tied for fourth in the teams championship that year.

===2002===
With the all new Northstar LMP02, Team Cadillac prepared once again for the 24 Hours of Le Mans.  Team DAMS was no longer involved in the project, leaving the American team to do all development of the new car.  Once again the decision was made to concentrate on private testing prior to Le Mans, although this year Cadillac would run the [[12 Hours of Sebring]].

The year did not start well for the Northstar LMP02 at Sebring.  One car suffered a failed electronics system towards the end of the race, while the sole remaining car came home a disappointing 31st.  Moving to Le Mans, the Cadillac showed its speed in qualifying once again by taking the eighth and tenth fastest qualifying times, beating out both an [[Audi]] and a [[Bentley]].  However the race itself saw the Northstar LMP02 show its potential, with both cars running in the top ten for most of the race.  Cadillac managed to take home ninth and twelfth places in the end, their best Le Mans result since the start of the program.

Returning to the United States, Cadillac saw competition again in Washington D.C., where the team managed to take a fourth-place finish, only a single lap behind the winners.  Skipping Trois-Rivieres, Mosport saw the Northstar LMP02s finish third and sixth, followed by another third at Laguna Seca.  Cadillac's best race ever would finally come on the streets of Miami, where the LMP02 of [[JJ Lehto]] and [[Max Angelelli]] would take second place, a mere fourteen seconds behind the winning Audi.  The final race of the year, [[Petit Le Mans]], would see Cadillac coming home in third and fourth.  Once again, with only half a season, Cadillac would manage an impressive fifth in the championship.

At the end of 2002, General Motors announced that the Cadillac project would not continue into 2003.  Feeling that the Cadillac program had achieved what General Motors believed it was meant to, the project was canceled and GM would move to concentrating solely on their more successful [[Chevrolet_Corvette#Racing|Chevrolet Corvette]] program.  General Motors would not offer any of the Northstar LMPs for sale to privateer customers, instead retaining the cars for themselves.

In 2009 GM decided to sell some of their specialty cars that were featured in the GM Museum.  The Cadillac LMP #8 (Chassis #02-002) was for the first time sold to a privateer.

==Chassis history==
A total of seven Riley &amp; Scott-built Northstar LMP and Northstar LMP01s would be built, while a further three Northstar LMP02s would be built.  Team [[Cadillac]] and [[DAMS]] would be the only teams to run the cars.

The '''Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham''' was a [[Luxury vehicle|luxury car]] manufactured by [[Cadillac]] from 1977 through 1986. In 1987, the Fleetwood Brougham name was shortened to simply [[Cadillac Brougham|Brougham]], with production continuing through 1992 with only minor updates.

Cadillac used the "Fleetwood" name as a prefix between 1934 and 1976 on several of its most expensive models, always designating an elevated level of luxury.  Between 1958 and 1961, Cadillac used the "Brougham" sub-designation for its exclusive four-door [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]] models.

In 1965, the "Brougham" name was first affixed to "Fleetwood" on the [[Cadillac Fleetwood Sixty Special|Fleetwood Sixty Special]] as an upgraded option package, which included a vinyl roof and special "Brougham" script lettering on the sides, but it was not a separate model. In 1966, the Fleetwood Brougham was added as a separate model, accompanying the Fleetwood 60 Special, which continued through 1970. In 1971, with the Fleetwood Brougham outselling the Fleetwood 60 Special by a large margin, the two models were consolidated into a single model, the Fleetwood 60 Special Brougham, and would continue with this name through 1976. The car's name was shortened to Fleetwood Brougham with the 1977 downsizing across the GM car line. The "d'Elegance" and "Talisman" sub-models were also sometimes used to designate upgraded option packages.

Lawrence P. Fisher was the Fisher brother most closely involved with [[Cadillac]] in its early years. In 1916, he joined the [[Fisher Body]] Company, which had been formed by two of his brothers in 1908. Larry (as people knew him) was one of four of the seven Fisher brothers who brought Fisher Body Corporation under the [[General Motors]] umbrella in 1919.  In May 1925, [[Alfred P. Sloan]], then the head of General Motors, appointed Fisher as Cadillac General Manager, an office he retained through 1934. Fisher immediately went to work adding exclusive, custom bodies to the Cadillac range. Thus he oversaw the purchase of the [[Fleetwood Metal Body]] Company by the Fisher Body Corporation in September 1925.&lt;ref name="cadillacdatabase1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadillacdatabase.net/Dbas_txt/Factd-g.htm|title=Cadillac Terms and Definitions D - G|date=|publisher=Cadillacdatabase.net|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111154213/http://www.cadillacdatabase.net/Dbas_txt/Factd-g.htm|archivedate=2012-01-11|url-status=dead|accessdate=2011-12-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fleetwood Body Company of [[Fleetwood, Pennsylvania]], was founded by Harry Urich in the nineteenth century. It began as a small community of craftsmen founded by Henry Fleetwood, Esq. of [[Penwortham]], near [[Lancaster, England]] (the Fleetwood family flourished in England in the 17th and 18th centuries). The rich traditions of 300 years of coach-building that the Fleetwood Body Company applied to its work on cars secured for it a high reputation in automobile circles worldwide by the 1920s. Coachwork was built by Fleetwood for a variety of luxury makes through 1924. However, after the Fisher Body Corporation purchased the Fleetwood Body Company in 1925, Fleetwood bodies were reserved exclusively for Cadillac. By 1929 GM had purchased the remaining stock holdings of the Fisher Body Corporation and thus became sole owner of both the Fisher and Fleetwood companies.&lt;ref name="cadillacdatabase1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kimes1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kimes|first=Beverly|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1805-1942|year=1996|publisher=Krause publications|isbn=0-87341-428-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally an enclosed carriage, drawn by a single horse, for 2–4 persons, “[[Brougham (carriage)|Brougham]]” owes its name to British statesman, [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]]. Cadillac first used the name in 1916 to designate an enclosed 5-7 passenger sedan body style.&lt;ref name="gunnell2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunnell|first=John|title=Standard Catalog of Cadillac 1903-2005|year=2005|publisher=Krause publications|isbn=0873492897}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the thirties, the name was given to a formal body style with open chauffeur compartment and enclosed rear quarters, metal roof and often "razor-edged" styling.&lt;ref name="cadillacdatabase2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadillacdatabase.net/Dbas_txt/Facta-c.htm|title=Cadillac Terms and Definitions A - C|date=|publisher=Cadillacdatabase.net|accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Cadillac started offering Fleetwood bodies on some of its cars in 1925, the Brougham body style was Fleetwood bodied every year with the exception of 1926. After 1937 the Brougham name was not applied to any Cadillac for the remainder of the pre-WW II period.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gunnell2005"/&gt;

The [[Cadillac Brougham|Brougham]] name would eventually reappear on the 1955 [[Cadillac Eldorado]] Brougham show car which preceded the 4-door Eldorado Brougham hardtops of the 1957 to 1960 model years.&lt;ref name="gunnell2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kowalke1997"&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975|last=Kowalke|first=Ron|publisher=Krause publications|year=1997|isbn=0-87341-521-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/standardcatalogo00beve}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 the [[Cadillac Series 70]] Eldorado Brougham joined the Sixty Special and the Series 75 as the only Cadillac models with Fleetwood bodies although Fleetwood script or crests did not appear anywhere on the exterior of the car,&lt;ref name="Bonsal2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonsall|first=Thomas|title=The Cadillac Story|year=2003|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0-8047-4942-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SIA1970"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Special Interest Autos|issue=#2 Nov.–Dec. 1970|title=Mark II Meets Eldorado Brougham}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so this would also mark the first time in 20 years that a Fleetwood bodied car was paired with the Brougham name. When production of the Eldorado Brougham was shifted in 1959 from the Cadillac Fleetwood plant in [[Detroit]] to [[Pininfarina]] in [[Turin, Italy]], only then did it acquire Fleetwood wheel discs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1957-1960-cadillac-eldorado-brougham5.htm |title=1957-1960 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham - page 5 |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and doorsill moldings, presumably because the design work&lt;ref name="1957-1960Cadillac EldoradoPage6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1957-1960-cadillac-eldorado-brougham6.htm|title=1957-1960 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham - page 6|date=|publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com|accessdate=2012-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and final touches&lt;ref name="Bonsal2003"/&gt; were still being done by Fleetwood. The 1960 Eldorado Brougham would be the final iteration.

After a five year absence the Brougham name once again reappeared as an option package on the 1965 [[Cadillac Sixty Special]]. The following year the Brougham moved up to becoming a subseries of the Fleetwood Sixty Special. This continued through 1970. Starting in 1971 the Sixty Special was only available as the well equipped Fleetwood Sixty Special Brougham.&lt;ref name="gunnell2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kowalke1997"/&gt;

When the Sixty Special Series was retired in 1977, the Fleetwood Brougham took its place as Cadillac's largest owner-driven sedan model through 1986.&lt;ref name="gunnell2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flammang|first=James|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1976-1999|year=1999|publisher=Krause publications|isbn=0-87341-755-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1977, [[General Motors|GM]] significantly down-sized their full sized cars.  The [[Cadillac DeVille|DeVille]] and Fleetwood Brougham rode on the same 121.5" wheelbase and were powered by the 425 cubic inch (7.0L) V8.  This engine was basically a de-bored version of the 472/500 (7.9&amp;nbsp;L/8.2&amp;nbsp;L) V8 of previous years.  Compared with the 1976 Fleetwood Sixty Special Brougham, the Fleetwood Brougham had a wheelbase 11.5" shorter and weighed nearly 900&amp;nbsp;lb (400&amp;nbsp;kg) less. The new Fleetwood Brougham, which had lost its exclusive longer wheelbase, was now virtually identical to the lesser Sedan de Ville. Other than the name, there were only subtle exterior differences between a Fleetwood Brougham and Sedan de Ville. The interior of the Fleetwood was more plush and offered more features as standard.

In 1980, GM gave all of the full-sized B and C-body line new sheet metal to tidy up the styling and improve aerodynamics. The basic dashboard design was retained. Also new for 1980 was a two-door Fleetwood Brougham Coupe, which was based upon the Coupe de Ville but featured an exclusive formal landau vinyl roof. The 425&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in (7.0&amp;nbsp;L) engine, a reduced bore 472, was further debored for 1980-81 to 368 cubic inches or 6.0&amp;nbsp;liters in order to comply with newly-enacted CAFE standards. For 1981, the 368 was provided with a modulated displacement system designed by Eaton Corporation, controlled by a digital computer, which locked off intake and exhaust valves to two or four of the eight cylinders, thus running effectively as a V6 or V4 under light load conditions where in third gear, and over {{convert|35|mph|abbr=on}}. This engine, called the "V8-6-4", was reliable, but the computer technology of the era was not refined enough for smooth operation and it was dropped from all models but limousines after 1981. 

Both the 425 and 368 are small-bore versions of the durable 472 (which was introduced in late 1967 for the '68 model year). The larger 500 had the 472's bore but a longer stroke. This engine family was the last Cadillac cast-iron engine, and the last 'big-block'. During this period, an assortment of engines were offered in the interest of fuel economy. These included the Buick 252 V6, diesel Oldsmobile 350 V8, and of Cadillac's own "HT-4100" small block V8, an alloy unit with cast iron cylinder liners which was troublesome and prone to early failure. The first two were dropped in 1982 once gas prices began falling while the latter persisted through 1986.

For 1985, Cadillac introduced a brand-new front-wheel drive platform for DeVille and Fleetwood.  This car featured two "firsts"; it had the first transverse mounted V8 ever (the HT4100) and it was the first car to have a high mounted rear stop-lamp that was federally mandated starting in the 1986 model year. The rear wheel drive 1985 Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham continued on nearly unchanged from the 1984 model. 1985 was the final model year for the Fleetwood Brougham coupe. In 1986, the [[Cadillac High Technology engine#HT-4100|HT-4100 V8]] was replaced with an Oldsmobile-sourced 307 cubic inch (5.0&amp;nbsp;L) V8 in the Fleetwood Brougham.

The Fleetwood name was dropped from the Fleetwood Brougham in 1987, which continued to be produced as simply the [[Cadillac Brougham]].  It was otherwise the same as the 1986 model.  The reason for the change was that Cadillac had introduced a new, smaller, front-wheel drive model in 1985 and named it simply the [[Cadillac Fleetwood|Fleetwood]].  The Brougham remained in production through 1992.

The STS-V premiered with a 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph acceleration time of 4.6 seconds and 12.9 second quarter mile time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/2006-bmw-m5-vs-2006-cadillac-sts-v-vs-2006-mercedes-benz-cls55-amg-comparison-test|title=2006 BMW M5 vs. Cadillac STS-V, M-B CLS55 AMG|last=Swan|first=Tony|date=January 2006|work=Car and Driver|access-date=May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was introduced at the 2005 [[Detroit Auto Show]], and was available for sale in late 2005.

==Specifications==
The STS-V uses a [[supercharged]] 4.4&amp;nbsp;L version of the [[Cadillac Northstar engine#Supercharged|Northstar]] V8, producing 469&amp;nbsp;hp (350&amp;nbsp;kW) and {{convert|439|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. This engine is mated to a driver-adjustable automatic transmission with two shifting modes, larger brakes by [[Brembo]], larger 10 spoke alloy wheels (18"x8.5" front, 19"x9.5" rear), [[Pirelli]] [[run-flat tire]]s, a faster steering ratio, and a stiffer [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] than the standard STS.  The [[engine block]] and [[cylinder head]]s are aluminum, the [[camshafts]] are cast iron, and the [[crankshaft]] is forged steel. Suspension is fully independent and there are four settings for the [[traction control system]] and [[stability control]].  Also, different from the standard STS, the STS-V has a cooler for the rear differential oil located on the underside of the car behind the 3rd member.

==Appearance==
The STS-V's primary visual difference from the standard STS was a wire mesh grille and a 'power-dome' hood as well as six lug wheels normally seen only on trucks and pick-ups.

In addition to the grille, the front differences include the bumper, the fog light and turning signal cluster, and the hood which is slightly domed to fit over the [[supercharger]].

In the rear, the bumper is different from the standard [[Cadillac STS|STS]] and includes a wire mesh insert at the bottom which is made of the same mesh material used in the front grille.  The rear spoiler is taller and wider, and encompasses the third brake light.

For the interior, the STS-V also has upgraded leather and suede trim contracted from the German company [[Dräxlmaier]], whose prior credit includes the [[Maybach 57 and 62]]. Interior color choices were Ebony and Gray, both of which are offered on the standard STS as well, and a two-tone Ebony/Tango Red scheme which was unique to the STS-V.

==Features==

Standard features in 2006 &amp; 2007 included;

Heated seats, express up &amp; down windows, voice command of HVAC, windows, locks, audio, and NAV system. Blind spot warning system (flashing built into mirrors), automatic high &amp; low beam system, backup proximity sensors, proximity digital key system, heated steering wheel, additional digital instrumentation (including boost, oil pressure, etc.) via the selectable vehicle module. Only a sunroof, head-up-display (HUD), and RainSense wipers were optional.

In 2008 and 2009 the model was lightly refreshed, including in the standard configuration a head-up display (HUD). This was available on all STS's starting in '05 but it was very expensive, thus why it is so rare to find outside of the '08/'09 V models. The refreshed version also offered standard RainSense (automatic) wipers which was an option on non-V STS vehicles. This matters only peculiarly, as Cadillac didn't offer RainSense wipers on any STS model in 2010 or in its last year of production, 2011.

[[Elvis Presley]]'s iconic Pink Cadillac was a 1955 [[Cadillac Fleetwood]]. It set style for the era, was sung about in popular culture, and was copied by others around the world. 

The car is now preserved in the [[Graceland]] museum, in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]].

==History==
In early 1955, Elvis bought his first Cadillac, a 1954 Fleetwood Series 60, which was the color pink. The car provided transport for Elvis and the [[Blue Moon Boys]], but after the failure of a brake lining, was destroyed in a roadside fire between Hope and [[Texarkana, Arkansas]], on June 5, 1955.

On July 5, 1955, Elvis purchased a new Cadillac Fleetwood Series 60 in blue 
with a black roof. Having mentioned a Pink Cadillac in the song "[[Baby, Let's Play House]]", the first song recorded by Elvis to appear on a national chart which made #5 on the [[Billboard Country Singles]] chart in July 1955;&lt;ref&gt;The Blue Moon Boys - The Story of Elvis Presley's Band. Ken Burke and Dan Griffin. 2006. Chicago Review Press. page 47. {{ISBN|1-55652-614-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elvis had the car repainted by Art, a neighbour on Lamar Street. Art designed a customised pink color for Elvis which he named "Elvis Rose," but the car kept its black roof. Once the car was finished Elvis gave it to his mother Gladys as a gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.elvispresleynews.com/ElvisCadillacs.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812114948/http://www.elvispresleynews.com/ElvisCadillacs.html |archive-date=2015-08-12 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Gladys Presley never had a [[driver's license]], and Elvis drove the car with the members of his band for most of 1955–1956.
[[File:Elvis Presley Pink Cadillac on display.png|240px|thumb|The Pink Cadillac displayed in March 2012]]
On September 2, 1955, [[Scotty Moore]] drove the car into a vehicle which was passing a pick-up truck in [[Texarkana, Texas]], causing $1000 of damage. Having signed his contract with RCA in November 1955,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldies.about.com/od/elvis/a/elvis1955_5.htm|title=The Story of Elvis Presley - Life and Career in 1955|author=|date=|website=about.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in March 1956 Elvis had the upholstery replaced, the body retouched and roof painted white. (As can be seen in the book "A Boy from Tupelo", from FTD/2012, in 1955 the Cadillac already has the white roof).

On his return from military service in [[Germany]] in 1960, Presley lent the car to his [[US Army]] buddy [[Diamond Joe Esposito|Joe Esposito]], having bought himself a white with pink roofed 1961 [[Cadillac_Coupe_de_Ville#1959|Cadillac Coupe de Ville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/derbyshire/5343214.stm|title=Elvis's pink Cadillac auctioned|author=|date=13 September 2006|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The original pink Cadillac remains on permanent display at Graceland, formerly under a carport for many years, and now resident in the auto museum. The car was once again brought to the front drive entrance of Graceland in June 2006, during the visit of President [[George W. Bush]] and Prime Minister of Japan [[Junichiro Koizumi]].

==Pink Cadillacs in popular culture==
At the time, Ford Motor Co. was the only manufacturer to offer pink as a standard color. After the public attention to Elvis' car many individual car owners in the 1950s began to paint their cars various shades of pink.

Although the original car was a 1955 four-door sedan, the more replicated version in popular culture is a pink 1959 Cadillac Series 62 Convertible, which have been sold as miniature replicas by many companies including  [[Franklin Mint]], and featured in songs and videos about the pink Cadillac. 

Pink Cadillacs have also been the automobiles of recognition for their top sales people by [[Mary Kay Cosmetics]].

Elvis Presley appears in the [[Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]] series by [[Douglas Adams]]—he is depicted as driving a pink [[spaceship]].  

Elvis' Pink Cadillac was the inspiration for [[Robert Dunn (novelist)|Robert Dunn]]'s musical novel ''[[Pink Cadillac (novel)|Pink Cadillac]]'' (2002). In the novel Elvis makes a cameo appearance, giving the heroine, Daisy Holliday, one of his pink Cadillacs as a gift after she helps him get it running.

Elvis' Pink Cadillac was featured in the [[CBS]] miniseries ''[[Elvis (2005 Mini-series)|Elvis]]'', where it shows him first buying the car for his mother.

===Krentzman copy===

In December 2006 the historians of Graceland documented and provided 125 detailed color photographs of the entire car so that Bonnie and [[Stewart Krentzman]] of [[River Vale, New Jersey]] could re-create Elvis' famous pink Cadillac in exacting detail. [[Pantone]] color swatches were used to match the pink and white exterior and interior paint. It was stipulated in the agreement with Graceland that this, the only "twin sister" and exact re-creation of the original car, would be offered at no charge to "[[pink ribbon]]" breast cancer fund-raising organizations to help raise money for breast cancer research and education. It has been estimated that close to 200,000 photos have been taken with this re-creation at breast cancer fund raising events. On occasion [[Diamond Joe Esposito]], Elvis' road manager has appeared with the Krentzman car. The Krentzman car made its first appearance at Susan G. Komen's mother and daughter Color Me Pink Event in New York City in April 2007. It has since appeared at many Susan G. Komen, Avon and Revlon Walks in addition to being used by many grassroots breast cancer organizations across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ei/pix/b/eap/68489.htm|title=Photo: President Bush and Japanese Prime Minister|author=|date=|website=www.state.gov|access-date=2017-06-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/30/world/asia/30cnd-elvis.html?ex=1309320000&amp;en=80a8553677d23ef3&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss Foreign Policy], June 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cadillac XTS''' (X-Series Touring Sedan) is a full-size luxury sedan from [[Cadillac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://media.gm.com/content/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2011/Aug/0804_Reuss_Overview|date=August 4, 2011|publisher=GM Media|title=GM Poised to Thrive with New Cars, Tech, Reuss Says}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is based on an enlarged version of the [[GM Epsilon platform#Epsilon II|Epsilon II platform]].  The XTS replaced both the Cadillac [[Cadillac STS|STS]] and [[Cadillac DTS|DTS]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/insignia-based-cadillac-dts-replacement-to-be-called-xts.html |author=Ganz, Andrew |title=Insignia-based Cadillac STS and DTS replacement to be called XTS? |date=July 2, 2009 |publisher=LeftLaneNews |accessdate=2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is smaller than the DTS but larger than the STS.  It began production in May 2012 at the [[Oshawa Car Assembly|Oshawa Assembly Plant]] and launched in June as a 2013 model.  The XTS is available with [[front-wheel drive]] and [[all-wheel drive]].

For the Chinese market, the Cadillac XTS is assembled by Shanghai GM.  Production began in February 2013.  In addition to the LFX 3.6 V6, Cadillac XTS also comes with an LTG 2.0 turbo engine in the Chinese market.  In the Chinese market, the Cadillac XTS with an LFX 3.6 V6 engine is called XTS 36S, and the version with LTG 2.0 turbo engine is called XTS 2.0T.

The Cadillac XTS Sedan is currently available in the United States, Canada, Mexico, China, and the Middle East (except Israel) in LHD only.

==Overview==

The Epsilon II-platform is used for the XTS and is shared with the Chevrolet Impala and Buick LaCrosse.  The optional twin-turbocharged engine, available only in the V-Sport, has an estimated {{convert|0|to|60|mph}} time of 6.7 seconds.&lt;ref name=aw20120625&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Winfield|first=Barry|title=Back To Its Roots|magazine=[[Autoweek]]|date=June 25, 2012|volume=62|issue=13|pages=38–39|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20120626/CARREVIEWS/120629885|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The XTS is one of two large sedans currently offered by Cadillac (the other is the [[Cadillac CT6|CT6]]), and rivals the [[Lincoln Continental]] in size and price.  The XTS is manufactured in [[Oshawa, Ontario]], [[Canada]] ([[Oshawa Car Assembly]]) and in [[Shanghai, China]] ([[Shanghai GM]]).

[[File:Cadillac XTS Interior.jpg|thumb|left|Interior]]
In addition to the base XTS, there are five trim packages labeled "Luxury", "Premium Luxury", and "Platinum", with the optional XTS V-Sport offered in both "V-Sport Premium Luxury" and "V-Sport Platinum".  Some of the standard features include dual-zone automatic climate control, [[4G]] LTE connectivity, adaptive cruise control, keyless entry, leather seat-upholstery, 8-way power front seats, parking assist and comprehensive safety equipment like ABS, stability control, dual-stage front airbags, front side airbags, side-curtain airbags front and rear, and a driver side knee airbag.  Optional equipment and technology is extensive, including separate climate controls for rear seat passengers, coupled with 8" LCD screens that flip up from the front passenger seat-backs, allowing an internal DVD player to display content with wireless headphones. The interior can be outfitted in a large assortment of color combinations, along with four types of wood selections. Cadillac's [[Cadillac CUE|CUE system]] is standard with an 8-speaker Bose sound system, including HD Radio and SiriusXM. An optional 14-speaker Bose sound package includes AudioPilot noise compensation technology.

===Powertrain===
The XTS is available with two engines, a [[Inline-4 engine|4-cylinder]] 2.0-liter [[Turbocharger|turbo]] for China only, and a 3.6-liter with {{convert|304|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|264|lb·ft|0|abbr=on}}, with available [[twin-turbo]]charging on the XTS V-Sport providing {{convert|410|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|369|lb·ft|0|abbr=on}} together with [[cylinder deactivation]]. The XTS is available in both front-wheel drive and optional all-wheel drive (standard on V-Sport vehicles) which includes a [[limited slip differential]] and [[torque vectoring]].&lt;ref&gt;Transcribed from 2016 Cadillac XTS sales brochure&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cadillac ATS''' is a [[compact executive car|compact executive]] 4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]] and 2-door [[Coupé|coupe]] manufactured and marketed by [[Cadillac]] and developed at the [[General Motors Technical Center]] in [[Warren, Michigan|Warren]], [[Michigan]]. Cadillac assembles the ATS at the [[Lansing Grand River Assembly]] plant in [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]], Michigan.

The ATS is based on [[General Motors]]' [[GM Alpha platform|Alpha platform]] and is offered in either [[Rear-wheel drive|rear-]] or [[All wheel drive#4WD versus AWD|all-wheel drive]] configurations. The ATS base engine had been a [[Naturally aspirated engine|naturally aspirated]] 2.5-liter [[Inline-four engine|I-4]] [[gasoline]] engine that produces {{convert|202|hp||abbr=on}}, until the 2016 model year. Optional engines include a 2.0-liter [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] I-4 gasoline engine that produces {{convert|272|hp||abbr=on}} and a naturally aspirated 3.6-liter [[V6 engine|V6]] gasoline engine that produces {{convert|321|hp||abbr=on}}. The 2.0-liter engine replaced the 2.5-liter engine as the base engine for the 2017 model year. A [[diesel engine]] had been planned to be available in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cadillac Confirms It Will Bring Diesels Back To The U.S.|url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1099662_cadillac-confirms-it-will-bring-diesels-back-to-the-u-s|last=Edelstein|first=Stephen|website=Green Car Reports|accessdate=February 12, 2016|date=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; All versions were equipped with a 6-speed [[GM 6L50 transmission|GM 6L45]] [[Hydramatic|Hydra-Matic]] automatic transmission as standard until the 2015 model year. An 8-speed automatic transmission was introduced for the 2016 model year. The 2.0-liter turbocharged, rear-wheel drive version can be mated to an optional 6-speed [[Tremec TR-3160 transmission|Tremec M3L TR-3160]] manual transmission.

Cadillac debuted the ATS to the press in the United States in January 2012, placed the ATS into production in July 2012 and began selling the ATS in the United States in August 2012 as a 2013 model. GM began selling the ATS in China in November 2013. Cadillac currently sells the ATS in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Europe, the Middle East, China, Japan, and South Korea.

==Development==
GM engineers working principally at the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, United States developed the ATS.&lt;ref name=thompsonandphelan&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson |first1=Chrissie |last2=Phelan |first2=Mark |title=2013 Cadillac ATS Puts an American Spin on Luxury |date=2012-01-09 |url=http://www.freep.com/article/20120109/BUSINESS03/201090367/2013-Cadillac-ATS-puts-an-American-spin-on-luxury.html |work=[[Detroit Free Press]] |publisher=freep.com |oclc=49606245 |accessdate=2012-11-21 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CLq5xs4i?url=http://www.freep.com/article/20120109/BUSINESS03/201090367/2013-Cadillac-ATS-puts-an-American-spin-on-luxury.html |archivedate=2012-11-21 |quote=Smaller than Cadillac's CTS sedan, the ATS was developed in GM's Warren Tech Center. |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationale===
Prior to the debut of the ATS, Cadillac's smallest vehicle was the [[Mid-size car|mid-size]] CTS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=[[General Motors|General Motors Company]] |location=Traverse City, Michigan |date=2011-08-04 |title=GM Poised to Thrive with New Cars, Tech, Reuss Says |url=http://media.gm.com/content/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2011/Aug/0804_Reuss_Overview |accessdate=2012-11-21 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CLYXfhXa?url=http://media.gm.com/content/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2011/Aug/0804_Reuss_Overview.html |archivedate=2012-11-21 |url-status=live |quote=Cadillac next year will launch the XTS large luxury sedan and a compact luxury sports sedan codenamed ATS, models that will bracket the CTS Sedan, Coupe and Wagon family, Reuss said at the Center for Automotive Research’s Management Briefing Seminars. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CTS was comparable in price to compact competitors like the [[Audi A4]], the [[BMW 3 Series]], the [[Lexus IS]] and the [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class]] but was comparable in size and weight to the more expensive mid-size [[BMW 5 Series]]. Although Cadillac believed that customers would favor a 5 Series sized car at a 3 Series price, that assumption proved to be incorrect. Cadillac's research found that target customers who already owned vehicles like the 3 Series or A4 did not want a larger vehicle. General Motors began development of a smaller car that would satisfy these target customers; that car would eventually become the Cadillac ATS.&lt;ref name=lorio&gt;{{cite web|last=Lorio |first=Joe |title=First Drive: 2013 Cadillac ATS |date=October 2012 |url=http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/driven/1210_2013_cadillac_ats/ |work=[[Automobile (magazine)|Automobile]] |publisher=[[Source Interlink|Source Interlink Media]] |issn=0894-3583 |oclc=44212172 |accessdate=2012-11-21 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CLlWAMDL?url=http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/driven/1210_2013_cadillac_ats/ |archivedate=2012-11-21 |quote=According to ATS chief engineer Dave Masch, one of the things Cadillac learned from its time spent with owners of competitive vehicles...was that 'buyers didn't want a bigger vehicle.' |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competitive benchmarking===
To establish parameters around which they would design the ATS, GM engineers benchmarked the 1999-2006 [[BMW 3 Series (E46)|BMW E46 3 Series]], which ATS chief engineer Dave Masch and his team regarded as the most dynamic and driver-focused iteration of the 3 Series.&lt;ref name=mackenzie2&gt;{{cite web|last=MacKenzie |first=Angus |title=2013 Cadillac ATS |url=http://www.motortrend.com/auto_shows/detroit/2012/1112_2012_detroit_2013_cadillac_ats_first_look/ |work=[[Motor Trend]] |publisher=Source Interlink Media |issn=0027-2094 |oclc=423854316 |date=January 2012 |accessdate=2012-01-09 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64ZUXe8E9?url=http://www.motortrend.com/auto_shows/detroit/2012/1112_2012_detroit_2013_cadillac_ats_first_look/ |archivedate=2012-01-09 |quote=The dynamic benchmark for the ATS was the E46 3 Series.... Masch's team believes BMW moved away from the driver-focused chassis tune of the E46 with the current 3 Series -- the E90 -- and expects that trend will continue with the next-gen 3 Series due later this year. |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The engineers emphasized low weight when developing the ATS and their efforts resulted in a finished vehicle that weighs less than the BMW E46 benchmark.&lt;ref name=lorio/&gt; To achieve this result, Masch suggested that the engineering team disregarded certain GM product development rules that, had they been followed, would have resulted in a heavier vehicle.&lt;ref name=MacKenzie&gt;{{cite web|last=MacKenzie |first=Angus |title=The Big Picture: Rulebreaker |url=http://www.motortrend.com/features/editorial/1203_the_big_picture_rulebreaker/ |work=Motor Trend |publisher=Source Interlink Media |issn=0027-2094 |oclc=423854316 |date=March 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-21 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CLo9WlDU?url=http://www.motortrend.com/features/editorial/1203_the_big_picture_rulebreaker/ |archivedate=2012-11-21 |quote='We broke a lot of our own rules,' says Dave Masch, chief engineer of the highly anticipated ATS... |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New platform and minor refresh for 2015===
During the early development of the ATS, GM engineers determined that downsizing the [[GM Sigma platform#Sigma II|GM Sigma II]] platform that underpinned the second-generation CTS would result in a vehicle that was too heavy and that using an economical, front-wheel drive platform would sacrifice performance. Under the leadership of Dave Leone, GM engineers created a brand-new platform which was designed to be light and compact, to be capable of handling both rear- and all-wheel drive configurations and to have a near 50/50 weight distribution. The new platform developed by the GM engineers for the ATS is now called the [[GM Alpha platform]].&lt;ref name=csere&gt;{{cite web

 |quote=Leone and his team started with a clean sheet of paper, creating a platform designed to be light and compact, with near 50/50 weight distribution as well as rear- and all-wheel drive.... The result is the new Alpha platform. For MY 2015, the Cadillac ATS will see a new front fascia that incorporates the brand's new wreath-less emblem, and a sleeker front bumper. The interior has been upgraded as well with new trim options as well as some new tech including Siri Eyes Free functionality, dictated text messaging and optional inductive smartphone charging.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2015 model year, the refreshed Cadillac ATS gained most of its styling from its Coupe version, the two-bar grille, redesigned Cadillac emblem, seen on the ATS coupe first, and will eventually be placed on every Cadillac lineup. Exterior tweaks for the 2015 Cadillac ATS front fascia has been lowered, and more exterior paint choices have been made. The ATS interior is a carryover for 2015, but has seen some modest technology updates for 2015 as well.

===2016 model year changes===
For the 2016 model year, the ATS replaces the 6-speed [[GM 6L50 transmission|6L45]] automatic transmission with the new 8-speed [[GM 8L45 transmission|8L45]] and the 3.6L [[GM High Feature engine#LFX|LFX]] V6 is replaced with a new generation 3.6L [[GM High Feature engine#LGX|LGX]] V6 featuring a cylinder deactivation system. Automatic start-stop technology was added for the 2.0T and 3.6L V6 models using the 8-speed automatic transmission. GM claimed this ultracapacitor-based system reduced CO2 output by 6 percent. &lt;ref&gt;https://media.cadillac.com/media/us/en/cadillac/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2015/oct/1009-technology-boost.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transmissions====
All versions of the ATS were equipped with a 6-speed GM 6L45 Hydra-Matic automatic transmission as standard until the 2015 model year. The 2.0-liter turbo, rear-wheel drive version can be mated to an optional 6-speed [[Tremec TR-3160 transmission|Tremec M3L TR-3160]] manual transmission.&lt;ref name=vettraino/&gt;&lt;ref name=ewing/&gt;

The 2016 model year ATS replaces all uses of the 6-speed 6L45 with the new 8-speed 8L45 automatic transmission.

For China, 2014 and 2015 models used the ''[[GM 6T70 transmission|GM 6T70]]'' gearbox. The ''[[GM 8L45 transmission|GM 8L45]]'' gearbox replaced it for 2016 models onwards.

The 2015 Cadillac ATS Coupe debuted at the 2014 [[Detroit Auto Show]]. The two door Cadillac targets [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class]] Coupe and the [[BMW 4 Series]]. It went on sale in the summer of 2014 as the 2015 Cadillac ATS Coupe. The ATS coupe is wider than the sedan. Two models were available at launch. One with a 2.0L four-cylinder engine with {{convert|272|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|295|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque, the other with a 3.6L engine with {{convert|321|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|275|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.

Previous ATS vehicles had been imported to China from GM's Lansing manufacturing facility in Michigan. The ATS-L has a starting price of 270,000 Chinese Yuan, or about $43,600 US dollars. The 2 litre LTG turbocharged petrol engine is standard across the range producing 230 and 279 horsepower. The ATS-L previously ran on the ''[[GM 6T70 transmission|GM 6T70]]'' automatic gearbox for 2014 and 2015 and used the ''[[GM 8L45 transmission|GM 8L45]]'' automatic gearbox from 2016 onwards.

The Cadillac ATS-V is a high performance version of the Cadillac ATS, similar to how the CTS-V is to the standard [[Cadillac CTS|CTS]] model. The ATS-V series includes two body styles, which feature a turbocharged [[DOHC]] V-6 engine and a sport-tuned suspension. The ATS-V sedan and coupe were introduced for the 2016 model year.

The sedan with the automatic transmission can reach 60 mph (97 km/h) in 3.7 seconds and can achieve a top speed of 189 mph (304 km/h). The ATS-V is rear-wheel drive, and is powered by a LF4 3.6L twin turbocharged V6 producing 464 hp (346 kW; 470 PS) and 445 lb⋅ft (603 N⋅m) of torque.

''[[Motor Trend]]'' conducted a comparison between the [[BMW M3]], ATS-V, and [[Mercedes-AMG C-Coupé DTM|Mercedes-AMG C63-S]]. The Cadillac managed to accelerate faster than both German vehicles and was the fastest around [[Willow Springs International Motorsports Park]]; it was also the least expensive in the test.

Cadillac competed at the [[Pirelli World Challenge]] from 2015 to 2017 with the Cadillac ATS-V.R, a racecar based on the ATS-V under the GT3 regulations, developed in collaboration with [[Pratt &amp; Miller]]. [[Johnny O'Connell]] won the championship in 2015, finished fourth in 2016 and sixth in 2017. In addition, Michael Cooper finished third in 2016 and second in 2017.

==Safety==
Testing conducted by the United States [[National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration]] scored the 2013 and 2014 ATS, in both rear- and all-wheel drive variants, at five stars in frontal crash, side crash and rollover protection, resulting in five stars overall, the highest possible score. The NHTSA notes the availability of three NHTSA recommended technologies on the ATS: electronic stability control, forward collision warning and lane departure warning.&lt;ref name=safecargov&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/5-Star+Safety+Ratings/2011-Newer+Vehicles/Search-Results?searchtype=model&amp;make=CADILLAC&amp;model=ATS&amp;year= |title=Search Results by Model |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=December 2012 |website=safecar.gov |publisher=[[United States Department of Transportation|U.S. Department of Transportation]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IkxAxYcU?url=http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/5-Star+Safety+Ratings/2011-Newer+Vehicles/Search-Results?searchtype=model&amp;make=CADILLAC&amp;model=ATS&amp;year=# |archivedate=2013-08-10 |url-status=live |accessdate=2013-08-09 |quote=2014 Cadillac ATS 4 DR RWD *****, 2014 Cadillac ATS 4 DR AWD ***** }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ramsey&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/12/11/2013-cadillac-ats-earns-rare-perfect-score-in-nhtsa-crash-tests/ |title=2013 Cadillac ATS Earns Rare Perfect Score in NHTSA Crash Tests |last=Ramsey |first=Jonathon |date=2012-12-11 |website=Autoblog |publisher=AOL |oclc=777730406 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IkxdTodk?url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/12/11/2013-cadillac-ats-earns-rare-perfect-score-in-nhtsa-crash-tests/ |archivedate=2013-08-10 |url-status=live |accessdate=2013-08-09 |quote=Now another vehicle in the General Motors stable has scored top marks on the frontal, side and rollover crash tests on its way to a five-star overall rating: the Cadillac ATS (in both rear- and all-wheel-drive variants). }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="6611" xml:space="preserve">The '''2005 Cadillac DTS Presidential State Car''' was the [[Presidential State Car (United States)|official state car]] used by President [[George W. Bush]] of the United States during the second term of his administration. Analogous to the President's use of an airplane designated ''[[Air Force One]]'', the automobile&amp;mdash;traditionally a [[limousine]]&amp;mdash;is informally known as "'''Cadillac One'''". The limousine model was replaced on January 20, 2009, upon the inauguration of President [[Barack Obama]], although both models are still in use.

==Specifications and capabilities==

}}

The model is a 2005 hand-crafted, custom built, heightened-roof, and armored vehicle designed with the styling of the [[Cadillac DTS]] sedan built on a [[General Motors|GM]] [[four-wheel drive]] platform.&lt;ref name="dtcad"&gt;{{cite news |first=Neil|last= McDonald |title=By George, a Caddie that's bulletproof |work= The Daily Telegraph (Australia) |date=2007-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle was custom built by [[Centigon (company)|Centigon]] (formerly [[O'Gara, Hess &amp; Eisenhardt]]).&lt;ref name="dtcad"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | agency=Associated Press | title=British company agrees to buy Armor Holdings | url=http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070508/BIZ/705080340/1001/BIZ | work=The Enquirer | date=May 8, 2007 | accessdate=2007-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first used on January 20, 2005, during the second [[Inauguration Day|inauguration parade]] of George W. Bush.

Most details of the car are classified for security reasons.&lt;ref name="limo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/automotive/new_cars/1269716.html?page=1|title=Take A Look Inside The President's New Cadillac One Limo|author=Merksamer, Gregg D|accessdate=2009-01-04|date=June 2001|publisher=Popular mechanics| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090119090912/http://www.popularmechanics.com/automotive/new_cars/1269716.html?page=1| archivedate= January 19, 2009 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle is one of a kind. It sports a tall roofline, an all-wheel drive set up based on that of the Cadillac Escalade, red and blue [[Emergency vehicle lighting|emergency lights]] built into the front grille, and is fitted with red strobe lights in the headlights and rear brake lights.&lt;ref name="limo"/&gt; The standard door handles have been replaced by those of a more loop design.&lt;ref name="limo"/&gt; The vehicle is completely fitted with military grade armor {{Convert|5|in|mm}} thick for maximum protection.&lt;ref name="limo"/&gt; The windows do not open, the wheels are fitted with [[run-flat tire|run flat tires]], and five antennas are mounted on the trunk lid.&lt;ref name="limo"/&gt; Due to the thickness of the glass, much natural light is excluded, so a fluorescent halo lighting system in the headliner is essential.&lt;ref name="limo"/&gt;

The car can seat seven people, including the President. The front seats two, and includes a console-mounted communications center.&lt;ref name="limo"/&gt; A glass partition divides the front from back. Three rear-facing seats are in the back, with cushions that are able to fold against the partition. The two rear seats are reserved for the president and another passenger; these seats have the ability to recline individually.&lt;ref name="limo"/&gt; A folding desk is between the two rear seats. Storage compartments in the interior panels of the car contain communications equipment.&lt;ref name="limo"/&gt;

==Use, 2005-==
On domestic trips, Cadillac One displays the American and [[Flags of the United States#Other federal flags|presidential standard]] flags, which are illuminated by directional [[High-intensity discharge lamp|flood lights]] mounted on the hood.&lt;ref name="limo"/&gt; The limousine is airlifted for domestic and international use primarily by a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[C-17 Globemaster III]]. When the President performs a [[state visit]] to a foreign country, the presidential standard is replaced by the foreign country's flag.

On May 23, 2011, the 2005 model presidential state car was involved in an incident when it got stuck on a ramp as it exited the [[Embassy of the United States in Dublin|U.S. Embassy in Dublin]], Ireland, during an official visit by President Obama. It is understood that the [[wheelbase]] of the vehicle was too great for the ramp and it had to be towed off the ramp as a large crowd looked on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/av/2011/0523/media-2963651.html |title=RTÉ.ie Extra Video: President Bush's car gets stuck leaving the US Embassy in Dublin - Video - RTÉ News Player |publisher=Rte.ie |date=2011-05-23 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Replacement===
On January 6, 2009, it was announced that a new, model year 2009, modified Cadillac would be used during the inauguration of President Barack Obama on January 20, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=David Shepardson | title=Obama to ride in style in GM limo, "The Beast"! | url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090106/AUTO01/901060373 | work=Detroit News | date=2009-01-06 | accessdate=2009-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNObama"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/01/06/driving.obama/index.html?eref=rss_topstories|title=Obama's wheels: Secret Service to unveil new presidential limo|last=Ahlers|first=Mike M.|author2=Eric Marrapodi|date=January 6, 2009|work=CNN.com|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2009-01-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090122235113/http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/01/06/driving.obama/index.html?eref=rss_topstories|archivedate= January 22, 2009 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model was replaced by the  {{slink|Presidential state car (United States)#2009-2018}} on that day. Both cars remain in the presidential fleet and the older model is occasionally used. The older model mainly serves as a backup to the primary vehicle.

The 1941 Series 61 had a fastback design.&lt;ref name="Kimes 1996"/&gt;

==Series 63==
The '''Series 63''' was similar to the 61. It was available as a sedan only and rode on the same wheelbase.

By the time the decision was made to drop the [[LaSalle (automobile)|LaSalle]] for 1941, at least three wood and metal mockups had been made for potential LaSalle models. One was based on the [[notchback]] [[GM C platform (RWD)|GM C platform]] which ended up being shared by the [[Cadillac Series 62]], [[Buick Roadmaster]] and [[Buick Super|Super]], the [[Oldsmobile 98|Oldsmobile 90]] and the [[Pontiac Torpedo|Pontiac Custom Torpedo]]. A second was based on the [[fastback]] [[GM B platform]] which ended up being shared by the Cadillac Series 61, the [[Buick Century]] and [[Buick Special|Special]], the [[Oldsmobile Series 70|Oldsmobile 70]] and the [[Pontiac Torpedo|Pontiac Streamliner Torpedo]]. A third was a modified notchback design, derived from the fastback B-body, but described as "[[GM A platform (RWD)|A-body]]-like", that ended up being used by the Cadillac Series 63. Any or all of these could have ended up being part of the next LaSalle line. However, it has been inferred that of the three, the third design was most likely to have been a LaSalle, with that platform being assigned exclusively to LaSalle, and that the second design, whose platform was shared with the Series 61, was the next most likely.&lt;ref name="SIA1997"&gt;{{cite journal|title=1941 Cadillac Series 63: The Last LaSalle|journal=Special Interest Autos|issue=#159 May–June 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sales of the Series 63 were 5,030 in 1941.&lt;ref name="Kimes 1996"/&gt;

The formerly-smaller Series 61 was moved to the [[Cadillac Series 62|Series 62]]'s General Motors [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-Body]] platform, making them very similar. Major design changes marked the C-bodied Cadillacs for 1948. They featured General Motors first all-new postwar body with styling advances including tailfins inspired by the [[Lockheed P-38]] fighter plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1948_Cadillac/1948_Cadillac_Brochure/1948Cadillac-10.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1948_Cadillac/1948_Cadillac_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also an attractive eggcrate grille, which was higher in the middle than on the sides. The front of the car was protected by a heavier and more massive bumper bar that curved around the fenders. The Cadillac crest was centered low in a "V" above the radiator grille. Chrome headlamp rims were used. Cars in the 61 series lacked bright metal front fender shields and under-taillight trim. A new dashboard with "rainbow" style instrument cluster and leather grained panels extending to the carpets was seen only this year.

The big news at Cadillac in 1949 centered on engineering, with the release of a new overhead valve V8 engine. This 331&amp;nbsp;in³ engine produced 160&amp;nbsp;hp (119&amp;nbsp;kW). Only minor appearance changes were seen. They included a more massive grille treatment with grooved extension panels housing the front parking lights and chevron slashes below the taillamps on the coupes. Once again the cars in this line lacked front fender gravel shields and rocker panel moldings and had plainer interior trim. A larger luggage compartment lid was seen on all sedans except early production units. Standard equipment now included twin back-up lamps mounted on the deck lid latch panel.

Cadillacs had extensive styling changes in 1950, as its appearance is similar to cross-town rival [[Chrysler Imperial#1949–1954|Chrysler Imperial]] and the [[Chrysler New Yorker#1949–1954|Chrysler New Yorker]] initially in 1949, and less so with yearly appearance changes. They looked generally heavier and had low sleek contours with longer rear decks, more sweeping front fenders and a broken rear fender line. The hood protruded more at front and was underlined by a more massive eggcrate grille. Round parking lights were used, but as in the past, when buyers chose fog lamps an additional bulb and larger housing were used. This setup combined the fog lamps and the directional signals. One piece windshields were introduced and the leading edge of the rear fenders which had a broken-off look, was highlighted by chrome imitation air slots. The rear fenders were longer and ended in a swooping tailfin design. The Cadillac script again appeared on the sides of the front fenders, but was now positioned closer to the front door opening gap. As far as Series 61 models went a big styling change was a return to marketing this line on the shorter wheelbase B-body than used on the Series 62. This led to some styling differences. For example, the Series 61 Sedan had no rear window ventipanes and featured a rear wraparound backlight. An identifying feature on both models was the absence of rocker panel moldings and rear quarter panel chrome underscores. The Series 61 was 4 inches shorter than in the previous season.

A minor face lift and small trim variations were the main Cadillac styling news in 1951. Miniature eggcrate grilles were set into the outboard grille extension panels below the headlights. Larger, bullet shaped bumper guards were used. The features list included handbrake, warning lamp; key start ignition; steering column cover; Delco-Remy generator; knee-action front suspension; directionals; mechanical fuel pump; dual downdraft carburetor; slipper-type pistons; rubber engine mounts; oversize brakes; Super Cushion tires; one-piece windshield; intake silencer; 160-hp engine; oil bath air cleaner; equalized manifolding; automatic choke and luxury appointments. On the dashboard "idiot lights" were used to monitor oil pressure and electrical charge rate instead of gauges. The smaller body was once again used on the 61s and again identified by the lack of chrome underscores. However a new medallion appeared on the rear roof pillar of the Series 61, above the upper beltline molding.

==Racing==

In 1950, [[Briggs Cunningham]] and his team bought 2 Series 61 DeVilles to the 1950 24 Hours of Le Mans. One of the Cars was modified for racing, dubbed "LeMonstre". the other was bought along bone stock with some minor modifications. The stock coupe finished 10th overall while the modded car finished 11th because Cunningham got stuck in the sand for 30 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Cadillac Allanté''' is a two-door, two-seater luxury [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]] produced by [[Cadillac]] from 1987 until 1993. It used a Cadillac chassis and running gear with a body built in Italy by [[coachbuilder]] [[Pininfarina]]. It was expensive to produce with the complete bodies flown to Detroit for final assembly. Over 21,000 were built during its seven-year production run.

==Overview==
The name ''Allanté'' was selected by [[General Motors]] from a list of 1,700 computer generated selections.&lt;ref name="name"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Confusing Story of the Cadillac Allante |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |first=Michelle |last=Higgins |date=December 2, 2004 |url=https://www.wsj.com/public/article_print/SB110194232087888545.html |access-date=March 13, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502202118/http://online.wsj.com/public/article_print/SB110194232087888545.html |archive-date=May 2, 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally designed to compete with the [[Mercedes-Benz R107 and C107|Mercedes-Benz SL]] and [[Jaguar XJS]], the Allanté originally featured a slightly modified variant of the 4.1&amp;nbsp;L [[V8 engine|V8]] used across Cadillac's model line. This was expanded to 4.5&amp;nbsp;L in 1989, and upgraded to the 4.6&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Northstar engine series#L37|L37 Northstar]]'' in its final year, 1993.

The Allanté incorporated an international production arrangement that was similar to the early 1950s [[Nash-Healey]] two-seat sports car. The Allanté bodies were designed and manufactured in Italy by [[Pininfarina]]&lt;ref name="nyt6"&gt;{{cite news | title =The few, the rich, Pininfarina |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 19, 1987 |first=Marshall |last=Shuon |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/19/automobiles/the-few-the-rich-pininfarina.html |accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were shipped {{convert|4600|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} to the U.S. final assembly with domestically manufactured chassis and engine.&lt;ref name="nyt6"/&gt; Specially equipped [[Boeing 747]]s departed from [[Turin International Airport]] with 56 bodies at a time,&lt;ref name="nyt6"/&gt; arriving at Detroit's [[Coleman A. Young International Airport]] about 3 miles northeast of Cadillac's new [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly|Hamtramck Assembly]] plant, known as the "Allanté Air Bridge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ernst |first=Kurt |title=Lost Cars of the 1980s – Cadillac Allante |url= https://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2013/09/30/lost-cars-of-the-1980s-cadillac-allante/ |website=blog.hemmings.com |date=13 September 2013 |accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ericpetersautos.com/2015/03/08/1986-1993-cadillac-allante-they-got-it-right-too-late/ |title=1986-1993 Cadillac Allante: They Got it Right ... Too Late |first=Eric |last=Peters |date=8 March 2015 |publisher=EPautos |accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expensive shipping process stemmed from GM's recent closing of [[Fleetwood Metal Body|Fisher Body Plant #18]], which had supplied Cadillac bodies since 1921. It was not the first time that Cadillac utilized Pininfarina, having farmed out body production for the [[Cadillac Eldorado#Third generation .281957-1960.29|1959 Eldorado Brougham]] and design and coachworks for [[Pininfarina#Concept cars.2C Prototypes and Individual commissions|several one-offs, customs, and concept cars]].

All Allanté models featured a fully electronic instrument and control panel, which was angled towards the driver, and featured no knobs or manual controls. [[General Motors]] (GM) also implemented electronic controls in its mid-to-late 1980s vehicles such as the [[Buick Reatta]], [[Buick Riviera]], and [[Oldsmobile Toronado]] Trofeo, although these vehicles included a touchscreen control panel called the Graphic Control Center (GCC), which the Allanté did not feature.

==1987==
The [[front-wheel drive]] Allanté roadster featured a [[Front-engine,_front-wheel-drive_layout#Front-engine_transversely_mounted_.2F_Front-wheel_drive|transverse]] [[fuel injection|multi-port fuel injected]] variant of GM's aluminum {{convert|4.1|L|CID|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac High Technology engine#HT-4100|HT-Cadillac 4100]] [[V8 engine|V8]], along with roller valve lifters, high-flow cylinder heads, and a tuned intake manifold. Suspension was independent strut front and rear, with [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] ABS III four-wheel [[disc brake]]s. A removable aluminum hardtop, Delco-GM/[[Bose Corporation|Bose]] Symphony Sound System (a $905 option on other Cadillacs), the industry's first power retractable AM/FM/Cellular Telephone antenna, and a complex lamp-out module that substituted an adjacent lamp for a burned-out bulb in the exterior lighting system until the dead one could be replaced were all standard. The only option was a cellular telephone, installed in a lockable center console. The base price came in at $54,700.

==1988==
For 1988, the Allanté featured revised front seat headrests, and a power decklid pulldown as standard equipment. Analog instruments, in place of the standard digital dash cluster, were also now available as a no-charge option. The base price was raised to $56,533, with the cellular telephone still being the only extra-cost option.

==1989==
[[File:Red closed Cadillac Allante fl.jpg|right|thumb|Cadillac Allanté]]
In 1989, the base price rose to $57,183.  Allanté's engine, the new [[Cadillac High Technology engine#4.5|273ci (4.5L)]] [[V8 engine|V8]], produced {{Convert|200|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, and with {{convert|270|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque, {{Citation needed span|text=it provided the most torque from any front-wheel-drive automobile in the world.|date=November 2018|reason=}} Unlocking the trunk also unlocked the side doors – similar to Mercedes-Benz and BMW. As a theft-deterrent, Allanté added GM's Pass Key (Personal Automotive Security System), utilizing a resistor pellet within the ignition key that has the ability to render the fuel system and starter inoperative if an incorrect ignition key is used. Allanté also received a new speed-sensitive [[shock absorber|damper]] system called [[Speed Dependent Damping Control]], or SD²C. This system firmed up the suspension at {{convert|25|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and again at {{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The firmest setting was also used when starting from a standstill until {{convert|5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Another change was a variable-assist steering system.

==1990==
{{unsourced|section|date=September 2018}}
In 1990, Cadillac offered a lower-priced ($53,050) companion model with a cloth convertible roof and without the removable aluminum hardtop, and a model including the hardtop at $58,638. By midyear, prices were dropped to $57,813 for the hardtop/convertible and $51,500 for the convertible, which included a $650 [[Gas Guzzler Tax]] along with $550 destination charge. The fully integrated cellular telephone, which was equipped from the factory on just 36 cars this year, was available for an additional $1,195. Allanté's bumper-to-bumper new car warranty, seven years and {{convert|100000|mi|km||abbr=on}}, was three years longer than other Cadillacs, and an additional {{convert|50000|mi|km|abbr=on}} of coverage. Allanté owners also received a special toll-free number to call for service or concerns. Headlamp washers and dual 10-way [[Recaro]] seating remained standard. A driver's side airbag was added to the leather-wrapped steering wheel, eliminating the telescoping steering wheel &amp;mdash; which retained its tilt feature. The analog instrument cluster – introduced the previous year – was standard on the convertible (available at no extra cost on the hardtop/convertible), with a total of 358 cars equipped with the analog cluster. 

The power mirror control moved from the right of the steering column on the instrument panel to a new location on the upper end of the driver's door armrest, while the power seat switches (previously mounted on the face of the seat base) were relocated to the lower side trim of the seat base facing the door panels. The 3-channel garage door opener base mounted on the header panel above the windshield was eliminated when a new sun visor design was introduced this year. Traction control was added – the first front-wheel drive automobile with a V8 to be equipped as such. The system was designed to cut fuel to up to four cylinders to reduce power and optimize traction. 

The [[Speed Dependent Damping Control|electronically controlled shock absorbers]] were retuned to remain in "soft" mode for up to {{convert|40|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Previously, they entered "normal" mode after just {{convert|25|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. A revised audio system allowed a CD player to be added as standard equipment, along with the cassette player. Of the 2,523 built for 1990, only five were exported – four to [[Canada]] and one to Germany. Allanté was available in eight colors this year, the most popular was ''Euro Red'', found on 1,012 cars, while the least chosen was ''Gray Metallic'', with only 28 made. Interior color choices (and production figures) were ''Charcoal Gray'' (1,343), ''Natural Beige'' (767), and ''Maroon'' (413).

==1991==
[[File:1991 Cadillac Allanté rear.jpg|right|thumb|1991 Cadillac Allanté]]
In 1991, Cadillac added a power-latching mechanism for the convertible top, and the digital instrument cluster, featured in all but 275 Allanté models this year, was repriced (it was now a $495 option for the convertible model). Prices began at $57,260, although a midyear price-drop brought the Allanté convertible down to $55,900, and the hardtop/convertible down to $61,450 (from $62,810). Allanté had 16.3 cubic feet of storage (when utilizing the pass-through compartment into the cabin area). Of the 1,928 models produced for 1991, only seven were manufactured for export – five to Canada, one to Italy, and another to Puerto Rico. Canadian models offered a kilometer-based instrument cluster, daytime running lamps, and an engine block heater as standard equipment, while the Italian model featured a list of European-mandated modifications, including breakaway side mirrors, specific European headlamps and turn signals, a front tow hook, rear fog lamps, deletion of the deck-lid mounted center brake light, a wet-arm windshield washer system, coolers for the power steering and [[automatic transmission]] fluids, and a revised steering column to compensate for the removal of the driver's airbag.

==1992==
The Allanté for 1992 was priced at $58,470 for the convertible, and $64,090 for the hardtop/convertible. Both prices included the mandated gas guzzler tax, which was now at $1,300. As it had been the custom for a few years now, price drops were announced midyear, $57,170 for the convertible, and $62,790 with the removable hardtop. The optional digital cluster was priced at $495 (available at no charge on the removable hardtop model), however, only 187 cars were equipped with the standard analog cluster this year. Also available on the convertible at extra-cost, a pearl white paint group (option YL3) priced at $700 (found on 443 models for 1992). This was the last year of the multi-adjustable [[Recaro]] seating design, as 1993 would go into production with less expensive [[Lear Corporation|Lear]]-designed eight-way dual power seats. Of the 1,698 produced this year, only four of them were specifically built for export – all of them to Canada. As with the previous year, the most popular exterior, found on 549 models, was ''47U – Euro Red'', while only 15 were made in ''49U – Light Blue Metallic''. Three shades of leather were available for the interior, the colors and production totals are: Charcoal (859), Natural Beige (652), Maroon (187), (50) Polo Green, and one Pearl Flax, (O4U).

==1993==
Introduced in early 1992 for the 1993 model year, Allanté was scaled down to just one model this year, the soft-top convertible priced at $59,975 (not including a mandatory $1,700 gas guzzler tax for vehicles sold in the United States). The removable {{convert|60.5|lb|abbr=on}}. aluminum hardtop was now a separate option, as well as the $495 LCD digital instrument cluster in place of the standard analog instruments. A $700 pearlcoat paint option (in Flax or Canyon Yellow, with Hawaiian Orchid added midyear) was available. Also optional were chrome squeeze-cast aluminum wheels. For its final model year, Allanté received the {{convert|4.6|L|CID|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac Northstar engine|Northstar]] [[DOHC]] V8 engine. It was rated at {{convert|295|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5600&amp;nbsp;rpm. [[Torque]] output was {{convert|290|ftlb|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 4400&amp;nbsp;rpm. A new unequal-length control arm rear suspension, shared with the [[Cadillac Seville|Seville]] and [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]], was also introduced that year. Also new for the small Cadillacs was [[Road Sensing Suspension]], an active [[Shock absorber|damper]] management system, and revised disc brakes. The 1993 model used GM's [[Delco Electronics|Delco]] "Premium Symphony Sound System". Other changes for the Allanté included a revised variable-assist [[power steering]] rack, deeper front spoiler, and single-piece side windows, which did away with the stationary forward vent window. Production for 1993 was the highest. Of the 4,670 Allantés manufactured for the 1993 model year, 115 were for export – France (1), Austria (2), Belgium (5), Germany (5), Switzerland (6), Japan (11), and Canada (85).{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The 1993 Allanté was also chosen as the 1992 [[pace car]] for the 76th Indy 500 [[1992 Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis 500]], the pace car was driven by [[Bobby Unser]]. There were three modified 1993 Allanté Pace Cars that had only seat belts, lighted roll bar, and air intake modified from a stock production Allanté's, those three Allanté Pace cars were provided for the race, as well as just 30 stock 1993 Allanté's used as Festival/Pace Cars and 58 stock 1992 Allanté Festival/Pace cars that were used by drivers and crews at the opening parade and the closing of the race. Al Unser Jr's 1993 Allanté Festival/Pace car was featured at both the 2012, and 2013 Keel's &amp; Wheel's Concours D’Elegance in Seabrook, Texas, Bobby Unser was Grand Marshal in 2012, and Al Unser Jr was Grand Marshal in 2013.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The last Allanté built was flown from Turin, Italy on July 2, 1993, and completed at Detroit-Hamtramck 14 days later. With 21,430 built, assemblies averaged just a little more than 3,000 a year throughout the car's lifetime. Production officially ended on July 16, 1993.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The '''Cadillac Series 355''' was manufactured by [[Cadillac]] from 1931 to 1935. They were 8-cylinder cars, sold in several models: a 2-door [[coupe|club coupe]], a 2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]], 4-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]], a 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] a 4-door [[town car]] and a 4-door [[limousine]].

== Models ==
=== 355A (1931) ===
The 1931 Series 355A was very similar to the Series 353 except it was longer and lower, had a longer hood with five hood ports, with matching doors in the cowl. There was a modified coach sill with no compartments in the splash pan. The battery and tool compartment were now under the front seat. Floor boards were made of metal for the first time. The instrument panel was oval with the same gauge groupings as in the Series 353. The Series 355 featured a radiator screen, a single bar bumper and dual horns. The headlight diameter was reduced by one inch. There was a new frame with divergent side rails. The suspension springs now had metal covers. The radiator was mounted lower in the frame and there was now a condenser tank for cooling operation. The engine was the same {{convert|353|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#L-Head|L-Head]] [[V8 engine|V8]] as on the Series 353, thus the series designation no longer matched the displacement. Engine horsepower was 95. A five point engine suspension, similar to the [[Cadillac V-16|V-16]] was used. An intake muffler was added and the distributor was mounted {{convert|1.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} higher. The fan was mounted lower to match the lower radiator. Model year sales totaled 10,717.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gunnell2005"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== 355B (1932) ===
The 1932 Series 355B was even longer and lower, with an entirely restyled front assembly. The roof line was lowered {{convert|1|-|3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. The longer hood now had six hood ports. The new front end styling included a flat grille built into the radiator shell, head and side lights of streamlined bullet shape and the elimination of the fender tie bar and monogram bar. The trumpets of the dual horns projected through the headlight stanchions. The headlight lenses were {{convert|9.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} in diameter. The dual taillights matched the headlights. Super safe lighting featured three filament bulbs and four contour positions for degree and angle of illumination. The front license plate was mounted on the bumper. Runningboards curved to match the sweep of the front fenders and blended into the rear fenders. The tail of the rear fenders blended into the fuel tank valence. The trunk on the town sedan, town coupe and five-passenger convertible coupe was integral with the body. The vision of the driver was improved by 30 percent as a result of the elimination of the outside visor and the construction of a 12 degree sloping windshield and corner posts. There was a large ventilator on top of the cowl and none on the sides. All separate body moldings were eliminated. A three spoke steering wheel enabled an unobstructed view of the instrument cluster when in the straight ahead position. The right side of the instrument panel was occupied by a "locker." Engine horsepower increased to 115. The deepening [[Great Depression]] helped sales plummet to 2,700.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gunnell2005"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== 355C (1933) ===
[[File:Cadillac 1933 Series 355-C Five-Passenger Sedan V-8.jpg|thumb|1933 Cadillac Series 355C]]

The bumpers on the 1933 Series 355C were sectioned, with plain ends and a three bar center. The grille was made V-shaped and blended into the painted (chrome optional) radiator shell. The radiator cap disappeared under the hood on the right side (same side as the oil level gauge). The fender tie bar, after a year's absence was sectioned and the center section was hidden behind the grille. Six horizontal doors replaced the vertical hood doors. [[Fender skirts|Skirts]] were added to the front and rear fenders. The most significant change in body detail was the introduction of no-draft Individually Controlled Ventilation (ICV) or pivoting [[Quarter glass|vent windows]] in the front doors and the rear quarter or rear door windows. In early production the front door window had to be lowered to disengage the channel at its front edge from the vent window to allow the vent window to pivot. In later production the sealing channel was attached to the door frame rather than to the window glass so that the vent window could be operated independently of the window glass. Windshield and rear quarter windows were made stationary. Absence of a windshield operating mechanism on the closed car allowed room to conceal the wiper motor behind the headboard. The cowl ventilator was baffled and drained in such a way as to be rainproof. Chassis changes were few and minor in nature. Controlled [[Freewheel|free wheeling]] was discontinued. Vacuum assist was added to the brake system. Changes in shock absorber valves extended the range of the ride control system. During the model year the dual point four lobe distributor was replaced by a single point eight lobe unit. A radio was optional. Model year sales were 2,100.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gunnell2005"/&gt;

=== 355D (1934) ===
The 1934 Model 355D was completely restyled and mounted on an entirely new chassis but used the same engine as in 1933. The Model 355 was divided into three series, the Series 10, 20 and 30. Bodies on the Series 10 and 20 were built by [[Fisher Body|Fisher]] and on the Series 30 by [[Fleetwood Metal Body|Fleetwood]]. The bodies on the Series 30 were shared with the [[Cadillac V-12]] and V-16. Styling emphasized streamlining, including concealment of all chassis features except the wheels. Body construction was improved for better insulation against engine heat and reduction of engine, road and wind noise. Bumpers were a stylish but ineffective biplane design, mounted against telescoping springs. The grille was V-shaped and sloping, set into a painted shell. Although restricted use of chrome was a feature of the overall ornamentation, a chrome plated radiator shell was available as an option. Horns and radiator filler cap were concealed under the hood. Teardrop Guide Multibeam headlights were mounted on streamlined supports attached to the fenders. Parking lamps were mounted on the headlight supports. Airfoil shaped fenders were brought low over the chassis. The hood sills were high with the entire fender shape molded into the radiator shell. A curious horizontal crease broke the nose contour of the fenders. Hoods extending nearly to the windshield carried shutter-type louvers in the side panel. Windshields were fixed and steeply sloping; 18 degrees on Fisher bodies, 25 degrees flat or a 29.5 degree V on Fleetwood bodies. Cowl vents opened toward the windshield; one vent on flat windshield bodies, two vents projecting through openings in the hood on V-shaped windshield bodies. Bodies were {{convert|2.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} lower than on previous models. Added passenger space in the front compartment was achieved by moving the hand brake lever to the left of the driver, under the instrument panel. Rear fenders were airfoil shaped and carried rear lights that matched the headlights. The gas tank filler was on the left side at the rear of the body, on Fleetwood bodies in the left rear fender. All bodies featured beaver tail deck that completely covered the chassis. On Fleetwood bodies the spare was concealed under the rear deck, unless optional fender mounts were specified. Independent front suspension was introduced, called "knee-action". Engine horsepower increased to 120.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gunnell2005"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== 355E (1935) ===
The 1935 Model 355E remained virtually unchanged from 1934. The biplane bumpers of 1934 were replaced with more conventional units. One major change was introduced on Fisher bodies, the all steel Turret Top. Fleetwood bodies would not have the Turret Top until 1936. Having been associated with funeral and ambulance equipment for many years, Cadillac embarked on an extra effort to consolidate this business in 1935. Three Fleetwood bodied seven passenger livery sedans were offered on the Series 30 chassis. Additionally a {{convert|160.0|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase commercial chassis was offered for hearse and ambulance adaptation. Engine horsepower increased yet again to 130. Combined model year sales for 1934 and 1935 totaled 8,318.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gunnell2005"/&gt;

The '''Cadillac STS''' (Seville Touring Sedan) is a [[Mid-size car|mid-size]]d [[luxury car|luxury]] 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] manufactured and sold by [[General Motors]] from 2004 to 2011 for the 2005 to 2011 model years.  A version of the STS was sold in China as the SLS through 2013.  It was equipped with a six-speed [[automatic transmission]] with performance algorithm shifting and driver shift control.&lt;ref name=6speed&gt;[http://media.gm.com/us/powertrain/en/news/press_kits/05naias_kit/ GM POWERTRAIN LAUNCHES NEW HYDRA-MATIC SIX-SPEED AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523111630/http://media.gm.com/us/powertrain/en/news/press_kits/05naias_kit/ |date=2009-05-23 }}. ''GM.com'' press release, January 10, 2005. Retrieved on August 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The STS was the successor to the [[Cadillac Seville]],&lt;ref name="newbury2006"/&gt; which beginning in 1987 was available as an upscale performance-oriented ''STS'' (for ''Seville Touring Sedan'') version, and comfort-oriented ''SLS'' (for Seville Luxury Sedan). The next year, the STS received Cadillac's then-new [[Northstar engine series|Northstar System]], including the aluminium [[DOHC]] [[Northstar engine series#L37|''L37'' Northstar]] [[V8 engine]].

While smaller than the full-size [[Cadillac DTS|DTS]], the more expensive STS was the flagship sedan of the Cadillac brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.autozine.org/Archive/GM/old/STS.html|title=Cadillac STS|website=www.autozine.org|access-date=2019-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==
The Cadillac STS was rated with a four star frontal and five star rear passenger crash test rating from the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safercar.gov/ |title=Safecar.gov |publisher=Safercar.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was given an overall "Good" score in the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] frontal crash test and an "Acceptable" rating in the side impact test.&lt;ref name="iihs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=242 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Cadillac STS |publisher=Iihs.org |date=2008-11-25 |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the side impact test injury measurements to the driver's pelvis was rated "Poor" and for the torso "Acceptable."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=828 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Cadillac STS |publisher=Iihs.org |date=2008-11-25 |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2005-2007 ==
[[File:2005-2007 Cadillac STS.jpg|thumb|left|2005–2007 Cadillac STS]]
The [[front wheel drive]] Seville model name was retired in 2004, succeeded by an entirely new "STS" based on the [[rear wheel drive]] [[GM Sigma platform]]. The first Cadillac sedan to be offered with [[All wheel drive]], it retained the Seville's high-performance [[Magnetic Ride Control]] suspension.  The Cadillac STS was assembled at GM's [[Lansing Grand River]] facility in [[Lansing, Michigan]] along with the smaller [[Cadillac CTS|CTS]] sedan.

Available engines were a 3.6&amp;nbsp;L [[GM High Feature engine#LY7|High Feature LY7]] [[V6]] with {{convert|255|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|252|lbft|N.m|abbr=on}} and the 4.6&amp;nbsp;L [[Northstar engine series#LH2|Northstar LH2]] [[V8 engine|V8]] which puts out {{convert|320|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|315|lbft|N.m|abbr=on}} in the STS. All engine models feature dual overhead camshafts with [[variable valve timing]]. Remote ignition is standard.

Overall length was down 5" to 196.3", yet wheelbase grew by 4" to {{convert|116.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, resulting in increased interior space. A [[heads-up display]] was optional, as was a 300-watt [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] stereo system with [[MP3]] capability. Base pricing at launch ranged from [[USD|US$]]40,575 for the V6 model to [[USD|US$]]47,025 for the V8.

== 2008-2011 ==
[[File:2008-2009 Cadillac STS.jpg|250px|thumb|right|2008–2011 Cadillac STS]]The STS was updated for 2008. Changes included a refreshed exterior, with styling cues resembling the 2008 [[Cadillac CTS|CTS]], such as larger, more aggressive grille and chrome fender vents. The interior was updated, with new materials and a new steering wheel, though the overall interior design remained the same, despite previous rumors of an all-new interior similar to that of the Chinese-market SLS. The standard powertrain was a [[gasoline direct injection|direct-injected]] 3.6&amp;nbsp;L [[V6 engine|V6]] mated to a six-speed [[automatic transmission]], which in the STS produced {{convert|302|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|272|lbft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. It also offered enhanced safety features, including a [[lane departure warning system]] developed by [[Mobileye]], a [[blind spot monitoring system]], and an improved version of GM's [[StabiliTrak]] stability control system, which could operate the steering system in addition to the brakes to help correct a skid. Additionally, options previously limited to the [[V8 engine|V8]] model (such as [[HID headlamp]]s and [[Automotive head-up display]]) were available with the [[V6 engine|V6]]. The 2008 Cadillac STS debuted at the 2007 [[New York Auto Show]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.windingroad.com/body-stylesmarket-segment/sedans/cadillac-ups-sts-horsepower-rating-to-302] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523102225/http://news.windingroad.com/body-stylesmarket-segment/sedans/cadillac-ups-sts-horsepower-rating-to-302 |date=May 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 update for the STS removed the GM badges, although early 2010 models still retained GM badging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detnews.com/article/20090825/AUTO01/908250320/1148/rss25 |title=GM to drop corporate logo from vehicles - Detroit News |publisher=The Detroit News |date= |accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For 2011, the V8 was dropped from the Cadillac STS lineup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/2011-gm-order-guide-changes-for-chevrolet-camaro-corvette-hhr-malibu-cadillac-sts/ |title=2011 GM Order Guide: Changes for Chevrolet Camaro, Corvette, HHR, Malibu; Cadillac STS |date= |accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2006 V-series [[Cadillac STS-V|STS-V]] was introduced at the [[Detroit Auto Show#2005|2005 Detroit Auto Show]]. It features a [[supercharged]] 4.4&amp;nbsp;L version of the [[Cadillac Northstar engine#Supercharged|Northstar]] [[V8 engine|V8]], along with handling upgrades. This engine is certified by the SAE to produce {{convert|469|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|439|lbft|N.m|abbr=on}}.  The model was discontinued in 2009.

The Chinese market received the Cadillac SLS in November 2006 for the 2007 model year.  It was assembled by [[Shanghai GM]].  Compared to the STS, the SLS has a longer wheelbase, unique interior appointments, and a near-identical exterior appearance. Engine choices included the 2.8-liter ''[[GM High Feature engine#LP1|LP1]]''  V-6, 3.6 ''[[GM High Feature engine#LY7|LY7]]'' V-6 and the 4.6-liter Northstar V-8 as in the STS V-8 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ovidiu Sopa @ Xtreme WD |url=http://www.supercarnews.net/2007-cadillac-shanghai-gm-sls-chinese-version |title=2007 Cadillac Shanghai GM SLS Chinese Version &amp;#124; Cadillac |publisher=Supercarnews.net |date= |accessdate=2009-08-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604110922/http://www.supercarnews.net/2007-cadillac-shanghai-gm-sls-chinese-version# |archive-date=2009-06-04 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; from 2007 to 2009. The 3.6 liter ''[[GM High Feature engine#LLT|LLT]]'' engine was available from 2010 to 2011  until it was replaced by the 2.0 liter ''[[GM Ecotec engine#LDK|LDK]]'' and the 3.0 liter ''[[GM High Feature engine#LF1|LF1]]'' V6 for 2011 to 2013 models.

[[File:Cadillac SLS China 2012-04-21.JPG|250px|thumb|left|2007–2009 Cadillac SLS]]

The '''Cadillac V-12''' is a top-of-the-line car that was manufactured by [[Cadillac (automobile)|Cadillac]] from the 1931 through the 1937 model years. All were furnished with custom bodies, and the car was built in relatively small numbers. A total of 10,903 were made in the seven model years that the automobile was built, with the majority having been constructed in its inaugural year.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; It was Cadillac's first, and is to date, Cadillac's only standard production [[V12 engine|V-12]] powered car.&lt;ref name="gunnell2005"/&gt;

==Origin==
[[File:1931Cadillac370AcoupeV12-engine.jpg|thumb|left|Cadillac V-12 engine]]
In the mid to late 1920s a number of luxury car manufacturers began work developing multicylinder engines. Not to be outdone, Cadillac began work on two different multicylinder engines, a V-12 and a [[V16 engine|V-16]]. Larry Fisher, Cadillac General Manager, leaked to the press information about the V-12, hoping to keep the V-16 a secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Hemmings]] Classic Car|page=17|issue=December 2006|title=In the Halls of Power}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Owen Nacker]], who designed the [[Cadillac V-16 engine]], also designed the [[Cadillac V-16 engine#V12|Cadillac V-12 engine]], and it shared the tooling and many of the components of the V-16. The V-12 was essentially a truncated V-16, with a bore of 3.125" instead of 3", and retaining the V-16's 4" stroke, giving it a displacement of 368 cubic inches. It shared the V-16's 45 degree bank angle., rather than the 60 degree angle that would have been ideal. The V-12 was less powerful than the V-16, generating 135 versus 175 horsepower.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gunnell2005"/&gt; Both engines featured overhead valves in the first generation.

The 1931 Model 370A V-12 was introduced in October 1930. A V-12 roadster was used as the pace car at the [[Indianapolis 500]]. The Cadillac V-12 had a shorter wheelbase than the [[Cadillac V-16]], with a choice of {{convert|140|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} or {{convert|143|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, compared to the V-16's {{convert|148|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, but it offered a similar choice of [[Fisher Body|Fisher]] and [[Fleetwood Metal Body|Fleetwood]] semi-custom bodies. It was difficult to tell a Cadillac V-12 from a Cadillac V-16 unless you were close enough to read the figure "12" mounted on the headlight tie bar, but the hood was four inches (102&amp;nbsp;mm) shorter, and the headlights and horns smaller than a V-16's. More significantly, the V-12 cost about $2,000 less for each bodystyle, starting at $3,795. The Cadillac V-12 might have been lower in prestige than the Cadillac V-16, but it joined a select group of 1930s cars with multicylinder engines, namely those manufactured by [[Auburn Automobile|Auburn]], [[Franklin (automobile)|Franklin]], [[Hispano-Suiza]], [[Horch]], [[Lagonda]], [[Maybach]], [[Packard]], [[Pierce-Arrow]], [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]], [[Tatra (car)|Tatra]], [[Avions Voisin|Voisin]], [[Walter Engines|Walter]], [[Marmon Motor Car Company|Marmon]] and [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]]. Moreover, thanks to its lower price, it immediately outsold the Cadillac V-16 with 5,733 sold in the 1931 model year, versus a mere 363 for the V-16.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gunnell2005"/&gt;

The appearance of the 1932 Series 370B benefited from a radiator shell that flared on the top, more flaring fenders and curved running boards. Mechanical changes included a stiffer frame, and a Cuno self-cleaning oil filter mounted at the right hand side of the clutch housing. Dual Detroit Lubricator carburetors were used in place of the Cadillac/Johnson carburetors that had been standard equipment on Cadillacs for 20 years. Largely thanks to the deepening [[Great Depression]] sales plunged to 1740 units.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gunnell2005"/&gt;

Styling changes to the 1933 Series 370C included a V-shaped grill that blended into the painted radiator shell, a radiator cap hidden under the hood, and skirts on the front and rear fenders for a more streamlined look. Fisher no-draft individually controlled vent windows were a new standard feature. Sales fell further to 953 cars.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gunnell2005"/&gt;

The 1934 Series 370D was restyled yet again but this time was mounted on a completely new chassis. The radiator grill slanted rearward with a central bar and five horizontal sections, the windshield sloped even more rearward, headlights were enclosed in new teardrop housings mounted on streamlined supports, the horns joined the radiator cap under the hood, the spare tire was concealed under a new beaver tail deck on most models and the whole car sat approximately {{Convert|2|in|mm}} lower. Significant mechanical advancements included dual X-frame chassis construction, "[[Dubonnet suspension|Knee-Action]]" front coil spring suspension that greatly reduced unsprung weight and Hotchkiss steering. The 1935 Series 370E saw the addition of the Fisher Turret Top on Fisher bodied cars and an increase in horsepower to 150. Sales over the two years combined totaled only 1098.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gunnell2005"/&gt;

The Cadillac V-12 was renamed the Series 80 and 85 in 1936. The Series 80 and 85 featured a 131" and 138" wheelbase respectively. All V-12s were now Fleetwood bodied and had Turret Tops. A total of 901 V-12s were sold in 1936.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gunnell2005"/&gt;

In 1937 the Series 80 was dropped leaving only the long wheelbase Series 85. The only significant mechanical changes were the adoption of an oil-bath air cleaner and a pressure radiator cap. Sales were only 478.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gunnell2005"/&gt; The Series 85 was discontinued at the end of 1937.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

A [[Northstar engine series|Northstar]]-based V-12 was featured in the [[Cadillac Cien]] concept car of 2001, and tested by Cadillac engineers as an engine for a [[Cadillac Escalade]] with somewhat improved performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trucktrend.com/roadtests/suv/163_0302_2003_cadillac_escalade_v12/index.html |title=2003 Cadillac Escalade V-12 - First Drive &amp; Road Test Review |publisher=Truck Trend |date= |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ''AutoWeek'' report in 2007 claimed a V-12 in the design phase was to be based on the [[GM High Feature engine#V12|High Feature V6]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title = AutoWeek Breaks Major Cadillac News in March 26 Issue |publisher = prnewswire.com |date = 21 March 2007 |url = http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/03-21-2007/0004550743 |url-status = dead |access-date = 20 May 2019 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120713222923/http://www2.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104 |archive-date = 13 July 2012 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fisher Body|Fisher]]-bodied Series 62 replaced the [[Cadillac Series 61]] at the lowest rung in the model line up in 1940. The Series 62 featured a low sleek "torpedo" style [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] with chrome window reveals, more slant in the windshield, and a curved rear window. The new C-body that the 1940 Cadillac Series 62 shared with the [[Buick Roadmaster]] and [[Buick Super|Super]], the [[Oldsmobile 98|Oldsmobile Series 90]] and the [[Pontiac Torpedo]] featured shoulder and hip room that was over 5" wider, the elimination of running boards and exterior styling that was streamlined and 2-3" lower. When combined with a column mounted shift lever the cars offered true six passenger comfort. These changes had clearly been influenced by the [[Cadillac Sixty Special]]. The styling feature distinguishing all V-8 Cadillacs was once again the grille. Although grilles had the same pointed shape as in 1939, the grille bars were heavier and fewer in number. Two sets of louver bars appeared on each side of the hood. Running boards were a no cost option. The Series 62 was available as a club coupe or a sedan, with 2-door and 4-door convertibles introduced mid-year. Sales totaled 5903 in its inaugural year accounting for about 45% of Cadillac's sales.

In 1941, the one piece hood came down lower in the front, included the side panels and extended sideways to the fenders. A single rectangular panel of louver trim was used on each side of the hood. The rectangular grille was wide, vertical, and bulged forward in the middle. Rectangular parking lights were built into the top outer corners of the grille. Headlights were now built into the nose of the fenders, and provision for built in accessory fog lights was provided under the headlights. Three chrome spears appeared on the rear section of all four fenders. Rear fender skirts were standard. The Series 62 offered the only 4-door convertible built by Cadillac in 1941 and it would be the last time this bodystyle was ever made by the marque. All Cadillacs shared the same {{convert|346|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} 135&amp;nbsp;hp (101&amp;nbsp;kW) [[Cadillac V8 engine|L-head]] [[V8 engine|V8]] that year, with power rising to 150&amp;nbsp;hp (112&amp;nbsp;kW).

Sales more than quadrupled to 24,734, accounting for 37% of Cadillac sales in a sales year that well more than doubled the previous Cadillac sales rate record set during the two model years of 1926–27, in part due to the huge popularity of the new Series 61. Evidently the new "torpedo" style with its low streamlined runningboardless bodies and expansive shoulder room had proved a big hit. The following model year, abbreviated as it was by a world war, would set no such sales record.

The grille became more massive in 1942, with even fewer bars. Parking lights became round and fog light sockets became rectangular and were included in the grille area. A bullet shape appeared on the tops of the bumper guards. Fenders were rounded and longer. Front fenders extended into the front doors. Rear fenders extended forward into the rear doors. The new fenders had heavy moldings along the sides. A new fresh air ventilating system with air ducts leading from the grille replaced cowl ventilators. Handbrake control was changed from lever to tee-shaped pull handle. Radiator shutter control of engine temperature was replaced by a blocking type thermostat in the water return fitting in the radiator.

The first postwar Cadillac rolled off the line on October 7, 1945 and for several months, only Series 62s were produced. 1946 Cadillacs were not significantly altered from 1942 outside a few styling changes and the addition of a negative ground battery. The Series 62 retained the same lineup of body styles as in 1942—coupe, sedan, and convertible, and 18,565 total were produced for the model year, approximately 65% of Cadillac's total 1946 output of 29,000 vehicles. Resuming civilian production was a difficult task for the entire automobile industry and demand for new cars much exceeded supply. Cadillac had as many as 100,000 unfilled orders into 1947. Due to materials shortages, some Cadillacs shipped from the factory with wooden bumpers, dealers being expected to install proper ones as they became available. Postwar inflation pushed the sticker price of a 1946 Cadillac over $1000 higher than 1942.

In 1946, the Series 62 used GM's [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] platform, as did the [[Cadillac Sixty Special]], [[Buick Super]] and [[Buick Roadmaster]], and [[Oldsmobile 98]]. Notchback styling characterized the cars except for the Club Coupe which had fastback styling. It was easy to distinguish the Series 62 coupe from the Series 61 because the door skins did not flare out above the rocker panel moldings, and the side window openings were lower and the reveal window moldings circled each window individually instead of looping around all the windows. The Series 62 sedan featured venti planes on both the front and rear windows. It was also the first Cadillac to enter production after World War II. Interior styling and technical features were similar to those seen on the [[Cadillac Series 61]] but with slightly richer interior appointments. Late 1946 models introduced technical changes to the V8 engine in the form of hardened ball seats for the hydraulic lifters.

The 1947 models received minor styling changes and the addition of Hydro-Lectric window lifts on the Series 62 convertible, which remained the sole ragtop in Cadillac's lineup. Polished metal stone guards on the fenders replaced the rubber ones used on 1946 models. As before, Series 62s remained Cadillac's bread-and-butter lineup with 39,834 produced, 84% of the make's total 1947 volume.

Series 62 Cadillacs had a slightly shortened wheelbase, but the track width was widened by two inches, increasing interior room. However, updated drivetrains would have to wait another year and for the time being, the new Cadillacs were still powered by the same 346 CID flathead V8 used across the board since 1941, which delivered only fair performance (0-60 in 16 seconds with a top speed of 93&amp;nbsp;mph). Fuel mileage was an estimated 14 mpg highway, 10 mpg city with the Hydramatic transmission, which was rapidly becoming the norm on Cadillacs—by 1949, only 10% of Cadillacs were ordered with the 3-speed manual gearbox. Series 62 production totaled 34,213 vehicles for the 1948 model year, accounting for 68% of Cadillac's volume. The 1948 models had been slow to get into production and did not arrive in showrooms until February 1948, consequently Cadillac produced on 50,599 total vehicles for the abbreviated model year.

The new Cadillac OHV V8 was the big news for 1949, with minor trim differences otherwise. This 331 cu in (5.4 L) engine produced 160&amp;nbsp;hp (119&amp;nbsp;kW) and weighed 200 pounds less than the old flathead V8 in addition to being shorter and lower. The 331 V8 could also handle higher compression levels to take advantage of improved, higher octane postwar gasoline formulations. The major difference between Series 61 and Series 62 models of similar body style was minor trim variations. The higher-priced series again had grooved, front fender stone shields and bright rocker panel moldings. Chevrons below the taillights were no longer seen. The convertible was an exclusive offering. A heater was optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1949_Cadillac/1949_Cadillac_Brochure/1949%20Cadillac-18.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1949_Cadillac/1949_Cadillac_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales reached a record 55,643.

The Cadillac Series 62 '''[[Cadillac Coupe de Ville|Coupe de Ville]]''' was introduced late in the 1949 model year.&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kowalke|first=Ron|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975|year=1997|publisher=Krause publications|isbn=0-87341-521-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/standardcatalogo00beve}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the [[Buick Roadmaster]] [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]], and the [[Oldsmobile 98]] Holiday, it was among the first pillarless [[hardtop]] coupes ever produced.&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; At $3,496 it was only a dollar less than the Series 62 convertible, and like the convertible, it came with power windows standard. It was luxuriously trimmed, with leather upholstery and chrome 'bows' in the headliner to simulate the ribs of a convertible top.&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;

55,643 Series 62 Cadillacs were produced in 1949 out of a total volume of 92,554 vehicles.

For 1950, major styling changes were performed. The cars were lower and sleeker, with longer hoods, and one-piece windshields were fitted. Hydra Matic transmission was now standard. The Series 61 was again a short wheelbase model, having been reduced to 122 in (3099&amp;nbsp;mm). Sales set yet another record at 59,818.

Full-length chrome rocker panels set off the 1951 model, and the Coupe de Ville was now marked with noticeably-improved trim, including Coupe de Ville script on the rear roof pillar. Sales were 81,844, or a record of over 74% of all Cadillacs sold. ''Popular Mechanics'' reported about 12-MPG at 45&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Popular Mechanics|date=February 1932|publisher=Hearst Magazines|issn=0032-4558|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_4-EDAAAAMBAJ|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Cadillac, the V-shaped hood and deck emblems were done as gold castings. The Series 62 sedan was also characterized by a higher rear deck lid contour. This provided additional luggage space. Back up lights were now standard equipment and were incorporated in the taillights. The grille wraparound panels were redesigned once again having broad chrome trim below each headlight with side scoop styling and gold-colored winged emblem mounted in the center. At the rear all Cadillacs adopted a through the bumper dual exhaust system. Deck ornamentation took the form of a Cadillac crest over abroad golden "V". New standard features included self-winding clocks, improved direction signal indicators, glare proof mirrors, stannate treated pistons, and four barrel carburetion. Engine output for the 331 was up to 190&amp;nbsp;hp (142&amp;nbsp;kW). Sales fell to 70,255, but with the Series 61 out of the way, Series 62 sales accounted for a record 78% of all Cadillacs.

The 1953 Series 62 saw a redesigned grille with heavier integral bumper and bumper guards, the repositioning of parking lamps directly under the headlights, chrome "eybrow" type headlamp doors, and one piece rear windows without division bars. Wheel discs were fashioned in an attractive new disced design. Series 62 bodystyles were identified by non louvered rear fenders, the use of thin bright metal underscores on the bottom rear of the cars only and the decoration of both hood and deck lid with Cadillac crests and V- shaped ornaments. The Club Coupe model disappeared. Two door Series 62 were now all hardtops (including the better equipped Coupe de Ville) or convertibles. Another familiar name appeared on 1953's Series 62. The top of the line subseries '''[[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]]''' was one of three specialty convertibles produced in 1953 by General Motors, the other two being the [[Oldsmobile 98]] Fiesta and the [[Buick Roadmaster]] [[Buick Skylark|Skylark]]. The Eldorado was a limited-edition luxury convertible, and would eventually become its own series. It featured a full assortment of deluxe accessories, including wire wheels, and introduced the wraparound windshield to Cadillac standard production. Sales set a new record at 85,446.

The Series 62 included a lower sleeker body, a new cellular grille insert, and inverted gull wing front bumpers and tapered dagmar style bumper guards. Round jet style dual exhaust outlets were incorporated into the vertical bumper extensions and the rear bumper was entirely redesigned. An [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]] style wraparound windshield was seen on all models. Sedans used a distinctive style of window reveal molding, which created a built in sun visor effect. For coupes a smoothly curved wraparound backlight was referred to as the "Florentine" style rear window. A wide ventilator intake was now stretched across the base of the windshield on all body styles and the chrome visored headlamp look was emphasized. The Series 62 could be distinguished by the lack of rear fender louvers. V-shaped ornaments and crests were used in the hood and deck and there were full length body underscores in bright metal. [[Cadillac Coupe de Ville|Coupe de Ville]] script was seen on rear corner pillars of the luxury hardtop, which also had wider sill moldings. The Eldorados had golden identifying crests centered directly behind the air-slot fender breaks and wide fluted beauty panels to decorate the lower rear body sides. These panels were made of extruded aluminum and also appeared on a unique one of a kind Eldorado coupe built for the Reynolds Aluminum Corporation. Also included in the production Eldorado convertible were monogram plates on the doors, wire wheels, and custom interior trimmings with the Cadillac crest embossed on the seat bolsters. Automatic windshield washers, power steering, 12-Volt electrical system, and aluminum alloy pistons made the long list of standard equipment for the first time this year. Power steering, windows, seats, and auto headlight dimming were optional.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|title=Popular Mechanics|date=September 1954|publisher=Hearst Magazines|issn=0032-4558|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_AeADAAAAMBAJ|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A parking brake release reminder light was new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AeADAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0 |title=Popular Mechanics - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular Mechanics rated the 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph time as 17.3 seconds.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

In 1955, the grille was redesigned with wider spaces between the blades and the parking lamps were repositioned beneath directly below the headlights. On the sides of the body the rub-rail moldings formed a right angle with the vertical trim on the rear doors or fenders. This accentuated the character line in the sheet metal. The Florentine curve rear window treatment was adopted for sedans. Three chrome moldings bordered the rear license plate on either side and deck lid decorations consisted of a V-shaped ornament and a Cadillac crest. The Coupe de Ville had a golden script nameplate at the upper body belt just forward of the rear window pillar. The Eldorado sport convertible featured extras such as wide chrome body belt moldings, a distinctive rear fender design, with twin round taillights halfway up the fenders and flatter pointed tailfins. Tubeless tires were a new standard Cadillac feature. Sales reached a record 118,190, accounting for nearly 84% of all Cadillacs sold. Standard equipment included back-up lights, turn signals, and automatic transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1955_Cadillac/1955_Cadillac_Brochure/1955%20Cadillac-07.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1955_Cadillac/1955_Cadillac_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1955_Cadillac/1955_Cadillac_Brochure/1955%20Cadillac-03.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1955_Cadillac/1955_Cadillac_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, there was a new grille, with finer textured insert, and the repositioning of the parking lights in the bumpers, below the wing guards. Buyers were given an option of the standard satin finish grille or an optional gold finish. Cadillac script was found on the left side. A narrow chrome molding and nine vertical louvers were seen. The Coupe de Ville had a model nameplate and a Cadillac crest on the sides of the front fenders. The Coupe de Ville was joined by the Series 62 '''[[Cadillac Sedan de Ville|Sedan de Ville]]''', Cadillac's first standard production 4-door hardtop.&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Similarly to the Coupe de Ville, it was also more expensive and more luxuriously trimmed that the standard 4-door Series 62.&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; With 41,732 sold, it also easily outsold the Series 62 sedan in its very first year.&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Given their sales success, it was only natural that the Coupe de Ville and Sedan de Ville were moved to their own separate series in 1959, the Series 6300, being joined by a De Ville convertible in 1964.&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; The Eldorado subseries also gained a new bodystyle, a 2-door hardtop called the '''[[Cadillac Seville|Seville]]'''. An Eldorado script finally appeared with fender crest on the car which was further distinguished by a twin hood ornament. Extras featured on the Eldorado convertible, now known as the Biarritz in order to distinguish it from the Seville, were a ribbed chrome saddle molding extending from the windshield to the rear window pillar along the beltline and flat, pointed rear fender fins.

Series 62 sales reached an all-time record in 1956 at 134,502 units, accounting for an all-time record 86.4% of all Cadillacs sold. This included 66,818 De Villes and 6050 Eldorados.

In a Popular Mechanics survey of 1956 Series 62 owners, the two most serious complains: Was one, with 23.7% responding to the survey, was ''slipshod'' workmanship during assembly; and two, with 22.7%, transmission problems. The major item they liked with 35% was riding quality and two, with 32.7% power and performance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SeEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=Popular+Mechanics+Science+installing+linoleum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qsgcX3mC0k&amp;sig=5uzq7dFzwBL4NlAn6jl810wzujk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DPAdUMLcFabRyAGC94D4CQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Popular%20Mechanics%20Science%20installing%20linoleum&amp;f=true "Owners Report: "Owners Praise Cadillac's Performance But Complain of Transmission Trouble."] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1956, pp. 104-108/258&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1957, a tubular X-frame without side rails was adopted, which Cadillac claimed resulted in lower body without a loss of usable space and increased torsional strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cadillac data book 1957 |date=1957 |publisher=Cadillac Division of General Motors |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/United%20States/Cadillac/1957_Cadillac/1957-Cadillac-Salesmens-Data-Book/slides/1957_Cadillac_Data_Book-005.html |accessdate=13 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; These frames gained controversy as being unsafe, and other manufactures, such as Ford, touted that their "perimeter" frames were safer. Front end styling was marked by rubber bumper guard tips and dual circular lamps set into the lower bumper section. Side trim was revised and a dual taillight theme was used. Identifying the standard 62 models were bright metal moldings, just forward of the rear wheel openings, highlighted by seven horizontal wind slits. At the upper end this fender brake trim joined a horizontal molding that ran along a conical flare extending towards both taillamps. A crest medallion was seen on the forward angled rear fins. [[Cadillac De Ville|De Villes]] had special nameplates on the front fenders. Series 62 [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorados]] (as distinct from the [[Cadillac Series 70|Series 70]] Eldorado [[Cadillac Brougham|Brougham]]) were further distinguished by the model name above a V-shaped rear deck ornament and on the front fenders. The rear fender and deck contour was trimmed with broad, sculptured stainless steel beauty panels. Also seen were "shark" style fins pointing towards the back of the cars. A three section built in front bumper was another exclusive trait of the Series 62 Eldorados, which came with a long list of standard features. A new body style was added to the subseries, a 4-door Eldorado Sedan [[Cadillac Seville|Seville]], but only four were actually sold, and it was cancelled the following year.

For 1958, there was a new grille featuring multiple round "cleats" at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical members. The grille insert was wider and new bumper guards were positioned lower to the parking lamps. New dual headlamps were used and small chrome fins decorated the front fenders. Tailfins were less pronounced and trim attachments were revised. The word Cadillac appeared in block letters on the fins of base models. On the sides of the car were five longer horizontal wind splits ahead of the unskirted rear wheel housing and front fender horizontal mouldings with crests placed above the trailing edge and no rocker sill trim. The convertible and the De Villes used solid metal trim on the lower half of the conical projection flares, while other models had a thin ridge molding in the same location. On Series 62 Eldorados, a V-shaped ornament and model identification script were mounted to the deck lid. Series 62 Eldorados also had ten vertical chevron slashes ahead of the open rear wheel housings and crest medallions on the flank of the tailfins. Broad, sculptured beauty panels decorated the lower rear quarters on all Series 62 Eldorados and extended around the wheel opening to stretch along the body sills. Standard equipment on all Series 62s was the same as the previous year. All new was an extended deck Series 62 sedan which, along with the Series 62 Sedan deVille, stretched 8.5 inches longer than the regular 4-door Series 62, and a special order Series 62 Eldorado Seville of which only one was actually built. Excluding export sedans and chassis only, the Series 62 offered an all-time record of nine bodystyles this year. The infamous Cadillac Air-Suspension was optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1958_Cadillac/1958_Cadillac_Brochure_1/1958%20Cadillac-15.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1958_Cadillac/1958_Cadillac_Brochure_1 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year De Ville and Eldorado were spun off onto their own series.

The 1959 Cadillac is remembered for its iconic huge tailfins with dual bullet tail lights. The new model year also saw two distinctive rooflines and roof pillar configurations, new jewel-like grille patterns and matching deck lid beauty panels. For 1959, the Series 6200 became the '''Series 62'''. [[Cadillac De Ville|De Villes]] and 2-door [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorados]] were moved from the Series 6200 to their own series, the '''Series 63''' and '''Series 64''' respectively, though they all, including the 4-door Eldorado [[Cadillac Brougham|Brougham]] (which was moved from the '''[[Cadillac Series 70|Series 70]]''' to '''Series 69'''), shared the same {{convert|130|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase. Engine output was an even 325&amp;nbsp;hp (242&amp;nbsp;kW) from the {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine. The Series 62 was identifiable by its straight body rub moldings, running from front wheel opening to back bumpers, with crest medallions below the spear. A one-deck jeweled rear grille insert was seen. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, back-up lamps, windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror and oil filter. The convertible model had power windows and a two-way power seat. Plain fender skirts covered the rear wheels and 4-doors were available in either four-window or six-window hardtop configurations. With the De Villes and 2-door Eldorados in their own series sales plunged to only 70,736, the lowest since the 1950 model year.

The 1960 Series 62 had smoother, more restrained styling. General changes included a full-width grille, the elimination of pointed front bumper guards, increased restraint in the application of chrome trim, lower tailfins with oval shaped nacelles and front fender mounted directional indicator lamps. Series 62 models were distinguished by plain fender skirts, thin three-quarter length bodyside spears and Cadillac crests and lettering on short horizontal front fender bars mounted just behind the headlights. Four-window and six-window hardtop sedans were offered again. The former featured a one-piece wraparound backlight and flat-top roof, while the latter had a sloping rear window and roofline. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual back-up lamps, windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror and oil filter. The convertible model had power windows and a two-way power seat. Technical highlights were finned rear drums and an X-frame construction. Interiors were done in Fawn, Blue or Gray Cortina Cord or Turquoise, Green, Persian Sand, or Black Caspian cloth with Florentine vinyl bolsters. Convertibles were upholstered in Florentine leather single or two-tone combinations or monochromatic Cardiff leather combinations.

Cadillac was restyled and re-engineered for 1961. The new grille slanted back towards both the bumper and the hood lip, along the horizontal plan, and sat between dual headlamps. New forward slanting front pillars with non-wraparound windshield glass were seen. The revised backlight treatment had crisp angular lines with thin pillars on some models and heavier semi-blind quarter roof posts on others. Standard equipment power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual reverse lights, windshield washer, dual speed wipers, wheel discs, plain fender skirts, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror and oil filter. Rubberized front and rear coil springs replaced the trouble prone air suspension system. Four-barrel induction systems were now the sole power choice and dual exhaust were no longer available.

A mild face lift characterized Cadillac styling trends for 1962. A flatter grille with a thicker horizontal center bar and more delicate cross-hatched insert appeared. Ribbed chrome trim panel, seen ahead of the front wheel housings for 1961, were now replaced with standard cornering lamps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1962_Cadillac/1962_Cadillac_Brochure/1962%20Cadillac-12.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1962_Cadillac/1962_Cadillac_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and front fender model and series identification badges were eliminated. More massive front bumper end pieces appeared and housed rectangular parking lamps. At the rear tail lamps were now housed in vertical nacelles designed with an angled peak at the center. A vertically ribbed rear beauty panel appeared on the deck lid latch panel. Cadillac script also appeared on the lower left side of the radiator grille. The short-deck [[hardtop]] Town Sedan was moved from the Series 6300 to the Series 6200, being replaced by a short-deck Sedan de Ville Park Avenue in the Series 6300.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960–1972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), p.147.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition all short deck Cadillac models went from being 6-window sedans for 1961 to 4-window sedans for 1962 and 1963. The Town Sedan would disappear for 1963,&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p.210.&lt;/ref&gt; with only 4,900 sold (of 134,572 Series 62s in all),&lt;ref&gt;Flory, pp.148 &amp; 212.&lt;/ref&gt; though the Sedan de Ville Park Avenue sold even fewer, 4,175 (out of 150,882 De Villes).&lt;ref&gt;Flory, pp.149 &amp; 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Standard equipment included all of last year's equipment plus remote controlled outside rearview mirror, five tubeless black wall tires, heater and defroster and front cornering lamps. Cadillac refined the ride and quietness, with more insulation in the floor and behind the firewall.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p.147.&lt;/ref&gt;

1963 brought another restyle. Exterior changes imparted a bolder and longer look. Hoods and deck lids were redesigned. The front fenders projected 4.625" further forward than for 1962 while the tailfins were trimmed down somewhat to provide a lower profile. Body side sculpturing was entirely eliminated. The slightly V-shaped radiator grille was taller and now incorporated outer extensions that swept below the flush-fender dual headlamps. Smaller circular front parking lamps were mounted in those extensions. A total of 143 options including bucket seats with wool, leather or nylon upholstery fabrics and wood veneer facings on dash, doors and seatbacks, set an all-time record for interior appointment choices. Standard equipment was the same as the previous year. Convertibles were equipped with additional features. The engine displacement and output remained the same, {{convert|390|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|325|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p.211.&lt;/ref&gt;

A minor facelift for 1964 featured a new bi-angular grille that formed a V-shape along both its vertical and horizontal planes. The main horizontal grille bar was now carried around the body sides. Outer grille extension panels again housed the parking and cornering lamps. It was the 17th consecutive year for the Cadillac tailfins with a new fine-blade design carrying on the tradition. Performance improvements including a larger V-8 were the dominant changes for the model run. Equipment features were same as in 1963 for the most part. Comfort Control, a completely automatic heating and air conditioning system controlled by a dial thermostat on the instrument panel, was introduced as an industry first. The engine was bumped to {{convert|429|cid|l|0|abbr=on}}, with 340&amp;nbsp;hp (253.5&amp;nbsp;kW) available. In its final year only 35,079 Series 62s were sold, the smallest number since 1946 and little more than a quarter of their all-time sales record in 1956. The 62 convertible was dropped for 1964. 
{{clear}}
 
The Series 62 (née 6200) designation was dropped after 1964. Cadillac's entry level car was renamed [[Cadillac Calais|Calais]] for 1965-1976.

The '''Cadillac Series 70''' (models 70 and 75) is a full-size [[V8 engine|V8]]-powered series of cars that were produced by [[Cadillac]] from the 1930s to the 1980s. It replaced the 1935 [[Cadillac Series 355|355E]] as the company's mainstream car just as the much less expensive [[Cadillac Series 60|Series 60]] was introduced. The Series 72 and 67 were similar to the Series 75 but the 72 and 67 were produced on a slightly shorter and longer wheelbase respectively. The Series 72 was only produced in 1940 and the Series 67 was only produced in 1941 and 1942.  For much of the postwar era, it was the top-of-the-line Cadillac, and was Cadillac's factory-built [[limousine]] offering.

Production of the short wheelbase Series 70 ceased in 1938, but reappeared briefly as the relatively expensive [[Cadillac Eldorado#Third generation (1957-1960)|Series 70 Eldorado Brougham]] 4-door [[hardtop]] from 1957 to 1958, while the long wheelbase Series 75 made a final appearance in the 1987 model year.

The 1936 Series 70 and 75 both had v-shaped windshield styles by [[Fleetwood Metal Body|Fleetwood]]. A narrower radiator shell was supported by the new louver style "Convex vee" grill. Headlights were mounted on the radiator shell. Parking lights were inside the headlights. Front fenders were new with a crease along the center line. The cowl vent was changed back to opening forward. There were built-in trunks on "touring" styles, [[town car]]s and 4-door [[Convertible (car)|convertible]]s. Coupes and 2-door convertibles had [[rumble seat]]s plus a separate door for the spare tire at the extreme rear of the deck. All bodies now utilized the [[Fisher Body|Fisher]] Turret Top.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"&gt;{{cite book|title=standard catalog of American Cars 1805-1942|last=Kimes|first=Beverly|publisher=Krause publications|year=1996|isbn=0-87341-428-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gunnell2005"&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of Cadillac 1903-2005|last=Gunnell|first=John|publisher=Krause publications|year=2005|isbn=0873492897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1937 Cadillac Series 70 convertible coupe.JPG|thumb|left|1937 Cadillac Series 70 2-door convertible]]

The Series 70 and 75 were powered by the new {{convert|346|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#Monobloc|Monobloc]] [[V8 engine|V8]],  This 135&amp;nbsp;hp (101&amp;nbsp;kW) engine was both less expensive and more powerful, and the stylish body by Fleetwood should have made the Series 70 and 75 an instant hit. However, the high price ($2,445 and up) limited their appeal in the [[Great Depression]] era. Only 5,248 were sold for 1936.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;

In 1937 bodies were the same except for drip moldings running from the bottom of the front pillar up and over the doors and rear quarter window, new fenders and bumpers, headlights rigidly attached (adjusted by moving reflector), wheel discs incorporated a hubcap, and a built-in trunk was incorporated on most bodies. A die-cast eggcrate grille was used, but the hood louver treatment differed from that used in Fisher bodied cars. Chrome die cast strips were used at the rear of the hood side panels. A seven-passenger Fisher-bodied Special touring sedan, without a division window was offered on the {{convert|138.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase. These two body styles had the eggcrate hood louvers typical of all Fisher bodied Cadillacs for 1937. The Business car line included eight-passenger versions of these Special sedans plus eight-passenger versions of Fleetwood body styles. The eighth passenger was seated with two others on auxiliary seats. A commercial chassis on a {{convert|156.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase was offered. Engine changes included a lighter flywheel, a generator relocated in the vee, an oil filter, a new carburetor with full automatic electric choke, an oil bath cleaner, and a relocated distributor. A new transmission design featured pin-type synchronizers, shifter rails relocated to the side of the case, a cover on the bottom of the case, and an extension integral with the transmission mainshaft. Sales totaled 4,332.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;

For 1938 the Series 70 and [[Fisher Body|Fisher-bodied]] Series 75 Specials were dropped. The Series 75 used a {{Convert|141|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase and now only offered bodies by [[Fleetwood Metal Body|Fleetwood]].

In 1938 the [[Cadillac Series 65]] and the Series 75 shared a new front end style featuring a massive vertical cellular grille, three sets of horizontal bars on the hood sides, alligator hood, and headlights on the filler space between the fenders and the hood. Optional sidemount covers were hinged to the fenders. Quarter windows were of sliding rather than hinged construction. The rear of the body had rounder corners and more smoothly blended lines. Trunks had more of an appearance of being an integral part of the body. Bodies were all steel except for wooden main sills. New chassis details included a column gear shift, horns just behind the grille, battery under the right hand side of the hood, transverse muffler just behind the fuel tank, wheels by a different manufacturer, "Synchro-Flex" flywheel, hypoid rear axle and the deletion of the oil filter. All Cadillacs shared the same 346&amp;nbsp;in³ [[Cadillac V8 engine|L-head]] [[V8 engine|V8]], although the 75 generated 140&amp;nbsp;hp (104&amp;nbsp;kW) instead of 135&amp;nbsp;hp (101&amp;nbsp;kW) like the rest of the line thanks to a higher 6.70:1 compression ratio, necessitating the use of higher octane fuel.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;

For 1939, all Cadillac V8s had new grille styling; similar in appearance but different in detail dimensions on each series. The pointed center grille and the functional side grilles were die-cast, with finepitch bars. A single die-cast louver was positioned to the rear of each hood side panel. Headlights were once again attached to the radiator casing. Chassis changes included: tube and fin radiator core; sea shell horns under the hood; 10mm spark plugs.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;

In 1940 the one year only Series 72 was introduced as a less expensive companion to the Series 75. 1940 was the final year for the optional sidemounts. Sealed beam headlights were standard equipment. The engine manifold was set at five degrees to the engine to cancel the rearward tilt of the engine and give balanced distribution.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;

=== Series 72 ===
The Series 72 had the same general appearance as the Series 75 but it was three inches shorter and set apart by rectangular taillights set high on the sides of the trunk. Recirculating ball steering was tried on Series 72 in 1940, to be adopted on all series in 1941. Like the Series 75 it was Fleetwood bodied, but rode on a {{Convert|138|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;

For 1941, the wheelbase was reduced to {{convert|136|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, though power on the {{convert|346|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine|L-head]] V8 engine was up to 150&amp;nbsp;hp (112&amp;nbsp;kW). The one piece hood came down lower in the front, included the side panels and extended sideways to the fenders. A single rectangular panel of louver trim was used on each side of the hood. The rectangular grille was wide, vertical, and bulged foreword in the middle. Rectangular parking lights were built into the top outer corners of the grille. Headlights were now built into the nose of the fenders,and provision for built in accessory fog lights was provided under the headlights. Three chrome spears appeared on the rear section of all four fenders. Rear fender skirts were standard. Unlike other Cadillacs the Series 75 could only be ordered with running boards.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;

The grille became more massive in 1942, with even fewer bars. Parking lights became round and fog light sockets became rectangular and were included in the grille area. A bullet shape appeared on the tops of the bumper guards. The nose on the hood louvers were more rounded.Unlike other Cadillacs the fender treatment remained unchanged. A new fresh air ventilating system with air ducts leading from the grille replaced cowl ventilators. Handbrake control was changed from lever to tee-shaped pull handle. Radiator shutter control of engine temperature was replaced by a blocking type thermostat in the water return fitting in the radiator.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;

The Series 75 returned after the war as Cadillac's largest model. It retained most of its pre-war styling and rode on the long {{Convert|136|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase and used a distinctive body not shared with other general Motors divisions. Five different touring sedan configurations were featured: with quarter windows; with auxiliary jump seats; business; Imperial seven-passenger and Imperial nine-passenger (the latter two both having jump seats). The engine was the same 346&amp;nbsp;in³ [[Cadillac V8 engine|L-head]] [[V8 engine|V8]] used by other Cadillacs that year. Standard equipment included large wheel discs, fender skirts, hood, side and lower beltline moldings and stainless steel runningboards.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975|last=Kowalke|first=Ron|publisher=Krause publications|year=1997|isbn=0-87341-521-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/standardcatalogo00beve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unchanged in all but minor details for 1947, the big Series 75 continued to use the touring sedan body with a stately prewar appearance. It came in the same five configurations marketed the year before and had the same assortment of standard equipment geared to the luxury class buyer.

Consideration was given to the deletion of the long wheelbase line in 1948, but competitive pressure from Packard in the luxury class market dictated the retention of the Series 75. Again they featured General Motors old-fashioned "Turret Top" styling, a throwback to the prewar years. Minor revisions on the outside of the cars included a new background for the V-shaped hood emblem and Cadillac script, replacing block lettering, low on the fenders behind the front wheel opening. Buyers ordering fog lamps got rectangular lamps in place of the smaller round style. Stainless steel running boards were seen once again. A new dashboard with rainbow style instrument cluster and burled leather trim extending to the carpets was seen this year.

To accommodate luxury-class buyers the long wheelbase Series 75 was carried over in 1949 without any basic changes except that a more conventional dashboard design appeared featuring a horizontal speedometer. The new [[Cadillac V8 engine|Cadillac OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]] was the big news for 1949. This {{convert|331|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine produced 160&amp;nbsp;hp (119&amp;nbsp;kW).

=== Series 67 ===
[[File:1941 Cadillac Limo.jpg|thumb|left|1941 Cadillac Series 67]]
The Series 67 of 1941-42 was somewhat longer than the 75. It was a [[Fisher Body|Fisher]] bodied car, but rode on a {{Convert|139.0|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase.
{{clear}}

The series 67 featured the usage of standard sheetmetal, that was similar and in most times interchangeable with lower 61 and 62 series. The 67 series had therefore a more family type appearance as the series 75 were taller, and therefore more formal in appearance. 
The series 75 featured a higher cowl, and the height of the hood was extended to accommodate this extra height. Interior room in the series 75 was larger, and it's higher body made it more easily to enter and leave the vehicle.

[[File:1953 Cadillac limousine - Flickr - denizen24.jpg|thumb|left|1953 Cadillac Series 75]]

An all-new Series 75 was introduced for 1950 which conformed to the postwar styling introduced on other Cadillacs in 1948. This would replace the pre-war design dating back to 1941 with a new {{Convert|146.8|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase. It featured six-window styling, a one piece windshield, the absence of running boards and a "high-headroom" [[limousine]]-type appearance. 7-passenger seating was again offered via jump seats in the sedan, business sedan and Imperial sedan. Surprisingly [[Hydramatic]] [[automatic transmission]] was optional but power windows were standard equipment.

A minor face lift and small trim variations were the main Cadillac styling news in 1951. Miniature eggcrate grilles were set into the out-board grille extension panels below the headlights. Larger, bullet shaped style bumper guards were used. Jump seats were used in both the seven-passenger sedan and Imperial limousine. Hydramatic automatic transmission was optional and hydraulic window lifts were standard. Business sedans were built in limited numbers on a special order basis.

In 1952, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Cadillac, the V-shaped hood and deck emblems were done as gold castings. The grille wraparound panels were redesigned once again having broad chrome trim below each headlight with side scoop styling and gold-colored winged emblem mounted in the center. Back up lights were now standard equipment and were incorporated in the taillights. At the rear all Cadillacs adopted a through the bumper dual exhaust system. Although all Series 75 had been [[Cadillac Fleetwood|Fleetwood]] bodied since 1938 it was not until 1952 that Fleetwood script appeared on the rear deck lid.&lt;ref name="gunnell2005" /&gt; Equipment features were the same and no business sedans were built. Engine output for the 331 was up to 190&amp;nbsp;hp (142&amp;nbsp;kW) for 1952. It would borrow the bumper bullets (or [[Custom car#Language|dagmars]]) as a styling cue from the 1951 [[Le Sabre concept car|Le Sabre]] [[Concept vehicle|show car]].&lt;ref&gt;Flory,  J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1946-1959'' (Jefferson, NC:  McFarland &amp; Coy, 2008), p.1021.&lt;/ref&gt;

1953 saw a redesigned grille with heavier integral bumper and bumper guards, the repositioning of parking lamps directly under the headlights and chrome "eyebrow" type headlamp doors. Wheel discs were fashioned in an attractive new disced design. Otherwise, appearance features and equipment were about the same as in previous years. Regular production models included the Imperial eight-passenger limousine with glass partition or eight-passenger sedan, both with jump seats.

The big Series 75 "high-headroom" car came as an eight-passenger limousine with driver's partition or eight-passenger sedan without partition, both having jump seats. The Series 75 included a lower sleeker appearing body, a new cellular grille insert, and inverted gull wing front bumpers and tapered dagmar style bumper guards. Round jet style dual exhaust outlets were incorporated into the vertical bumper extensions and the rear bumper was entirely redesigned. An [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]] style wraparound windshield was seen. A wide ventilator intake was now stretched across the base of the windshield and a chrome visored headlamp look was emphasized. V-shaped ornaments appeared on the hood and deck lid with [[Cadillac Fleetwood|Fleetwood]] script in the latter location. Wheelbase was up to {{convert|149.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} for 1954, and engine output jumped to 230&amp;nbsp;hp (172&amp;nbsp;kW).

In 1955 the grille was redesigned with wider spaces between the blades and the parking lamps were repositioned beneath directly below the headlights. The trim of the Series 75 long wheelbase model was distinctive from other lines. A horizontal rub molding ran from the front parking light housings to the trailing edge of the front door and stopped. A full length vertical air slot-style fenderbreak molding was placed directly behind the rear gap of the back doors. The two moldings did not meet at right angles. A Fleetwood script appeared on the rear deck lid. The high headroom appearance was seen again. Both the sedan and the limousine continued to feature auxiliary seats for extra passenger carrying capacity and the Imperial limousine had a hydraulically operated glass driver's partition. Engine output was increased to 250&amp;nbsp;hp (186&amp;nbsp;kW). An optional dual-four barrel carb setup boasted 270&amp;nbsp;hp (201&amp;nbsp;kW). [[Hydramatic]] [[automatic transmission]] was now standard equipment.

In 1956 there was a new grille, with finer textured insert, and the repositioning of the parking lights in the bumpers, below the wing guards. Buyers were given an option of the standard satin finish grille or an optional gold finish. Cadillac script was found on the left side. A narrow chrome molding and nine vertical louvers were seen. Side trim was about the same as in 1955, except for the addition of exhaust extension moldings on the rear fender. The trim ran long a tapering conical flare from above the wheel housing to the rear bumper. A Fleetwood script appeared on the deck lid and limousine styling was seen again. Both the sedan and the limousine had auxiliary seats and the Imperial limousine again featured a glass driver's partition. Standard equipment was comparable to the previous year. The engine was stroked to {{convert|365|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} for 285 or 305&amp;nbsp;hp (213 or 227&amp;nbsp;kW) in 1956.

In 1957 a tubular X-frame without side rails was adopted. This resulted in greater structural rigidity and provided for a lower body without a loss of usable space. Front end styling was marked by rubber bumper guard tips and dual circular lamps set into the lower bumper section. Side trim was revised and a dual taillight theme was used. Identifying the Series 75 were bright metal moldings, just forward of the rear wheel openings, highlighted by seven horizontal windsplits. At the upper end this fenderbreak trim joined a horizontal molding that ran along a conical flare extending towards both taillamps. The Series 75 came as a limousine or in a nine-passenger sedan configuration, both with auxiliary seats. Power was 300 to 325&amp;nbsp;hp (224 to 242&amp;nbsp;kW) for 1957.

In 1958 there was a new grille featuring multiple round "cleats" at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical members. The grille insert was wider and new bumper guards were positioned lower to the parking lamps. New dual headlamps were used and small chrome fins decorated the front fenders. Tailfins were less pronounced and trim attachments were revised. On the sides of the car were five longer horizontal windsplits ahead of the unskirted rear wheel housing and front fender horizontal mouldings with crests placed above the trailing edge and no rocker sill trim. The limousine and nine-passenger long wheelbase sedan were available once again.

The highly expensive and exclusive 4-door [[Cadillac Eldorado]] [[Cadillac Brougham|Brougham]] [[hardtop]] marked the return of the name '''Series 70''', but for only two years, as from 1959-60 the Eldorado Brougham was denoted a Series 6900, and it was discontinued thereafter. Announced in December 1956 and released around March 1957, the Series 70 Eldorado Brougham was a hand built, limited car derived from the Park Avenue and [[Cadillac Orleans|Orleans]] show cars of 1953-54. Designed by Ed Glowacke, it featured the first appearance of quad headlights and totally unique trim. The exterior ornamentation included wide, ribbed lower rear quarter beauty panels extending along the rocker sills and rectangularly sculptured side body "cove" highlighted with five horizontal windsplits on the rear doors. Tail styling treatments followed the Eldorado pattern. This four-door hardtop with rear [[suicide doors]] was an ultra-luxury car that cost an astonishing $13,074 — twice the price of any other 1957 Eldorado and more than the [[Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud]] of the same year. It featured a stainless steel roof, [[air suspension]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1957_Cadillac/1957_Cadillac_Eldorado_Brougham_Press_Release/1957%20Cadillac%20Eldorado%20Brougham-02.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1957_Cadillac/1957_Cadillac_Eldorado_Brougham_Press_Release |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first automatic "memory" [[power seat]]s, a dual four-barrel V-8, low profile tires with thin white-walls, automatic trunk opener, Cruise Control, high pressure cooling system, polarized sun visors, Signal-Seeking twin speaker radio, electric antenna, automatic-release parking brake, electric door locks, dual heating system, silver magnetized glovebox, drink tumblers, cigarette and tissue dispensers, lipstick and cologne, ladies compact with powder puff, mirror and matching leather notebook, comb and mirror, [[Arpège]] atomizer with [[Lanvin (clothing)|Lanvin]] perfume, automatic starter with restart function, [[Headlamp#Automatic beam switching|Autronic Eye]], drum-type electric clock, power windows, forged aluminum wheels and [[automobile air conditioning|air conditioning]]. Buyers of Broughams had a choice of 44 full leather interior and trim combinations and could select such items as [[Sheepskin|Mouton]], [[Karakul (sheep)|Karakul]] or lambskin carpeting. The 1957 Series 70 Eldorado Brougham joined the Sixty Special and the Series 75 as the only Cadillac models with [[Cadillac Fleetwood|Fleetwood]] bodies although Fleetwood script or crests did not appear anywhere on the exterior of the car,&lt;ref name="Bonsal2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonsal|first=Thomas|title=The Cadillac Story|year=2003|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0-8047-4942-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SIA1970"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Special Interest Autos|issue=#2 Nov.–Dec. 1970|title=Mark II Meets Eldorado Brougham}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so this would also mark the first time in 20 years that a Fleetwood bodied car was paired with the Brougham name. There were serious difficulties with the air suspension. Some owners found it cheaper to have the system removed and replaced with conventional coil springs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=the Auto Editors of Consumer Guide |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1950-1959-cadillac3.htm |title=HowStuffWorks "1957, 1958 Cadillac" |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=2007-03-13 |accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 400 Series 70 Eldorado Broughams were sold in 1957.

The major changes to the Series 70 Eldorado Brougham in 1958 were seen inside the car. The interior upper door panels were finished in leather instead of the metal finish used in 1957. New wheel covers also appeared. Forty-four trim combinations were available, along with 15 special monotone paint colors. A total of 304 Series 70 Eldorado Broughams were sold in 1958. 1958 was the last year for the domestic production of the handbuilt Series 70 Eldorado Brougham at Cadillac's Detroit factory, as future manufacturing of the special bodies was transferred to [[Pininfarina]] of [[Turin, Italy]]. It was relabeled the '''Series 6900''' in 1959.

No single automotive design better characterizes the industry's late 1950s flamboyance than the 1959 [[Cadillac]], which incorporated totally new styling. Large tailfin, twin bullet taillamps, new jewel-like grille patterns and matching deck-lid beauty panels personified these cars. The in-house code number for the model was changed from 7500 to 6700, in keeping with Cadillac's new numbering scheme, but the commercial name remained "Series Seventy-Five". Production models again were a nine-passenger sedan and Imperial [[limousine]] with auxiliary jump seats. The "Imperial" term was no longer used soon after [[Chrysler]] introduced their top-level luxury sedans and limousines with the [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]] in 1955.

[[Cadillac Fleetwood|Fleetwood]] lettering appeared on the rear deck lid trim strip. Single side trim moldings extended from the front wheel housing to the rear of the car. Standard equipment included power brakes; power steering; [[Hydramatic]] [[automatic transmission]]; dual back-up lamps; windshield washers and two-speed wipers; wheel discs; dual outside rearview mirror; vanity mirror; oil filter and power vent windows. Power steering and shock absorbers were improved this year. Engine displacement on the [[Cadillac V8 engine|Cadillac OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]] was increased to {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}.



The 1960 Cadillacs exhibited smoother styling, more subtle rendition of the styling theme introduced one year earlier. General changes included a full-width grille; the elimination of pointed front bumper guards; increased restraint in the application of chrome trim; lower tailfins with oval shaped nacelles which encased stacked taillights and back up lamps and front fender mounted directional indicator lamps. The long wheelbase sedan and limousine had auxiliary jump seats, high-headroom formal six-window styling, broad ribbed edge beauty panels and trim generally similar to Series 6200 Cadillacs in other respects. The limousine passenger compartment was trimmed in either bradford cloth or Bedford cloth, both in combinations with wool. Florentine leather upholstery was used in the chauffeur's compartment. Standard equipment was essentially the same as the previous year.

Cadillac was restyled and re-engineered for 1961. The new grille slanted back towards both the bumper and the hood lip, along the horizontal plane, and sat between dual headlamps. New forward slanting front pillars with non-wraparound windshield glass were seen. New standard equipment included a remote control trunk lock.

A mild face lift characterized Cadillac styling trends for 1962. A flatter grille with a thicker horizontal center bar and more delicate cross-hatched insert appeared. Ribbed chrome trim panel, seen ahead of the front wheel housings in 1961, were now replaced with cornering lamps and front fender model and series identification badges were eliminated. More massive front bumper end pieces appeared and housed rectangular parking lamps. At the rear tail lamps were now housed in vertical nacelles designed with an angled peak at the center. A vertically ribbed rear beauty panel appeared on the deck lid latch panel. Cadillac script also appeared on the lower left side of the radiator grille. New standard equipment included remote control outside rearview mirror, heater and defroster and front cornering lamps.

In overall terms 1963 Cadillac was essentially the same as last year. Exterior changes imparted a bolder and longer look. Hoods and deck lids were redesigned. The front fenders projected {{convert|4.625|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} further forward than in 1962 while the tailfins were trimmed down somewhat to provide a lower profile. Body side sculpturing was entirely eliminated. The slightly V-shaped radiator grille was taller and now incorporated outer extensions that swept below the flush-fender dual headlamps. Smaller circular front parking lamps were mounted in those extensions. Cadillac's extra-long nine-passenger cars were the only pillared four-door sedans in the line. Standard equipment again essentially remained unchanged. Trimmings included a full-length lower beltline molding of a simple yet elegant design. Convertible top like rooflines and windshields with forward "dog-leg" pillars were 1962 carryovers seen exclusively on this series. The engine was entirely changed for 1963, though the displacement and output remained the same.

It was time for another facelift in 1964 and really a minor one. New up front was a bi-angular grille that formed a V-shape along both its vertical and horizontal planes. The main horizontal grille bar was now carried around the body sides. Outer grille extension panels again housed the parking and cornering lamps. It was the 17th consecutive year for the Cadillac tailfins with a new fine-blade design carrying on the tradition. Equipment features were same as in 1963 for the most part. Comfort Control, a completely automatic heating and air conditioning system controlled by a dial thermostat on the instrument panel, was introduced as an industry first. The engine was bumped to {{convert|429|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]] for 1964. 340&amp;nbsp;hp (254&amp;nbsp;kW) was the result.

Cadillac's longest, heaviest, richest, and highest priced model was again more conventionally engineered than the other lines in 1965. For example, the new perimeter frame was not in use and neither was the improved automatic transmission. In addition automatic level control was not featured. Even the annual styling face lift did not affect these tradition-bound luxury cars. They came with all power controls found in Eldorados and added courtesy and map lights and the standard equipment list. Sales of the commercial chassis earned an increase of  30 units, while limousine deliveries tapered slightly downward and the popularity of the nine-passenger sedan saw a considerable decline.

As usual [[Cadillac Fleetwood|Fleetwood]] exterior trim and interior appointments enriched the Series 75 in 1966. The first major redesign since 1961 featured a full perimeter frame. The new look brought the appearance of the big sedan and limousine up-to-date so that it matched the visual impression of other Cadillac lines. A big jump in sales for both regular production models, but not the commercial chassis, was the result.

New at [[Cadillac]] for 1967 was a redesigned side panel contour that created a longer look and more sculptured appearance. Technical improvements included a revised engine valve train, different carburetor, Mylar printed circuit instrument panel, re-tuned body mounts and a new engine fan with clutch for quieter operation. A squarer cornered radiator grille insert had a cross-hatch pattern that appeared both above the bumper and through a lowered center section of it, with a V-shaped appearance last used in 1954–1956 models.  The new grille had a forward angle and blades that seemed to emphasize its vertical members. Rectangular parking lamps were housed in the outer ends. Rear end styling revisions were highlighted by metal divided taillamps and a painted lower bumper section. This year's new styling was particularly beautifully rendered on the Series 75 which had extra-long rear fenders and an extended "greenhouse" with a formal high-headroom look. Fleetwood wreath and crest emblems decorated the hood and the trunk, with Fleetwood block letters at the right side of the deck lid. A simple horizontal body rub molding running the length of the elongated sides added to the elegance. Standard equipment now included automatic level control; air conditioning; carpeted fold-down foot rests and 8.20 x 15 four ply 8PR blackwall tires.

[[File:1970 Cadillac Fleetwood.jpg|thumb|left|1970 Cadillac Fleetwood Seventy-Five]]

The same basic styling and engineering continued into the 1968 model year, with a number of refinements. A new grille  had an insert with finer mesh and step-down outer section, which held the rectangular parking lights just a little higher than before. Rear end styling was modestly altered. An obvious change was a {{convert|8.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} longer hood, which incorporated recessed windshield wipers. The deck lid also had more of a rake. The standard V8 was enlarged, with the greatest displacement and torque of any American engine, putting out 375&amp;nbsp;hp (280&amp;nbsp;kW). Of the 20 exterior paint color combinations 14 were totally new. Again marked by simple extra-long body rub moldings, a formal high-headroom look with doors cut into the roof and Fleetwood-type wreath and crest emblems, the nine-passenger models had the longest Cadillac production wheelbase, as well as power front ventiplanes,{{what|date=September 2017}} automatic level control, right-hand manually operated outside rearview mirrors, 8.20 x 15-8PR blackwall tires and automatic climate control air conditioning as standard equipment.

Although its overall size and character was largely unchanged, the 1969 Cadillac was restyled. Rear quarters were extended to give the car a longer look. There was an all new grille with dual horizontal headlamps positioned in the outboard step down areas of the grille. The hood was again extended, a total of {{convert|2.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} to add the impression of extra length. Stretched body and trim; Fleetwood emblems and embellishments; doors cut into a formal, high-headroom roof, and generally higher appointment and trim levels continued to mark Cadillac's most luxurious line. Standard equipment included automatic level control, automatic climate control, rear window defogger, four rear ashtrays and 8.20 x 15 four-ply blackwall tires.

[[File:'70 Cadillac Fleetwood Limousine (Auto classique VAQ St-Lambert '12).jpg|thumb|right|1970 Cadillac Series 75]]

A relatively minor restyling marked 1970 Cadillacs. A face lift included a new grille with 13 vertical blades set against a delicately cross-hatched rectangular opening. The bright metal headlamp surrounds were bordered with body color to give a more refined look. Narrow vertical  taillights were seen again, but no longer had smaller V-chaped bottom lenses pointing downward below the bumper. Wheel discs and winged crest fender tip emblems were new. Special equipment found on the big Cadillac sedan and limousine included automatic level control; rear window defogger; four rear ashtrays and manual right-hand outside rearview mirror. Separate climate control systems were provided for front and rear compartments. Fleetwood wreath crests appeared at the extreme edge of the rear fenders, above the belt molding, on both the sedan and the limousine. As usual, the doors on the limousine cut into the roof and a fixed driver's partition with adjustable glass compartment divider was inside. The front compartment was trimmed in genuine leather, the rear in one of five combinations. Three of these were the more standard Divan cloth trim, while Decardo cloth or Dumbarton cloth with leather were the richest selections available.

As with all [[General Motors|GM]] full-size lines, the Series 75 was redesigned for 1971. The new GM full-size bodies, at 64.3 inches front shoulder room (62.1 inches on [[Cadillac]]) and 63.4 inches rear shoulder room (64.0 inches on Cadillac) set a record for interior width that would not be matched by any car until the full-size GM rear-wheel-drive models of the early to mid-1990s. Pairs of individually housed squarish headlamps were set wider apart. The V-shaped grille had an eggcrate style insert and was protected by massive vertical guards framing a rectangular license plate indentation. A wide hood with full-length windsplints, a prominent center crease and hidden windshield wipers was seen. A Cadillac wreath and crest decorated the nose and new indicator lamps appeared atop each front fender. A horizontal beltline molding ran from behind the front wheel housing, almost to the rear stopping where an elliptical bulge in the body came to a point and where thin rectangular side markers were placed above and below the chrome strip. The rear wheel openings were again covered with fender skirts. Long Vertical taillamps in chrome bezels were located at the end of the rear fenders . Long horizontal back-up lamps were set in the bumper, on either side of a deeply recessed license plate housing. Standard equipment included automatic level control; automatic climate control; rear window defogger; four rear ashtrays and manual right-hand outside rearview mirror. A hand-fitted padded vinyl roof was available. The rear roof could be custom finished in several different ways including triangular "coach" windows or vinyl covered "blind quarter" looks. Ornamentation included the traditional [[Cadillac Fleetwood|Fleetwood]] laurel wreath crests and lettering. No rocker sill strips, panels or extension moldings were used. And, of course, the limousine had doors cut into the roof, special upholstery appointment and a driver's partition with adjustable division window.

In 1972, a modest frontal revision placed more emphasis on horizontal grille blades. The parking lamps were moved from the bumper to between the square bezeled headlamps, which were now set wider apart. Standard equipment included automatic level control; carpeted foot rests; fixed ratio power steering; remote control right-hand side outside rearview mirror; rear window defogger and automatic climate control. The sedan included folding auxiliary seats. The limousine had the doors cut into the roof and had the traditional partition and glass divider. Trim included bright body underscores with rear extensions; horizontal thin belt moldings; Fleetwood front fender lettering and laurel wreath badges for the hood and deck lid. Several optional roof treatments were available making these models true factory-built semi-custom-type vehicles.

New energy absorbing bumpers were seen on all GM cars in 1973 and it brought styling refinements to Series 75. Grilles were widened and had an intricate eggcrate design. Larger vertical rectangles housed the parking lamps between wide spaced headlamps which had square bezels but round lenses. Bumpers ran fully across the front and wrapped around each end. Vertical guards were spaced much further apart at a point outboard of the grille. The rear end had a bumper with a flatter upper section housing an angled license plate recess. Border outline moldings vertically "veed" paralleled the fender edge shape at the rear bodysides. Single horizontally mounted rectangular rear side marker lamps were placed over and under the rear tip of the thin beltline trim. Cadillac script was seen on the front fender sides below the belt molding behind the wheel opening. The long wheelbase, expensive Series 75's were immense automobiles with rounded corner side window treatments and rather large "coach windows" cut into the rear roof pillars. The Series 75 had a thin horizontal bodyside molding; front fender nameplates; full-length body underscores with rear extensions and Fleetwood-style wreath badge ornamentation. Standard equipment included carpeted foot rests; fixed ratio power steering; rear seat window defogger; automatic climate control and right outside rearview mirrors operated by remote control. Bumper impact strips were also standard.

In 1974, a wide eggcrate grille was used. Dual round headlamps were mounted close together in square bezels. Further outboard were double deck wraparound parking lamps. Shorter vertical grille guards appeared in about the same position as before. Rear fendersides were flatter without the elliptical bulge. The thin beltline molding was positioned lower by several inches. The rear end had vertical bumper ends with the sidemarker lights built in. New horizontal taillamps were placed beneath the trunk lid.  Both bumpers, especially the rear, protruded further from the body. Inside, a new curved "space age"  instrument panel housed a new quartz controlled digital clock. Standard equipment included automatic level control; carpeted footrests; fixed ratio power steering; rear seat window defogger; automatic climate control; trailering package and remote control right-hand outside rearview mirror. Black sidewallL78-15/D tires were standard. Also found on the Series 75 new gray and white bumper impact strips. Series script appeared on the front fenders, behind the wheelhousings, and "coach" windows appeared at the rear roof pillar. [[Twilight Sentinel]] was now featured on all 75s at regular prices.

Styling changes for 1975 brought dual rectangular headlamps flanked by rectangular cornering lights wrapped around new, squared-off front fenders. A new cross hatched grille also appeared, with Cadillac script on the header. Both long wheelbase Series 75 came with two separate climate control systems; automatic leveling air shocks; folding jump seats; rear window defogger; trailering equipment and remote control right-hand outside rearview mirrors. The limousine had a leather front chauffeur's compartment and glass partition window. Script identification nameplates were worn on the front fenders, behind the wheel opening. Fleetwood decorative trim was seen. New triangular rear quarter window, of much slimmer design than before, were seen.

In 1976, the grille saw a new finer crosshatching pattern.&lt;ref name="flammang1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Flammang|first=James|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1976–1999 3rd Edition|year=1999|publisher=Krause publications|isbn=0-87341-755-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornering lamps got new horizontal chrome trim while taillamps gained new chrome-like trim. New 'Fleetwood' nameplates with block lettering replaced the  'Fleetwood' script on the front fenders and trunk lid. A Controlled (limited-slip) Differential was included for extra traction. An optional illuminated entry and theft deterrence system was optional. A new [[ACDelco|Delco Freedom]] battery never needed water. New turbine vaned and wire wheel covers were offered. A new option locked the doors when the transmission lever was shifted to "Drive". Cadillac also offered Track Master, a computerized skid prevention system that automatically pumped the back brakes in an emergency situation to shorten stopping distance. New options included a push-button Weather Band built into the AM/FM stereo signal-seeking radio. Of the 15 standard and six optional Firemist body colors, 13 were new this year. The Series 75 remained the only American-built vehicle that was designed and built strictly as a limousine. Big 75's had two separate automatic climate control systems. Interior choices were Medici crushed velour fabric in black or dark blue, or Magnan Knit in light gray. Full-width folding seats held three extra passengers. Passengers could use the control panel to raise/lower windows, turn on reading lamps, operate radio, or (in limousines) raise/lower the central partition. There were large fixed quarter windows behind the rear doors. Electronic fuel injection was optional on the {{convert|500|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]]. A cross-grain padded vinyl roof was optional. Series 75 also had new graphite-treated rear brake linings, reinforced shoes, and Hydro-Boost power-brake booster. They also boasted four cigarette lighters rather than the usual two.

In 1977 General Motors significantly down-sized their full sized cars in response to United States Federal [[CAFE standard]] legislation.  The Cadillac Fleetwood Limousine rode on a 144.5" wheelbase and was powered by a 425 cubic inch (7.0&amp;nbsp;L) V8.  This engine was basically a de bored version of the 472/500 (7.9&amp;nbsp;L/8.2&amp;nbsp;L) V8 of previous years.  Compared with the 1976 Cadillac Fleetwood 75 which it replaced, the Cadillac Fleetwood Limousine had a wheelbase 7.0" shorter and weighed about 900&amp;nbsp;lb (340&amp;nbsp;kg) less.

The 425&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in (7.0&amp;nbsp;L) engine, a reduced bore 472, was further debored for 1980-1981 to 368 cubic inches or 6.0&amp;nbsp;liters. For 1981, the 368 was provided with a modulated displacement system designed by Eaton Corporation, controlled by a digital computer, which locked off intake and exhaust valves to two or four of the eight cylinders, thus running effectively as a V6 or V4 under light load conditions where in third gear, and over {{convert|35|mph|abbr=on}}. This engine was called the "[[Cadillac V8 engine#368 and V8-6-4|V8-6-4]]", and its electronics and sensors proved troublesome and, except for limousines, this engine was dropped after 1981. The engine's controls and sensors were a stretch for the computer power of the era.

Both the 425 and 368 are small-bore versions of the durable 472 (which was introduced in late 1967 for the '68 model year). The larger 500 had the 472's bore but a longer stroke. This engine family was the last Cadillac cast-iron engine, and the last 'big-block'.

A new [[FF layout|front wheel drive]] [[General Motors]] [[GM C platform (FWD)|C-body]] [[monocoque|unibody]] platform was introduced in 1985. The Series 75 briefly shifted to this platform, stretched by {{convert|23.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} to a wheelbase of {{convert|134.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Even so, the modern edition was more than two feet shorter than the old rear-wheel drive version and weighed 1,200 pounds less, and naturally, also much narrower. The aluminum {{convert|249|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac High Technology engine#HT-4100|HT-4100]] [[V8 engine|V8]] was used to power the last generation of Series 75. The transmission was a 4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]. Unlike previous generations, the limousines were not built from the ground up, but created from [[Cadillac Coupe DeVille|Coupe DeVilles]] from the Orion plant rather than sedans with extra doors added in the process of stretching the wheelbase from the normal {{convert|110.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|134.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. They were built by [[Hess &amp; Eisenhardt]] at a plant in [[Madison Heights, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Theobald, "Fleetwood Metal Body Co." (History). Coachbuilt, 2004. http://www.coachbuilt.com/bui/f/fleetwood/fleetwood.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Theobald, "Hess &amp; Eisenhardt" (History). Coachbuilt, 2004. http://www.coachbuilt.com/bui/h/hess_eisenhardt/hess_eisenhardt.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Rear control panels let passengers lock or unlock doors, operate power windows, adjust climate, and control the stereo unit. Additionally, pushbuttons in the rear panels allowed backseat passengers to unlatch the rear doors electrically. Initially, just the standard eight-passenger [[limousine]] was available, but later in the model year, a seven-passenger formal limousine was offered featuring a partition with sliding glass between the front and rear compartments, and a secondary (trunk-mounted) climate control unit. Series 75 limousines had power operated mirrors and specific "Fleetwood" style seating patterns. Aluminum alloy wheels were standard on all 75s.

Only minor equipment changes arrived for 1986, including the previously optional electronic instrument cluster was now standard equipment, and an armrest-mounted cellular telephone with overhead microphone became available. Cherry grain replaced the former walnut grain on instrument panel and door trim appliques. Automatic door locking prevented the doors from opening with the limousine in gear. 

The Cadillac Fleetwood Limousine was available in eight colors (two enamels, four metallics, and two extra-cost colors). Exterior colors included Cotillion White, Sable Black, Platinum Metallic, Academy Gray Metallic, Gossamer Blue Metallic, Commodore Blue Metallic, Corinthian Blue Firemist, and Black Cherry Pearlmist. Tuxedo Grain vinyl roof covering was available in six matching colors for all shades (including Black Cherry Pearlmist), except for Gossamer Blue and Corinthian Blue, which were equipped with the Dark Blue (the same color used for the Commodore Blue models) vinyl roof. Standard-equipment single-color exterior accent stripes were available in nine colors, including White, Dark Gray, Black, Light Blue, Medium Mauve, Dark Blue, Gold, Red, and Dark Claret. Interior colors were upholstered in Black, Gray, and Dark Blue - in Royal Prima Cloth or optional Leather. The front compartment of the Formal Limousine (with the divider window) was upholstered in Black Leather regardless of the color or material selected for the rear compartment.

Both the front and rear styling of the limousine and formal limousine was revised for 1987. A new grille, header moldings and composite headlights with wraparound bezel and cornering lamps were used. Rear styling now featured elongated quarter extensions against which the taillamps, bumper and bumper trim fascia fit flush. Also new was grooved six-inch wide rocker molding made of stainless steel/aluminum composite with a single-rib accent groove. For 1987, new hydro-elastic engine mounts were used to further isolate powertrain vibration.  

In 1987, the Sixty Special was reintroduced in limited production to fill non-limousine demands, though the 75 continued to be built by Hess &amp; Eisenhardt and offered until 1992 by special order only&lt;ref name="theobald" /&gt;.{{clear}}

The '''Cadillac Fleetwood''' is a model of [[Luxury vehicle|luxury car]] that was manufactured by the [[Cadillac]] division of [[General Motors]] between 1976 and 1996.  The "Fleetwood" name was previously used as a prefix on several of Cadillac's models dating back to 1935.  Four door cars bearing the name "Fleetwood" generally had longer [[wheelbase]]s than Cadillac's more common [[Cadillac Series 62|Series 62]] and [[Cadillac de Ville series|DeVille]] models.

Through 1984, all Fleetwood series cars were rear wheel drive. For 1985, "Fleetwood" was used on new [[front wheel drive]] models which were made through 1992.  In 1987, a stretched wheelbase car was offered and named the Fleetwood 60 Special, a name which was last used in 1970 for the non-Brougham RWD Fleetwood car.  During this time,  the [[rear wheel drive]] cars built on the older Fleetwood platform dating from 1977 continued to be offered as "Fleetwood Brougham" (later shortened to "[[Cadillac Brougham|Brougham]]").  In 1993, a new rear wheel drive Fleetwood was introduced, but was discontinued after 1996.

Before 1934, all Cadillac models could be ordered with bodies built by General Motors' [[Fleetwood Metal Body|Fleetwood]] operation in [[Fleetwood, Pennsylvania]], instead of their usual [[Fisher Body]], and between 1935 and 1941, cars bearing the Fleetwood name were assembled there.

==Pre-history 1916–1924==
[[File:Cadillac.fleetwood.v8.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|1929 Cadillac V-8 series 341-B Imperial sedan or limousine, body by Fleetwood]]

Lawrence P. Fisher was the Fisher brother most closely involved with [[Cadillac]] in its early years. In 1916 he joined the [[Fisher Body]] Company which had been formed by two of his brothers in 1908. Larry (as people knew him) was one of four of the seven Fisher brothers who brought Fisher Body Corporation under the [[General Motors]] umbrella in 1919. In May, 1925 [[Alfred P. Sloan]], then the head of General Motors, appointed Fisher as Cadillac General Manager, an office he retained through 1934. Fisher immediately went to work adding exclusive, custom bodies to the Cadillac range. Thus he oversaw the purchase of the [[Fleetwood Metal Body]] Company by the Fisher Body Corporation in September, 1925.&lt;ref name="cadillacdatabase.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadillacdatabase.net/Dbas_txt/Factd-g.htm|title=Cadillac Terms and Definitions D - G|date=|publisher=Cadillacdatabase.net|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111154213/http://www.cadillacdatabase.net/Dbas_txt/Factd-g.htm|archivedate=2012-01-11|url-status=dead|accessdate=2011-12-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fleetwood Body Company of [[Fleetwood, Pennsylvania]], was founded by Harry Urich in the nineteenth century. It began as a small community of craftsmen founded by Henry Fleetwood, Esq. of [[Penwortham]], near [[Lancaster, England]] (the Fleetwood family flourished in England in the 17th and 18th centuries). The rich traditions of 300 years of coach-building that the Fleetwood Body Company applied to its work on cars secured for it a high reputation in automobile circles worldwide by the 1920s.&lt;ref name="cadillacdatabase.net"/&gt; Coachwork was built by Fleetwood for a variety of luxury makes through 1924.

After the Fisher Body Corporation purchased the Fleetwood Body Company in 1925, Fleetwood bodies were reserved exclusively for Cadillac. By 1929 GM had purchased the remaining stock holdings of the Fisher Body Corporation and thus became sole owner of both the Fisher and Fleetwood companies.&lt;ref name="cadillacdatabase.net"/&gt; From 1927 through 1934 all Cadillac series offered Fleetwood bodies as an option.&lt;ref name="Kimes 1996"&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1805-1942|last=Kimes|first=Beverly|publisher=Krause publications|year=1996|isbn=0-87341-428-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunnell|first=John|title=Standard Catalog of Cadillac 1903-2005|year=2005|publisher=Krause publications|isbn=0873492897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Cadillac Fleetwood Sixty Special|Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham|Cadillac Series 75}}

After 1934, Cadillac became more selective in offering Fleetwood bodies on its series and by 1938 the only way to obtain a Fleetwood bodied car was by buying a [[Cadillac Series 70|Cadillac Series 75]] or [[Cadillac V-16|90]], as even the [[Cadillac Sixty Special]] had a Fisher body in its inaugural year. The Fleetwood script and crest would not appear on the exterior of any Cadillac until the 1947 model year when it appeared on the rear deck lid of the [[Cadillac Sixty Special|Sixty Special]]. By 1952 it also appeared on the rear deck lid of the Series 75. In 1957 the [[Cadillac Series 70]] [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]] [[Cadillac Brougham|Brougham]] joined the Sixty Special and the Series 75 as the only Cadillac models with Fleetwood bodies although Fleetwood script or crests did not appear anywhere on the exterior of the car.&lt;ref name="SIA1970"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Special Interest Autos|issue=#2 Nov.–Dec. 1970|title=Mark II Meets Eldorado Brougham}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the first time in 20 years that a Fleetwood bodied car was paired with the Brougham name.&lt;ref name="Kimes 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975|last=Kowalke|first=Ron|publisher=Krause publications|year=1997|isbn=0-87341-521-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/standardcatalogo00beve}}&lt;/ref&gt; When production of the Eldorado Brougham was shifted in 1959 from the Cadillac Fleetwood plant in [[Detroit]] to [[Pininfarina]] in [[Turin, Italy]], only then did it acquire Fleetwood wheel discs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1957-1960-cadillac-eldorado-brougham5.htm |title=1957-1960 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham - page 5 |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and doorsill moldings,&lt;ref name="1957-1960Cadillac EldoradoPage6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1957-1960-cadillac-eldorado-brougham6.htm |title=1957-1960 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham - page 6 |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; presumably because the design work&lt;ref name="1957-1960Cadillac EldoradoPage6"/&gt; and final touches&lt;ref name="Bonsal2003"/&gt; were still being done by Fleetwood. 

Production of the Eldorado Brougham ceased in 1961 but in 1963 the Eldorado Biarritz also became Fleetwood bodied and immediately acquired Fleetwood crests on its rear quarters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadillacdatabase.net/Dbas_txt/Phocad63.htm |title=Cadillac photos - 1963 |publisher=Cadillacdatabase.net |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fleetwood rocker panel moldings.&lt;ref name="Bonsal2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonsall|first=Thomas|title=The Cadillac Story|year=2003|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0-8047-4942-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1963 Eldorado Biarritz was also the first Fleetwood bodied convertible since the Cadillac Series 75 stopped offering 4-door and 2-door convertible body styles and production of the Cadillac Series 90 ceased in 1941.&lt;ref name="Kimes 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt;

In 1965, the Eldorado, Sixty Special and Series 75 models were designated as Fleetwood “subseries” but this would only last through the 1972 model year and during this period there never was a separate Fleetwood series per se.&lt;ref name="Kowalke 1997"/&gt; Fleetwood became a much more integral part of a Cadillac series name in 1977 with the introduction of the [[Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham]] and the Cadillac Fleetwood Limousine, which replaced the Fleetwood Sixty Special Brougham and the Fleetwood 75 respectively. In 1985, Fleetwood became a separate series in its own right.&lt;ref name="Gunnell 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flammang 1999"&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1976-1999|last=Flammang|first=James|publisher=Krause publications|year=1999|isbn=0-87341-755-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new [[front wheel drive]] [[GM C platform (FWD)|C-body]] platform was introduced in 1985. The Fleetwood shared the same {{convert|110.8|in}} wheelbase as the other C-body cars, the [[Cadillac De Ville|DeVille]], [[Buick Electra]], and [[Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight]].&lt;ref name=TM585&gt;{{cite magazine | magazine = Tekniikan Maailma | ref = TM | date = 1985-03-19 | number = 5/85 | volume = 41 | issn = 0355-4287 | title = Luksusmatka menneisyyteen | trans-title = A luxury trip into the past | last = Sihvonen | first = Jukka | publisher = TM-Julkaisu | location = Helsinki | language = fi | page = 70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham|Fleetwood Brougham]] continued to use the RWD platform, (which was redesignated as "[[GM D platform|D-body]]" for 1985) through 1986.

[[File:'86 Cadillac Fleetwood (Toronto Spring '12 Classic Car Auction).JPG|thumb|left|1986 Cadillac Fleetwood]]
As had been the case since the 1977 model year, there were little more than trim differences between the Fleetwood and the DeVille. For 1985, the Fleetwood was actually a DeVille trim option, rather than a separate model. The optional '''d'Elegance''' package, added tufted-button seating among other niceties for the FWD Fleetwood sedan.  The Fleetwood coupe was dropped after the 1986 model year, but returned in 1989.

A new [[Cadillac Sixty Special|Cadillac Fleetwood Sixty Special]] model was added to the lineup for 1987 and 1988 and used a stretched {{convert|115.8|in}} version of the new C-body platform, while the 1985 through 1987 Fleetwood Series 75 used a {{convert|134.4|in}} stretched version of the same platform. The aluminum 4.1&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Cadillac V8 engine#HT-4100|HT-4100]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] was replaced by the 4.5&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Cadillac V8 engine#4.5|HT-4500]]'' for 1988. The engine displacement was increased for 1991 to the 4.9&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Cadillac V8 engine#L26 4.9|HT-4900]]''.

[[File:1990 Cadillac Fleetwood coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1990 Cadillac Fleetwood coupe]]
The Fleetwood line was redesigned for the 1989 model year. To visually differentiate from the DeVilles which had also been redesigned, the upper-rung Fleetwood and Sixty Special models came with fender skirts over the rear wheels, while the DeVille had full rear-wheel openings. The Fleetwood [[coupe]] remained on the old {{convert|110.8|in|abbr=on}} wheelbase, while the [[sedan (car)|sedan]]'s wheelbase increased by {{convert|3|in|abbr=off}}. The [[USD|US$]]30,000+ sticker prices were a bargain compared to the large German luxury cars of the time but the Fleetwoods lacked the performance and cornering/handling characteristics of the import rivals.
[[File:1989 Cadillac Fleetwood.jpg|thumb|left|1989 Cadillac Fleetwood Sedan]]

Power was increased to {{convert|180|hp|abbr=on|0}} from the same 4.5&amp;nbsp;L engine for 1990 through the use of a [[variable length intake manifold|dual-stage intake manifold]] and other changes. It was replaced by the {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on|0}} 4.9&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Cadillac V8 engine#L26 4.9|HT-4900]]'' for 1991.

The Fleetwood nameplate departed the front-drive lineup for 1993 (as Fleetwood was transferred to the new rear-drive replacement for the 1992 Brougham). Instead, the Sixty Special nameplate was used on the front wheel drive model for 1993.  There were 5,292 Sixty Specials built in 1993, including 688 with the optional "Ultra" Package that featured 22-way adjustable front seats, designed in Italy by Giorgio Giugiaro. This seating package had been standard on the Sixty Special since 1989, but in 1993, it became a $3,550 option. While it was based upon the DeVille, the Sixty Special included eleven items as standard equipment, while those eleven items were optional at extra cost on DeVilles, and in addition there were options for the Sixty Special, that were unavailable on the DeVille, such as "Memory Seat" for driver with two recall settings, an "Exit" button" when pushed automatically powered the driver seat all the way rearward, and dual front seat power recliners.

Both the Fleetwood and DeVille were coded as C-bodies in the fourth digit of the [[VIN]]. The fifth digit coded the DeVille as "D" (with the later Touring Sedan becoming "T"), the Fleetwood as "B", and the Fleetwood Sixty Special as "S". The Sixty Special became the "G" code for 1991, and switched back to "B" for its 1993 run.

For 1993, the '''Fleetwood''' name (and exterior) was switched from the DeVille's [[front wheel drive]] C-body to the newly revised [[rear wheel drive]] [[GM D platform|D-body]] that the [[Cadillac Brougham]] had used previously. It was one of the first American front wheel drive vehicles to be returned to rear-wheel drive.

The DeVille was used again in 1997, after production of the Fleetwood ceased. After 1996, the Cadillac Fleetwood was retired by General Motors along with all other rear-wheel drive sedans and the assembly plant was converted to truck production for the Chevrolet [[Chevrolet Suburban#1992–1999|Suburban]] and [[Chevrolet Tahoe#1992–1999 (GMT400)|Tahoe]] because of the increasing demand for SUVs.&lt;ref name="HowStuff1990-1999-cadillac6"/&gt;

'''Packages'''

The '''Brougham''' option package included a full vinyl top, [[Pillar (car)|C-pillar]] badging, specific seat design with six-way driver's seat memory and heated and three-position lumbar front seats, instrument panel badging and rear seat storage armrest.

The {{convert|7000|lb|abbr=on}} trailer towing package was made available 1993, a return to production sedan since the 1971–1976 [[Cadillac Sixty Special]] {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}. The [[Regular Production Option|RPO]] V4P package included heavy duty cooling (RPO V08, which consisted of a seven-blade mechanical primary fan, a heavy-duty electrical secondary fan, and an extra capacity radiator), RPO FE2 Suspension System Ride Handling, HD 4L60 transmission, RPO KC4 Cooling System Engine Oil, RPO KD1 Cooling System Transmission Oil, RPO KG9 140&amp;nbsp;amp alternator, and RPO GT4 3.73 gears with an 8.5-inch ring gear. In 1994–1996, the V4P package was revised with RPO GU6 3.42 gears with the new more powerful RPO LT1 {{convert|260|hp|0|abbr=on}} V8, and HD 4L60E transmission with revised accumulators to shift smoother with the shorter rear axle gearing.

It is built on a different platform than the smaller [[Cadillac CTS|CTS]] and is engineered as a rear-wheel drive vehicle with optional all-wheel drive. In addition to its primary markets of North America and China, the CT6 is also offered in Europe, Korea, Japan, and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.cadillaceurope.com/media/intl/en/cadillac/vehicles/2016-ct6/2016.html|title=Cadillac Pressroom - Europe - CT6|access-date=2016-11-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104011220/http://media.cadillaceurope.com/media/intl/en/cadillac/vehicles/2016-ct6/2016.html|archive-date=2016-11-04|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General Motors announced the discontinuation of the Cadillac CT6 in February 2020 due to retooling of the [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly|Detroit/Hamtramck]] facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/25/cadillac-expects-record-global-sales-in-2020-flagship-ct6-sedan-dead.html|title=Cadillac expects record global sales in 2020 – CT6 sedan officially dead|last=Wayland|first=Michael|date=2020-01-25|website=CNBC|language=en|access-date=2020-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 3, 2020, GM announced that a new flagship, called the Celestiq, is in development and will be battery-powered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1063056_cadillac-celestiq-true-flagship-sedan-finally-happening-and-it-will-be-electric|title=Cadillac Celestiq: True flagship sedan finally happening–and it will be electric|website=Motor Authority|language=en|access-date=2020-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/cadillac-celestiq-electric-sedan-will-be-hand-built-2020-3|title=GM just revealed the Celestiq — an all-electric flagship Cadillac sedan that will be built by hand|last=DeBord|first=Matthew|website=Business Insider|access-date=2020-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:2018 Cadillac CT6 Premium Luxury AWD Super Cruise, rear right.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view]]
[[File:2019 Cadillac CT6 Premium Luxury, front 8.28.19.jpg|thumb|left|Front view (facelift)]]
[[File:2019 Cadillac CT6 Premium Luxury, rear 8.28.19.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view (facelift)]]
The CT6 is longer and wider than the [[Cadillac XTS|XTS]] and offers more interior volume. It uses a mix of steel and aluminum making it lighter than other cars in its size class. It was brought to market as an addition to, not a replacement for, the now-discontinued XTS. 

Cadillac projected the CT6 would be the temporary flagship until it would bring a larger, more luxurious CT8 sedan to market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cadillac CT8 Will be the Brand's First True Flagship in the Modern Era|url=http://www.automobilemag.com/features/magazine/1508-cadillac-ct8-will-be-the-brands-first-true-flagship-in-modern-era/|author=Automobile Staff|website=[[Automobile (magazine)|Automobile]]|date=19 June 2015|accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CT8 did not come to fruition, and the CT6 remained the brand's flagship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cadillac Kills CT8 Project|url=http://www.autotalk.com/cadillac-reported-kills-ct8-project-32949/|author=Automobile Staff|website=[[Automobile (magazine)|Automobile]]|date=5 April 2016|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For the American market, the CT6 was manufactured at GM's [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly]] plant.&lt;ref name="dbusiness"/&gt; On March 11, 2016, the first CT6 delivery took place, having been delivered to the winner of a 2015 auction for the first CT6 sold. The vehicle sold for $200,000 at the auction. The car was "Platinum" trim level and painted Stellar Black Metallic.&lt;ref&gt;Szymkowski, Sean. "First Production 2016 Cadillac CT6 Leaves Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly." GM Authority. Motrolix LLC., 11 Mar. 2016.

Installed within the CT6 is the second generation [[Cadillac CUE|CUE system]], [[4G]] LTE connectivity, and an 8 speaker Bose audio system, a Bose Centerpoint 10 speaker system included with the "Luxury" and "Premium Luxury" package, with a 34-speaker [[Bose speaker packages|Bose Panaray]] audio system included with the top level "Platinum" package. Cadillac once again offers the [[Automotive night vision#Cadillac|Enhanced Night Vision]] which was discontinued as of 2004 on the [[Cadillac de Ville series#Eighth generation (2000–2005)|DeVille]]. Available equipment includes Adaptive Cruise Control, as well as [[MagneRide|Magnetic Ride Control]] coupled with accident avoidance technologies. New with the CT6 is the Rear Camera Mirror, which uses streaming video from a camera that displays within the rear view mirror, which provides an enhanced view without obstructions from the "[[Pillar (car)|C-pillar]]" and passengers sitting in the rear area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cadillac CT6 Getting Streaming-Video Rearview Mirror Cam|url=http://uk.pcmag.com/cars-products/38444/news/cadillac-ct6-getting-streaming-video-rearview-mirr|last=Mlot|first=Stephanie|website=PC Magazine|date=22 December 2014|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Put blind spots in the rearview with this high-tech car|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/102281640#.|last=LeBeau|first=Phil|website=[[CNBC]]|date=18 December 2014|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cadillac CT6 Interior Rearview Mirror to Stream Video|url=http://wardsauto.com/vehicles-technology/cadillac-ct6-interior-rearview-mirror-stream-video|last=Amend|first=James M.|website=[[Ward's|WardsAuto]]|date=18 December 2014|accessdate=13 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230010527/http://wardsauto.com/vehicles-technology/cadillac-ct6-interior-rearview-mirror-stream-video#|archive-date=2014-12-30|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front seats can be adjusted 14 different ways, with an optional 16- or 20-way adjustment package that includes heated and cooled seat with a massage feature for both front and rear passengers. Rear seat passengers are also offered, retractable 10" LCD screens that extract up from the back of the front seat seatbacks, behind the front seat headrests that can play [[Blu-ray]] content for brought-in devices, that were introduced on the [[Cadillac Escala]] concept car.&lt;ref&gt;[Information transcribed from 2016 Cadillac CT6 sales brochure]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Powertrain===
The CT6 was initially available with a choice of three engines, a [[Inline-4 engine|4-cylinder]] 2.0-liter [[Turbocharger|turbo]] (a first for a full-size Cadillac) and two [[V6 engine]]s, a 3.6-liter and a 3.0-liter [[twin-turbo]]charged offering {{convert|404|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|400|lb·ft|0|abbr=on}} together with [[cylinder deactivation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cadillac CT6 arrives at New York.

Torque for both engines is {{convert|640 and 574|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cadillac CT6 Receiving All-New 4.2-liter Twin-Turbo V8|url=http://www.carscoops.com/2016/01/cadillac-ct6-receiving-all-new-42-liter.html|last=Anderson|first=Brad|publisher=Carscoops|date=22 January 2016|accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CT6 PHEV===
A [[plug-in hybrid]] variant, the '''CT6 PHEV''', debuted at the 2015 [[Auto Shanghai|Shanghai Auto Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Cadillac CT6 Plug-In Hybrid Debuts At 2015 Shanghai Auto Show|url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1097908_2016-cadillac-ct6-plug-in-hybrid-debuts-at-2015-shanghai-auto-show|last=Vijayenthiran|first=Viknesh|publisher=Motor Authority|date=20 April 2015|accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plug-in hybrid uses a similar powertrain as the current [[Chevrolet Volt (second generation)]]. The powertrain combines a 266&amp;nbsp;hp, 2.0L turbocharged 4-cylinder direct injected gasoline engine with a two motor, hybrid transmission and a liquid cooled 18.4 [[kWh]] [[lithium-ion battery]] pack, which is integrated into the car floor as well as an e-CVT. Total combined power is {{convert|250|kW|hp|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadillac.com/plug-in-hybrids/ct6-plug-in|title=2018 CT6 Plug-In {{!}} Cadillac|website=www.cadillac.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The powertrain is manufactured in the United States and the vehicle's final assembled point is in Jinqiao, China (by [[SAIC-GM|Shanghai GM]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cadillac CT6 gets a plug in Shanghai, will come to US|url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1101939_gms-second-chinese-import-to-be-cadillac-ct6-plug-in-hybrid-report|last=Vijayenthiran|first=Viknesh|publisher=Motor Authority|date=18 January 2016|accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cadillac CT6 gets a plug in Shanghai, will come to US|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2015/04/19/cadillac-ct6-plug-in-hybrid-shanghai-will-come-usa/|last=Blanco|first=Sebastian|publisher=Autoblog.com|date=20 April 2015|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CT6 plug-in hybrid was released in the Chinese market in December 2016.&lt;ref name="CT6price"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hybridcars.com/cadillac-ct6-plug-in-hybrid-priced-up-to-95000-plus-in-china/ | title=Cadillac CT6 Plug-In Hybrid Priced Up To $95,000-Plus In China | first=Jeff | last=Cobb| work=HybridCars.com| date=2017-01-02| accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pricing in China started at {{Yuan|558,800}} (~{{USD|80,408}}), with a higher trim at {{Yuan|658,800}} (~ {{USD|94,683}}) before [[Government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles|any applicable government incentives]].&lt;ref name=CT6price/&gt; The CT6 PHEV went on sale in the U.S. in March 2017 in Premium Luxury trim level with a base price of US$75,095, also before applicable government incentives.

The CT6 PHEV has an [[EPA]] [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] rating of 62 MPGe (54 kWh per 100 miles) combined while running on full electric power, or 25 MPG combined in hybrid mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/noframes/39767.shtml |title=Fuel Economy of the 2018 Cadillac CT6 Plug-In |publisher=Fueleconomy.gov |date= |accessdate=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[EPA]]-certified electric range is 31 miles, while the total range of both the gasoline engine and hybrid electric motor combined is over 440 miles. It is the first Cadillac product to be manufactured in China.

===Technological innovations===
The all-new CT6 is the first vehicle to feature the new [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] Panaray Surround-Sound System, using [[Dolby]] [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]] [[Surround Sound]] Technology. The system consists of 34 speakers, including ones mounted in the front seat headrests, as well as a motorized center-channel speaker that retracts from the center of the instrument panel. The system uses [[Bose Corporation|Bose]]'s automotive sound system technologies, as well as technologies from its Panaray line of professional speakers. The entire CT6 line comes standard with one of three [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] premium audio systems: an 8-speaker [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] Premium Sound System, a 10-speaker [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] Centerpoint Surround-Sound System,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadillac.com/sedans/ct6-sedan/trims|title=2018 CT6 Sedan - Compare Trims {{!}} Cadillac|website=www.cadillac.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the top-of-the-line 34-speaker [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] Panaray Surround-Sound System.

Another innovation on the CT6 is a rear view mirror camera, which allows the driver to easily see what is behind them via a digital image projected onto the rearview mirror. This is the first vehicle to offer a rearview camera mounted in the rearview mirror.

Starting in 2017, Cadillac Super Cruise became available for semi-autonomous highway driving. It is part of a $5,000 option package on CT6's Premium Luxury model and is standard on the top-of-the-line Platinum.

===CT6-V===
[[File:2019 Cadillac CT6 V-Sport front 4.2.18.jpg|thumb|Cadillac CT6-V front]]
[[File:2019 Cadillac CT6 V-Sport rear 4.2.18.jpg|thumb|Cadillac CT6-V rear]]

Introduced as a high-performance version of the CT6, the CT6-V (formerly known as the V-Sport)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedrive.com/news/23740/the-cadillac-ct6-v-sport-is-now-the-ct6-v|title=The Cadillac CT6 V-Sport Is Now the CT6-V|last=Brandt|first=Eric|work=The Drive|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; was first revealed at the [[New York Auto Show#2018|2018 New York Auto Show]]. Apart from the regular CT6 is the addition of newly developed DOHC twin-turbo V8 which produces {{convert|550|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 5,700 rpm and {{convert|640|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 3,200-4,000 rpm. The engine, known as the GF18, has an 86.0&amp;nbsp;mm bore and 90.2&amp;nbsp;mm stroke with a compression ratio of 9.8:1. In order to withstand stress and reduce friction, Cadillac has used forged steel connecting rods and special coating for piston pins. For efficiency, Cadillac has employed cylinder deactivation for number 2, 3, 5, and 8 cylinders with variable timing on all four cams that can adjust 55 degrees on the exhaust and 70 degrees on the intake side. When the engine is off, the intake cams are parked in the middle of their traveling preventing exhaust/intake valve overlap allow for easier starting and smoother initial idle. Fuel is injected directly into the cylinder with over 5,000 psi pressure. Cast stainless steel exhaust manifolds incorporates housing for the twin-scroll Mitsubishi Heavy Industries turbochargers located inside the V bank for better response. Titanium aluminide turbine wheels spin up to 190,000 rpm producing peak boost of 20 psi that is relieved by electric wastegates. The intercooler is mounted just above each cylinder heads which reduces the charge air temperature by 130 degrees Fahrenheit immediately before reaching the intake valves. Two versions of the GF18 will be offered in the CT6-V. The top trim makes {{convert|550|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} while the alternative choice will make {{convert|500|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|574|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The two engines are tuned with slight differences such as the active valve system and ECU mapping. The engines are hand-assembled and personally signed on the Performance Build Centerline at the Bowling Green Kentucky Corvette plant. Both engines are mated with 10-speed automatic transmission shifted by Performance Algorithm Shift programming to achieve the ideal shifting patterns. The CT6-V also features AWD system with optimized Transfer case, rear steering and mechanical Limited Slip Differential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/ct6/2019/2019-cadillac-ct6-v-sport-twin-turbo-v8-first-look-review/|title=2019 Cadillac CT6 V-Sport Twin Turbo V-8 First Look: Northstar 2.0 - Motor Trend|date=2018-03-21|work=Motor Trend|access-date=2018-04-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AWD system will adjust according to the 3 different driving modes that are available. The standard torque bias remains 40:60 front to rear yet, in track mode, the torque split is changed to provide 10:90 for optimized track performance with minimum understeer. Furthermore, the front end and rear end are redesigned. The front features a new hood, headlamps, and grill with rear featuring new deck lid and tail lamps. The chassis is recalibrated with specific tuning for stabilizer bar, springs, and Magnetic Ride dampers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tflcar.com/2018/03/2019-cadillac-ct6-v-sport/|title=2019 Cadillac CT6 V-Sport Features Brand's First Engine Since Northstar, Plus More Performance Upgrades [Video] - The Fast Lane Car|date=2018-03-29|work=The Fast Lane Car|access-date=2018-04-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, General Motors reversed its decision to cancel the project and announced the Converj concept would go into production as the Cadillac ELR, at a price less than the {{USD|57,400}} [[Tesla Model S]], but did not provide details on performance or timing.

==Specifications==
[[File:2014 Cadillac ELR DoE.jpg|thumb|[[U.S. Department of Energy]] Secretary [[Steven Chu]] discusses the features of the 2014 Cadillac ELR exhibited at the 2013 [[Washington Auto Show]].]]

The ELR incorporates a version of the [[Voltec]]&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt; propulsion system used in the [[Chevrolet Volt]]. The Voltec propulsion system includes a 119–135-kilowatt electric motor, a [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] engine-generator and a 16.5&amp;nbsp;[[kWh]] [[lithium-ion battery]] pack. The ELR has an official [[all-electric range]] of {{Convert|37|mi|km}} and a total range of {{convert|340|mi|abbr=on}}, as rated by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).&lt;ref name=EPAratings/&gt; Charging times are 12.5–18 hours using the 120-volt travel charger, and about 5 hours using a 240-volt charging station.  Top speed is {{Convert|106|mph|abbr=on}} and accelerates from 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph in 7.8 seconds in [[range extender (vehicle)|range extended mode]].&lt;ref name=Specs&gt;{{cite web|title=Cadillac ELR Specs|url=http://www.myelr.com/cadillac-elr-specs|publisher=My Electric Car Forums|accessdate=21 November 2013|author=Mike Szostech}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regenerative braking is controlled by steering wheel-mounted paddles.&lt;ref name="specs"/&gt;

Features include LED lighting, active air shutters, automatic high/low-beam headlamps, Bose 10-speaker sound system with active noise cancellation, and hand-cut-and-sewn interior with leather seating and microfiber suede headliners. Optional features include a full speed-range adaptive cruise control, collision-imminent braking, side blind zone assist and rear cross-traffic warning. The base model has 16-way-adjustable seats, with an optional 20-way-adjustable system.&lt;ref name="specs"&gt;{{cite web

For MY 2014, the ELR was available in four exterior colors, radiant silver metallic, black raven, graphite metallic and extra-cost bi-coat crystal red — with a tri-coat white edition of 100 examples marketed through [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] —  fully optioned with an upgraded 240-volt charging station (including installation) and concierge service.&lt;ref name="saks"&gt;{{cite web

==2016 model==
Skipping the 2015 model year, for the 2016 [[model year]] Cadillac decreased the ELR's MSRP by $10,000 and raised total system horsepower, from its two electric motors and gasoline four-cylinder engine.  Horsepower increased from 217 to 233, and peak torque increased from 295 lb-ft to 373 – reducing the zero-to-60 time by 1.5 seconds.  The 2016 models featured revised torque-steer-mitigating strut technology with stiffer springs, stiffer control-arm bushings, and the addition of a damper rebound spring.

The rear twist-beam axle received stiffer bushings for its Watts linkage and the adaptive suspension was retuned to match the increased stiffness and the recalibrated steering. Brakes were also upgraded. An optional performance package reduces the ELR's electric-only driving range by about four miles, and includes summer-only performance tires, new 20-inch wheels, Brembo four-piston front brake calipers with 13.6-inch vented rotors, a sport steering wheel with a thicker rim, and unique steering and suspension revisions.

The 2016 ELR included previously optional blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, automatic high beams, and lane-change alert as well as a 4G LTE onboard data connection with Wi-Fi hotspot capability.  The 2016 model also features Cadillac's revised, wreathless crest badge and a revised front "grille."

The engine management software was updated and the regenerative braking system reconfigured. The 2016 ELR delivered an [[all-electric range]] of {{Convert|39|mi|abbr=on}}, up from {{Convert|37|mi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2015/04/15/cadillac-2016-elr-update-more-power-9000-price-drop/|title=2016 Cadillac ELR gets more power, $9,000 price drop|author=Noah Joseph|work=[[Autoblog.com]]|date=April 15, 2015|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fuel economy==

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) officially rated the 2014 model year ELR's combined city/highway [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] in [[all-electric mode]] at 82 [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent]] (MPG-e) (2.9 L gasoline equivalent/100&amp;nbsp;km; 98 mpg-imp gasoline equivalent). This rating considers a conversion factor of 33.7&amp;nbsp;[[kWh]] of electricity being the energy equivalent of a gallon of gasoline, and the ELR has an energy consumption rate of 41 kWh/100&amp;nbsp;mi for combined city/highway driving.&lt;ref name=EPAratings/&gt; The EPA rating in gasoline-only mode is {{Convert|33|mpgus|abbr=on}} for combined driving. The 2014 Volt has a rating of {{Convert|37|mpgus|abbr=on}} for gasoline-only mode and a fuel economy in all-electric mode of 98 MPG-e (2.4 L gasoline equivalent/100&amp;nbsp;km; 118 mpg-imp gasoline equivalent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=34770&amp;id=33900|title=2014 Cadillac ELR and 2014 Chevrolet Volt|publisher=Fueleconomy.gov|author=[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] and [[U.S. Department of Energy]]|date=June 6, 2014|accessdate= 8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ELR has more power than the Volt but is {{convert|300|lb|abbr=on}} heavier.&lt;ref name=Autoblog112013/&gt;

==Operating modes==

The ELR has a traditional shift lever ([[PRNDL]]) with a button on the console allowing selection of four driving modes: Tour, Hold, Mountain and Sport:

::'''Tour mode''', the default setting, lets the ELR operate in [[all-electric mode]] (EV mode) until its battery is fully discharged. This mode provides the maximum powertrain efficiency and a minimum level of vibration.

::'''Hold mode''' allows the driver to save the energy currently stored in the battery for later use, such as traveling in urban areas.&lt;ref name="Autoblog112013" /&gt;

::'''Mountain mode''' was designed to provide more available battery power in mountainous environments by increasing minimum battery [[state of charge]] (SOC) in the battery. The car uses the gasoline-engine sooner, or runs it longer to build up the battery's state of charge, thus allowing the car to maintain performance on steep and long grades. Range extended versions of the BMW i3 do not have this mode and have struggled in these situations, resulting in a class-action lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/bmw-i3-rex-electric-car-lawsuit-range-extender-134500568.html|title=BMW i3 REx electric-car lawsuit: range-extender power loss alleged|access-date=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA's 2014 edition of the "Light-Duty Automotive Technology, Carbon Dioxide Emissions, and Fuel Economy Trends" report calculated utility factors for plug-in hybrids to estimate the percentage of miles that would be driven using electricity by the average driver, in electric only or blended modes. The ELR scored a utility factor of 65%, compared with 83% for the [[BMW i3 REx]], 66% for the Chevrolet Volt, 45% for the [[Ford Fusion Energi|Ford Energi models]], and 29% for the [[Toyota Prius PHV]].&lt;ref name="EPAtrends2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epa.gov/fueleconomy/fetrends/1975-2014/420r14023.pdf|title=Light-Duty Automotive Technology, Carbon Dioxide Emissions, and Fuel Economy Trends: 1975 Through 2014|publisher=EPA|author=[[U.

==Production and sales==
[[File:2014 Cadillac ELR delivery Dec 2013 (1).jpg|thumb|Shipping to dealers of the 2014 Cadillac ELR began in late December 2013.]]

In October 2012, General Motors announced that the ELR would be assembled at the [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly|Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Plant]], alongside the Chevrolet Volt, Opel Ampera, and Holden Volt. The addition of the ELR to the plant represented an additional {{USD|35}} million investment, bringing the total product investment at the plant to {{USD|561}} million since December 2009.

General Motors began assembly of pre-production vehicles to be used for testing in late May 2013. Production of vehicles destined for retail customers began in December 2013.&lt;ref name=jross&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2013/05/30/first-cadillac-elr-rolls-off-the-line/ |title=First Cadillac ELR Rolls Off the Line |last=Ross |first=Jeffrey N. |website=Autoblog |publisher=AOL |date=May 30, 2013 |accessdate=30 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JiNu9OMn?url=http://www.autoblog.com/2013/05/30/first-cadillac-elr-rolls-off-the-line/ |archivedate=September 18, 2013 |url-status=live |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=burden2013/&gt; Shipping to dealerships from the Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly began on December 20, 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evworld.com/news.cfm?newsid=31985|title=Cadillac Begins Delivery of ELR Luxury Sport Coupe Electric Hybrid|author=GM Press Release|publisher=EV World|date=December 20, 2013|accessdate=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, while retail deliveries were scheduled to begin in January 2014, the first 10 units were delivered early in December 2013—six in the U.S.&lt;ref name=ELR1st/&gt; and four in Canada.&lt;ref name=SalesCanada&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarreports.com/image/100496312_plug-in-electric-car-sales-in-canada-december-2014|title=Plug-in electric car sales in Canada, December 2014|first=Matthew |last=Klippenstein |publisher=Green Car Reports|date=January 2015|accessdate=18 February 2015}} ''A total of 4 ELRs were sold in 2013 and 44 in 2014.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
[[File:2014 Cadillac ELR coupe.jpg|thumb|2014 Cadillac ELR]]
In 2009, the Converj concept was awarded "Best Concept Vehicle" in the Eyes on Design Awards, "Most Significant Concept Vehicle of 2009" in the North American Concept Vehicle of the Year Awards and "Specialty Concept Vehicle of the Year" by the Southeast Automotive Media Organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Maynard |first=Shawn |url=http://www.automobile.com/cadillac-converj-named-best-concept-vehicle-of-2009-detroit-show.html |title=Cadillac Converj Named Best Concept Vehicle of 2009 Detroit Show |publisher=Automobile.com |year=2010 |accessdate=27 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217215006/http://www.automobile.com/cadillac-converj-named-best-concept-vehicle-of-2009-detroit-show.html |archivedate=February 17, 2012 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Blanco |first=Sebastian |url=http://green.autoblog.com/2009/06/24/fisker-karma-sunset-cadillac-converj-vw-bluesport-roadster-win/ |title=Fisker Karma Sunset, Converj, BlueSport Roadster win Concept Vehicle of the Year Awards |website=Autoblog Green |publisher=AOL |date=June 24, 2009 |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Biel |first=John |url=http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2009-north-american-concept-vehicle-of-the-year.htm |title=Converj "Emerjes" as Top Concept Vehicle |website=How Stuff Works ConsumerGuide Automotive |publisher=Publications International |date=July 1, 2009 |accessdate=27 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218074903/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2009-north-american-concept-vehicle-of-the-year.htm |archivedate=February 18, 2012 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
Cadillac launched the ELR marketing campaign with a 60-second television commercial.  Called ''Poolside'' and featuring actor [[Neal McDonough]], the commercial prominently aired during broadcast of the [[2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony]] as well as before and during the [[86th Academy Awards]] (Oscars) in March 2014.&lt;ref name="woodyard-20140303"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2014/03/03/cadillac-elr-ad-poolside/5965439/|title=Is Cadillac's ELR ad causing rich-guy backlash?|first=Chris|last=Woodyard|work=[[USA Today]]|date=March 3, 2014|accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commercial opens with its protagonist, an American businessman portrayed by McDonough, casually dressed and standing by the outdoor swimming pool of his contemporary, upscale home, asking ''"why do we work so hard?"'' He walks through his home, interacting with his family, changing into business attire, ultimately standing by and unplugging his ELR – while extolling the [[American Dream]], [[the Wright Brothers]], [[List of Apollo missions#Manned Apollo missions|NASA's moon mission]], [[Bill Gates]] and American work ethic and short annual leave – compared to other countries, unnamed.  He finally asserts from the driver's seat of his ELR that the house and car are the benefit of only taking two weeks off in August, finally asking rhetorically, ''n'est-ce pas?'' — and winking to the camera.&lt;ref name="mccarthy-20140301"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://adage.com/article/news/cadillac-clears-misconceptions-poolside-ad/291925/|title=Cadillac Clears Up 'Misconceptions' About Contentious 'Poolside' Ad|first=Michael|last=McCarthy|date=March 1, 2014|accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; GM [[target audience|targeted]] an audience earning $200,000 per year.&lt;ref name="mccarthy-20140301"/&gt;

The '''Cadillac DeVille''' was originally a trim level and later a separate model produced by [[Cadillac]]. The first car to bear the name was the 1949 Coupe de Ville, a pillarless two-door hardtop body style with a prestige trim level above that of the Series 62 luxury coupe. The last model to be formally known as a DeVille was the 2005 Cadillac DeVille, a full-size sedan, the largest car in the Cadillac model range at the time. The next year, the DeVille was officially renamed the [[Cadillac DTS]].

== Early history ==
[[File:Cadillac Coupe De Ville 1950.jpg|thumb|left|1950 Cadillac Series 62 Coupe de Ville]]
[[File:1955 Cadillac Coupe de Ville (29417015946).jpg|thumb|left|Cadillac Coupe de Ville badging]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Cadillac Series 62 Sedan 1956. four doors. Spielvogel.jpg|thumb|left|1956 Cadillac Series 62 Sedan]] --&gt;

The name "DeVille" is derived from the French ''de la ville'' or ''de ville'' meaning "of the town".&lt;ref name="cadillacdatabase1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cadillacdatabase.net/Dbas_txt/Factd-g.htm |title=Cadillac Terms and Definitions D - G |publisher=Cadillacdatabase.net |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111154213/http://www.cadillacdatabase.net/Dbas_txt/Factd-g.htm |archivedate=2012-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In French coach building parlance, a coupé de ville, from the French couper (to cut) i.e. shorten or reduce, was a short four-wheeled closed carriage with an inside seat for two and an outside seat for the driver and this smaller vehicle was intended for use in the town or city (de ville). An (unshortened) limousine or (in the United States) town car has a division between the passenger and driver compartments and if the driver's seat is outside it may be called a ''sedanca de ville'' or town car.&lt;ref name="cadillacdatabase1"/&gt;

The first Cadillac "Coupe de Ville" was shown during the [[General Motors Motorama#1949|1949 Motorama]]. It was built on a [[Cadillac Sixty Special]] chassis and featured a dummy air-scoop, chrome trim around front wheel openings, and a one-piece windshield and rear glass. The interior was black and trimmed in gray leather, including the headliner, to match the roof color. It was equipped with a telephone in the glove compartment, a vanity case and a secretarial pad in the rear armrest, power windows and highly decorative chrome interior trim. The prototype "Coupe de Ville" was used by GM President Charles E. Wilson until 1957 when he presented it to his secretary. At some time during this period it acquired a dark [[Vinyl top|Vicodec roof]].  The prototype "Coupe de Ville" was found again and beautifully restored in the 2nd decade of the New Millennium; it is currently (2016–17) in a private collection in London, Ontario, Canada.&lt;ref name="cadillacdatabase2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadillacdatabase.net/Dbas_txt/Facta-c.htm|title=Cadillac Terms and Definitions A - C|date=|publisher=Cadillacdatabase.net|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111112255/http://www.cadillacdatabase.net/Dbas_txt/Facta-c.htm|archivedate=2012-01-11|url-status=live|accessdate=2011-12-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cadillac Series 62]] Coupe de Ville was introduced late in the 1949 model year. Along with the [[Buick Roadmaster]] [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]], and the [[Oldsmobile 98]] Holiday, it was among the first pillarless [[hardtop]] coupes ever produced. At $3,496 it was only a dollar less than the Series 62 convertible, and like the convertible, it came with power windows standard. It was luxuriously trimmed, with leather upholstery and chrome 'bows' in the headliner to simulate the ribs of a convertible top. In its first year the Series 62 Coupe de Ville only sold 2,150 units. But 1950 sales more than doubled to 4507, and in 1951 sales more than doubled again to 10,241 exceeding the sales for the Series 62 Club Coupe that year. Also, in 1951, Coupe de Ville chrome script appeared on the rear roof pillar for the first time, to further distinguish it from the Series 62 Club Coupe.&lt;ref name="kowalke1997"&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975|last=Kowalke|first=Ron|publisher=Krause publications|year=1997|isbn=0-87341-521-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/standardcatalogo00beve}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gunnell2005"&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of Cadillac 1903–2005|last=Gunnell|first=John|publisher=Krause publications|year=2005|isbn=0873492897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956 the Series 62 Coupe de Ville was joined by the Series 62 Sedan de Ville, Cadillac's first standard production 4-door hardtop. Similarly to the Coupe de Ville, it was also more expensive and more luxuriously trimmed that the standard 4-door Series 62. With 41,732 sold, it also easily outsold the Series 62 sedan in its very first year. Given their sales success, it was only natural that the Coupe de Ville and Sedan de Ville were moved to their own separate series in 1959, the Series 6300, being joined by a DeVille convertible in 1964.&lt;ref name="kowalke1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gunnell2005"/&gt;

The 1959 [[Cadillac]] is remembered for its huge sharp tailfins with dual bullet tail lights, two distinctive rooflines and roof pillar configurations, new jewel-like grille patterns and matching deck lid beauty panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1959_Cadillac/1959_Cadillac_Comparison_Folder/1959%20Cadillac%20Comparison%20Folder-04.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-24 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225010824/http://oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1959_Cadillac/1959_Cadillac_Comparison_Folder/1959%20Cadillac%20Comparison%20Folder-04.html |archivedate=2015-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959 the [[Cadillac Series 62|Series 62]] were moved from the Series 62 to their own series, the '''Series 6200'''.  DeVilles and 2-door [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorados]] became the '''Series 6300''' and '''Series 6400''' respectively, though they all, including the 4-door Eldorado [[Cadillac Brougham|Brougham]] (which was moved from the '''[[Cadillac Series 70|Series 70]]''' to '''Series 6900'''), shared the same {{convert|130|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase. Engine output was an even 325&amp;nbsp;hp (242&amp;nbsp;kW) from the {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine. The DeVille Series had script nameplates on the rear fenders. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, back-up lamps, windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows and two-way power seats. Plain fender skirts covered the rear wheels and 4-doors were available in either four-window or six-window hardtop configurations. Over 53,000 DeVilles were sold in their first year as a separate series, accounting for roughly 37% of all Cadillacs sold.

The 1960 Cadillacs had smoother, more restrained styling. General changes included a full-width grille, the elimination of pointed front bumper guards, increased restraint in the application of chrome trim, lower tailfins with oval shaped nacelles and front fender mounted directional indicator lamps. DeVilles were distinguished by special script nameplates on the rear fenders. Four-window and six-window hardtop sedans were offered again. The former featured a one-piece wraparound backlight and flat-top roof, while the latter had a sloping rear window and roofline. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual back-up lamps, windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows and a two-way power seats. Technical highlights were finned rear drums and an X-frame construction. Interiors were done in Chadwick cloth or optional Cambray cloth and leather combinations.

Cadillac was restyled and re-engineered for 1961. The new grille slanted back towards both the bumper and the hood lip, along the horizontal plane, and sat between dual headlamps. New forward slanting front pillars with non-wraparound windshield glass were seen. The revised backlight treatment had crisp angular lines with thin pillars on some models and heavier semi-blind quarter roof posts on others. DeVille models featured front series designation scripts and a lower body "skeg" trimmed with a thin, three-quarter-length spear molding running from behind the front wheel opening to the rear of the car. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual backup lights, windshield washer, dual speed wipers, wheel discs, plain fender skirts, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows and 2-way power seats. Rubberized front and rear coil springs replaced the trouble prone air suspension system. Four-barrel induction systems were now the sole power choice and dual exhausts were no longer available. A new short-decked four-door Town Sedan hardtop appeared mid-season.

A mild facelift characterized Cadillac styling trends for 1962. A flatter grille with a thicker horizontal center bar and more delicate cross-hatched insert appeared. Ribbed chrome trim panel, seen ahead of the front wheel housings in 1961, were now replaced with cornering lamps and front fender model and series identification badges were eliminated. More massive front bumper end pieces appeared and housed rectangular parking lamps. At the rear tail lamps were now housed in vertical nacelles designed with an angled peak at the center. A vertically ribbed rear beauty panel appeared on the deck lid latch panel. Cadillac script also appeared on the lower left side of the radiator grille. The short-deck [[hardtop]] Town Sedan was moved from the DeVille series  to the Series 6200, being replaced by a short-deck Park Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960–1972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), p.147.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition all short deck Cadillac models went from being 6-window sedans in 1961 to 4-window sedans in 1962 and 1963. Standard equipment included all of last year's equipment plus remote controlled outside rearview mirror, five tubeless black wall tires, heater and defroster and front cornering lamps. Cadillac refined the ride and quietness, with more insulation in the floor and behind the firewall.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p.147.&lt;/ref&gt; DeVille sales as a separate series exceeded their sales level as a trim level for the first time ever at 71,883 units, or nearly 45% of Cadillac's total sales.

Cadillac was restyled again for 1963. Exterior changes imparted a bolder and longer look. Hoods and deck lids were redesigned. The front fenders projected 4.625 inches further forward than in 1962 while the tailfins were trimmed down somewhat to provide a lower profile. Body-side sculpturing was entirely eliminated. The slightly V-shaped radiator grille was taller and now incorporated outer extensions that swept below the flush-fender dual headlamps. Smaller circular front parking lamps were mounted in those extensions. A DeVille signature script was incorporated above the lower beltline molding near the rear of the body. A total of 143 options including bucket seats with [[wool]], [[leather]], or [[nylon]] upholstery fabrics and wood veneer facings on dash, doors, and seatbacks, set an all-time record for interior appointment choices. Standard equipment was the same as the previous year. The engine displacement and output remained the same, {{convert|390|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|325|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p.211.&lt;/ref&gt;

A minor facelift followed in 1964. New up front was a bi-angular grille that formed a V-shape along both its vertical and horizontal planes. The main horizontal grille bar was now carried around the body sides. Outer grille extension panels again housed the parking and cornering lamps. It was the 17th consecutive year for the Cadillac tailfins with a new fine-blade design carrying on the tradition. Performance improvements including a larger V-8 were the dominant changes for the model run. Equipment features were same as in 1963 for the most part. Comfort Control, a completely automatic heating and air conditioning system controlled by a dial thermostat on the instrument panel, was introduced as an industry first. The engine was bumped to {{convert|429|cid|l|0|abbr=on}}, with 340&amp;nbsp;hp (253.5&amp;nbsp;kW) available. Performance gains from the new engine showed best in the lower range, at 20 to 50&amp;nbsp;mph traffic driving speeds. A new technical feature was the Turbo-Hydramatic transmission, also used in the Eldorado and the Sixty Special. A DeVille script above the lower belt molding was continued as an identifier. This was the first year for the DeVille convertible. DeVille sales reached 110,379 units, accounting for nearly two thirds of all Cadillacs sold.

As it had been since DeVille became a separate series, DeVille denoted Cadillac's mainstream model, falling between the [[Cadillac Calais|Calais]] (which had replaced the [[Cadillac Series 62|Series 62]]) and the [[Cadillac Sixty Special|Sixty Special]] and [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]]. The DeVille was redesigned for 1965 but rode on the same {{convert|129.5|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase. Tailfins were canted slightly downward, and sharp, distinct body lines replaced the rounded look. Also new were a straight rear bumper and vertical lamp clusters. The headlight pairs switched from horizontal to vertical, thus permitting a wider grille. Curved frameless side windows appeared, and convertibles acquired tempered glass backlights. New standard features included lamps for luggage, glove and rear passenger compartments and front and rear safety belts. Power was still supplied by the 340 horsepower {{convert|429|CID|cc|abbr=on}} V8, which would be replaced by the {{convert|472|CID|cc|abbr=on}} for 1968. Perimeter frame construction allowed repositioning the engine six inches forward in the frame, thus lowering the transmission hump and increasing interior room. Pillared sedans appeared on the DeVille series for the first time, while six-window hardtop sedans were dropped. A padded vinyl roof was a $121 extra-cost option on the hardtop model. All four DeVille models had small "Tiffany-like" script nameplates on the ends of their rear fenders just above the chrome [[side molding]].

In 1966 changes included a somewhat coarser mesh for the radiator grille insert, which was now divided by a thick, bright metal horizontal center bar housing rectangular parking lamps at the outer ends. Separate rectangular side marker lamps replaced the integral grille extension designs. There was generally less chrome on all Cadillac models this year. DeVille scripts were still above the rear tip of the horizontal body rub moldings. Cadillac crests and V-shaped moldings, front and rear, were identifiers. Cadillac "firsts" this season included variable ratio steering and optional front seats with carbon cloth heating pads built into the cushions and seatbacks. Comfort and convenience innovations were headrests, reclining seats and an AM/FM stereo system. Automatic level control was available. Engineering improvements made to the perimeter frame increased ride and handling ease. Newly designed piston and oil rings and a new engine mounting system and patented quiet exhaust were used.

The 1967 DeVilles were extensively restyled. Prominent styling features were given a powerful frontal appearance with forward-leaning front end, long, sculptured body lines, and redefined rear fenders that had more than just a hint of tail fins in them. The full-width, forward-thrusted "eggcrate" grille was flanked by dual stacked headlights for the third consecutive year. The squarer cornered grille insert had blades that seemed to emphasize its vertical members and it appeared both above the bumper and through a horizontal slot cut into it. Rectangular parking lamps were built into the outer edges of the grille. Rear end styling revisions were highlighted by metal divided tail lamps and a painted lower bumper section. Coupe de Villes got a new roofline, inspired by the Florentine show car created for the 1964 [[New York City|New York]] World's Fair, that gave rear seat passengers added privacy. As on that show car, the quarter window glass retracted rearward into a sail panel. Minor trim variations and slightly richer interiors separated DeVille from [[Cadillac Calais|Calais]]. Tiffany style chrome signature scripts were again found above the body side molding on the rear fenders. New standard DeVille features included non-glare [[rear-view mirror]], electric clock, Automatic Climate Controls, padded dashboard, Hazard Warning system, outboard seatbelt retractors and rear cigarette lighters in all styles. A slide-out fuse box and safety front seat back lock for two-door models were additional Cadillac advances for the 1967 model year. Technical improvements included a revised engine valve train, different carburetor, Mylar printed circuit instrument panel, re-tuned body mounts, and a new engine fan with clutch for quieter operation.

In 1968 grilles had an insert with finer mesh and step down outer section which held the rectangular parking lights just a little higher than before. Rear end styling was modestly altered with the deck lid having more of a rake. The most obvious change was an 8.5-inch-longer hood designed to accommodate recessed windshield wiper-washers, which now came with three speeds standard. Of 20 exterior paint color combinations, 14 were totally new. On the inside enriched appointments included molded inner door panels with illuminated reflectors and a selection of 147 upholstery combinations, 76 in cloth, 67 in leather and four in vinyl. New standard features included a Light Group, a Mirror Group, a trip odometer and an ignition key warning buzzer. The DeVille also gained a new {{convert|472|CID|cc|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]] engine rated at 375&amp;nbsp;hp (SAE gross). 1968 was also the last year for the "stacked" dual headlights, which were replaced with side-by-side dual headlights in 1969. This was also the last year for vent windows.  Side marker lights in the rear bumper as well as
front fender were also added.  Side mirror changed from a round to rectangular shape.
Also of note front disc brakes were available starting in 1968.

In 1969 DeVille was restyled in the Eldorado image. An Eldorado-like front fender treatment evolved and helped to emphasize a stronger horizontal design line. Rear quarters were extended to give the car a longer look. There was an all new grille with dual horizontal headlamps positioned in the outboard step down areas of the grille. The hood was again extended, a total of 2.5 inches to add the impression of extra length. The roofline was squarer and the rear deck and bumper more sculptured. A new ventilation system eliminated the need for vent windows, which provided a longer sleeker look and improved visibility. New standard features included front and rear (except on convertibles) center seat armrests.

In 1970 a facelift included  a grille with 13 vertical blades set against a delicately cross-hatched rectangular opening. The bright metal headlamp surrounds were bordered with body color to give it a more refined look. Narrow vertical "vee" tail lights were seen again, but now had additional smaller V-shaped bottom lenses pointing downward below the bumper. Wheel discs and winged crest fender tip emblems were new. Exterior distinctions came from a DeVille script above the rear end of the belt molding and from the use of long rectangular back up light lenses set into the lower bumper as opposed to the smaller square lens used on the Calais. A new feature was a body color border around the edge of the vinyl top covering, when this option was ordered. 1970 was the last year that DeVille offered a convertible body style, 1970 was also the last model year for pillared sedans until hardtops were permanently dropped in 1977.  A total of 181,719 DeVilles were sold for that model year, accounting for 76% of all Cadillacs.

As with all GM full-size lines, the DeVille was completely redesigned for 1971. The new GM full-size bodies, at 64.3 inches front shoulder room (62.1 inches on Cadillac) and 63.4 inches rear shoulder room (64.0 inches on Cadillac) set a record for interior width that would not be matched by any car until the full-size GM rear-wheel-drive models of the early to mid-1990s. Pairs of individually housed squarish headlamps were set wider apart. The V-shaped grille had an eggcrate style insert and was protected by massive vertical guards framing a rectangular license plate indentation. A wide hood with full-length windsplints, a prominent center crease and hidden windshield wipers was seen. A Cadillac crest decorated the nose and new indicator lamps appeared atop each front fender. A horizontal beltline molding ran from behind the front wheel housing, almost to the rear stopping where an elliptical bulge in the body came to a point and where thin rectangular side markers were placed above and below the chrome strip. The rear wheel openings were again housed in fender skirts. Tail lamps were of the same type as before but were no longer divided by a chrome bar. Long horizontal back-up lamps were set in the bumper, on either side of a deeply recessed license plate housing. DeVilles were set apart visually by thin bright metal rocker panel steps and signature script on the front fenders bearing the series name. The bottoms of the rear fenders were decorated with a bright metal beauty panel that was wider than the rocker panel strips and blended into the molding running along the bottom of the fender skirt. The standard engine remained the [[Cadillac V8 engine#472|472]], still rated at 375 SAE gross horsepower and {{convert|525|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque.
Interiors were redesigned, featuring a new curved instrument panel and new seating configurations. A rear "lamp monitor", a fiber-optic system which monitored the taillamps, turn signals and brake lights, was new and positioned on the shelf behind the rear seat.

In November 1971, a showroom-stock 1971 Coupe de Ville placed third in the annual coast-to-coast Cannonball Run, posting the highest average speed of the event, {{convert|84.6|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} (excluding stops) and averaging {{convert|8.9|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}}.

In 1972, a modest frontal revision placed more emphasis on horizontal grille blades. The parking lamps were moved from the bumper to between the square bezeled headlamps, which were now set wider apart. V-shaped emblems made a return on hood and deck lid. New standard features included a bumper impact system, automatic parking brake release, passenger assist straps and flow through ventilation system. New DeVille signature script was affixed to the sides of the rear roof panels. Sales reached a record 194,811.

New energy absorbing bumpers were seen on all GM cars in 1973 and it brought styling refinements to DeVille. Grilles were widened and had an intricate eggcrate design. Larger vertical rectangles housed the parking lamps between wide spaced headlamps which had square bezels but round lenses. Bumpers ran fully across the front and wrapped around each end. Vertical guards were spaced much further apart at a point outboard of the grille. The rear end had a bumper with a flatter upper section housing an angled license plate recess. Border outline moldings vertically "veed" paralleled the fender edge shape at the rear bodysides. Single horizontally mounted rectangular rear side marker lamps were placed over and under the rear tip of the thin beltline trim. Cadillac script was seen on the front fender sides below the belt molding behind the wheel opening.Inside, "soft-pillow" door panels with larger, sturdier pull-straps were new. The rear "lamp monitor" was repositioned from the rear seat shelf to the headliner just above the rear window. An Illuminated vanity mirror was an available option. This was the final year for hardtop Coupe de Villes, an irony since it was their introduction of the hardtop that made them such a sensation in 1949. Sales set a new record at 216,243.

In 1974, a wide eggcrate grille was used. Dual round headlamps were mounted close together in square bezels. Further outboard were double deck wraparound parking lamps. Shorter vertical grille guards appeared in about the same position as before. Rear fendersides were flatter without the elliptical bulge. The thin beltline molding was positioned lower by several inches. The rear end had vertical bumper ends with integrated side marker lights. New taillamps were positioned horizontally beneath the trunk lid. Both bumpers, especially the rear, protruded further from the body. Unlike the other "C" body GM coupes, the Coupe de Ville was no a longer true hardtop, instead sporting large wide "coach" windows giving a thick center pillar look. They retained their frameless door glass, however.  The Sedan de Ville continued as a true hardtop however, and would remain so until the 1977 model.  A new curved instrument panel housed a new quartz controlled digital clock. New standard features included an integral litter container. A Space Saver spare tire was standard when DeVilles were ordered with optional white sidewall steel belted radial tires.

1974 also saw the introduction of the optional "[[Air Cushion Restraint System]]". Known today as airbags, this option provided protection for front seat occupants in the case of a frontal collision. One bag was located in the steering wheel, the other in the dashboard in front of the front seat passenger. The glove box was replaced with a lockable storage compartment under the dashboard. The option was expensive and therefore unpopular with customers and was discontinued after the 1976 model year. Cadillac would not offer airbags again until the 1990 model year.

A new option package was a fully padded '''Cabriolet''' roof treatment. It incorporated a [[Landau (automobile)|landau]]-style top with bright metal forward divider strip. Another new option package was the '''d'Elegance''' package. Similar to the Sixty Special Brougham's package of the same name, it featured [[velour]] upholstery, Deluxe padded doors, front seatback storage pockets, deep pile carpeting, floor mats, see-through standup hood ornament and vinyl tape accent stripes. The "d'Elegance" name remained with the DeVille series as a package through 1984. For 1997, it became a separate model designation for the sedan.

Styling changes for 1975 brought dual rectangular headlamp lenses flanked by rectangular cornering lights wrapped around squared-off front fenders. A new cross hatched grille also appeared, with Cadillac script on the header. Sedan's now featured thin opera windows set within the D-pillars. New standard equipment included front fender lamp monitors, power door locks, high energy ignition, steel-belted radial whitewall tires. The 210&amp;nbsp;hp 500 V8 replaced the 472 as the standard engine. Electronic fuel injection became optional in March 1975. Another option was the Astroroof with sliding sunshade that permitted use as an electrically operated sunroof or a transparent closed skylight. An ordinary sunroof panel was also available. New hinged door pull handles replaced the old door pull straps for 1975 and 1976.

In 1976, the grille saw a new and finer crosshatching pattern. Cornering lamps received new horizontal silver trim; taillamp
Bezels also gained new chrome-like trim. Eight different color accent stripes were available. Vinyl tops were now integral padded Elk grain material. New trims included sporty plaids, plush velours, knits and 11 distinctive genuine leathers. Coupe de Villes had a new vinyl roof whose top molding served as a continuation of the door "belt" molding. A Controlled (limited-slip) Differential was included for extra traction. An optional illuminated entry and theft deterrence system was optional. The new [[ACDelco|Delco Freedom]] battery, never needed water added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1976_Cadillac/1976%20Cadillac%20Full%20Line%20Brochure/image3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509191541/http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1976_Cadillac/1976%20Cadillac%20Full%20Line%20Brochure/image3.html |archivedate=2018-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; New turbine-vaned and wire wheel covers were offered. A new option locked the doors when the transmission lever was shifted to "Drive". Cadillac also offered Track Master, a computerized skid prevention system that automatically pumped the back brakes in an emergency to shorten stopping distance. New options included a push-button Weather Band built into the AM/FM stereo signal-seeking radio, loose pillow style seats for d'Elegance packages, plus power passenger and manual driver seatback recliners for 50/50 front seats. Of the 15 standard and six optional Firemist body colors, 13 were new this year. New standard features included Soft-Ray [[tinted glass]], spare tire cover, trunk mat, washer fluid level indicator, and steel belted radial whitewall tires.

From 1975 to 1976 small numbers of Coupe de Villes were converted into car-based pick-ups, similar to a [[Chevrolet El Camino]], but much more upscale. Coachbuilding company Traditional Coach Works manufactured 204 of these, called the '''Cadillac Mirage''', to Cadillac's standards, such that one could be ordered through a participating Cadillac dealer.&lt;ref name=Mirage1&gt;[http://www.facereplace.com/mirage/History%20of%20the%20Cadillac%20Mirage.htm History of the Cadillac Mirage – facereplace.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The floor bed could carry flat plywood 4 x 8 sheets with the tailgate closed, while the two-seat front cabin offered driver and passenger a plush ride. A storage area behind the seats was used for golf-clubs or small articles of value, out of view. A metal cover with a lock on it was available for the rear bed, just as a trunk would also have.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_kJlN_Sm0o Cadillac Mirage video review – The Drive]&lt;/ref&gt;

1977 was Cadillac's 75th anniversary, and saw the introduction of the downsized DeVille coupes and sedans. These new cars featured a higher roofline, resulting in a vehicle that was over nine inches shorter, four inches narrower, and 1/2 ton lighter than the previous year, but with a larger trunk and more headroom and legroom. These were also the first DeVilles ever to be marketed without [[fender skirts]] over the rear wheels. The old door pull straps returned for 1977 and on. The 500 in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; V8 (which produced 190 horsepower) was replaced for 1977 by a 180-horsepower 425 in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; V8 variant of similar design. The reduction in size and weight was implemented to improve fuel economy and emissions as a result of the United States Federal Government passage of [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] regulations.

For 1977, the lineup included the two-door Coupe de Ville ($9,654) and four-door Sedan de Ville ($9,864). The $650 d'Elegance package, an interior dress-up option carried over from the previous generation of DeVilles, continued for both models. 3-sided, wrap-around tail lamps were a 1977 feature only (although they would re-appear in 1987). Coupe de Ville's popular "Cabriolet" option, priced at $348, included a rear-half padded vinyl roof covering and opera lamps. An optional electronic fuel-injected version of the standard 7.0-liter powerplant, adding {{convert|15|hp}}, was available for an additional $647. Sales figures were 138,750 Coupe de Villes and 95,421 Sedan de Villes for an all-time sales record of 234,171 DeVilles sold.

In addition to a redesigned grille and hood ornament, 1978 saw slim, vertical tail lamps inset into chrome bumper end caps with built-in side marker lamps (Cadillac would retain this "vertical tail lamp inset" design feature on DeVille through 1984, and again from 1989 through 1999). New for 1978, a "Phaeton" package was optional for DeVille. Available on both coupe and sedan, the $1,929 Phaeton package featured a simulated convertible-top, special pin striping, wire wheel discs, and "Phaeton" name plates in place of the usual "Coupe de Ville" or "Sedan de Ville" ornament on the rear fenders. Inside were leather upholstered seats and a leather-trimmed steering wheel matching the exterior color. The package was available in "Cotillion White" (with Dark Blue roof), "Platinum Silver" (with a Black roof), or "Arizona Beige" (with a Dark Brown roof). Coupe de Ville's popular Cabriolet roof package was priced at $369, while the d'Elegance package (for coupe or sedan) was available at $689. Electronic [[fuel injection]], which added {{convert|15|hp}}, was available at $744. Electronic level control - which used suspension-mounted sensors and air filled rear shocks - kept the car's height level regardless of passengers and cargo weight, was available for $140. Sales dropped slightly from 1977 to 117,750 for the $10,444 Coupe de Ville, and 88,951 for Sedan de Ville, priced at $10,668.

With bigger changes coming in 1980, the 1979 models saw few alterations,  which included a new lightweight aluminum hood and a new grille design with "Cadillac" script on the header above the grille. The "Phaeton" package, now priced at $2,029, was still available in three colors, but with two new replacement colors: "Western Saddle Firemist" (with leather interior in "Antique Saddle") replacing the "Arizona Beige", and "Slate Firemist" (with leather interior in "Antique Gray") replacing "Platinum Silver". The d'Elegance package was back, at $725, which included Venetian velour upholstery (in four colors) with a 50/50 split front seat, overhead assist handles, Tangier carpeting, door pull handles, and "d'Elegance" emblems among other niceties. In addition to the $783 "fuel-injection" option, there was also the choice of a 350 in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; LF9 diesel V8 (built by [[Oldsmobile]]) for $849. Coupe de Ville's cabriolet package, priced at $384, was available in 17 colors. Production rose slightly to 121,890 for Coupe de Ville ($11,728), and 93,211 for Sedan de Ville ($12,093).

1980 saw a significant refresh, with a lower, more aerodynamic nose, higher tail end, and a heavier, more substantial appearance. The Phaeton option was discontinued, but the $1,005 d'Elegance package remained. The Coupe de Ville now wore full, bright side window surround moldings, whereas the sedan had body-color door frames with a thin chrome bead around the window opening (as used in 1977 - 1979). The chromed-plastic grille held a very diplomatic, [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls-Royce]] inspired design, with thick vertical bars, featuring the 'Cadillac' script on the driver's side grille header. The grille cast for 1980 was used again for the 1989 to 1992 [[Cadillac Brougham]]. Late in the 1980 model year, V6 power (in the form of a 4-bbl 252 CID engine manufactured by [[Buick]]) was offered as a credit option. Cadillac had not offered an engine with fewer than 8 cylinders since 1914. The standard engine for 1980 was a new 368 CID (6.0 L) V8. Unlike the pre-1980 models, the rear window glass for both two- and four-door models was now the same, as the two-door models did away with the sporty slanted rear window and adopted the formal vertical look shared with the sedans. Pricing for DeVille was $12,899 for the coupe; $13,282 for the sedan. Sales dropped miserably for the 1980 model year, despite new sheetmetal and a multitude of improvements. Coupe de Ville was down to 55,490 (less than half of the 1979 figures), Sedan de Ville was also down by nearly half at 49,188. Oldsmobile's 5.7-liter diesel V8 was still available at $924, as was the popular Cabriolet option for Coupe de Ville at $350.

1981's biggest news was the introduction of Cadillac's modulated-displacement 368 in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; V8-6-4 engine.  Developed by the [[Eaton Corporation]] - with design elements that had been tested for over {{convert|500000|mi|km}} - allowed various engine computers to decide how many cylinders were needed to power the car for optimal fuel economy. The theory was 8 cylinders from a complete stop, 6 cylinders during usual driving, and just four cylinders at cruising speed. The changes in cylinder operation were seamless, and most drivers did not detect any difference in operation. However, in some cases, reliability and component failure led to customer complaints. Cadillac defended its micro-processor controlled powerplant, and even offered special extended warranties to customers. Also available was [[Oldsmobile]]'s 5.7-liter V-8 diesel engine. The {{convert|125|hp}} [[Buick]] V6, teamed with an automatic transmission, returned for 1981 after a short initial offering in the spring of 1980. Coupe de Ville was priced at $13,450, while Sedan de Ville, priced at $13,847, now had the unique option of an available automatic seat belt system - the first offered on a GM vehicle. With the automatic shoulder/lap belt system (only for the outboard front seat passengers), the shoulder point was moved from the upper B-pillar to the upper door glass frame, and the belt reel was moved from the floor onto the door itself, installed in the lower corner. With this, you could theoretically leave the seat belt latched at all times, and simply get in and out of the vehicle without having to unfasten the belt. The $150 option (which would re-appear as standard equipment on the 1990 - 1992 Brougham), was available only on V6-powered Sedan de Villes. The [[V6]] option itself was a $165 credit over the standard V8 in DeVille. A new grille design was made up of small squares, similar to the pattern from 1979, while the same chromed grille surround from 1980 continued. The egg-crate 1981 grille cast was used again for the 1987 and 1988 [[Cadillac Brougham]] models. A new Electronic Climate Control panel did away with the slide lever and thumb wheel in favor of a digital display which allowed the driver to set the interior temperature to a single degree - from 65 to 85 (or "max" settings at 60 and 90 degrees). Option groups included the $1,005 d'Elegance package (available on both models), and the Cabriolet package (for Coupe de Ville) at $363. Sales were up slightly from 1980: 89,991 sedans versus 62,724 coupes (figures include DeVille and Fleetwood models).

Changes for 1982 were kept to a minimum, including a new thin vertical bar grille design (which was used through 1986) with the same grille surround from the past two years, and a new standard wheel cover design. Cadillac introduced a new aluminum-block 249-cubic-inch 4.1-liter HT series V8 engine to replace the V8-6-4. The new power plant featured a closed-loop digital fuel injection system, free-standing cast-iron cylinders within a cast-aluminum block, and was coupled with a 4-speed automatic-overdrive transmission. Other engine options included the Buick V6 or Oldsmobile's diesel V8. Inside, the Electronic Climate Control had an updated fascia that now included an "Outside Temperature" button. Previously, the outside temperature was available through an illuminated thermometer mounted to the driver's outside mirror. With the new front-drive Cadillac Cimarron taking over as Cadillac's entry-level model, the $15,249 Coupe de Ville was now a step-up. Sedan de Ville was priced at $15,699. Sales totals for 1982 included 50,130 coupes and 86,020 sedans (figures include DeVille and Fleetwood models).

For 1983, slight reworkings under the hood added 10 horsepower (now rated at 135) to the standard 4.1-liter powerplant. Meanwhile, the Buick V6 credit-option was dropped. The biggest visible change was hardly noticeable - while the grille design was a carry-over from the previous year (and would be through 1986), the Cadillac script moved from the chrome header onto the grille itself. The wide parking lamps below the quad headlamps now had clear frosted lenses (previous years they were amber), with satin gold-colored winged Cadillac emblems centered on each lens. A very minor change in the rear was the deletion of the chrome tips on both sides of the lower deck lid trim. These little chrome corner pieces, mounted on the filler panels, were prone to pitting as they were made of a different material than the bright aluminum trunk trim and upper license late surround. Coupe de Ville's popular Cabriolet roof package added $415 to its $15,970 sticker price. While both models, including the $16,441 Sedan de Ville, could be ordered with the $1,150 d'Elegance package. 1983 was supposed to be the last year for the rear-drive DeVille, as new front-drive models would take over for 1984. However, numerous developmental delays caused DeVille to stay in rear-drive form for another year. Sales figures looked healthy, with a total of 109,004 sedans and 65,670 coupes (figures include DeVille and Fleetwood models).

Because of a delay in production of the new front-drive DeVilles (which were now going to be 1985 models), 1984 was a rerun for the rear-wheel-drive Coupe de Ville ($17,140) and its four-door companion, the popular Sedan de Ville ($17,625). It would also be the last time DeVille used the "V" emblem below the Cadillac crest, as 1985 models and on would use the crest and wreath emblem - formerly a Fleetwood exclusive. Minor changes included new body-color side moldings and a revised exhaust system with a revamped catalytic converter. The diesel V8 was now available at no additional charge. While the optional d'Elegance package remained at $1,150, the Cabriolet option for Coupe de Ville went up to $420. For 1984, sales figures show a total four-door production of 107,920 units, and an additional 50,840 two-door units (figures include de Ville and Fleetwood models). The new front-drive 1985 Coupe de Ville and Sedan de Ville arrived in Cadillac showrooms during the Spring of 1984, about six months earlier than most new-car introductions, so both the 1984 rear-drive and 1985 front-drive models were selling and being produced (due to separate assembly plants) at the same time for nearly half a year.

For the 1985 model year, the DeVille switched to GM's new FWD [[GM C platform (FWD)|C-body]] platform. A Fleetwood sedan variant was added to the mix at the start of production and shared the new [[front-wheel-drive]] platform and most dimensions with the DeVilles (the "Fleetwood Brougham" nomenclature remained on the rear-wheel-drive chassis through model year 1986 at which time the "Fleetwood" portion of the name was dropped and it became simply "Brougham" from 1987 through 1992).

Production of the new C-body commenced December 1983 at the [[Orion Assembly]] Plant in [[Orion Township, Michigan]]. A Fleetwood coupe version of the new FWD C-body joined the lineup later in the production run. The front cover of the brochure advertised the new cars as the "Cadillac of Tomorrow".  These new models were significantly smaller externally yet kept almost identical interior dimensions as their predecessors.  This change also brought nearly the entire Cadillac line of cars to front-wheel drive, leaving only the Fleetwood Brougham as the only rear-wheel-drive car offered by the division. Cadillac's [[Cadillac High Technology engine#HT-4100|HT-4100]] [[V8 engine|V8]] remained the standard engine, mounted transversely and coupled with a [[Turbo-Hydramatic 125#Turbo-Hydramatic 440-T4|440-T4]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]. Oldsmobile's 4.3L V6 diesel was optional. Of GM's front-drive C and H bodies, Cadillac was the only line to offer a V8 engine. The other GM vehicles were equipped with a Buick-derived 3.0 or 3.8 V6 engine, or - for 1985 only - Oldsmobile's 4.3L V6 diesel powerplant.

The 1985 DeVille was still available in [[sedan (car)|sedan]] or [[coupe]] form.  The d'Elegance package - an optional interior dress-up package featuring assist handles and button-tufted seating among other niceties - was no longer available on DeVille, but now offered solely on the Fleetwood sedan.  Thanks to an extended model year (starting April 1984), sales of the new downsized 1985 DeVille and Fleetwood models reached nearly 200,000 units.

For 1986, few changes marked the new DeVille's second year in production. An anti-lock braking system, developed by Teves, became available. A 2-position automatic rear-view mirror utilized two electronic 'eyes' and a small motor to dim when headlights appeared from behind. A factory-installed cellular telephone joined the option list at an astonishing $2,850. The standard space-saver spare tire now sat horizontally in the trunk, doing away with the small covered storage cubby in the spare tire well from last year. The optional aluminum wheels had new flush-fitting center caps (last year's design featured exposed capped lugs), and bumper rub strips changed from black to gray. Borrowed from the front-wheel-drive Fleetwood line, the narrow lower body side molding from the 1985 DeVille was replaced with a considerably wider one, and the trim surround from the rear window gave the formal appearance of a smaller window opening. Inside, a more tailored look was applied to the seat trim. Coupe de Ville's popular cabriolet option, featuring a padded vinyl covering over the rear half of the roof, was priced at $698. Along with the exterior changes made to 1986 DeVilles, adding the Cabriolet option made it difficult to distinguish a 1986 Coupe de Ville from the 1986 Fleetwood Coupe. Pricing for the Coupe de Ville was $19,669, with Sedan de Ville at $19,990. The transverse-mounted Cadillac 4.1-liter V-8 continued from the previous year, but with 5 more horsepower.

The 1986 Cadillac had:
Type: 90-degree, overhead valve V-8. Aluminum block and cast iron heads.
Displacement: 249 cu in (4.1 liters) 
Bore &amp; stroke: 3.47 x 3.31 in 
Compression ratio: 8.5:1 
Brake horsepower: {{convert|135|hp|abbr=on}} at 4200 rpm 
Torque: 200&amp;nbsp;lbf·ft (270 N·m) at 2200 rpm 
Five main bearings 
Hydraulic valve lifters 
TBI 
VIN Code: 8

Introduced in 1986, Cadillac's Touring Sedan and Touring Coupe were based on the standard DeVille but included extras such as a subtle rear deck lid spoiler, body-color tail lamp bezels, front air dam with fog lamps, rear seat headrests, leather upholstery, and a performance enhancement package among other features. The package was available for $2,880. In addition, the Touring Coupe had removable decorative louvers on the rear edge of the side opera windows.

1987 saw a new front-end design including revised cornering lamps in front and one-piece composite headlamps flanked a trapezoid-shaped grille with a bold egg-crate texture. Elongated fender caps were in back - upping the overall length by an inch and a half, but much more dramatic in appearance with new wrap-around tail lamps. This new 3-sided tail lamp style was inspired by a design used on the 1977 DeVille. Unlike the new one-piece headlamps, the changes to the rear-end in 1987 had little to do with engineering, but rather, feedback from Cadillac's customer base who felt the 1985-86 car looked too short. Although the 1987 revamp was still quite similar to the 1986 model (so much in fact that it still used the previous year's deck lid), the design was more in-tune with the look that traditional Cadillac buyers were used to.

Pricing for 1987 included Coupe de Ville at $21,316, and Sedan de Ville at $21,659.  Fleetwood d'Elegance at $26,104, and the new Fleetwood Sixty-Special was available for $34,850. The Touring option, priced at $2,880 over DeVille's base cost, also included aluminum wheels mounted on 15-inch Goodyear Eagle GT tires. At the end of the 1988 model year, Cadillac discontinued the slow-selling DeVille-based Touring Coupe and Sedan, although the 4-door would return in 1992.

For 1988, Cadillac kept cosmetic changes to a minimum in anticipation of the redesigned DeVille and Fleetwood models to come the following year.  To mitigate the nearly $2,000 price jump this year, several previously optional items were made standard equipment including tilt steering column, telescopic steering wheel, power trunk release, split-bench front seating, cruise control, and variable delay windshield wipers. Under the hood was a new 155&amp;nbsp;hp 4.5 L V8 and heavy-duty battery. Pricing rose to $23,049 for Coupe de Ville, and $23,404 for Sedan de Ville.

Cadillac's main competition in this time frame continued to be Lincoln, which, alongside their successful Town Car, was now fielding an all-new front-wheel-drive Continental (based on the [[Ford Taurus]]). The [[Lincoln Continental#Eighth generation (1988–94)|Continental]] went into production with a six-cylinder engine so as to be considered a larger front-wheel-drive alternative to the [[Acura Legend#First generation (1986–1990)|Acura Legend]] that appeared in 1986, with a front-wheel-drive platform and a V6 engine.

1989 introduced an extensive exterior redesign which included a longer 113.8-inch wheelbase for sedans. The {{Convert|155|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 4.5-liter powerplant (introduced just a year earlier), dashboard, and the front doors (on both the coupe and sedan) were about the only items that carried over — even the luggage compartment was over {{convert|2|cuft|m3}} larger than last year. The Coupe de Ville and Fleetwood coupe retained the previous year's interior, wheelbase, and doors—all cleverly hidden between the new front and rear styling. A give-away to the previous design is the rear shelf package on the 2-door models. While the parcel shelf on the four-door models received a 'Mercedes-Benz inspired' storage compartment with lid, rear seat headrest panel, and a long 3-bulb horizontal brake lamp, the 2-door models still had the narrow carpeted parcel shelf and pedestal brake lamp from the previous year. Of special note were the composite (plastic) front fenders that resisted parking-lot dings and dents, and weighed less than their steel counterparts. Previously optional equipment that was made standard for 1989 included electrically powered outside mirrors and the AM/FM/cassette player stereo. New options introduced this year included a driver's side airbag, the [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] compact disc player, an electrically heated windshield, and a set of four reversible carpeted floor mats.

For 1990, DeVille and Fleetwood lost their telescopic steering column, but retained the tilt feature in exchange for an airbag mounted onto the newly standard leather-trimmed steering wheel. Engine output was up an additional {{convert|25|hp}} from sequential multi-port fuel injection. 1990 models also received GM's PASS Key theft-deterrent system which used a coded electronic pellet embedded into the ignition key. Other new features for 1990 included a non-illuminated vanity mirror on the driver's visor (a passenger side visor mirror had been standard equipment for decades now), door edge guards (previously optional), "clam shell" front center armrest with storage, and manual seat-back recliners for driver and passenger. While Lincoln's Continental did not fare well against DeVille, a new sales threat—aimed directly at Cadillac—came from the 1990 debut of [[Toyota]]'s [[Lexus LS400]] and the [[Infiniti Q45]] from Nissan.  Additionally, the [[Acura Legend]]—[[Honda]]'s high-end label—had been gaining momentum in the luxury market since its 1986 introduction.

In 1991, a {{Convert|200|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} 4.9-liter V8—the largest of this type—became the new standard powerplant.  Also new was a grille of an inverted trapezoid design (almost upside-down from last year's egg-crate keystone design), and revised bumper and body-side moldings.  The new grille held the familiar shape of the Cadillac crest itself—a styling cue that continues to this day. The grille was now attached to the forward edge of the hood, and lifted up along with the hood when raised (similar to [[Mercedes-Benz]]). The secondary hood release latch was at the bottom of the grille instead of its previous location above the passenger side headlight. In addition to the new engine and minor front-end restyling, several previously optional features became standard this year, including the anti-lock braking system, accent striping, automatic door locks, Twilight Sentinel headlamp control, electrochromic inside rear-view mirror, and electric rear window and side mirror defogger. New standard features included rear-seat air conditioning vents, central door unlocking from the driver's door and luggage compartment, sun visors with shaded slide-out extensions, rear window lock-out switch, brake / transmission interlock safety switch, and an oil life indicator through the fuel data center. Other new features included the available remote keyless entry system, and the optional illuminated mirrors now featured a slide switch that offered variable intensity lighting. The first "Deville Touring Sedan" became available to the public on April 1, 1991. As a limited edition of only 1,500 produced for the 1991 model year,&lt;ref&gt;''Orlando Sentinel'' - "Expert Reviews - 1991 Cadillac DeVille TS" by Richard Truett dated August 8, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; it was offered in 5 monochromatic paint schemes: Carmine Red; Cotillion White; Black; Dark Slate Gray metallic; and Black Sapphire Metallic. Larger 16" x 6.5" forged aluminum wheels with a wreath and crest center cap were fitted to P215/60R16 Goodyear GA all-season radial tires. A quicker 17:1 steering gear was also used. The specific Beechwood-color interior of the DeVille Touring Sedan had leather seating areas and revised seat design with integral lumbar support. Both driver and passenger seat featured six-way power seat adjusters and power recliners. This specific interior also featured American Walnut wood accents on the doors and instrument panel. A grill-mounted wreath and crest replaced the traditional stand-up hood ornament. Side door moldings feature "TOURING SEDAN" lettering and import style break-away outside rearview mirrors were painted body color. Revised sport door handles also are painted body color. The revised exterior also included a cloisonne deck lid lock cover similar to the STS and Eldorado Touring Coupe.&lt;ref&gt;Detroit Auto Show Press Release from Cadillac Motor Car Division dated January 7, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1992, the Touring Sedan continued as a limited edition option. Besides the special features included in the initial 1,500 models from 1991, it featured on Touring Sedans, like other DeVille models, the "Symphony Sound" stereo with cassette was standard, while the optional [[Delco Electronics|Delco]]/[[Bose Corporation|Bose]] music system was available with cassette or single-slot CD player. Introduced for 1992, speed-sensitive suspension and traction control (both standard on Touring Sedan when introduced in '91) were available at extra cost on DeVille. Approximately 5,300 Touring Sedans were produced for 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Standard Catalog of American Cars 1976-1999 - 3rd ed. by Flammang &amp; Kowalke. Krause publications 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

1993 saw few changes, as a brand-new replacement was coming for 1994. The previously optional speed-sensitive suspension, "Computer Command Ride", introduced last year became standard equipment, and now included a new speed-sensitive steering system as well. Minor trim changes were made including black-out trim in the grille (used on the 1992 Touring Sedan), and removing the chrome strip from the glass divider on the sedan's rear doors. 1993 would be the last year for the Coupe de Ville, which now came standard with the previously optional "[[Cabriolet (carriage)|Cabriolet]]" roof option (which covered the rear half of the roof in padded vinyl). Introduced as a prestige trim level of the Series 62 for the 1949 model year, Coupe de Ville's full-size 2-door body style had been declining in sales for several years, and as a result, the 1994 design went into production solely as a 4-door. Production ceased in July 1993.

=== The final Coupe de Villes (1990–1993) ===
[[File:Cadillac-Coupe-De-Ville-1991.jpg|thumb|left|1991 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]
Cadillac built 17,507 Coupe de Villes and 2,429 Fleetwood coupes in 1990. The optional ''Cabriolet'' roof (standard on Fleetwood) appeared on 3,988 Coupe de Villes, while the available ''Phaeton'' roof was found on an additional 4,453 cars.  The ''Phaeton'' roof, re-creating the look of a convertible top, was included in the ''Spring Edition'' package (with 4,413 built), which also included perforated leather seat inserts among other items. The most popular color for 1990 was ''Cotillion White'', with 5,292 manufactured, while the least chosen color was ''Medium Dark Gray'', which found its way onto 193 cars that year. While all these two-door models wore the standard white-wall Michelin tires, this would be the last year for plain wheel covers on Coupe de Ville (found on 2,788 cars this year), as next year would feature a standard styled aluminum wheel (similar to the Fleetwood coupe). 479 two-door models were produced for export that year: 383 to Canada, 81 to Japan, and another 15 to Saudi Arabia. The 1990 Coupe de Ville was priced at $26,960, and the Fleetwood coupe at $32,400.&lt;ref name="Flammang, James 1999"&gt;Flammang, James ''Standard Catalog of American Cars 1976–1999 3rd Edition'' (Iola, WI: Krause Publications, Inc 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 Cadillac manufactured 10,057 Coupe de Ville models, and an additional 597 Fleetwood coupes (of the 597 Fleetwood coupes, only 248 were equipped with the optional ''Custom Seating Package'' that included power back rest recliners for the front seats, and a 2-position ''Memory Seat'' function for the driver's seat). All of these cars were produced at GM's [[Orion Assembly]] plant in [[Orion, Michigan|Michigan]]. The total for both models with optional leather upholstery was 9,799 (with ''Dark Auburn'' being the least chosen interior color—only 11 in leather and 2 in velour were ever made). The most popular exterior color for 1991 was ''Cotillion White'', with 2,967 models; while the least chosen color was ''Medium Dark Gray'', of which only 58 were manufactured. Of the 10,057 Coupe de Villes, 3,397 were ''Spring Edition'' models. The optional ''Cabriolet Roof'' with opera lamps (standard equipment on the Fleetwood coupe), which covered the rear-half of the roof in padded vinyl, was equipped on 1,729 Coupe de Villes, while an additional 3,952 carried the $1,095 ''Phaeton'' simulated convertible roof. The standard cassette stereo was found in nearly all models, while 1,122 opted for the [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] sound system at extra cost (752 with cassette, 370 with compact disc). Cadillac produced 164 of the 2-door models for export, including 126 to Canada, 23 to Japan, 5 to the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf countries]], 3 to [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], and the remaining seven to Europe. Pricing was $30,205 for Coupe de Ville, and $34,675 for Fleetwood coupe.&lt;ref name="Flammang, James 1999"/&gt;

For 1992, Cadillac manufactured 6,980 Coupe de Ville models, and an additional 291 Fleetwood coupes (of the 291 Fleetwood coupes, only 128 were equipped with the optional ''Custom Seating Package'', a $425 option that included power back rest recliners for the front seats, and a two-position ''Memory Seat'' function for the driver's seat). All of these cars were produced at GM's [[Orion Assembly]] plant in [[Orion, Michigan|Michigan]]. The most popular color for 1992 was ''Cotillion White'', with 1,879 models; while the least chosen color was ''Mary Kay Pink'', of which only one was manufactured. Of the 6,980 Coupe de Villes, 2,635 were ''Spring Edition'' models. The ''Cabriolet Roof'' with opera lamps (a $925 option, and standard equipment on the Fleetwood coupe) which covered the rear-half of the roof in padded vinyl, was equipped on 3,572 Coupe de Villes, while an additional 3,319 carried the $1,095 ''Phaeton'' convertible-look roof. Only 89 standard painted-roof Coupe de Villes were made for 1992. Cadillac produced 144 of the two-door models for export, including 129 to Canada, and 15 to Japan. Pricing was $31,740 for Coupe de Ville, and $36,360 for Fleetwood coupe.&lt;ref name="Flammang, James 1999"/&gt;

With the discontinuation of the Fleetwood coupe at the end of the 1992 model year, the 1993 Coupe de Ville was Cadillac's last six-passenger two-door car. The previously optional speed-sensitive suspension, "Computer Command Ride", introduced last year became standard equipment, and now included a new speed-sensitive steering system as well. Minor trim changes included black-out trim in the grille (as seen on the 1992 Touring Sedan). GM built 4,711 Coupe de Villes this year. The previously optional ''Cabriolet'' roof became standard equipment this year, and appeared on 3,606 cars. The ''Phaeton'' roof, which re-created the dashing look of a convertible top (now just a $170 option since the ''Cabriolet'' roof was standard equipment), was found on 1,105 cars. There were no painted-roof Coupe de Villes this year. Again, the most popular color for 1993 was ''Cotillion White'', with 1,147 manufactured, while the least chosen color was ''Dark Plum'', which found its way onto 24 cars this year. The four wheel choices this year included the standard-design cast aluminum wheel on 2,012 cars, optional $235 lace-design squeeze-case aluminum wheel on 1,766 cars, optional $235 locking wire wheel disc on 749 cars, and the $1,195 chromed squeeze-case aluminum wheel on 184 cars. Only 18 Coupe de Villes were ordered with the no-charge option of blackwall [[Michelin]] radial tires, the other 4,693 models wore the standard-equipment white-wall version. 3,036 had mono-tone paint, while the others held a lower body accent color, with the breakdown as follows: ''Silver'', 1,130; ''Dark Red'', 275; ''Gunmetal Gray'', 177; and ''Beige'', 93. In total, 4,168 had the standard Symphony Sound system, while 543 were ordered with the optional [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] stereo (310 with cassette, 233 with compact disc). Nearly all Coupe de Villes had leather upholstery (the most popular color was ''Neutral'', with 1,236 made), as only 239 velour interior models were manufactured this year (the least chosen cloth color was ''Taupe'', with only 24 manufactured). No Coupe de Villes were produced for export this year, and only 523 of the 4,711 built included California emission equipment. The base price of the 1993 Coupe de Ville was $33,915.&lt;ref name="Flammang, James 1999"/&gt;

The declining popularity of full-size coupés led to the discontinuation of the Coupe de Ville at the end of the 1993 model year. For 1994, the series comprised the following four-door models: DeVille and DeVille Concours.

[[File:97-99 Cadillac DeVille.jpg|thumb|left|1997–1999 Cadillac DeVille]]

For 1994, the DeVille was redesigned to share the [[GM K platform (FWD)|K-body]] platform with the [[Cadillac Seville|Seville]]. The body was redesigned, although the wheelbase remained 113.8 inches—rather than the 111 inches used on the Seville.  Production moved to [[Hamtramck, Michigan]].

Also for 1994, all DeVille models included a standard SRS driver-side front airbag, as well as fully digital instrumentation with integrated message center, which provided important vehicle information and status, current speed, outside temperature, and more, with controls mounted to the left of the instrument cluster. Also standard was a dual-zone front HVAC system, with controls located to the right of the instrument cluster, and remote controls on the front passenger door panel. A six-speaker audio system with A/M-F/M-Cassette stereo was standard, with an A/M-F/M-Cassette-CD stereo being optional equipment, as well as an eleven-speaker premium audio system. Premium cloth seating was standard, while luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces were available on all trim levels and standard on higher trim levels, both with full power adjustments. Front and rear bench seating for six passengers was standard equipment on most trim levels, while front bucket seats were optional. [[General Motors]]'s automatic lighting system, known as "Twilight Sentinel", was also standard equipment on all models. Controls for audio system, HVAC system, and cruise control were all mounted on the leather-wrapped, tilt-adjustable steering wheel. A SRS passenger's-side front airbag became standard equipment after a restyling in 1996, which also brought revised exterior styling and new audio systems with TheftLock coded anti-theft technology.

{{anchor|Concours}}The ''DeVille Concours'' was available with the new 270&amp;nbsp;hp (201&amp;nbsp;kW) [[GM Premium V engine#LD8|''LD8'' Northstar]] [[V8 engine|V8]], while lesser models retained the ''[[Cadillac High Technology engine#L26 4.9|4.9L L26 V8]]'' until 1996. That year, the base model took on the lower-output Northstar while the Concours moved up to the high-output [[GM Premium V engine#L37|''L37'' Northstar]], with {{Convert|300|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}}.   The DeVille Concours replaced the previous generation's DeVille Touring Sedan.  The Concours introduced [[continuously variable road sensing suspension]] ([[CVRSS]]).

The DeVille received a facelift for the 1997 model year, and added the ''d'Elegance'' trim line to replace the [[Cadillac Fleetwood]].  The name was shortened from Sedan DeVille to simply DeVille. New headlights and a new grille were added, the rear wheel skirts were removed, the interior was redesigned, and the black/chrome trim was replaced by a double chrome trim in the base DeVille, chrome and gold trim and gold hood ornament on the d'Elegance, and chrome and body colored trim for the Concours. The Concours received real-time damping and [[Integrated Chassis Control System]] ICCS as standard. The interior gained a new dashboard design that hid the passenger airbag seams and new door panels with front side-airbags and the availability of [[OnStar]] system. Production of this generation ended in July 1999.

The 2000 model year saw the first major redesign since 1994; this generation marked the move from the [[GM K platform (FWD)|K platform]] to the [[GM G platform (FWD)|G platform]]; despite this move [[General Motors|GM]] continued to refer to it as the K platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frame|first=Phil|title=GM H Cars move to G Platform|url=http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950116/ANA/501160730#axzz2TYYYR1jT|work=[[Automotive News]]|accessdate=17 May 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Fapps%2Fpbcs.dll%2Farticle%3FAID%3D%2F19950116%2FANA%2F501160730%23axzz2TYYYR1jT&amp;date=2013-05-17|archivedate=17 May 2013|date=16 January 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production started in August 1999. The exterior was completely redesigned featuring a sportier, elegant and more aerodynamic design with a drag coefficient of 0.30.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The revamped interior featured completely new door panels and seats, while the dashboard and radio face only received minor facelifts.

Cadillac '''Night Vision''' on the DeVille was the first worldwide series production [[automotive night vision]] ever offered,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ask.cars.com/2008/09/what-are-led-ta.html |title=What are LED taillights? |publisher=Ask.cars.com |date=2008-09-16 |accessdate=2009-05-07 |url-status=live |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130327072052/http://ask.cars.com/2008/09/what-are-led-ta.html |archivedate=2013-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; however it was discontinued in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Keegan |first=Walter J |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2004/11/17/cadillac-kills-passive-night-vision-system/ |title=Cadillac kills passive night-vision system — Autoblog |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=2004-11-17 |accessdate=2009-12-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711163954/http://www.autoblog.com/2004/11/17/cadillac-kills-passive-night-vision-system |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This system was developed with [[Raytheon]] and worked by using a ''passive infrared'' sensor camera mounted behind the vehicle's grille.

The 2000 DeVille was one of the first American production cars to offer [[light-emitting diode|LED]] tail lamps in automobiles, a feature now becoming increasingly commonplace on luxury and family cars.

The d'Elegance designation was replaced with the DeVille DHS (DeVille High Luxury Sedan), which added several cabin comfort options to include power rear window sunshade and heated/massaging rear seats. The performance DeVille Concours was renamed the DeVille DTS (DeVille Touring Sedan), and was available with stability control, [[continuously variable road sensing suspension]] ([[CVRSS]]) with [[magnetorheological damper]]s, also called [[MagneRide]], and onboard navigation.

The last 2005 DeVille rolled off the [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly]] line on June 23, 2005.  It was replaced by the restyled and renamed [[Cadillac DTS|DTS]] for 2006.

In 2006, the DeVille nameplate was replaced by [[Cadillac DTS]], an [[acronym|abbreviation]] dating back to 1985's DeVille Touring Sedan package. The new name brought the DeVille into line with Cadillac's Art &amp; Science-era nomenclature, which saw the Seville renamed to [[Cadillac STS|STS]] and the [[Cadillac Catera|Catera]] replacement called the [[Cadillac CTS|CTS]].

[[File:2019 Cadillac XT5 Luxury 3.6L rear 3.24.19.jpg|thumb|left|Cadillac XT5 (rear view)]]
The XT5 features technology such as a streaming video rear-view mirror, 360° view backup camera, and the first application in a Cadillac of GM’s Electronic Precision Shift, which replaces the standard hydraulic shifter with an electronic controller.  This, together with a new lightweight chassis, results in a weight savings of {{convert|278|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} versus the outgoing SRX.

===Powertrain===
The XT5 is initially available with only one engine, depending on the market.  In the United States, it has a 3.6-liter V6 used in other recent Cadillac models, producing {{convert|310|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|271|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} torque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.cadillac.com/media/us/en/cadillac/vehicles/xt5/2017.tab1.html|publisher=Cadillac|title=PRELIMINARY 2017 CADILLAC XT5 SPECIFICATIONS (NORTH AMERICA &amp; ROW)|accessdate=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The V6 includes [[start-stop system|automatic stop-start]] and cylinder deactivation to improve fuel economy.  In China, the XT5 is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine producing an estimated {{convert|258|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|295|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} torque.  The XT5 is available in both [[front-wheel drive]] and [[all-wheel drive]]. The AWD system, provided by [[GKN Driveline]], is completely new for this model and utilizes features like twin-clutch differential at rear axle with active torque vectoring, allowing the system to distribute 100% of torque to either front or rear axle as well as to either left or right rear wheel. In an addition to that, the AWD system allows the driver to disconnect the rear drive unit and leave the car in FWD mode for improved fuel efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sae.org/14686/|publisher=SAE|title=2017 Cadillac XT5 brings superior dynamics to luxo-crossover segment|accessdate=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/2015/11/the-advanced-all-wheel-drive-system-of-the-2017-cadillac-xt5-feature-spotlight/|publisher=GM Authority|title=The Advanced All-Wheel Drive System Of The 2017 Cadillac XT5: Feature Spotlight|accessdate=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trim levels===
The 2017 XT5 is offered in four trim levels.  Above the base XT5 are "Luxury", "Premium Luxury" and range topping "Platinum". The base price of the entry front-wheel drive 2017 XT5 at launch was $38,995 in the United States.

===2020 update===
For the 2020 model year, the XT5 received several mid-cycle updates.  The trim levels changed to Cadillac's "Y" strategy, with Luxury as the base, and Premium Luxury and Sport as separate higher levels.  The exterior design received only minor changes, with a new bright metallic patterned grille on the Premium Luxury, and a new darker grille on the Sport.

GM's newest 2.0 L turbocharged I4 engine, producing {{convert|237|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|258|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} torque, replaced the previous engine in China, and became the new base engine in the North American market, joining the V6.  A new rotary controller for the Cadillac CUE system was added, along with updates to the rear camera mirror and electronic precision shifter.&lt;ref&gt;http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/06/2020-cadillac-xt5-facelift-makes-official-debut/&lt;/ref&gt;

The XT4 is produced at [[General Motors Fairfax Assembly Plant|GM's Fairfax Assembly plant]], and went on sale in the fall of 2018 as a 2019 model.  The Chinese-market XT4 is manufactured in Shanghai by [[SAIC-GM]].

Cadillac introduced a teaser for the XT4 during a telecast of the [[90th Academy Awards]] on March 4, 2018,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2018/03/05/cadillac-xt4-premier-oscars-commercial.html "Cadillac offers a peek at new KCK-made XT4 during Oscars broadcast"],  ''Kansas City Business Journal'' (March 5, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; and it made its official debut at the 2018 [[New York Auto Show]] on March 27, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/01/2019-cadillac-xt4-will-debut-at-2018-new-york-auto-show/ "Cadillac XT4 Will Debut at 2018 New York Auto Show"], GM Authority (January 17, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; Cadillac started taking customer pre-orders shortly following the New York debut.

The '''Cadillac Escalade''' is a [[Full-size car|full-size]] luxury [[SUV]] engineered and manufactured by [[Cadillac]]. It was Cadillac's first major entry into the SUV market. The Escalade was introduced for the 1999 model year in response to competition from the [[Mercedes-Benz ML-Class]] and [[Lexus LX]]  and to [[Ford Motor Company|Ford's]] 1998 release of the [[Lincoln Navigator]]. The Escalade project went into production only ten months after it was approved. The Escalade is built in [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]], [[Texas]]. The word "[[escalade]]" refers to a siege warfare tactic of scaling defensive walls or [[Rampart (fortification)|rampart]]s with the aid of ladders or [[siege tower]]s.

The 1999 Escalade was nearly identical to the 1999 [[GMC Yukon Denali]], but was redesigned for the 2002 model year to make its appearance fall more in line with Cadillac's "art and science" design theme. Escalade production was skipped for the 2001 model year. The Escalade ESV (based on the [[Chevrolet Suburban]]) and its former sibling the Escalade EXT (based on the [[Chevrolet Avalanche|Avalanche sport utility truck]]) were made in [[Silao]], [[Mexico]], before the 2007 redesign; the new Escalade ESV is sourced from Arlington, Texas.

As of 2015, the Cadillac Escalade is available in every country that Cadillac is available in.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The Escalade ESV version is available in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Russia and the Middle East. It is Cadillac's largest luxury oriented, passenger- and load-carrying vehicle, which was a niche previously filled by the [[Cadillac Commercial Chassis]].

The introduction of the [[Lincoln Navigator]] in the 1998 model year necessitated that General Motors be able to compete in the burgeoning American market for full-size luxury-type trucks. This generation was only a five-seat SUV. Fearing the growing hegemony of the Lincoln Navigator, the Escalade was rushed through the design process to reach dealers quickly. Essentially little more than a [[Badge engineering|badge-engineered]] [[GMC Denali|GMC Yukon Denali]], the SUV's aesthetics were similar to the Denali and the final vehicle was smaller than the Navigator. The Escalade's underpinnings were borrowed from the Yukon Denali line, with the GMC logos on the center caps replaced with Cadillac's crest. The Escalade also used the same 5.7&amp;nbsp;[[Liter|L]] ''[[Chevrolet small-block engine#5700|Vortec 5700]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] at {{convert|255|hp||0|abbr=on}}, which was underpowered compared to the Navigator's {{convert|300|hp||0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|365|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} 5.4 Liter InTech V8. All first-generation Escalades featured [[Four-wheel drive#Systems by design type|Auto-Trac]] selectable 4x4. The 1999-2000 Escalade achieves {{convert|11|mpgus|L/100km|abbr=on}} city and {{convert|15|mpgus|L/100km|abbr=on}} highway based on U.S. EPA test protocols.&lt;ref name=epampg1999&gt;{{cite web |title=Compare Side-by-Side |website=www.fueleconomy.gov |accessdate=2013-09-17 |url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=15506 |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=epampg2000&gt;{{cite web |title=Compare Side-by-Side |website=www.fueleconomy.gov |accessdate=2013-09-17 |url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=16314 |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first-generation Escalade (as well as its mechanically identical twin, the [[GMC Yukon]] Denali), was available in a single configuration (one "base" trim level with one four-wheel-drive (4X4) drive train option), and included a generous amount of standard equipment, with few options available. Standard equipment included sixteen-inch chrome-clad aluminum-alloy wheels, color-keyed front and rear bumpers and side cladding panels, an [[OnStar]] in-vehicle telematics and communications system, a top-of-the-line premium GM-Delco A/M-F/M cassette stereo with remote-mounted CD changer, automatic tone control (ATC), clock, and six-speaker [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] premium amplified audio system, luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces with embossed logos in both front bucket seats, power-adjustable front bucket seats with driver's memory system, full power equipment (windows, door locks, and heated side mirrors), a security alarm, keyless entry, full instrumentation, tri-zone climate controls for the front and rear seats, rear climate control vents, rear audio system and climate controls, a full overhead console with storage, an auto-dimming rearview mirror with compass and temperature gauge, wood interior trim, a leather-and-wood-wrapped steering wheel with cruise controls and embossed logo, automatic front head and fog lamps, roof rails with preparation for an optional roof rack, among other standard equipment. While base [[MSRP]] of the 2000 [[GMC Yukon]] Denali increased to $43,535 (up $460 from $43,075 in 1999), the Cadillac Escalade retained a base [[MSRP]] of $46,225 in both 1999 and 2000. The [[GMC Yukon]] Denali included a unique front fascia and front and rear bumpers to differentiate it from its non-luxury cousin, the [[GMC Suburban]]. The only other physical differences between the first-generation Cadillac Escalade and [[GMC Yukon]] Denali were the emblems on the front grilles, front doors, rear tailgates, steering wheels, and front seat embroidery. [[General Motors]] retains the first Cadillac Escalade produced at [[Arlington Assembly]] in 1998, a 1999 Aspen White model, in its Heritage Collection, [[VIN]] # 400001. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.gmheritagecenter.com/gm-vehicle-collection/1999_Cadillac_Escalade.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike its Chevrolet and GMC siblings, which launched for the 2000 model year, Cadillac delayed the Escalade's switch to the GMT820 chassis until February 2001 as a 2002 model, the last of the three General Motors full-size truck and SUV brands to switch to the new chassis; Cadillac unveiled the 2002 model year Escalade in August 2000 at Pebble Beach, while continuing to sell the 2000 model year trucks. [[Rear-wheel drive]] was standard, as was a 5.3&amp;nbsp;L V8. [[All-wheel drive]] was standard on the ESV and EXT, and was optional on the short wheelbase Escalade. The special [[GM small-block engine#6000|high-output Vortec]] 6.0&amp;nbsp;L [[V8 engine]] was the sole engine choice on all-wheel drive models whether it was the short wheel base, ESV, or EXT until 2005 when the 5.3L was dropped altogether. In 2005 all rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive Escalades came with the high output 6.0L Vortec V8. All models (except for the EXT) offered seating up to eight people.

The "StabiliTrak" [[electronic stability control]] system was upgraded to a four-wheel version, High Intensity Discharge (HID) low beam headlights, power-adjustable pedals and signal outside mirrors were added as a standard feature in 2003, along with a [[Bulgari]]-branded clock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com:80/2002/10/18/travel/driving-bells-whistles-bulgari-touch-in-cadillacs.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225081903/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/18/travel/driving-bells-whistles-bulgari-touch-in-cadillacs.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 25, 2010|date=October 18, 2002|work=The New York Times|access-date=December 25, 2010|title=DRIVING: BELLS &amp; WHISTLES; Bulgari Touch In Cadillacs|first=Michelle|last=Krebs}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2004, [[XM Satellite Radio]], second-row [[bucket seat]]s, and a [[tire pressure]] monitoring system were made standard on all Escalades except the EXT. Also in 2004, the Platinum edition Escalade ESV was introduced at a base price of $71,025; it featured the luxury utility segment's first factory-installed 20-inch chrome wheels, a slightly lowered suspension, heated and cooled seats (front and back), heated and cooled cup holders, moon roof, second and third row monitors, an interior that included an ebony and shale dashboard, shale leather upholstery and pleated door panel bolsters, a chrome grille, and a standard 6.0 liter V8 producing {{convert|345|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. The [[OnStar]] system was upgraded for the 2005 model year and had become a digital system instead of the analog system that had been in use.

The Escalade moved to the new [[GMT900]] platform for the 2007 model year, as the GMT900 platforms together (Silverado/Sierra/Avalanche/Escalade EXT, Tahoe/Suburban/Yukon/Yukon XL/Yukon Denali/Escalade) were launched together for that year.  The regular Escalade was again joined by a stretched ''ESV'' version as well as a new ''EXT'' [[sport utility truck]]. The 2006 Escalade was the official vehicle of [[Super Bowl XL]], with [[Super Bowl MVP|MVP]] [[Hines Ward]] being awarded one of the first Escalades produced.

Production of the redesigned Escalade began at [[Arlington Assembly]] in January 2006. It is priced from [[USD|US$]]57,280, though the [[rear-wheel drive]] version at this price was not produced until August. The more expensive [[all-wheel drive]] version was produced first, followed by the long wheelbase ''ESV'' and ''EXT'' pickup (the latter sourced from the [[Silao]], [[Mexico]], plant) in June.

The Escalade uses an all-aluminum 6.2&amp;nbsp;L ''[[GM small-block engine|Vortec]]'' V8. This [[pushrod engine]] includes [[variable valve timing]], a first in a mass-produced non-[[overhead cam]] engine. The system adjusts both intake and exhaust timing between two settings. The [[Internal combustion engine|engine]] produces 403&amp;nbsp;hp (301&amp;nbsp;[[Watt|kW]]) (23&amp;nbsp;hp more than its sister competitor, the GMC Yukon Denali) and 417&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (565&amp;nbsp;[[Newton meter|N·m]]) of torque. A new six-speed [[GM 6L80 transmission|6L80]] [[automatic transmission]] is used. The new body completes a 0.363 [[coefficient of drag|drag coefficient]]. In 2010, the Cadillac Escalade's base price was $62,500 for a RWD model, and $65,200 for an AWD model. The northeast accounts for 60 percent of Escalade sales. 2013 model(Cadillac Escalade 2WD 8 cyl, 6.2 L, Automatic 6-spd,) have official government measured fuel economy of {{convert|14|mpgus|L/100km|abbr=on}}, combined {{convert|16|mpgus|L/100km|abbr=on}} and highway {{convert|18|mpgus|L/100km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/bymodel/2013_Cadillac_Escalade.shtml |title=Gas Mileage of 2013 Cadillac Escalade |publisher=Fueleconomy.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[hybrid vehicle|Hybrid]] version of the luxury vehicle debuted at the 2008 [[South Florida Auto Show|South Florida International Auto Show]] in Miami, and went on sale in 2008 as a 2009 model at a starting price of $74,085&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cadillac.com/cadillacjsp/model/landing.jsp?model=hybrid&amp;year=2009&amp;cmp=HybridRedirect The 2009 Cadillac Escalade Hybrid] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426140349/http://www.cadillac.com/cadillacjsp/model/landing.jsp?model=hybrid&amp;year=2009&amp;cmp=HybridRedirect |date=April 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for a two-wheel drive model. In August, 20% of Cadillac Escalade sales were hybrids.{{when|date=September 2013}}&lt;!-- What year? --&gt;

The Escalade Hybrid takes 8.2 seconds to accelerate from 0 to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The Hybrid is powered by a 6.0-liter V8. It's joined by two 60-kilowatt electric motors supplied by a [[nickel-metal hydride]] [[battery pack]] under the rear seat. On its own, the V8 is rated at {{convert|332|hp|abbr=on}} at 5,100 rpm and {{convert|367|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 4,100 rpm. GM engineers say that combined output with the electric motors is 379&amp;nbsp;hp. The unique transmission houses the electric motors along with three different planetary gear sets and four traditional clutches.

[[New York Giants]] quarterback [[Eli Manning]] received an Escalade Hybrid for being the 2008 [[Super Bowl MVP]].{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} The Hybrid models were discontinued after the 2013 model year.

===Standard features===
Standard features of the Cadillac Escalade includes air conditioning with tri-zone climate controls, Nuance leather trimmed seats, wood and leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls, cruise control, heated front seats and heated 2nd-row seats, 14-way power front seats, memory system, remote engine start, premium sound system, 6-disc CD changer, rear radio controls, compass, power lift-gate, and outside-temperature indicator. The Platinum adds on a DVD entertainment system, navigation system, heated and cooled cup holders, [[rearview camera]], cooled front seats, upgraded leather (Tehama front and second-row upholstery), and power-retractable running boards.

===Safety===
According to the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] 2007-08 Escalade models had the highest fatality rate of their class with a driver death rate of 33 compared to the class average of 15.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iihs.org/externaldata/srdata/docs/sr4605.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 7, 2013, Cadillac unveiled the fourth generation Escalade and Escalade ESV at a star-studded event in New York City, just nearly a month after GM unveiled their next-generation SUVs from Chevrolet and GMC. Cadillac began its campaign to promote the Escalade on August 14, 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2013/08/14/2015-cadillac-escalade-debut-october-7-nyc/ Next-gen Cadillac Escalade debuting October 7 in NYC] from Autoblog (August 14, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; and started posting teasers online on September 23, 2013, with help from photographer [[Autumn de Wilde]], who helped reveal more images ahead of the unveiling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/auto/index.ssf/2013/09/gm_revealing_2015_cadillac_esc.html "GM revealing 2015 Cadillac Escalade in New York City, partners with Autumn de Wilde"] from MLive (September 23, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; A [[YouTube]] page called [https://www.youtube.com/user/cadillac/EscaladeReveal "Escalade Reveal"] was set up to showcase the videos along with the countdown to unveiling. On November 25, 2013, Cadillac began spreading the word of mouth about the 2015 Escalade by placing a front facsimile cutout of the vehicle on display at [[Saks Fifth Avenue]]'s New York City flagship store during its annual Christmas promotional campaign, which shows the SUV being frozen in wraps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2013/12/wordless-wednesdays-saks-fifth-avenue-freezes-the-2015-cadillac-escalade/ "Wordless Wednesday: Sak's Fifth Avenue Freezes The 2015 Cadillac Escalade"] from GM Authority (December 18, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Production on The Escalade began in January 2014 at GM's Arlington, Texas assembly plant and went on sale in April 2014 as a 2015 model (with the MSRP starting at around $71,000 for Full Size, $74,000 for ESV), and available in only three trims: Base, Luxury, and Premium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2014/01/23/2015-cadillac-escalade-on-sale-in-april-priced-at-71-695/ "2015 Cadillac Escalade on sale in April priced at $71,695"] from Autoblog (January 23, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2014/03/21/2015-cadillac-escalade-configurator-lets-you-bling-it-your-way/ "2015 Cadillac Escalade configurator lets you bling it your way"] from Autoblog (March 21, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; International sales are scheduled to start in the Summer of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2013/11/cadillac-unveils-2015-cadillac-escalade-in-uae/ "Cadillac Unveils 2015 Escalade In UAE"] from GM Authority (November 25, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; They are assigned to the GMT K2XX platform as K2XL. “The 2015 Escalade exterior light signature draws inspiration from a variety of sources, beginning with Cadillac’s heritage of vertical exterior lamps and extending into architecture,” said Exterior Lighting Design Manager Martin Davis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motory.com/en/news/cadillac-says-2015-escalade-s-led-lighting-was-inspired-by-dubai-skyscrapers-439/ "2015 Cadillac Escalade"] from MOTORY News (October 26, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report on Autoblog.com, GM had reissued a redesign on the GM fullsize SUV lineup, including the Escalade, for a 2014 release due to increased SUV sales, and was working on its fullsize SUV replacements, which would see a possible change in the Escalade's SUV platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Vijayenthiran |first=Viknesh |url=http://www.motorauthority.com/blog/1042604_gm-working-on-next-gen-cadillac-escalade-other-full-size-suvs |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120904153625/http://www.motorauthority.com/blog/1042604_gm-working-on-next-gen-cadillac-escalade-other-full-size-suvs |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-04 |title=GM Working On Next-Gen Cadillac Escalade, Other Full-Size SUVs |publisher=MotorAuthority |date=2010-02-15 |accessdate=2010-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But in July 2013, a series of spy shots revealed that GM will keep the Escalade a body-on-frame SUV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2015-cadillac-escalade-spy-photos-news "2015 Cadillac Escalade Spy Photos: The star of music videos for years to come"] from Car &amp; Driver (July 23, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; However, GM is looking at expanding the Escalade brand to the large CUV segment, which would see a vehicle using the Escalade badge sharing the same platform as the [[Chevrolet Traverse]] and [[GMC Acadia]], which is in the planning stages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autonews.com/article/20131007/OEM04/131009884/cadillac-weighs-large-crossover-under-escalade-badge#axzz2hLsv9y55 Cadillac weighs large crossover under Escalade badge] from Automotive News (October 7, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; According to VP Bob Ferguson, Cadillac's first 3-row Escalade CUV could be introduced in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2014/01/cadillac-escalade.html "Cadillac Should Exploit Escalade Name:Exec"] from Autoguide (January 27, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a possibility that GM might export the Escalade to [[Australia]] as a right-hand drive vehicle as part of Cadillac's global expansion, as GM has begun to import its North American vehicles to its [[Holden]] division there after discontinuing the latter’s locally-produced models in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2014/03/13/cadillac-could-flourish-australia-report/ "Cadillac could 'flourish' in Australia, says marketing chief"] from Autoblog (March 13, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The cargo space was reduced from {{convert|109.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|94.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} on the standard base and from {{convert|137.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|120.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} on the ESV in order to allow an additional 1.7 inches of headroom and 45.3 inches of legroom in the front while reducing the third-row legroom space to 24.8 inches from 25.6 inches. GM's 6.2-liter EcoTec3 V8, good for 420 horsepower and 460 pound-feet of torque, mated to a six-speed automatic transmission (2015i models and beyond are 8-Speed Automatics), is the only engine offered, along with a new coil-over front suspension and five-link rear setup, a wider track, variable-assist electric power steering and Cadillac's [[Magnetic Ride Control]] system with Tour and Sport modes. The interior now has a hand-crafted design that features cut-and-sewn and wrapped materials, with wood trim options. The dashboard was also updated, and the [[Cadillac CUE]] system is added as a standard feature, along with an updated security system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2013/10/07/2015-cadillac-escalade-official/ "2015 Cadillac Escalade is exactly what you expect (w/video)"] from Autoblog (October 7, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 Escalade lineup received an 8-speed transmission, surround view camera, and [[4G]] LTE connectivity as part of a mid-year refresh, which also saw the wreaths on the grille disappear from the Escalade as part of Cadillac's plans to update the logo to emphasize the crest on all of its models.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/11/2015-cadillac-escalade-platinum-8-speed/ "2015 Cadillac Escalade gets 8-speed auto, range-topping Platinum Collection trim"] from Autoblog (August 11, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The only changes made are the deletion of the Manhattan Noir Metallic and Bronze Dune Metallic color pallet and the addition of the Dark Mocha Metallic color. The dealer-ordered Escalade Noir package is also eliminated after being offered for only a year. GM had proposed a facelift for the 2020 model which is going to look like [[Cadillac XT6]], but will not happen due to the next generation Escalade that is expected to debut in late 2019 or early 2020 as a 2021 model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/06/2020-cadillac-escalade-heres-whats-new-and-different/ “2020 Cadillac Escalade: Here’s What New And Different”] from GM Authority (June 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hennessey HPE550===
In 2014, [[Hennessey Performance Engineering]] offered a HPE550 supercharger upgrade to fourth generation Escalade customers, which included a belt-driven supercharger, air-to-water intercooler, recalibrated engine management software and a three-year/36,000 mile powertrain warranty, a {{convert|6|psi|bar|1|abbr=on}} boost that will increase the 6.2L engine's performance to {{Convert|557|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|542|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque, and 20-inch lightweight H10 forged monoblock wheels, to further improve performance. The upgrades, once they are ordered by customers, have a set price of $15,950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2014/04/23/hennessy-supercharging-2015-cadillac-escalde/ "Hennessy wastes no time in supercharging the 2015 Cadillac Escalade"] from Autoblog (April 23, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

A Cadillac V engine was available as a supercharged 6.2-liter LT4 V8 with power in excess of {{convert|600|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|600|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The move allowed customers who usually turn to companies like Hennessey a new option for their supercharger fix.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wot.motortrend.com/1509_cadillac_escalade_v_on_the_way_with_ctsv_power.html "Cadillac Escalade V on the Way With CTS-V Power"] from ''Motor Trend'' (September 8, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===International version===
In July 2015, GM reached a deal with Unison SP ZAO in [[Minsk, Belarus]] to build and assemble the Escalade and Escalade ESV for the Russian and CIS markets. This version will be similar to the Russian-built Chevrolet Tahoe, featuring the 6.2L V8 EcoTec3 engine and the Tahoe's semi-CKD assembled designs; the ESV also marked the first time an extended-length base model has been offered in this region. It will be available in 4WD models only and carry a MSRP of 4.34 million Rubles ($76,984 USD) for standard-size and 4.59 million Rubles ($81,383 USD) for ESV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2015/07/general-motors-to-produce-new-cadillac-escalade-in-minsk-belarus-for-russia-cis-markets/ "General Motors To Produce New Cadillac Escalade In Minsk, Belarus For Russia &amp; CIS Markets"], GM Authority (July 10, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
The reviews for the fourth generation Escalade's redesign has been met with positive results from automotive critics. ''[[USA Today]]'s'' James R. Healey and Fred Meier noted that "The once-unthinkable big Cadillac SUV has become indispensable."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/10/07/cadillac-escalade-redesigned-2015/2939161/ 2015 Cadillac Escalade reaches higher], ''[[USA Today]]'' (October 7, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNET]]'s Antuan Goodwin notes that "Fans of the Escalade will appreciate the automaker's sticking with the original message and not "ruining" its former flagship, but if you already think the giant luxury SUV is a relic of the past, there's nothing in the 2015 Escalade that will convince you that it's anything but an old dog that's learned a few cool new tricks."&lt;ref&gt;[http://reviews.cnet.com/suv/2015-cadillac-escalade/4505-10868_7-35828577.html 2015 Cadillac Escalade learns new tech tricks, keeps old-school feel], [[CNET]] (October 7, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Carscoops'' noted that "It may have impressed us more if a) it had shown the Escalade first instead of last, after the Chevrolet and GMC models or b) if the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and GMC Yukon and Yukon XL simply did not exist…" and added that Cadillac has won their attention with the redesign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carscoops.com/2013/10/2015-cadillac-escalade-revealed-in-all.html "2015 Cadillac Escalade Revealed in All its Big and Brawny Glory (Photos &amp; Videos)"], Carscoops (October 7, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Burgess of ''[[Motor Trend]]'' summed up the redesign in its headline, saying its "It's bigger, it's bolder and it's more beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/suvs/1310_2015_cadillac_escalade_first_look/#ixzz2hAUBFlgx First Look: 2015 Cadillac Escalade], ''[[Motor Trend]]'' (October 7, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Visnic of ''Edmunds'' concluded in his review that "With subtle, new sheet metal refreshingly free of styling gimmicks, Cadillac's looking to the 2015 Escalade's all-new and upgraded interior to help it retain its role as the benchmark of bling SUVs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmunds.com/car-news/cadillac-reveals-next-generation-of-bling-with-2015-escalade.html "Cadillac Reveals Next Generation of Bling With 2015 Escalade"], Edmunds (October 7, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle received a positive review by ''Autoblog'' contributor Michael Hartley, who took a road trip with a standard 4WD full-size trim from Los Angeles to Monterey, California. Although Hartley was skeptical at first, he came away impressed: "A 600-mile trip in the Escalade left me convinced that it has the features, build quality and driving dynamics to strike new fear in the segment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/29/2015-cadillac-escalade-review/ "2015 Cadillac Escalade"], Autoblog (August 29, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bloomberg News]], in its March 27, 2015 review, cited the Escalade as one of the best American-built SUVs ever made, adding that when comparing it to its foreign competitors, "It's the best we make."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-27/the-cadillac-escalade-platinum-is-the-best-suv-america-makes "The Cadillac Escalade Platinum Is the Best SUV America Makes"], [[Bloomberg News]] (March 27, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2015, Cadillac is rumored to add a twin-turbo V6 package offering, like CTS and XTS (V-sport), the Escalade may receive the same offering, but will keep the V8 engine as an option, unlike the Lincoln Motor Company's new 2015 Navigator. GM recently hired Infiniti's Johan de Nysschen to serve as Cadillac president and help revitalize the brand. June 2014 shipments showed Cadillac down a few percent for the year, however the Escalade was among the biggest winners with a 74-percent sales jump, and was one of Cadillac's best sellers the following July. As of March 2015, both standard and ESV Escalades have contributed to massive sales with the full size Escalade seeing a 117% increase and the ESV soaring to 114% overall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://247wallst.com/autos/2015/04/05/navigator-escalade-sales-soar/ "Navigator, Escalade Sales Soar"], 24/7 Wall St. (April 5, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 20, 2014, ''Automotive News'' and ''Autoblog'' began reporting that Cadillac dealers have been waiting three times longer than usual—a month or more—from the time an Escalade leaves the assembly line to when it gets delivered, saying they don't always know where their vehicles are in transit, or when they are set to arrive, upsetting customers who have put down deposits, leading to Cadillac dealerships to reportedly stop taking pre-orders. Even customers who placed orders as far as February 2014 are still waiting for the vehicles according to the dealerships' owners. Cadillac blames the delays on two weeks of "dwell time," citing "a lengthy quality-assurance process on some interior parts" that caused the lag, as well as additional issues with figuring out which vehicles should be delivered first. Despite the setback, Cadillac does plan to correct the issues with adding more employees and speed up production at the Arlington plant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/20/cadillac-dealers-frustrated-over-escalade-production-snarls/ "Cadillac dealers frustrated over Escalade production snarls"], Autoblog (August 20, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 16, 2016, ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' named the 2016 Escalade the worst large sized luxury SUV in its annual rankings, with an overall score of 44. Most of the criticism came from its room space, second-row seating, the CUE media system, stopping, stiff road handling, and its redesign, calling it the worst in class.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.yahoo.com/autos/consumer-reports-names-worst-vehicles-182900152.html "Consumer Reports names the worst vehicles"], [[CNBC]]/[[Yahoo!]] (March 16, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumerreports.org/cars/lowest-rated-cars-bottom-picks-2016/ "The Lowest-Rated Cars in 10 Categories"], ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' (March 16, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

A fictional ad depicted what the Escalade would look like if it was introduced in 1977 made the social media round in October 2019 that was created by Abimelec Design, which photoshopped Cadillac's DeVille front grille and back light feature onto an eighth generation Chevrolet Suburban.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/10/1977-cadillac-escalade-that-never-was-rendered/ "1977 Cadillac Escalade That Was Never Rendered"] from GM Authority (October 1, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recalls===
In May 2014, GM recalled 1,402 units of the 2015 Escalade and Escalade ESV that were built between January 2014 to May 2014 due to "an insufficiently heated plastic weld that attaches the (front) passenger side air bag to the instrument panel assembly could result in a partial deployment of the air bag in the event of a crash." GM also placed a temporary halt on further sales and informed owners of the affected vehicles to not let passengers sit in the front passenger seat until they are replaced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2014/05/20/gm-issues-four-new-recalls-2-4-million-cars/ "GM issues four new recalls, 2.4 million cars affected"], Autoblog (May 20, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth generation Escalade debuted on February 4, 2020,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30692406/2021-cadillac-escalade-photos-info/|title=2021 Cadillac Escalade Gets Even Bigger and Bolder|work=[[Car and Driver]]|last=White|first=Annie|date=4 February 2020|accessdate=4 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Beverly Hills, California]] for the 2021 model year, with sales to commence in the fall of 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/2021-cadillac-escalade-revealed/|title=2021 Cadillac Escalade debuts with 38 inches of screen real estate|work=[[CNET|Roadshow by CNET]]|last=Cole|first=Craig|date=4 February 2020|accessdate=4 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production of the 2021 Escalade could be pushed back due to the growing pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-autos-launches/coronavirus-could-force-gm-to-delay-its-redesigned-2021-suvs-idUSKBN21H3D8 “Coronavirus could force GM to delay its redesigned 2021 SUVs”] from Reuters (March 30, 2020)&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth generation Escalade will be built on the GMT1XX platform,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.motortrend.com/news/2021-cadillac-escalade-first-look-review-photos-specs/|title=2021 Cadillac Escalade First Look: Caddy's Ultimate Luxury SUV Is All-New|work=[[Motor Trend]]|last=Priddle|first=Alisa|date=4 February 2020|accessdate=4 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; sharing it with the [[Chevrolet Tahoe|Chevrolet Tahoe/GMC Yukon]] and [[Chevrolet Suburban|Chevrolet Suburban/GMC Yukon XL]], and will have a front grille design similar to the one used on Cadillac's XT crossovers, the exception being by level trims. 

In December 2019, Cadillac unveiled a teaser video that featured a 38-inch curved OLED screen dashboard that displayed the Cadillac crest (on the driver’s side) and “Escalade” name (across the passenger side), making this version the most unique in the Cadillac roster. On January 28, 2020, Cadillac confirmed that the fifth generation Escalade will have a new feature - self-driving called the "Super Cruise".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/2021-escalade-super-cruise-self-driving/|title=Cadillac Brings Super Cruise to the New 2021 Escalade|work=Wired|access-date=2020-02-13|language=en|issn=1059-1028}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the confirmation on January 31, 2020 of the addition of the turbodiesel 3.0L LM2 inline six-cylinder Duramax engine, the latter joining the Suburban/Tahoe and Yukon/Yukon XL.

There will be five level trims available on the fifth generation Escalade: Luxury, Premium Luxury, Sport, Premium Luxury Platinum, and Sport Platinum. The interior choices will consist of eight trim options and four unique seating designs. The AKG audio technology system is new, featuring 36 speakers throughout the cabin.

===Escalade ESV===
The 2021 Escalade ESV will debut in April 2020. However, it will not be at the [[New York International Auto Show]] due to the coronavirus pandemic as scheduled.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.autoblog.com/2020/02/04/2021-cadillac-escalade-esv-debut-new-york-auto-show/ “2021 Cadillac Escalade ESV will debut at the New York Auto Show”] from Autoblog (February 4, 2020)&lt;/ref&gt; It will feature a unique fascia along the passenger doors and wider exhaust pipes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gmauthority.com/blog/2020/02/2021-cadillac-escalade-esv-spotted-on-the-street/ “2021 Cadillac Escalade ESV Spotted On The Street”] from GM Authority (February 12, 2020)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Escalade EV===
An EV version of the Escalade is forthcoming. It will be built on GM's new electric architecture and use its new Ultium battery technology, sharing its platform with the [[GMC Hummer EV]]. This architecture allows for battery packs as large as 200 kWh, making as much as 1000 hp using a three-motor setup driving both the front and rear axles.

==Escalade EXT==
[[File:1st Cadillac Escalade EXT.jpg|thumb|right|GMT800 Cadillac Escalade EXT (2002–06)]]
[[File:2nd Cadillac Escalade EXT -- 11-10-2011.jpg|thumb|right|GMT900 Cadillac Escalade EXT (2007-13)]]

The '''Escalade ''EXT''''' [[sport utility truck]] (released alongside its twin, the [[Chevrolet Avalanche]]) was introduced in 2001 (as a 2002 model) from the [[Cadillac]] division of [[General Motors]]. It features a "Convert-a-Cab" composite pickup bed that can be expanded into the truck's cab through a bottom-hinged door. Like the Avalanche, the ''EXT'' has four [[full-size]] [[door]]s and seating for five.  [[High-intensity discharge]] headlights were offered for 2003. The Escalade ''EXT'' also appears in the movie, [[The Matrix Reloaded]] along with the [[Cadillac CTS|CTS]] in [[product placement]] ads. All Escalade EXTs were built in [[Mexico]].

The Escalade ''EXT'' (based on the Cadillac Escalade) was created as a direct competitor to the failed [[Lincoln Blackwood]], a pickup truck based on the [[Ford F-150]]. It had competed with the [[Lincoln Mark LT]] (now discontinued in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]), another F-150-based pickup truck that made its debut in 2005. It now competes with the Ford F-150 Platinum, which is still known as the '''Lincoln Mark LT''' in [[Mexico]].

The EXT models were discontinued after the 2013 model year along with the Avalanche. According to [[Autoblog.com]], The EXT was ranked tenth among the worst selling vehicles in the United States for 2013, with only 1,972 units sold. The designer of the 2015 model year said that it could be open to the possibility of revisiting the idea to bring the EXT back in the future, but there are no plans to do so at this point in time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2014/01/08/top-10-worst-selling-vehicles-2013/ "The top 10 worst-selling vehicles of 2013"] from Autoblog (January 8, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The Escalade EXT was available in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Middle East (except Israel).

==Platinum==
'''MY04:''' Cadillac released its first version of the Platinum Escalade. It was only available in the ESV model. It had such features as heated and ventilated Seats (front and back), heated and ventilated cup holders, special 20" wheels, special leathers and interior design, extra labeling and [[HID headlamp]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

'''MY08:''' Cadillac offered the Platinum Edition on its redesigned Escalade and Escalade ESV models. It includes such features as a unique front fascia and grille, heated and cooled cup holders, limited edition 22" wheels, additional chrome pieces and accents, 2 additional DVD monitors- located in the headrests of each front seat, special hand stitched leathers, real aluminum interior accents, Advanced Magnetic Ride Control system, genuine olive ash and burled walnut wood interior trim, and LED headlamps.

'''MY09:''' An Escalade hybrid model was new for 2009.

'''MY12:''' The Escalade had a mid-cycle refresh on Platinum trim with dual exhaust and more color options including White diamond, which was an optional feature on Base, Luxury and Premium, but the color was standard free of charge on Platinum editions Escalade.

'''MY15:''' The Platinum Escalade went on sale in fall of 2014 with a base MSRP at $90k, a price jump to $9k more than the 2014 Escalade Platinum price. The all-new 2015 Platinum Escalade features Cadillac's all-new emblem, more innovations with Nappa, semi-aniline massaging front seats, and either a choice of Tuscan (beige) or Black leather seating surfaces, and the Platinum Escalade comes with every available feature that the Premium trim has, plus: a suede microfiber headliner, its own unique grille and 22" wheels, 7-inch LCD screens in the headrests and a 9-inch screen in the center and an icebox in the center console.

==U.S. sales==
Cadillac discontinued tracking the sales of the Escalade ESV in the United States in 2018, as GM combines the sales of both full size and ESV versions from the 2018 model year onward.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/02/cadillac-escalade-sales-dip-15-percent-in-q4-2018/ "Cadillac Escalade Sales Dip 15 Percent In Q4 2018"] from GM Authority (February 15, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cadillac XT6'''  is a seven-seat [[Luxury vehicle|luxury]] [[mid-size]] [[crossover SUV]] manufactured by [[General Motors]]. The vehicle was introduced on January 12, 2019 at the [[North American International Auto Show#2019|North American International Auto Show]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1118823_3-row-cadillac-crossover-to-debut-at-2019-detroit-auto-show/ "2020 Cadillac XT6 3-row crossover debuting in Detroit"] from Motor Authority (January 2019)&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle went on sale in June 2019 as a 2020 model, with early orders commencing prior to the launch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/01/2020-cadillac-xt6-debuts-with-three-rows-bold-styling-refined-luxury/ "2020 Cadillac XT6 Debuts With Three Rows, Bold Styling, Refined Luxury"] from GM Authority (January 12, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:2020 Cadillac XT6 Sport AWD 3.6L, rear 2.16.20.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view]]
The XT6 (short for Crossover Touring 6) is Cadillac’s third crossover SUV, and the largest in the XT series, slotted between the [[Cadillac XT5|XT5]] and the standard full size SUV [[Cadillac Escalade|Escalade]]. The XT6 is produced at GM's [[Spring Hill, Tennessee]] plant, while the Chinese-market XT6 is scheduled to be manufactured in Shanghai by [[SAIC-GM]]. The XT6 went on sale in Russia during the fourth quarter of 2019,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/01/gm-to-update-chevrolet-and-cadillac-lineups-in-russia/ "GM To Update Chevrolet and Cadillac Lineup In Russia"] from Autoblog (January 31, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt; and is scheduled to go on sale in Japan in early 2020, albeit as a import with one model trim, six-passenger seating, and Left hand drive configuration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/12/cadillac-xt6-headed-to-japan-for-2020-calendar-year/ “Cadillac XT6 Headed To Japan For 2020 Calendar Year”] from GM Authority (December 27, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

While it serves as the luxury counterpart to the full-size [[Chevrolet Traverse]] and [[Buick Enclave]] in the crossover SUV segment, the XT6 shares its wheelbase with the mid-size [[GMC Acadia]], [[Cadillac XT5]], and [[Chevrolet Blazer_(crossover)|Chevrolet Blazer]]. Cadillac describes the XT6 as a “mid-size plus” vehicle as they see the XT5 as their primary mid-size CUV.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.autoblog.com/2019/01/13/2020-cadillac-xt6-revealed-first-big-crossover/ "2020 Cadillac XT6 revealed as Caddy's first big crossover"] from Autoblog (January 13, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Seating===
The seating configurations was intended to feature 6 seats, as Cadillac had announced that a possible full-size larger crossover SUV could be in the works, but instead made the XT6 a standard seven-seat vehicle, with the six-seat configuration an optional feature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/01/2020-cadillac-xt6-to-offer-two-passenger-configurations/ "2020 Cadillac XT6 To Offer Two Passenger Configurations"] from GM Authority (January 29, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Powertrain===
The XT6 comes with a 3.6L V6 LGX engine, making {{Convert|310|hp|0|abbr=on}} mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission with next-generation Electronic Precision Shift. A choice of AWD and FWD are offered. A 2.0L I4 gasoline turbo engine will be offered in the Chinese version, producing {{convert|177|kW|hp|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} and {{convert|350|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} torque.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/03/cadillac-xt6-to-offer-2-0l-turbo-engine-in-china/ Cadillac XT6 To Offer 2.0L Turbo Engine In China] from GM Authority (March 5, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trim levels===
Trim levels on the XT6 include "Premium Luxury", and "Sport".

==Reception==
The XT6 received mixed reviews, with XT6's styling and features being particularly criticized as reviewers believed both pale in comparison to the concurrently launched [[Lincoln Aviator#Second generation (U611; 2019–present_)|Lincoln Aviator]]. Reviewers also criticized the lack of an [[Hybrid vehicle|optional hybrid powertrain]], which is available on a number of the XT6's competitors. ''[[Car &amp; Driver]]'' gave it a lukewarm review: "It fails to match its competitors' luxury quotients or meaningfully set itself apart from its [[GMC Acadia|GMC]] and [[Chevrolet Traverse|Chevrolet]]-badged siblings,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a25861430/2020-cadillac-xt6-three-row-photos-info/ "2020 Cadillac XT6 Nails the Three-Row Part, Needs Work on the Luxury Part"] from [[Car &amp; Driver]] (January 12, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cars.com]]'' called the XT6 "underwhelming,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cars.com/articles/2020-cadillac-xt6-a-lincoln-aviator-competitor-it-is-not-1420757004599/ "2020 Cadillac XT6: A Lincoln Aviator Competitor It Is Not"] from Cars.com (January 14, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt; while ''The Drive'' notes "For everything the XT6 gets right, it’s hard not to think that the much more interesting Lincoln Aviator with its handsome look, posh interior, and a high-performance plug-in hybrid option is going to eat this Caddy's lunch."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedrive.com/news/25930/2020-cadillac-xt6-caddy-makes-its-overdue-return-to-the-three-row-crossover-market "2020 Cadillac XT6: Caddy Makes Its Overdue Return to the Three-Row Crossover Market"] from The Drive (January 14, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;
