The '''GMC Acadia''' is a midsize SUV from [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]]. The first-generation GMC Acadia shared the [[GM Lambda platform]] with the [[Chevrolet Traverse]], and [[Buick Enclave]].  The Acadia went on sale in 2006 as a 2007 model in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The Acadia replaces three of the 7- or 8-seater vehicles on the [[Pontiac]]–[[Buick]]–GMC dealership network, the [[mid-size|midsize]] [[Chevrolet Astro|GMC Safari]] [[van]], the [[GMC Envoy]], and the [[Pontiac Montana SV6]] [[minivan]] for the domestic market. As of 2009, the Lambda vehicles have replaced the [[Buick Rainier]], [[Buick Rendezvous]], [[Buick Terraza]], and the GMC Envoy XL and then subsequently the GMC Envoy, [[Chevrolet TrailBlazer]] and the Isuzu Ascender A Denali version of the Acadia debuted in 2010 as a 2011 model. In 2016, the second generation Acadia was repositioned as a mid-size crossover utility vehicle (as a 2017 model) in order to compete within the growing midsize SUV market against the likes of the [[Ford Explorer]] and [[Dodge Durango]].

The Acadia represents GMC's entry-level truck-like [[crossover (automobile)|CUV]] and is the first [[unibody]] vehicle from the marque. It is also GMC's first [[front-wheel drive]] passenger vehicle.

The Acadia has seating for eight and either front or [[all-wheel drive]]. With a {{convert|5200|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} towing capacity, the Acadia slots between the [[GMC Terrain]] and the [[Chevrolet Tahoe|Yukon]].  The Acadia is the mid-priced Lambda model between the [[Chevrolet Traverse]] and Enclave.

In December 2006, all production and sales of the Acadia (and the Saturn Outlook) were temporarily stopped due to the engine mounts not having holes drilled to release accumulated water, as well as an issue with potentially faulty rivets in the load floor just forward of the vehicle's rear hatch. The assembly process was quickly adjusted, and dealership sales of the vehicles had resumed within days of the notice.

The first-generation Acadia was sold alongside its second-generation replacement as the Acadia Limited. 

===Suspension and chassis===
The 2008 Acadia has a {{convert|118.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase and {{convert|67.28|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} front/rear tracks. The independent front suspension is a [[MacPherson strut]] design, with a direct-acting stabilizer bar and aluminum knuckles. The independent rear suspension uses a "H" Linked design.

Steering is power-assisted rack-and-pinion, with an optional variable-effort system. Standard are 18&amp;nbsp;inch wheels and tires, with optional 19&amp;nbsp;inch wheels. Four-wheel [[disc brakes]] with [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] are standard.

===Engine and transmission===
The Acadia uses GM's [[GM High Feature engine|High Feature]] ''[[GM High Feature engine#LY7|LY7]]'' V6 that was introduced in the [[Cadillac CTS]]. In the Acadia, the engine produces {{convert|275|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|258|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The Acadia also uses the new [[GM-Ford 6-speed automatic transmission]].

The 2009 model year engine was the [[Direct fuel injection|direct injected]] ''[[GM High Feature engine#LLT|LLT]]'', producing {{convert|288|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|270|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.

The 2012 Acadia has a 3.6&amp;nbsp;L V6 engine producing {{convert|288|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,300 rpm and {{convert|270|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 3,400 rpm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edmunds.com/gmc/acadia/2012/features-specs/|title=Used 2012 GMC Acadia Features &amp; Specs {{!}} Edmunds|website=Edmunds|language=en|access-date=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 Acadia Limited has a 3.6 L V6 engine producing 310 hp (231 kW) and 271 lb ft (367 Nm) of torque&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/gm/gmc/acadia/2017-acadia/|title=2017 GMC Acadia|website=GM Authority|language=en-us|access-date=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interior===
The Acadia features available 3-row, 7 or 8-seater seating. Inside, the Acadia features more contemporary trim than the Outlook, including chrome and satin nickel textures, and a wider variety of two-toned interior colors such as an Ebony and Light Titanium (grey) cloth upholstery, and a choice of either Ebony, Light Titanium (grey) or Brick (brown) leather upholstery. A [[heads-up display]] similar to those found in the [[Cadillac XLR]], [[Cadillac STS]], [[Pontiac Grand Prix]], [[Pontiac Aztek]], [[Pontiac Bonneville]], [[Buick Park Avenue]] and [[Chevrolet Corvette]] is one of the available options exclusive to the Acadia and standard on the Acadia Denali thus far.

===Wheels and tires===
The 2008 Acadia features 19&amp;nbsp;inch cast aluminum wheels and Goodyear Eagle RS-A M+S P255/60R-19 108H tires with a high-pressure compact spare tire standard on the SLT2 model and optional on the SLT1. The SLE model has 18&amp;nbsp;inch painted aluminum wheels with P255/65R-18 tires. The SLT1 comes standard with 18&amp;nbsp;inch machined aluminum wheels.

===Acadia Denali===
[[File:GMC Acadia Denali -- 05-06-2011.jpg|thumb|First generation 2011 GMC Acadia Denali]]
[[File:2013 GMC Acadia Denali -- 2012 NYIAS.JPG|thumb|221x221px|First generation refresh for 2013 GMC Acadia Denali]]
The [[GMC Denali|Denali]] version of the Acadia arrived at dealerships in 2010 as 2011 model. This upgraded trim is available in FWD and AWD versions in seven- or eight-passenger form and features monotone paint, honeycomb grille, unique front and rear fascias, along with HID headlamps, chrome accents, exhaust tips, and six-spoke 20-inch wheels. Interior upgrades include perforated leather seating and wood trim.

The Acadia Denali joins its SUV siblings, the [[GMC Terrain|Terrain]] Denali, the Yukon Denali and Yukon XL Denali, and marks GMC's first crossover to take the Denali badge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Filipponio |first=Frank |url= http://www.autoblog.com/2009/12/17/gmc-reveals-gussied-up-acadia-denali-for-2011/ |title=GMC reveals gussied-up Acadia Denali for 2011 |publisher=Autoblog |date=December 17, 2009 |accessdate=October 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety===
A [[Monocoque|unibody]] construction helps lower center of gravity, compared to previous truck-based GM SUVs, reduces the risk of rollover accidents. Much of the Acadia's structure is reinforced with high-strength steel, including a steel cross-car beam welded across the floor between the B-pillars.

The Acadia has six different [[airbag]]s equipped in the vehicle; two dual-stage front air bags for the driver and front passenger, two seat-mounted side-impact air bags in the first row and two head curtain side impact air bags that cover all three seating rows. Similar to the [[Volvo XC90]], the Acadia will have a detection system on board that will deploy various airbags if a rollover is detected.

Additionally, the Acadia comes standard with the [[OnStar]] system.

===Model year updates===

====2013 facelift====
GM unveiled an updated 2013 GMC Acadia at the 2012 [[Chicago Auto Show]], taking the bodyshell of the discontinued [[Saturn Outlook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://suvs.about.com/od/gmc/ss/2013-Gmc-Acadia-Revealed-At-Chicago-Auto-Show.htm |title=2013 GMC Acadia Revealed at Chicago Auto Show |work=About.com |first=Jason |last=Fogelson |date= |accessdate=October 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2013 Acadia received a completely redesigned grille and front fascia, a redesigned rear liftgate, and an improved interior with upgrades to interior quality, as with its other two updated siblings, the [[Buick Enclave]] and [[Chevrolet Traverse]].

====2014 model year====
For the 2014 model year, the Acadia added Forward Collision Alert and Lane Departure Warning as a standard on Denali and as an optional feature on SLT1 and SLT2 trims, while two charging-only USB ports on the rear of the center console for second-row use were added as a standard for all trims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://media.gmc.com/media/us/en/gmc/vehicles/acadia/2014.html |title=GMC Acadia - 2014 |publisher=GM Media |date=May 2013 |accessdate=October 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015 model year====
For the 2015 model year, a heated, leather-wrapped steering wheel became standard on SLT-2 and Denali models, along with a twenty-inch aluminum wheel design. Crimson Red Tintcoat, Dark Sapphire Blue Metallic, and Midnight Amethyst Metallic are added as new exterior color palettes. In addition, dual exhaust became available only on Denali versions, while all other trim levels received single exhaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://media.gmc.com/media/us/en/gmc/vehicles/acadia/2015.html |title=GMC Acadia/Acadia Denali - 2015 |publisher=GM Media |date=August 2014 |accessdate=October 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second generation Acadia made its official debut at the [[North American International Auto Show]] on January 12, 2016. The redesigned Acadia went on sale in May 2016 as a 2017 model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autonews.com/article/20160104/OEM03/301049919/high-end-vehicles-and-crossovers-will-take-center-stage-in-Motown "High End Vehicles And Crossovers Will Take Center Stage In Motown"] from Automotive News (January 9, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; The second generation Acadia is built in [[Spring Hill, Tennessee]].

[[File:2017 GMC Acadia rear 2.15.18.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view]]
The second generation Acadia was reduced from 200.8 inches to 193.6 inches in length and from 78.9 inches to 75.4 inches in width (losing 700 pounds in the process), as GM repositioned the vehicle to mid-size status while remaining above the Terrain in size (the Terrain itself would relinquish its midsize status after it was repositioned as a second generation smaller compact crossover with the 2018 model), as GM has already announced that the next generation Traverse and Enclave will be the only GM-built full-size crossover SUVs in this segment. With the reduction from full-size to mid-size, the Acadia's MSRP was reduced to $29,995 (US).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2016/02/2017-gmc-acadia-msrp-drops-between-1725-and-3000-over-2016-model-pricing-comparison/ "2017 GMC Acadia MSRP Drops Between $1,725 And $3,000 Over 2016 Model: Pricing Comparison"] from GM Authority (February 18, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; The GMC Acadia now has 5, 6, and 7 passenger configurations arranged respectively like either two front bucket seats and one rear bench seat; two bucket seats up front, two buckets in the second row, and two seats in the rear row; or two front bucket seats, one second row bench seat, and two rear seats in the third row.

The second generation Acadia features seven seats instead of eight, a choice of either a 2.5L or 3.6L engine, a new advanced twin-clutch AWD system (available only with All-Terrain package) by [[GKN Driveline]] designed for off-road environment (joining the FWD and AWD drivetrains available on all other models), an updated fascia and redesigned lighting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.gmc.com/media/us/en/gmc/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2016/Jan/naias/gmc/0112-acadia.html GMC Introduces All-New 2017 Acadia] from GMC (January 12, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACADIA ALL TERRAIN: TESTED OFF THE BEATEN PATH|url=http://www.gmc.com/gmc-life/suvs/testing-the-acadia-all-terrain|website=GMC|publisher=GM|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 GMC Acadia: Our First Drive With The Latest From Professional Grade|url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/2016/05/2017-gmc-acadia-our-first-drive-with-the-latest-from-professional-grade/|website=GM Authority|publisher=GM Authority|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Acadia is built on the same platform as the [[Cadillac XT5]] and will be joined by the Chinese-built [[Buick Envision]] and the [[Chevrolet Blazer (crossover)|Chevrolet Blazer]] (built on the C1XX platform) when GM unveils its lineup for its mid-size CUVs for 2018 and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autonews.com/article/20150720/OEM04/307209970/chevrolet-clears-space-for-a-new-crossover "Chevrolet Clears Space For A New Crossover"] from Automotive News (July 20, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.autoblog.com/2018/02/28/chevy-blazer-midsize-suv-spy-photos/#slide-7259783 Is this a new Blazer?

With the decrease in size, fuel economy with the 3.6L increases to 18 city, 25 hwy (AWD and FWD) from 17 city 24 hwy (FWD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FEATURES &amp; SPECS|url=http://www.gmc.com/suvs/acadia-mid-size-suv/features-specs/trims.html|website=GMC|publisher=GM|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FEATURES &amp; SPECS|url=http://www.gmc.com/previous-year/acadia-mid-size-suv/features-specs/trims.html|website=GMC|publisher=GM|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2017 Acadia will offer the newly launched AppShop feature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2016/06/2017-model-year-gm-vehicles-to-roll-out-long-awaited-app-shop/ "2017 Model Year GM Vehicles To Roll Out Long-Awaited App Shop"] from GM Authority (June 3, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

Trim levels for the second generation Acadia were carried over from the previous generation; '''SL''', '''SLE-1''', '''SLE-2''', '''SLT-1''', '''SLT-2''', as well as a '''Denali''' trim level, though an '''All-Terrain Package''' is available on Acadia SLE and SLT trim levels that will be more rugged in its appearance. The second generation Acadia is also available with Third Row Seat Delete option on SLE and SLT trim levels as part of the All-Terrain Package.

The second generation Acadia introduced a feature to remind drivers to check the rear seats for children to help prevent heatstroke of children accidentally left behind in a vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autonews.com/article/20160112/OEM11/160119873/gm-unveils-technology-to-help-avoid-child-heatstroke-deaths "GM Unveils Technology To Help Avoid Child Heatstroke Deaths"] from ''Automotive News'' (January 12, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holden Acadia===
[[File:Holden Acadia Launch, 29 August 2018 (43429186695).jpg|left|thumb|Holden Acadia]]
The Acadia is sold in Australia and New Zealand as a [[Holden]]-badged vehicle. It went on sale November 12, 2018. The Holden Acadia is built in Tennessee with RHD specifications, and is marketed as a full-size CUV.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redbook.com.au/car-news/2016/car/holden/holden-confirms-captiva-replacement-103624?csn_tnet=true&lt;/ref&gt;
Australia and New Zealand are the only markets in the world where a right-hand drive version of the Acadia is sold. 

On 17 February 2020, GM announced that Holden brand will be phased out by 2021&lt;ref&gt;https://media.gm.com/media/au/en/holden/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/au/en/2020/feb/0217_Holden.html&lt;/ref&gt;, but it is not yet known if the RHD Acadia will be rebranded or discontinued altogether. GM is looking at making vehicles like the Acadia become part of a “General Motors Specialty Vehicle” exporting sub-brand, as it already have Chevrolet brands (Camaro, Silverado, and Corvette) distributed through [[Holden Special Vehicles|a former Holden division]] since 2018.

===Acadia Limited===
For the 2017 model year, the first-generation Acadia was sold alongside its second-generation replacement, but was renamed the Acadia Limited, much like the [[Chevrolet Cruze|Chevrolet Cruze Limited]], [[Chevrolet Malibu|Chevrolet Malibu Limited]], and [[Chevrolet Impala|Chevrolet Impala Limited]] were also sold alongside their replacements, at least for a single model year, as rental and fleet vehicles. However, production remained in [[Lansing, Michigan]] as the second generation Acadia moved to [[Spring Hill, Tennessee]], the site of the original [[Saturn (automobile)|Saturn]] plant. With the second-generation [[Buick Enclave]] and [[Chevrolet Traverse]] making their debuts in 2017 as 2018 models, GMC ended production on the Acadia Limited on March 31, 2017 in order to start production on the Traverse and Enclave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2017/03/gmc-acadia-limited-production-scheduled-to-end-next-week/ "GMC Acadia Limited Production To End Next Week"] from GM Authority (March 24, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; The Acadia Limited carried a base price tag of $44,775 and continued to offer the same features from the 2016 model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2016/06/gmc-acadia-limited-priced-at-44775/ "GMC Acadia Limited Priced at $44,775"] from GM Authority (July 1, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

====2020 facelift====
[[File:2020 GMC Acadia AT4 front NYIAS 2019.jpg|thumb]]
[[File:2020 GMC Acadia AT4 rear NYIAS 2019.jpg|thumb]]
The [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] Acadia received a facelift for 2020. The facelift introduced new exterior styling (including a new front grille inspired by the all-new 2019 [[GMC Sierra]] 1500), a revised infotainment system with [[Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]] [[smartphone]] integration, new alloy wheel options, an all-new '''AT4''' trim level (which replaces the All-Terrain Package on select trim levels), a new 2.0L turbocharged [[EcoTec]] inline four-cylinder (I4) engine (both the 2.5L EcoTec I4 and 3.6L VVT V6 engine options remain available for 2020), and the Electronic Precision Shift push-button automatic transmission that was first introduced on the 2018 [[GMC Terrain]], among other changes. The 2020 GMC Acadia went on sale in the fall of 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a26358738/2020-gmc-acadia-suv-photos-info/|title=The 2020 GMC Acadia Looks Blockier and Has a New Turbo Engine|work=[[Car and Driver]]|last=Capparella|first=Joey|date=18 February 2019|accessdate=18 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''GMC Syclone''' is a high-performance version of the [[GMC Sonoma]] [[pickup truck]]. Produced in 1991 by [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]], the Syclone spawned the similarly powered 1992-1993 [[GMC Typhoon]] [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]]. Another vehicle, the [[Sonoma GT|GMC Sonoma GT]], offered less performance but was seen as a companion model.

==Product run==
At the time it was introduced, the Syclone was the quickest stock pickup truck being produced in the world. Auto magazines compared its acceleration favorably to a variety of sports cars including the Corvette and - in a memorable comparison test in ''Car and Driver'' magazine - a Ferrari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sportmachines.com/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=Car+and+Driver+Sept+1991&amp;bl=y| title=Car and Driver Sept 1991| work=sportmachines.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features a turbocharged 6-cylinder engine, all wheel drive and 4-wheel anti-lock brakes.

Both the Syclone and Typhoon trucks feature a [[Mitsubishi]] TD06-17C 8&amp;nbsp;cm² [[turbocharger]]&lt;ref name="HMM-SS"/&gt; and [[Garrett AiResearch|Garrett]] water/air [[intercooler]] attached to a 4.3 L ''[[Chevrolet 90-Degree V6 engine#Turbocharged LB4 4.3L V6|LB4]]'' [[V6]] engine with unique pistons, main caps, head gaskets, [[intake manifold]]s, fuel system, [[exhaust manifold]]s, and a 48mm twin bore throttle body from the 5.7 L [[GM Small-Block engine]]. All Syclones and Typhoons had a [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM700R4 / 4L60 / 4L60E / 4L65E / 4L70E|4L60]] 4-speed [[automatic transmission]]. A [[BorgWarner]] all wheel drive transfer case splits torque with 35% forward and 65% to the rear wheels.&lt;ref name="HMM-SS"/&gt; Both trucks featured sport modifications to the standard suspensions. The Syclone was the first production truck to receive a 4-wheel [[anti-lock braking system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Huizenga |first1=Paul |title=Storm on the Horizon: Tracing Today's Super SUV Origins |url=https://www.drivingline.com/articles/storm-on-the-horizon-tracing-todays-super-suv-origins/ |website=Driving Line |publisher=Nitto Tire |accessdate=19 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this engine, the Syclone produces {{Convert|280|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|350|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.&lt;ref name="HMM-SS"/&gt; The Syclone, when new, was capable of accelerating from 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph (97 km/h) in 4.3 seconds and could do a quarter-mile run in 13.4 seconds at {{Convert|98|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} according to Car &amp; Driver's comparison test.

In 1991 Syclones were only available in black. 1992 models were to be offered in a wider range of colors before they were canceled. Two thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five Syclones were built in 1991, and three in 1992. One hundred and thirteen (estimated 31 returned) were reported as Export Sales including a subset now referred to as the ''Saudi Syclones'' &amp;mdash; a small number were delivered to [[Saudi Arabia]] and modified with a metric dash cluster, leaded fuel chip, and a [[Resonator#Automobiles|resonator]] in place of the [[catalytic converter]].

The Syclone, Typhoon, and Sonoma GT were built for GMC by [[Production Automotive Services]] of [[Troy, Michigan]], and sold through dealerships.

The Syclone and Typhoon's gauge cluster is the one used in the [[Pontiac Sunbird]] Turbo, which was discontinued in 1990, one year before the Syclone was introduced.

In 2009, a poor-condition GMC Syclone was scrapped under the [[Car Allowance Rebate System]], despite being highly collectible,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jalopnik.com/5462441/morons-clunkerize-rare-gmc-syclone-super-truck|title=Morons Clunkerize Rare GMC Syclone Super Truck|publisher=[[Jalopnik]] |date= Feb 2, 2010 |accessdate=2010-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it was saved by a group of auto enthusiasts.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Special editions==
There were two special-edition 1991 Syclones offered by third parties:

===Marlboro Syclone===
{{Infobox automobile
|name=Marlboro Syclone
|production=10 conversions
|image=1991GMCMarlboro.jpg
}}
The special-edition [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] Syclone was the grand prize for the ten winners of The Marlboro Racing ‘92 Contest. All ten trucks were provided to [[American Sunroof Company]] (ASC), by Shinoda Design Associates, Inc., in conjunction with Phillip Morris, Inc. With the help of [[Larry Shinoda]], designer of the Corvette Stingray and Boss Mustang, a transformation of the originally black Syclones took place.&lt;ref name="HMM-SS"/&gt;

Marlboro Syclone custom features include:&lt;ref name="HMM-SS"/&gt;
*ASC converted the roof to a targa-style{{What?|date=April 2017}} roof panel with mounts in the pick-up bed
*ASC installed a slide-down rear window assembly
*Guidon hard [[tonneau]] cover
*[[Boyd Coddington]] "Cobra" wheels with Marlboro emblem center caps and Goodyear Eagle GS-C tires
*PPG "Hot Licks" Red paint, with white strobe stripes provided by Graphik Concepts
*[[Recaro]] leather seats with Simpson 5-Point racing harness
*Custom [[Momo (company)|MOMO]] "Evolution" steering wheel
*Sony sound system
*PROMPaq performance chip and Borla [[stainless steel]] exhaust
*Bell Tech suspension which lowered the truck by three inches

===Indy Syclone===
Three ''Indy Syclones'' were used at the [[Indianapolis 500]] race on May 24, 1992 with the only modifications being a sticker package. One of these Indy trucks was converted into the [[PPG Industries|PPG]] ''Syclone Pace Truck'' (though it was not the [[List of Indianapolis 500 pace cars|official pace car]]) with significant modifications, including a multi-colored silver, magenta, and aqua paint scheme, and a molded in light bar in the roof, a [[racing fuel cell]] and fire system.

The '''[[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] CCKW''', also known as '''"Jimmy"''', or the [[List of U.S. military vehicles by supply catalog designation#G500 to G599|{{nobr|'''G-508'''}}]] by its Ordnance Supply Catalog nr,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Ordnance Corps]] Supply Catalog designation, 'G-number', or SNL nr. — a group number for ordering parts, based on a [[List of U.S. Army weapons by supply catalog designation|Standard Nomenclature List]].&lt;/ref&gt; was a highly successful series of [[Off-road vehicle|off-road capable]], [[2½-ton 6x6 truck|2{{1/2}}-ton, 6x6 trucks]], built in large numbers to a standardized design (from 1941 to 1945) for the [[U.S. Army]], that saw heavy service, predominantly as cargo trucks, in both [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]].  The original "Deuce and a Half", it formed the backbone of the famed [[Red Ball Express]] that kept [[World War II allies|Allied]] armies supplied as they pushed eastward after the [[Normandy invasion]].{{sfnp|Colley|2000}}

The CCKW came in many variants, including open or closed cab, long wheelbase (LWB) '''CCKW-353''' and short (SWB) '''CCKW-352''', and over a score of specialized models, but the bulk were standard, general purpose, cargo models. A large minority were built with a front mounted winch, and one in four of the cabs had a machine-gun mounting ring above the co-driver's position.

Of the almost 2.4 million trucks that the U.S. Army bought between 1939 and December 1945, across all payload weight classes, some 812,000, or just over one third, were {{frac|2|1|2}}-ton trucks.&lt;ref&gt;''(Or 5-ton on-road rated)''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HydeArsenal&gt;{{cite book |last=Hyde |first=Charles K. |year=2013 |title=Arsenal of Democracy: The American Automobile Industry in World {{nobr|War II}} |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=P-PCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152 |location= |publisher=Wayne State University Press |page=152–154 |isbn=9780814339527 |author-link= |ref=HydeArsfn }}&lt;/ref&gt; GMC's total production of the CCKW and its variants, including the 2{{1/2}}-ton, 6x6, amphibian [[DUKW]], and the 6x4, 5-ton (on-road) CCW-353, amounted to some 572,500 units – almost a quarter of the total WW II U.S. truck production, and 70 percent of the total {{frac|2|1|2}}-ton trucks. GMC's total of ~550,000 purely 6x6 models, including the DUKW, formed the overwhelming majority of the ~675,000 six by six {{frac|2|1|2}}-ton trucks, and came in less than 100,000 shy of the almost 650,000 [[Willys MB|World War II jeeps]].&lt;ref name=Sunderlin/&gt;&lt;ref name=USAIww2GM/&gt;&lt;ref name=HydeArsenal/&gt; Additionally, GM built over 150,000 units of the CCKW's smaller brother, the {{frac|1|1|2}}-ton, 4x4 [[Chevrolet G506]], at the same factory.

The GMC CCKW began to be phased out, once the [[M35 series 2½-ton 6x6 cargo truck|M35 series trucks]] were first deployed in the 1950s, but remained in active U.S. service until the mid-1960s. Eventually, the M35 series, originally developed by [[REO Motor Car Company|REO Motors]], succeeded the CCKW as the U.S. Army's standard {{frac|2|1|2}}-ton, 6x6 cargo truck.


==Etymology==
The name '''CCKW''' comes from GMC model [[nomenclature]]:{{sfnp|Whitlock|2004}}
* '''"C"''', designed in 1941
* '''"C"''', conventional cab
* '''"K"''', all-wheel drive
* '''"W"''', dual rear axles
* '''"X"''', experimental chassis / non-standard wheelbase (first 13,188 units &lt;ref name=Sunderlin/&gt;)

==History==
In 1939-1940 the [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|US Army Ordnance Corps]] was developing {{frac|2|1|2}}-ton (2,268&amp;nbsp;kg) load-rated [[six-wheel drive|6×6]] tactical trucks that could operate off-road in all weather. General Motors, already supplying modified commercial trucks to the Army, modified the 1939 ACKWX – built for the French Army – into the CCKW.{{sfnp|Ware|2010|pp=238-239}} The General Motors design was chosen by the Army and went into production at GM'S [[Yellow Coach Manufacturing Company|Yellow Truck and Coach]] division's [[Pontiac Assembly|Pontiac, Michigan plant]] alongside 6×4 CCWs. Later they were also manufactured at [[St. Louis Truck Assembly|GM's St. Louis, Missouri Chevrolet plant]].{{sfnp|Crismon|2001|pp=9, 184, 326, 330-335, 465}}{{sfnp|Doyle|2010|p=9}}

==Production numbers==
Sources do not precisely agree on the total numbers of CCKWs built by the end of production in 1945. Ware (2010) lists one single number of 562,750 of CCKW trucks, built across all variants – presumably including the amphibian DUKW. More clearly specified numbers are provided by Sunderlin in ''Army Motors'' magazine, and by Jackson, using the numbers found in the 1946 revision of the U.S. military's ''Summary Report of Acceptances, Tank-Automotive Materiel''. Sunderlin reports a total of 528,829 of {{frac|2|1|2}}-ton 6x6 units (excluding the DUKW) produced by GMC — versus a total of 527,168 accepted by the U.S. Army.&lt;ref name=Sunderlin&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Sunderlin |first=Bryce |date= |title=THE JIMMY's ANCESTRY – The CCKW in Detail and The Collector's Syndrome |url=http://www.cckw.org/pdf/CCKW_Part_1.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304185616/http://www.cckw.org/pdf/CCKW_Part_1.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |magazine=Army Motors |location=Lansing, MI |publisher=CCKW.org |access-date=2019-04-10 |pages=19–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson's tabulation of the 1946 U.S. acceptances numbers adds up to 524,873 units, excluding the DUKWs and the ACKWX predecessor models.&lt;ref name=USAIww2GM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usautoindustryworldwartwo.com/General%20Motors/gmc.htm |title=The American Automobile Industry in World War Two – GMC |last=Jackson |first=David |date=1 February 2019 |website= |publisher= |access-date=2019-04-10 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|ref=SRATAM4045|Summary Report – Tank-Automotive Materiel|1945|pages=86–102}} Both of these numbers still include the cab-over engine AFKWX-353 models — leaving a total of some 518,000–519,000 actual CCKW-352 and CCKW-353 units.&lt;ref name=Sunderlin/&gt;&lt;ref name=USAIww2GM/&gt; In addition, GMC serial numbers indicate a production of 23,500 of the same bodied 6x4 CCW models, versus 23,649 units accepted by U.S. ordnance.&lt;ref name=Sunderlin/&gt;

In any case, GM / GMC built a total of {{frac|2|1|2}}-ton, 6-wheeled trucks that was second only to the [[Willys MB|WW II “Jeep”]] {{sfnp|Ware|2010|pp=238-239}} — and neither Ford nor Willys individually built as many jeeps during the war.

==Specifications==
===Engine and drive-line===
The CCKW was equipped with the [[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#270|GMC 270 engine]], an overhead valve inline-6 with {{convert|91.5|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{sfnp |ref=TM9280047 |TM 9-2800 'MILITARY VEHICLES' |1947 |p=267–270, 272–279 }} or {{convert|104|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{sfnp |ref=TM9280043 |TM 9-2800 'Standard Military Motor Vehicles' |1943 |p=238–275 }} at 2750rpm, and {{convert|216|lbft|0}} at 1400rpm.{{sfnp |ref=TM9280047 |TM 9-2800 'MILITARY VEHICLES' |1947 |p=267–270, 272–279 }} A {{convert|3+25/32|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} bore by {{convert|4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} stroke gave a {{convert|269.5|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} displacement.{{sfnp|TM 9-801|1944|pp=6-9}} This (gasoline) engine was designed for commercial trucks, and was reliable in service.{{sfnp|Doyle|2003|pp=108-118}}

The transmission was a Warner T93 5-speed with a direct 4th gear and overdrive 5th gear. The transfer case had high and low gears, and engaged the front axle. Originally all axles were a Timken split type, later trucks also used GM "banjo" types.{{sfnp|TM 9-801|1944|pp=13-14, 35-39}}{{sfnp|Doyle|2010|pp=9, 10, 20}}

===Chassis===
The CCKW had a ladder frame chassis with three driven beam axles, the front on leaf springs, the rear tandem on leaf springs with locating arms. There were two wheelbases, the short Model 352 and the long Model 353. The short, {{convert|145|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} (Measurements are from the centerline of the front axle to the centerline of rear bogie) was used with a short cargo bed as an artillery prime mover for 75&amp;nbsp;mm and 105&amp;nbsp;mm howitzers. All other models used the long {{convert|164|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase. Tires were 7.50-20, brakes were hydraulic with vacuum assist.{{sfnp|Doyle|2003|pp=108-118}}

Some were fitted with {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}} front-mounted winches. A winch added {{convert|300|lb}} and {{convert|14|in|cm|0}}.{{sfnp|TM 9-801|1944|pp=17-18, 54-58}}

Some open cab chassis were cut in half behind the cab for air transport. Each half was a load, at the vehicle's destination, the halves were bolted back together.{{sfnp|Doyle|2003|pp=108-118}}{{sfnp|Doyle|2010|pp=47-55}}

==Versions==
[[File:K-53 shop van.jpg|thumb|Van body with canvas roof and doors in place]]
[[File:GMC CCKW 750 Gal Tanker.jpg|thumb|Gasoline tanker ({{convert|750|usgal|l|abbr=on}})]]

Initially, all versions used a modified commercial closed cab design having a metal roof and doors. By 1944 an open cab version, with a canvas roof and doors, was used. This was easier to build, and the roof could be removed to lower the shipping height. 1 in 4 of cabs had a machine gun mounting ring above the co-driver's position.{{sfnp|Doyle|2003|pp=108-118}}

The CCKW provided a platform for the widest range of bodies on any U.S. military vehicle,{{cn|date=April 2019}} with the {{convert|12|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} cargo version being the most common. As steel was more heavily rationed during the course of the war, the steel cargo bed was replaced by a wooden one. Wooden beds proved unsatisfactory and a 'composite' bed with steel sides, framing, and wooden bottom slats was developed.{{sfnp|Doyle|2010|p=9}} However, the composite bed was still unsatisfactory and the bed design returned to all steel. Standard cargo models had beds with fixed sides and a drop tailgate, as well as folding troop seats.

A standard rectangular van configuration was used in communications, medical, workshop, and many other specialty roles. Special built vans were also used.{{sfnp|Doyle|2010|pp=78-80}}

===Specialized variants===
Many specialized variants of the basic 6×6 CCKW were made, some in small numbers, including some converted in the field. These include:{{sfnp|TM 9-2800|1947|pp=267-268, 272-293}}

===ACK-353===
The ACK-353 ('''A''' for 1939 design, '''C''' for conventional cab, and '''K''' for all wheel drive) {{frac|1|1|2}}-ton 4x4 truck was the smaller brother of the ACKWX, and a predecessor to the [[Chevrolet G506]], competing with the
[[Dodge WC series#1940 — 1⁄2-ton VC and 1 1⁄2-ton VF models|Dodge / Fargo T-203 / VF-400]] series, as GM was at that time also trying to clinch the lucrative contract for the standard World War II cargo trucks in the {{frac|1|1|2}}-ton 4x4 category.&lt;ref name=DoyleG506&gt;{{cite book |last=Doyle |first=David |year=2019 |title=Chevrolet G-506 – {{frac|1|1|2}}-ton 4x4 Development, Production and Variants in WW2 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190408104402/https://cdn3.volusion.com/hrqpw.cruld/v/vspfiles/photos/620-1000-5.jpg |location=Branchville, NJ |publisher=Portrayal Press |page=8 |isbn=9780938242062 |author-link=David Doyle (writer) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACK-353 was equipped with the new for 1939 [[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#248|GMC 248 engine]], an overhead valve, low-deck inline-six with a {{convert|3+23/32|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} bore and {{convert|3+13/16|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} stroke, resulting in a {{convert|248|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} displacement, producing {{convert|77|bhp|kW}} (net).&lt;ref&gt;[http://69.5.4.225/od_mvg_vehicle_id_ltrucks.php Military Light Trucks – Olive-Drab]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vanderveen&gt;{{cite book |last=Vanderveen |first=Bart |year=1972 |title=Observer's Fighting Vehicle Directory, WW II |url=https://olive-drab.com/images/id_gmc_ack353_full.jpg |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103073751/https://olive-drab.com/images/id_gmc_ack353_full.jpg |archivedate=2018-03-03 |url-status=live |location=London |publisher=[[Frederick Warne &amp; Co|F. Warne]] |isbn=978-0723214694 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transmission was four-speed manual, combined with a two-speed transfer-case engaging the front axle for all-wheel drive operation.

The truck rode on a {{convert|157+3/4|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase, measuring {{convert|256|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|90|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|117|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} tall – or {{convert|89|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} with the rear top bows taken down.&lt;ref name=Vanderveen/&gt; Tires were 7.50-20, and weight came in at {{convert|7532|lb|abbr=on}}. A special feature were the front hubs, designed to take dual wheels in especially challenging terrain.

Fitted with steel GS bodies with fixed sides and troop seats, the trucks were originally ordered under French contract, but ended up in use by the British Army,&lt;ref name=Vanderveen/&gt; although some 2,000 units delivered to the French in early 1940 likely fell into the hands of the Nazi Germany [[Wehrmacht]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.o5m6.de/wehrmacht_old/gmc_ack353.html Engines of the Wehrmacht – GMC ACK-353, 1.5-ton, 4x4, Cargo Truck]&lt;/ref&gt;

===ACKWX-353===
The ACKWX-353 ('''A''' for 1939 design, '''C''' for conventional cab, '''K''' for all wheel drive, '''W''' for tandem rear axles, and '''X''' for non-standard chassis) three-ton 6x6 truck was the direct predecessor from which the CCKW was developed.&lt;ref name=RedACKWX/&gt; Fitted with the same {{convert|77|bhp|kW}} drivetrain as the ACK, the trucks weighed {{convert|9856|lb|abbr=on}}, and measured {{convert|264|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|94.5|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|118|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} tall / or {{convert|90|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} to cab.&lt;ref name=Vdveenb&gt;{{cite book |last=Vanderveen |first=Bart |year=1972 |title=Observer's Fighting Vehicle Directory, WW II |url=https://olive-drab.com/idphoto/id_photos_gmc_h_early.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917150703/https://olive-drab.com/images/id_gmc_ackwx353_full.jpg |archivedate=2018-03-03 |url-status=live |location=London |publisher=[[Frederick Warne &amp; Co|F.

[[File:G-508_Cargo_17_FT_Body_GMC_AFKWX-353_C.O.E._pic1.JPG|thumb|GMC AFKWX-353 cab-over-engine]]
Some 1,000 of the 3-ton 6x6 trucks were originally contracted by France, but – just like the 4x4 ACK trucks – after the defeat of the French, diverted to Britain in 1940. The British however, deemed the trucks unfavorable for use in the war, due to their long wheelbase and lacking power, and diverted them to Russia in turn, in 1941.&lt;ref name=RedACKWX&gt;[https://www.o5m6.de/redarmy_old/gmc_ackwx353.html Engines of the Red Army in WW2 – GMC ACKWX-353]&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 2,466 ACKWX trucks were built — both according to GMC's serial numbers, as well as the U.S. Army's acceptance figures.&lt;ref name=Sunderlin/&gt;

===AFKWX-353===
The AFKWX ('''A''' for 1939 design, '''F''' for forward cab, '''K''' for all wheel drive, '''W''' for tandem rear axles, and '''X''' for non-standard chassis) 353, a [[cab over|cab over engine]], long cargo bed version of the CCKW, went into production alongside it in 1942 at Yellow’s Pontiac plant and Chevrolet’s in St. Louis. Otherwise mechanically identical, its compact cabin design allowed a {{convert|15|ft|m|2|abbr=on}}, and later {{convert|17|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} cargo bed to be fitted. Only the first 50 units produced had closed cabs, all others were open. None had a front-mounted winch. The [[cab over]] design made engine maintenance difficult. As a result, only 7,235 were built,{{sfnp|Doyle|2003|pp=105-107}}{{sfnp|TM 9-2800|1947|pp=268-269}} – 2,232 units with the 15 ft. body, and 5,000 of the 17 ft. version.&lt;ref name=USAIww2GM/&gt;

[[Image:DUKW.image2.army.jpg|thumb|right|DUKW in use by American troops in France]]

===CCW-353===
The CCW-353 ('''C''' for 1941 design, '''C''' for conventional cab, and '''W''' for tandem rear axles) was a near identical version of the CCKW-353, that lacked its front-wheel drive, resulting in an officially purely on-road, and therefore 5-ton rated, 6×4 version of the same truck. A beam front axle was used, with the transfer case locked in high range. Of the ~118,000 {{frac|2|1|2}}-ton, 6x4 trucks the U.S. built in WW II, GMC contributed 23,649 units of the CCW-353 as standard cargo trucks without winch – almost all of them built in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usautoindustryworldwartwo.com/General%20Motors/gmc.htm The American Automobile Industry in World War Two – GMC (2-1-2019)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===DUKW===
{{Main|DUKW}}
The DUKW ('''D''' for 1942 design, '''U''' for utility, '''K''' for all wheel drive, and '''W''' for tandem rear axles) — popularly the “Duck” – was an amphibious truck that shared the CCKW's driveline, but had a totally different body and structure than all the other trucks. First produced at Yellow’s Pontiac plant, as demand increased production was added to Chevrolet’s St. Louis plant. The hull, designed by an [[America's Cup]] winner, gave the truck respectable sea-keeping capability. A very successful design, 21,147 were built.{{sfnp|TM 9-801|1944|pp=465}}{{sfnp|Doyle|2003|pp=119-121}}{{sfnp|ref=SRATAM4045|Summary Report – Tank-Automotive Materiel|1945|page=86}}

The '''GMC Chevette''' is an [[automobile]] which was manufactured from 1992 to 1995 by [[General Motors do Brasil]] specifically for the [[Argentina|Argentinian]] market, where it was sold by both [[Chevrolet]] and [[Renault]] dealers.&lt;ref name=vauxpedianet&gt;{{cite web | url = http://vauxpedianet.uk2sitebuilder.com/vauxhall-t-car---opel-k180-gmc-chevette-argentina | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171116175010/http://vauxpedianet.uk2sitebuilder.com/vauxhall-t-car---opel-k180-gmc-chevette-argentina | archivedate = 2017-11-16 | title = Vauxhall T car - Opel K180 &amp; GMC Chevette in Argentine | work = vauxpedianet }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the result of a deal having been made whereby Argentinian [[Renault Argentina|CIADEA]]-made [[Renault Trafic]]s were sold as "Chevrolets" in Brazil in return for GM do Brasil being allowed to export Chevettes to Argentina.&lt;ref name=vauxpedianet/&gt;

The Chevette was a variation of the [[GM T platform (1973)|General Motors T-car]] platform which includes [[Opel Kadett#Kadett C .281973.E2.80.931979.29|Opel Kadett]], [[Chevrolet Chevette]] and [[Isuzu Gemini#1974|Isuzu Gemini]]. Offered as a 2-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] and as a 4-door sedan, it was powered by a 1.6-liter [[overhead camshaft]] engine with a 1.8-liter [[Isuzu]] diesel engine available as an option. A [[Pickup truck|pickup]] version of the Chevette was sold as the '''Chevrolet 500'''.&lt;ref name=vauxpedianet/&gt;

The Chevette was the only sedan car to be badged as a [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]]. (In North America, the GMC brand solely marketed light duty and heavy duty trucks until the late 2000s when the company added crossovers.)&lt;ref name="GMC Chevette"&gt;[https://www.carthrottle.com/post/2zlz444/ GMC Chevette.

The '''GMC Typhoon''' is a high-performance [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]], produced from 1991 to 1993 by [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]]. The Typhoon was based on the 1991 [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer|GMC Jimmy]].&lt;ref name= CD92&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Car and Driver]]|volume= 37| number= 9|date= March 1992 |pages= 63–67| title=Road Test: GMC Typhoon| first= Arthur |last= St. Antoine | url= http://sportmachines.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Car-Driver-3-92.pdf| access-date= July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Like the [[GMC Syclone]], the Typhoon is powered by a 4.3 L LB4 V6 engine with unique pistons, main caps, head gaskets, intake manifolds, fuel system, exhaust manifolds, and a 48mm twin bore throttle body from the 5.7 L GM Small-Block engine. With this engine, the Syclone produces {{Convert|280|hp|0|abbr=on}} and 350 lb⋅ft (475 N⋅m) of torque. The engine is a modified version of the Vortec engine found in the standard Jimmy, which originally produced {{Convert|190|hp|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.streetmusclemag.com/features/car-features/musclecars-you-should-know-gmcs-turbo-terrors-typhoon-and-syclone/|title=Muscle Cars You Should Know: GMC Typhoon / Syclone|date=2016-09-19|work=Street Muscle|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine uses a Mitsubishi TD06-17C/8&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; [[turbocharger]] producing 14 psi of boost and a [[Garrett AiResearch|Garrett]] Water/Air [[intercooler]], as well as revised [[intake manifold]]s, fuel system, exhaust manifolds, and a {{Convert|48|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} twin-bore throttle body from the 5.7&amp;nbsp;L [[GM Small-Block engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/classic-cars/a26217/1992-gmc-typhoon-first-drive-flashback/|title=1992 GMC Typhoon: First Drive Flashback|date=2015-07-30|work=Road &amp; Track|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Typhoon sends power to all four wheels through a 4L60 4-speed [[automatic transmission]] and a [[BorgWarner]] 4472 (the Syclone used a BorgWarner 1372){{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} transfer case splitting torque with 35% forward and 65% to the rear wheels.

The '''DUKW''' (colloquially known as '''Duck''') is a six-wheel-drive [[amphibious vehicle|amphibious]] modification of the {{frac|2|1|2}}-ton [[CCKW]] trucks used by the U.S. military during [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]].

Designed by a partnership under military auspices of [[Sparkman &amp; Stephens]] and [[GMC (automobile)|General Motors Corporation]] (GMC), the DUKW was used for the transportation of goods and troops over land and water. Excelling at approaching and crossing beaches in amphibious warfare attacks, it was intended only to last long enough to meet the demands of combat. Surviving DUKWs have since found popularity as tourist craft in marine environments.

==Etymology==
The name '''DUKW''' comes from General Motors Corporation model [[nomenclature]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Michigan Manufacturer and Financial Record|volume=73|year=1944|publisher=Manufacturer Publishing Co.|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''D''', Designed in 1942
* '''U''', [[Utility vehicle|Utility]]
* '''K''', [[All-wheel drive]]
* '''W''', Dual-tandem rear axles

Decades later, the designation was [[backronym|explained erroneously]] by writers such as Donald Clarke, who wrote in 1978 that it was an initialism for "Duplex Universal Karrier, Wheeled".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Donald|title=How It Works: The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Science and Technology|volume=1|year=1978|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LcidHt4zzDgC&amp;pg=PA109 |page=109 |title=Ironsides: Canadian Armoured Fighting Vehicle Museums and Monuments |last=Skaarup |first=Harold A. |publisher=iUniverse |year=2011 |isbn=1462034640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The DUKW was designed by Rod Stephens, Jr. of [[Sparkman &amp; Stephens]], Inc. yacht designers, [[Dennis Puleston]], a British deep-water sailor resident in the U.S., and Frank W. Speir from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foils.org/miami.htm |title=Miami Shipbuilding Corporation |publisher=Foils.org |accessdate=2013-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816122208/http://www.foils.org/miami.htm |archive-date=2014-08-16 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Developed by the [[National Defense Research Committee]] and the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] to solve the problem of resupply to units which had just performed an amphibious landing, it was initially rejected by the armed services. When a [[United States Coast Guard]] patrol craft ran aground on a sand bar near [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], an experimental DUKW happened to be in the area for a demonstration. Winds up to {{convert|60|knots}}, rain, and heavy surf prevented conventional craft from rescuing the seven stranded Coast Guardsmen, but the DUKW had no trouble,{{sfnp|Doyle|2003|pp=119}} and military opposition to the DUKW melted. The DUKW later proved its seaworthiness by crossing the [[English Channel]].

The final production design was perfected by a few engineers at Yellow Truck &amp; Coach in Pontiac, Michigan. The vehicle was built by [[Yellow Coach Manufacturing Company|Yellow Truck and Coach Co.]] ([[GMC (automobile)|GMC Truck and Coach Div.]] after 1943) at their [[Pontiac West Assembly|Pontiac West Assembly Plant]] and [[Chevrolet|Chevrolet Div.]] of [[General Motors|General Motors Corp.]] at their [[St. Louis Truck Assembly|St. Louis Truck Assembly Plant]]; 21,147 were manufactured before production ended in 1945.{{sfnp|Doyle|2003|pp=119}}

==Description==
[[File:Aa edencamp dukw.jpg|thumb|left|DUKW at the [[Eden Camp]] museum, England]]
The DUKW was built around the GMC AFKWX, a [[Cab Over Engine|cab-over-engine]] (COE) version of the [[GMC CCKW]] six-wheel-drive military truck, with the addition of a watertight hull and a propeller. It was powered by a {{convert|269.5|cuin|l|0|abbr=on}} [[GMC Straight-6 engine|GMC]] Model 270 [[straight-six engine]]. A five-speed overdrive transmission drove a [[transfer case]] for the propeller, then a two-speed transfer case to drive the axles. The propeller and front axle were selectable from their transfer case. A [[power take-off]] on the transmission drove an air-compressor and winch.{{sfnp|TM 9-802|1942|pp=3, 8}} It weighed {{convert|13,000|lb|abbr=on}} empty and operated at {{convert|50|mph|km/h}} on road and {{convert|5.5|kn|mph km/h}} on water.&lt;ref name=Friedman2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedman |first=Norman |title=U.S. amphibious ships and craft: an illustrated design history |publisher=Naval Institute Press |year=2002 |series=Illustrated Design Histories |page=218 |isbn=1-55750-250-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=oWX-x0b4pw4C&amp;pg=PA218&amp;lpg=PA218 |accessdate=March 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was {{convert|31|ft|2}} long, {{convert|8|ft|3|in|m|2}} wide, {{convert|7|ft|2|in|m|2}} high with the folding-canvas top down&lt;ref name=Friedman2002/&gt; and {{convert|8|ft|9|in|m|2}} high with the top up.&lt;ref name="USATM"/&gt;[[File:FLMM - DUKW 353 aft.jpg|thumb|Rear view of a DUKW preserved at the Fort Lewis Military Museum, Washington. The propeller tunnel, propeller, and rudder can be seen (2009)]] It was not an armored vehicle, being plated with sheet steel between {{convert|1/16|and|1/8|in|mm}} thick to minimize weight. A high-capacity [[bilge pump]] system kept it afloat if the thin hull was breached by holes up to {{convert|2|in|mm}} in diameter. One in four DUKWs mounted a [[M2 Browning machine gun|{{not a typo|.50-caliber}} Browning heavy machine gun]] on a ring mount.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzsimons, Bernard, general editor. ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons and Warfare'' (London: Phoebus, 1978), Vol. 8, p.802, "DUKW".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--In British service, a Bren is conceivable, but not mentioned.--&gt;

The DUKW was the first vehicle to allow the driver [[Central Tire Inflation System|to vary the tire pressure from inside the cab]]. The tires could be fully inflated for hard surfaces such as roads and less inflated for softer surfaces, especially beach sand.{{sfnp|TM 9-802|1942|pp=8, 24, 35}} This added to its versatility as an amphibious vehicle. This feature is now standard on many military vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ware|first=Pat|title=The Illustrated Guide to Military Vehicles |year=2014|publisher=Hermes House| isbn=978-1-78214-192-1|pp=105, 114, 179, 244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service history==
=== World War II ===
[[File:A British DUKW carries supplies and American paratroopers across the Waal river at Nijmegen, 30 September 1944. B10434.jpg|thumb|A British DUKW carries American airborne troops and supplies across the [[River Waal]] at [[Nijmegen]], 30 September 1944]]
The DUKW was supplied to the U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps and Allied forces, and 2,000 were supplied to Britain under the [[Lend-Lease]] program;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/a-b/battletwo03.html|title=Battle Stations II: The 'Duck'|publisher=Channel 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  535 were acquired by Australian forces,&lt;ref name="dmo2006"/&gt; and 586 were supplied to the Soviet Union, which built its own version, the [[BAV 485]], after the war. &lt;!-- (see [[#Developments|Developments]]).
 --&gt;
DUKWs were initially sent to [[Guadalcanal]] in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]], but were used by an invasion force for the first time in the [[European theatre of World War II|European theater]], during the Sicilian invasion, [[Operation Husky]], in the Mediterranean.

They were used on the [[D-Day]] beaches of [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy]] and in the [[Battle of the Scheldt]], [[Operation Veritable]], and [[Operation Plunder]].

In the Pacific, USMC DUKW's were used to cross the coral reefs of islands such as [[Saipan]] and [[Guam]] and the tires were not affected by the coral.&lt;ref&gt;p. 26 ''The Marines in the Pacific War'' ''The Marine Corps Gazette'', Volume 31 Marine Corps Association, 1947&lt;/ref&gt;

Some DUKWs used in WW2 were reported to have capsized while landing at Omaha beach during the Normandy invasion.&lt;ref name="MurrayMillett2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Williamson Murray|author2=Allan Reed Millett|title=A War To Be Won: fighting the Second World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tdYkMPfUSUAC&amp;pg=PA422|date=30 June 2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-04130-1|pages=422–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collier2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Collier|title=D-Day: June 6, 1944: The Normandy Landings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qEgOkEydIQgC|date=1 November 2002|publisher=Orion Books Limited|isbn=978-0-297-84346-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the war===
After World War II, reduced numbers were kept in service by the United States, Britain, France, and Australia, with many stored pending disposal. Australia transferred many to [[Australian Army Reserve|Citizens Military Force]] units.

The U.S. Army reactivated and deployed several hundred at the outbreak of the [[Korean War]] with the 1st Transportation Replacement Training Group providing crew training. DUKWs were used extensively to bring supplies ashore during the [[Battle of Pusan Perimeter]] and in the [[Battle of Incheon|amphibious landings at Incheon]].

Ex-U.S. Army DUKWs were transferred to the French military after World War II and were used by the [[Troupes de marine]] and [[Naval commandos (France)|naval commandos]]. Many were used for general utility duties in [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas territories]]. France deployed DUKWs to [[French Indochina]] during the [[First Indochina War]]. Some French DUKWs were given new hulls in the 1970s, with the last being retired in 1982.

Britain deployed DUKWs to Malaya during the [[Malayan Emergency]] of 1948–60. Many were redeployed to [[Borneo]] during the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation]] of 1962–66.

===Later military use===
The [[Royal Marines]] used five of these vehicles for training at 11 (Amphibious Trials and Training) Squadron, 1 Assault Group Royal Marines at [[Instow]], North Devon. Four were manufactured between 1943 and 1945. The fifth is a DUKW hull copy manufactured in 1993 with unused World War II-vintage running gear parts.&lt;ref name="janes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.janes.com/articles/jdu99/UK-DUKWS-REFURBISHED-FOR-ROYAL-MARINES.html |title=UK DUKWS Refurbished for Royal Marines, Upgrade Update |author= |date=30 July 1999 |work=Jane's International Defence Review |publisher=Jane's Information Group |accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, a refurbishment programme began to extend their service life to 2014.&lt;ref name="janes" /&gt; DUKWs were removed from service in 2012.

The DUKWs were used for safety, allowing all ranks to undertake training drills for boat work for the landing craft ranks, and drivers undertaking wading drills from the [[Landing Craft Utility]].

===Principal military users===

==Developments==
[[File:DUKW-353_USArmyTransportationMuseum_DSCN7534.JPG|thumb|Superduck prototype]]
In the latter 1940s and throughout the 1950s, while Speir, now project engineer for the Army's Amphibious Warfare Program, worked on "bigger and better" amphibious vehicles such as the "Super Duck", the "Drake", and the mammoth [[LARC-LX|BARC]] (Barge, Amphibious, Resupply, Cargo), many DUKWs were made surplus and used as rescue vehicles by fire departments and Coast Guard stations.

In 1952, the Soviet Union produced a derivative, the [[BAV 485]], adding a rear loading ramp.  The [[ZiL|Zavod imeni Stalina]] factory built it on the structure of its ZiS-151 truck, and production continued until 1962, with over 2,000 units delivered.

==Civilian use==
[[Image:mobyduck.jpg|right|thumb|The "Moby Duck" at a parade in Seattle (2006)]]

Many were used after WWII by civilian organizations such as the police, fire departments, and rescue units.

The Australian Army lent two DUKWs and crew to [[Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions]] for a 1948 expedition to [[Macquarie Island]]. Australian DUKWs were used on Antarctic supply voyages until 1970.&lt;ref name="dmo2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/dmo/news/ontarget/nov06/rw.cfm |title=Remember when&amp;nbsp;... we sent amphibious trucks to the Antarctic? |publisher=Defence Materiel Organisation |date=November 2006 |accessdate=2008-10-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201193633/http://www.defence.gov.au/dmo/news/ontarget/nov06/rw.cfm |archivedate=2008-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1945 to 1965, the Australian Commonwealth Lighthouse Service supply ship ''Cape York'' carried ex-Army DUKWs for supplying [[lighthouse]]s on remote islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Cape Rochon – An Island Light|last=Johnson|first=Erika|publisher=Lighthouses of Australia Bulletin|volume=9|number=2|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One DUKW is in use by the [[Technisches Hilfswerk]] (THW) of [[Germersheim]] in [[Germany]],  a [[Emergency management|civil protection]] organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thw-germersheim.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=230&amp;Itemid=121 |title=Ortsverband Gemersheim |publisher=Thw-germersheim.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourist attractions==
{{Main|Duck tour}}
DUKWs are still in use as [[tourism|tourist]] transport in harbor and river cities across the globe, and have been associated with a number of [[Duck tour#Fatal incidents|fatal accidents]]. The first "duck tour" company was started in 1946&lt;ref name=Wisconsin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinducktours.com/about-us/history/timeline |title=Timeline |publisher=Original Wisconsin Ducks |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Mel Flath in [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin]]. The company is still in operation under the name Original Wisconsin Ducks.&lt;ref name=Wisconsin/&gt;

'''Production Automotive Services, Inc.''' (commonly referred to as '''PAS''') and formally known as '''Prototype Automotive Services''', was a specialty vehicle manufacturer which produced the 1989 [[Pontiac]] Turbo Trans Am, the 1991 [[GMC Syclone]], the 1992 [[GMC Sonoma GT]] and the 1992 - 1993 [[GMC Typhoon]]. These were the only projects PAS created with [[General Motors]] before merging and becoming TDM Technologies in Livonia, MI and Wheel to Wheel in Troy, MI.

==History==
1989 marked the 20th Anniversary for Pontiac's flagship ponycar, the Trans Am, and Bill Owen at Pontiac Motor Division saw to it that it was a special one. Pontiac engineers originally wanted to use an all-aluminum V-8 engine in the TTA. That plan never materialized, so the 3.8L Intercooled Buick Turbo V-6 engine from the [[Buick Grand National]] was chosen and equip with cylinder heads from the existing 3800 Series I V-6, because of their increased clearance at the strut towers and superior flow.&lt;ref name="HRM-IMD"&gt;{{cite web|title=1989 Pontiac Trans Am Turbo Pace Car - Indy Meets Daytona|url=http://www.hotrod.com/cars/featured/hppp-0610-1989-pontiac-trans-am/|publisher=Hot Rod Magazine|author=Thomas A. DeMauro|accessdate=August 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contract to outfit the TTA engine was given to PAS Engineering in Van Nuys, CA  and the work took place in its 40,000-square-foot City of Industry facility. After the engines were completed, they were shipped back to GM, installed in the cars and then returned to PAS for testing and quality-control checks, before being offered to the public for sale. Jeff Beitzel, who was the president of PAS, had his personal 20th Anniversary TTA (one of the 5 pilots cars) sent to [[American Specialty Cars]] (ASC) and made into a convertible.&lt;ref name="HRM-IMD"&gt;{{cite web|title=1989 Pontiac Trans Am Turbo Pace Car - Indy Meets Daytona|url=http://www.hotrod.com/cars/featured/hppp-0610-1989-pontiac-trans-am/|publisher=Hot Rod Magazine|author=Thomas A. DeMauro|accessdate=August 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PAS also made other performance changes, which included the 1LE brake package originally engineered for Trans Am racecars. The setup featured vented 12-inch front and 11.7-inch rear rotors to ensure fade-free performance. The aluminum dual-piston front and single-piston rear calipers were borrowed from the [[Chevrolet Corvette]].&lt;ref name="HRM-TW"&gt;{{cite web|title=Time Warp T/A|url=http://www.superchevy.com/features/0512gm-1989-pontiac-trans-am-turbo-feature/|publisher=Hot Rod Magazine|first=Jim|last=McIlvaine|accessdate=Oct 7, 2005|date=2005-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the project, Scott Kelly, who was the Engineering Liaison of PAS, was instrumental in the development and production of the TTA. Scott served as the go-between for PAS and [[General Motors]] throughout the program and was responsible for the all of the Trans Ams used during the month of May 1989, including the three actual pace cars. After the TTA program, Scott worked as the Service and Warranty Administrator for the TTA, GMC Syclone, Typhoon, Sonoma GT, and natural-gas-powered trucks, that PAS produced until 1994.&lt;ref name="HPP-TTAR"&gt;{{cite web|title=1st Annual 1989 Pontiac Trans Am Turbo Meet - The '89 Pontiac Turbo Trans Am Reunion|publisher=High Performance Pontiac Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 Terrain debuted in April 2009 at the [[New York International Auto Show]], introduced as a replacement for the [[Pontiac Torrent]], which ended production after GM shut down the Pontiac brand in 2010. Although the preceding Pontiac Torrent had the same Theta platform, the Torrent was a [[Badge engineering|rebadged]] version of the original [[Chevrolet Equinox]] from 2005–09, while GM decided to differ the look of the Chevrolet Equinox with its 2010 Terrain and still use the Theta platform. Early 2010 models have the GM Mark of Excellence logo applied on the sides of the vehicle.

For the 2013 model year, the GMC Terrain introduced the [[GMC Denali|Denali]] trim which consists of more chrome trim and slightly improved interior quality, the 3.6L SIDI V6 that is shared with the 2012 Cadillac SRX in place of the optional 3.0L SIDI V6, and firmer front struts. The Denali also offers cross-traffic detection, blind-spot warning and a power passenger seat as options.&lt;ref name="Popular Mechanics"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/reviews/trucks/2013-gmc-terrain-denali-test-drive-9865402?click=pm_latest|title=2013 GMC Terrain Denali|date=June 19, 2012|last=Wilson|first=Kevin|work=[[Popular Mechanics]]|publisher=popularmechanics.com|accessdate=June 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2016, the GMC Terrain received a facelift as part of its first mid-cycle refresh along with the Equinox. The refresh consisted of new front and rear fascias, new grille, a power dome hood, LED daytime running lights, new wheels, a new gear selector, a second storage shelf under the dashboard, as well as deletion of the door lock buttons from the dashboard.&lt;ref name="Auto News"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20150331/OEM03/150339966/gmc-terrain-undergoes-facelift-for-2016|title=GMC Terrain undergoes facelift for 2016|date=March 31, 2015|last=Truett|first=Richard|work=Auto News|publisher=autonews.com|accessdate=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, GMC introduced the Terrain Nightfall edition, which replaces chrome with gloss-black finish on the grille surround, the front and rear fascia accents, the license-plate surround, mirror caps, and roof rack, as well as charcoal grille inserts and darkened headlights pulled from the Terrain Denali. The Terrain Nightfall comes with revised rims with machined faces and black spokes. The Terrain Nightfall trim is available on the SLE-2 and SLT trim levels and is available only in Onyx Black, Summit White, Graphite Gray, and Crimson Red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2016/03/21/gmc-terrain-nightfall-edition-official/ |title=GMC Terrain Nightfall Edition is murdered-out for the masses |work=Autoblog |author=Turkus, Brandon |date=March 21, 2016 |accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [http://www.nat-g.com Nat G CNG Solutions] in Houston, TX and [http://agasystemsinc.com AGA Systems] in Salt Lake City, UT announced that they had begun offering a [[Compressed Natural Gas]] (CNG) version of the Terrain and the [[Chevrolet Equinox|Chevy Equinox]] using the 2.4L Direct Injection engine. The natural gas version is a "bi-fuel" CNG vehicle, meaning it runs on either gasoline or natural gas, giving it extended range. The Terrain/Equinox were the first direct injection natural gas vehicles ever approved by the US EPA.&lt;ref name="Piellisch"&gt;{{cite web|last=Piellisch|first=Rich|title=Nat G CNG for New GM Crossovers|url=http://www.fleetsandfuels.com/fuels/cng/2013/12/nat-g-cng-for-gm-crossovers/|publisher=Fleets and Fuels.com|accessdate=2 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419100215/http://www.fleetsandfuels.com/fuels/cng/2013/12/nat-g-cng-for-gm-crossovers/|archive-date=19 April 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CNG version was available for newly purchased Terrains through select dealers or as a retrofit on 2013 and 2014 models. Nat G CNG Solutions® offered the vehicle in two options: a two-seater "[https://web.archive.org/web/20140825124753/http://www.nat-g.com/nat-g-and-aga-systems-introduce-new-natural-gas-crossover/ cargo version]" and a five-seat "[https://web.archive.org/web/20140825124753/http://www.nat-g.com/nat-g-and-aga-systems-introduce-new-natural-gas-crossover/ passenger version]." The cargo version has an 837-mile combined gasoline / natural gas (9.2 [[Gasoline gallon equivalent|gge]] of CNG) while the passenger version has a 775-mile combined highway range (6.8 [[Gasoline gallon equivalent|gge]] of CNG).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The companies claimed that the natural gas version had tested at the EPA lab at 31 mpg highway on natural gas and had achieved a Bin 3 emissions equivalent to the Toyota Prius.&lt;ref name="Piellisch"/&gt;

Silver Eagle Distributors, L.P., the nation's largest distributor of Anheuser-Busch products,&lt;ref&gt;[[John L. Nau]]&lt;/ref&gt; was the launch customer for the natural gas version with an initial order of up to 100 of the natural gas versions.

The '''GMC Sprint''' is a [[coupe utility]]/[[Pickup truck|pickup]] that was produced by [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] for the 1971–1977 [[model year]]s. The Sprint was renamed '''Caballero''' for the 1978 model year, and produced through 1987. The [[rear-wheel-drive]] car-based pickups were sold by GMC Truck dealers primarily in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] as the GMC version of the [[Chevrolet El Camino]]. Trim designations, emblems, and wheel trim differentiate the GMC from the [[Chevrolet]]. The vehicles were built on the [[GM A platform]] through 1981; for 1982, it was re-designated the [[GM G platform (RWD)|G platform]] as the A platform switched to [[front-wheel drive]].

In 1971 [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] began producing the Sprint, their version of the [[Chevrolet El Camino]]. This light-duty pickup truck was identical to the El Camino except for the name, and the chassis for both cars was based on the [[Chevrolet Chevelle]] station wagon/4-door sedan wheelbase. The Sprint's first year was also the first year for mandated lower-octane unleaded fuel which necessitated a reduction in engine compression; GM's A.I.R. system, a "smog pump", was added to control tailpipe emissions.  1972 was the last year for the third generation El Camino, resulting in a two-year generation for Sprint. For 1972, little changed but for lower power outputs. Engine offerings for 1971–72 included the 250 cubic-inch [[Overhead valve|OHV]] [[Straight-six engine|inline Six]], small block V8s of 307 and 350 cubic inches; and big block [[V8 engine|V8]]s of 402 and 454 cubic-inch displacements. Horsepower ratings of those engines for 1971 ranged from 145 for the six to 365 for the 454—all in gross figures. For 1972, horsepower measurements were switched to the "net" figures as installed in a vehicle with all accessories and emission controllers hooked up—this change brought the horsepower ratings for 1972 down to a range from 110 horsepower (82&amp;nbsp;kW) for the six to 270 for the 454 V8. The Sprint shared exterior and interior trims with the Chevelle Malibu and El Camino including cloth and vinyl or all-vinyl bench seats and deep twist carpeting. All-vinyl Strato bucket seats and center console were optional.

Both the El Camino and Sprint shared the same body styling as the Chevelle from the cowl to the front bumper.  The 1971 models featured the Chevelle's twin parking light lenses, dual "high intensity" headlights and horizontally-divided front grille.  A large "GMC" badge replaced the Chevy bowtie and for models with optional engines, engine badges (depicting cubic inch size), identical to those of the counterpart Chevrolet, were placed just below the divider bar on the left side of the grille.  Both years featured rear end styling taken from the Chevelle station wagon (and were shared with El Camino).

For 1972, the Sprint was given the updated Chevelle front end styling, retaining the "GMC" and optional engine badges in their 1971 locations.

The Sprint has the same design, features, and equipment as the El Camino, with some renamed. It was offered as "Standard" or "Custom". The inline six was only available on the "Standard".  Like the Chevelle and El Camino, the GMC Sprint could be ordered with a standard 3-speed Synchro-Mesh [[manual transmission]], an optional four-speed Synchro-Mesh manual, or the Turbo Hydra-Matic three-speed [[automatic transmission]].  Luxury options, such as air conditioning, cruise control, power windows, and power locks, were also available at extra cost.

====Sprint SP====
The SP package, only offered on the Sprint Custom, was GMC's own equivalent of the Chevrolet SS package. It included the same features as the Chevrolet. The Sprint SP was an option package, RPO YE7, rather than a distinct model. Engines were an L48 350 4 barrel, LS3 400 (402) big block, and the LS5 454 365&amp;nbsp;hp big block.

}}

For 1973, all GM A-body vehicles were redesigned. It was the largest generation of the Sprint, but thanks to lighter construction, it weighed less than the previous generation. Engine offerings during this period included a 250 cubic-inch inline six, as well as a variety of V8s, including the 305, 350 and 400 cubic-inch versions of the Chevy small-block [[V8 engine|V8]], plus the 454 Turbo-Jet big block through 1975. GMC carried over the "Standard" and "Custom" Sprint designations. The inline six was still only available on the "Standard". Catalytic converters were added to all engines beginning with the 1975 model. Other than annual grill revisions and a switch to quad-stacked, rectangular headlights in 1976, the Sprint remained relatively unchanged through 1977, when the "Sprint" name was replaced with "Caballero" for 1978.

====Sprint SP====
The Chevelle SS was dropped after 1973, but the El Camino was one of the few Chevrolet models to retain an SS package. Following suit, GMC continued to offer the Sprint with an SP package, though it was still only available on the Sprint Custom. It no longer included the two fat hood stripes, and the 454 Turbo-Jet big block V8 was discontinued after 1975.

===Nameplate===
The word "[[wikt:caballero|Caballero]]" is from the [[Spanish language]]. Its most common definition today in the Americas is "gentleman", though its technical definition is "horseman" (caballo meaning horse) or "[[knight]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/caballero |title=caballero - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=M-w.com |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are, in turn, related to the English "[[cowboy]]" (though the more appropriate Spanish equivalent of "cowboy" would be [[cowboy|vaquero]], based on "vaca" for "[[cow]]").

GMC's use of a Spanish-derived name was perhaps a response to the El Camino's own borrowing from Spanish colonial history (via the assumed reference to El Camino Real, the "King's Road", lit. "Regal Road"). Until 1979, Ford offered a similar vehicle, the [[Ford Ranchero]], also with a Spanish name ("Rancher"). GMC also offered special trim packages for the Caballero under other Spanish names: Diablo, Laredo, Amarillo. As for the car's old nameplate, GM would later revive the Sprint name for a rebadged [[Suzuki Cultus]] sold under the Chevrolet banner.

===Overview===
The Caballero and the [[Chevrolet El Camino#Fifth generation|fifth generation El Camino]] shared their mechanical parts with the [[Chevrolet Malibu]] series, but rode on a 9-inch longer [[wheelbase]]. Other than different nameplates and minor trim variations, it is difficult to distinguish a Caballero from an El Camino at more than 10 paces distance. It was largely for this reason that the Caballero did not sell in the higher volumes that the El Camino did over the years (many never even knew a GMC version existed), though that rarity now counts as a plus to many Caballero fans and collectors.
Exterior appearance remained largely the same over the truck's nine-year lifespan, with the biggest changes through the years coming mostly in the form of [[grille]] design. From 1978 through 1981, this consisted of either "eggcrate" style (1978), horizontal bars (1979 and 1981) or vertical bars (1980). Then for 1982, the front end was changed to a full-width grille design housing four headlights and a four-row [[crosshatch]] pattern; this persisted through the vehicle's demise in 1987.

Caballero interiors featured a [[bench seat]] in standard models, though an upgrade to [[bucket seat]]s with a center console and floor-mounted shifter was available. Most models with automatic transmission carried the shifter on the [[steering column]]. [[Cloth]] or [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] [[upholstery]] choices were offered in a variety of colors. The instrument panel originally featured a "strip" style of [[speedometer]], with the needle making a long sweep across a horizontal line of numbers to indicate speed. This was changed for 1981 to a more conventional round dial format, with some further minor tweaks for 1986. The 1987 model year was the end of the line for GM's North American coupe utilities, which included 420 leftover El Caminos and 325 Cabelleros that were reported first sold in 1988.

====Laredo and Amarillo====
[[File:1987 GMC Caballero Amarillo, front left.jpg|thumb|left|1987 GMC Caballero Amarillo, the last model year. This front design was used from 1982 until 1987.]]
Offered from 1978 until 1980 only, the Laredo was a Caballero equivalent to the El Camino's luxurious Conquista package. Equipment included two-tone paint in various color combinations and a "Laredo" decal on the tailgate.

For 1981, the Laredo became known as the Amarillo, and this name would continue through 1987. Save for the different name decal on the tailgate, the package was substantially the same. GMC changed this package's name at about the same time as [[Jeep]] began using the "Laredo" name (as a trim level with the 1980 CJ-7) for a variety of special models in their own line - later evolving into a trim package with its XJ Cherokee and the midlevel (later base) trim level with the Grand Cherokee.

====Diablo====
[[File:79 GMC Caballero Diablo (7998313079).jpg|thumb|left|1979 GMC Caballero Diablo]]
The sporty Diablo package began in 1978 as an equivalent to the El Camino's Royal Knight package (which was, in turn, an upgrade from the long-running Super Sport package). Both the Royal Knight and the Diablo carried a hood graphic not unlike that featured on the [[Pontiac Trans Am]]; the Diablo's was in a [[symmetry|symmetrical]] flame pattern that resembled a [[demon]]. Besides the hood accents, Diablo also came with lower-body accent paint, body-color mirrors, black-trimmed window frames, a front [[Spoiler (automotive)|air dam]], color-matched "Rally" steel wheels with trim rings, and a large "Diablo" decal on the tailgate.

When Chevrolet dropped the Royal Knight option from the El Camino option list for 1982, GMC's Diablo remained but was now analogous to the "normal" Super Sport model. This meant that the flame decal was gone, but little else changed. However, when the El Camino Super Sport gained a new dealer optioned aerodynamic front end from Choo Choo Customs for 1984, the Diablo stuck with the same square front end it had carried since 1978. The Diablo was offered through the end of the Caballero line in 1987.

Available Engines: 
•200 CID 2bbl V6 (1978-1979)
•229 CID 2bbl V6 (1980-1981)
•231 CID 2bbl Buick V6 (1978-1981)- for California cars only
•267 CID 2bbl V8 (1979-1981)
•305 CID 2bbl V8 (1978 only)
•305 CID 4bbl V8 (1979-1981)
•350 CID 4bbl V8 (1978-1979)

==Modern revival==

[[Holden]], GM's [[Australia]]n division, has offered coupe-pickup models similar to the Caballero for years under the Ute name. Like the Caballero and El Camino, Holden's Ute is based on a car platform - in this case the long-running [[Holden Commodore|Commodore]] series. Rebadged Holden Utes were offered in [[South Africa]] as Chevrolet El Camino, and later the Lumina Ute.

For the 2008 model year, GM introduced an American version of the Commodore sedan called the [[Pontiac G8]]. Sometime after the announcement of the G8, GM announced that they would also be shipping over a revised version of the Ute. Since Pontiac shares most of its dealerships with GMC franchises, there was wide speculation that the Ute would be rebadged as a GMC (though not necessarily a Caballero or Sprint). However, GM later announced that the new pickup would also be Pontiac-branded, as the G8 ST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lavrinc |first=Damon |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2007/11/19/report-pontiac-g8-will-spawn-wagon-sport-truck/ |title=Report: Pontiac G8 will spawn wagon, sport truck |publisher=Autoblog |date=2007-11-19 |accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, GM announced to dealers the G8 ST was cancelled due to budget cuts and restructuring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20090106/BUSINESS01/90106080/1014|title=GM kills Pontiac G8 Sport Truck|publisher=Freep}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

And still, there was a chance that a coupe - pickup (or rather, a "sedan – pickup") could return to GMC. General Motors executive [[Bob Lutz (businessman)|Robert Lutz]] announced in January 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=GoAutoMedia |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/1E4BE26BBF20920FCA2573D60082231C |title=Future Models |publisher=GoAuto |date=2008-01-21 |accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the division will display a GMC-badged version of the [[Holden Crewman]], a four-door version of the standard Holden Ute pickup, at the New York Auto Show in March. Ultimately, the intended show vehicle eventuated as something quite different, in the GMC Denali XT Hybrid Concept, designed by GM Holden upon the Zeta platform, but bearing no resemblance to existing Holden product ... it debuted at the 2008 Chicago Auto Show, but plans for production based upon this unibody concept were subsequently cancelled circa September 2009.

===Pontiac concept===
In 1974, GMC's sister division, [[Pontiac]], reportedly took an El Camino body, grafted the urethane-nose front end from its Grand Am series, added the Grand Am's instrument panel, Strato bucket seats with recliners and adjustable lumbar support, along with Pontiac's Rally II wheels as a styling exercise for a possible Pontiac version of the El Camino/Sprint. The concept however never reached production.  Another show car version was also created in the late 1970s but never left the concept stage.

The '''GMC Envoy''' is a mid-size SUV that was produced by General Motors. It was introduced for the 1998 model year. After the first generation Envoy was discontinued after the 2000 model year, the Envoy was reintroduced and redesigned for the 2002 model year, and it was available in the GMC line of vehicles from the 2002 to 2009 model years.

The [[Envoy (automobile)|Envoy nameplate]] had previously used by GM in Canada during the 1960s that was sold only at Chevrolet and Oldsmobile dealers.

==1st generation (1998–2000)==
[[File:GMC Jimmy Envoy.jpg|200px|left|thumb|1998–2000 GMC Envoy]]
[[File:1998-2000 GMC Envoy 5.20.18.jpg|200px|left|thumb|1998–2000 GMC Envoy]]
The Envoy first hit dealers' lots in 1997
as a 1998 model. It is similar to the Chevrolet Blazer, GMC Jimmy, Oldsmobile Bravada, and Chevrolet TrailBlazer. The Envoy was discontinued after the 2000 model year and then was reintroduced and redesigned to replace the Jimmy as GMC's new midsize SUV in 2002. The Bravada was redesigned for 2002 and the TrailBlazer was redesigned for 2002 as well. The Blazer 4-door and the Jimmy 4-door were both discontinued after the 2004 model year and the Blazer 2-door and the Jimmy 2-door were both discontinued after the 2001 model year (the Jimmy was discontinued in Canada after the 2005 model-year). Most of the S-10 and Sonoma trucks which share the same chassis were being discontinued during the 2003, and 2004 model years. So both the Jimmy 2-door and the Jimmy 4-door were both discontinued after the 2001 model-year in the United States &amp; Mexico, and then after the 2005 model-year in Canada.

The Envoy had many extra features not available on the regular Jimmy 4-door including: a remote trunk release, heated driver's and passenger's seats, as well as a Bose sound system. Optional features included: a power sunroof, a panic alarm, an anti-theft system, and a power front driver &amp; passenger seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/used/1999/gmc/envoy/7768/standard.html |title=1999 GMC Envoy standard equipment |publisher=Edmunds.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety features===
The 1998-2000 GMC Envoy had a four-wheel ABS braking system standard as well as standard front driver and passenger airbags. However, the Envoy received a Poor rating in the [[IIHS]] frontal offset crash test.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==2nd generation (2002–2009)==
Envoy replaced the Jimmy name in GMC's lineup in early 2001 for the 2002 model year. While it still shared a platform with the [[Chevrolet TrailBlazer]], the exterior styling is different. The interior, however, has a more premium appearance, especially on the SLT trim with optional rear LCD and DVD entertainment. The [[GM Atlas engine#4200|Vortec 4200]] [[straight-6]] engine was rated at {{convert|270|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|275|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}. This smooth, efficient inline 6 engine was duty tested at WOT for 300k miles before being approved for production, almost 3 years before production started in 2002. Hydroformed and a fully boxed frame encompasses the GMT-360 platform and it employs either an AWD or a 4x4 Shift On-Demand electrically actuated system with 2hi, A4wd, 4hi, and a 2.69:1 4lo reduction ratio. Owners can opt for the automatic rear locking Eaton differential or a standard rear Posi-trac LSD. The 4L60e routes power to the back with rear differential gears varying from 3.23-3.42-3.73-4.10. Twintube Bilstein shock absorbers dampen the IFS up front and the 5-link coil sprung rear solid axle or opt for GM's Auto-ride air suspension. While the 2003 model received a small boost to {{convert|275|hp|kW|abbr=on}} this rating grew to {{Convert|291|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the 2006 model year with a redesign of the [[GM Atlas engine|Vortec 4200]]. All models in the line-up have 4-wheel [[disc brakes]]. A [[Displacement on Demand]] 5.3&amp;nbsp;L [[V8 engine|V8]] was optional on the Envoy beginning in 2003. The articulating headrests were discontinued, and made no longer available beginning for the 2003 model year for both the Envoy and the Envoy XL.

===Trim Levels===

Throughout its production run, the Envoy was available in three different trim levels:

The base '''SLE''' trim level was produced from 2002–2009, and included a plentiful amount of standard equipment, including full power equipment (power front seats, power door locks, power windows, and power mirrors), keyless entry, cloth seating surfaces, an A/M-F/M stereo with single-disc CD player (later, with satellite radio), a four-speaker audio system, [[OnStar]], aluminum-alloy wheels, a full-size spare tire with black-painted steel spare wheel, a 65/35 split-folding rear bench seat, faux carbon fiber interior trim panels, a cruise control, a dual-zone, manual climate control system, the 4.2L [[Vortec]] Inline Six-Cylinder (I6) gasoline engine, and a four-speed automatic transmission. Optional features included an in-dash, six-disc CD changer, a [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] six-speaker premium amplified audio system, a rear DVD entertainment system by [[Panasonic]], a security system, polished aluminum-alloy wheels, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces, dual heated front bucket seats, and a power moonroof. 

The uplevel '''SLT''' trim level, available from 2002–2009, added extra luxury and convenience features to the base '''SLE''' trim, including a six-disc, in-dash CD changer, a Bose six-speaker premium amplified audio system, [[OnStar]], polished aluminum-alloy wheels, luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces, dual heated front bucket seats, Driver Information Center, faux wood interior trim panels, a universal garage door opener system with a travel note recorder, a dual-zone, automatic climate control system, and a driver's memory system for driver's seat, mirrors, and radio preset settings. Optional features included an in-dash, touchscreen GPS navigation system (later models), a rear DVD entertainment system by [[Panasonic]], and a power moonroof.

The top-of-the-line '''Denali''' trim level, available from 2005–2008, was the most luxurious trim level of the Envoy, adding additional luxury features to the already luxurious '''SLT''' trim. Additional features included additional faux wood interior trim accents, a two-tone, luxury leather-trimmed interior, a 'Denali' emblem for the steering wheel, the 5.3L [[Vortec]] V8 gasoline engine, a power single-pane moonroof, unique chrome-plated aluminum-alloy wheels, satellite radio, and a chrome mesh front upper grille. Additional options included an in-dash, touchscreen GPS navigation system and a rear DVD entertainment system. 

The Envoy was ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Car of the Year|Sport/Utility of the Year]] for 2002. The 4200 [[GM Atlas engine|Vortec 4200 engine]] I6 engine was named one of ''Ward's 10 Best Engines'' from 2002 to 2005.

===Engines===
* 2002–2009 [[GM Atlas engine#LL8|LL8]] 4.2&amp;nbsp;L (256&amp;nbsp;in³) [[Straight-six engine|I6]]
* 2003–2004 [[GM small-block engine#5300|5300]] [[GM small-block engine#5300|LM4]] 5.3&amp;nbsp;L (323&amp;nbsp;in³) [[V8 engine|V8]] (Only available in Envoy XLs and XUVs)
* 2005–2009 [[GM small-block engine#LH6|5300]] [[GM small-block engine#5300|LH6]] 5.3&amp;nbsp;L (323&amp;nbsp;in³) [[V8 engine|V8]] with [[Displacement on Demand]]

===2003===
During this year, [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] detached many options from packages in order for customers to save money. Additionally, the I6 engine received a small increase of {{convert|5|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. For the XL model, a new engine was introduced, a [[GM small-block engine#5300|5.3 Liter V8]] with {{convert|290|hp|0|abbr=on}}. Other notable changes included making front side-impact airbags previously standard on the 2002 model, optional, recreating the headlight switch to allow a [[Daytime running lights|Daytime Running Lamp]] (DRL) off switch, and also increasing the fuel tank to {{convert|22|USgal|L|0}}. Articulating headrests are no longer available.

===2004===
Not many changes were made to any of the models this year. The only changes included the added feature of optional adjustable pedals, optional [[XM radio|XM Satellite Radio]], and an optional DVD-based navigation system.

===2005===
[[File:GMC Envoy Denali -- 08-21-2009.jpg|200px|right|thumb|GMC Envoy Denali]]In 2005, a Denali [[luxury SUV|luxury]] version of the Envoy became available. Both the standard-length wheelbase Envoy as well as the Envoy XL were available with the Denali trim option. The Envoy Denali features the hallmark bullet pattern grille and an upgraded interior with high-end car-like features such as heated power seats, extensive woodgrain trim, and rain-sensing windshield wipers. It also featured the GM Vortec [[GM small-block engine#5300|5.3 liter V8]] engine with "Displacement on Demand," shutting off four of the eight cylinders when workload was minimal. Prices for the Envoy Denali ranged from US$37,145 to $42,750; prices for the Envoy XL Denali ranged from $38,575 to $43,895.

Across the range, seating was restyled in hopes to increase comfort and quality of control of driving position. Additionally, a touch DVD navigation system was offered as an option. The option of side airbags evolved from previously just front-seat side-impact airbags to full-length side curtain airbags, covering both rows of seats (in the XL model, all three rows).

===2006===
[[File:06-08 GMC Envoy.jpg|200px|right|thumb|2006–2009 Envoy]]
For 2006, GMC added standard stability control, called "[[Stabilitrak]]," as well as standard cruise control, [[OnStar]], and a [[tire pressure monitoring system]]. For the Denali, new 18-inch alloy wheels were introduced.

The Envoy XL, and the Envoy XL Denali were both discontinued after the 2006 model-year when the Oklahoma City plant closed on February 20, 2006. It was replaced by the [[GMC Acadia|Acadia]] crossover SUV in 2007, and the Acadia Denali in 2011.
===2007=== 
No changes except that the Envoy XL was no longer available.

===2008===
For 2008 side-curtain [[airbag]]s were made standard as well was [[XM radio|XM Satellite Radio]] and [[Bluetooth]] wireless technology for wireless phones.

===Recall===

In 2012, [[General Motors]] had recalled more than 258,000 SUVs in the U.S. and Canada to fix short-circuits in power window and door lock switches that could cause fires. The recall covered Chevrolet TrailBlazer, GMC Envoy, [[Buick Rainier]], [[Isuzu Ascender]] and [[Saab 9-7X]] SUVs from the 2006 and 2007 model years. The SUVs were sold or registered in 20 U.S. states, Washington, D.C., and Canada, where salt and other chemicals are used to clear roads in the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GM recalls SUVs for fire hazard|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/18/business/gm-recall/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Variants ===

====Envoy XL====
[[File:GMC-Envoy-XL.jpg|225px|right|thumb|GMC Envoy XL]]The Envoy was also offered with an extended wheelbase to increase accommodation of more cargo and/or passengers. The Envoy XL was the full-size counterpart to the five-passenger mid-size Envoy. One unique element of the Envoy XL was the availability of a usable third row that was comfortable for a {{Convert|6|ft|m|2|sing=on}} passenger. This vehicle is 16&amp;nbsp;in (406&amp;nbsp;mm) longer and has a higher roofline to allow easier access to the third row of seats. This roof is disguised by standard roof racks. The Envoy XL was longer than the short-wheelbase [[Chevrolet Tahoe|Yukon]].

The XL model was produced on the [[Oklahoma City Assembly]] plant in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]].

====Envoy XUV====
[[File:GMC Envoy XUV .jpg|200px|right|thumb|GMC Envoy XUV]]
The five-passenger '''Envoy XUV''', introduced for 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2002-to-2009-gmc-envoy-7.htm|title=2002-2009 GMC Envoy: Year-to-Year Changes|date=November 13, 2010|work=Consumer Guide|publisher=HowStuffWorks.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910054239/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2002-to-2009-gmc-envoy-7.htm|archivedate=September 10, 2011|accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an attempt to create a combination of pickup truck and SUV. It featured a retractable rear roof section that slid forward, giving an open-topped load area. A 'MidGate' could be raised to partition the load area off from the passenger compartment; this was a solid, waist-height plastic-lined panel and with a retractable glass partition for the top half. The two-way tailgate could either hinge sideways or drop down; the tailgate glass retracted into the solid tailgate. The cargo area was waterproofed and fitted with a drainage system, allowing it to be easily hosed down  for cleaning.mommyoulhhh

The advantage of the Envoy XUV over a [[pickup truck]] or a more truck-like configuration such as the [[Chevrolet Avalanche]] (which originated the MidGate feature) is that with retractable roof and rear glass closed, the cargo area is sealed, full roof height and lockable, thus making it an enclosed SUV. The disadvantages include a much shorter cargo bed area and breakable side glass. The Envoy XUV's retractable roof was reminiscent of the [[Studebaker Wagonaire]] of the 1960s, while other features such as the 'MidGate' were similar to those of the [[GMC Terracross]] concept SUV.

Envoy XUV sales, projected at 30,000 per year (approximately a third of Envoy production), were much slower with just over 12,000 sold in 2004. GM discontinued XUV production on March 15, 2005.

==Discontinuation of the GMC Envoy==
The Envoy (along with the [[Chevrolet TrailBlazer]]-[[Saab 9-7X]]-[[Buick Rainier]]-[[Isuzu Ascender]]) were phased out during the 2009 model year.  GM closed the Moraine, Ohio plant on December 23, 2008, ending production of all [[GMT360]] products. The final Envoy rolled off the assembly line when the Moraine, Ohio plant shut down. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/car-news/gm-shut-ohio-suv-plant-2-years-ahead-plan|title=GM to shut Ohio SUV plant 2 years ahead of plan |publisher=Autoweek.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The closing of the last factory that manufactured the trucks was the subject of an emotional 2009 HBO documentary: ''[[The Last Truck: Closing of a GM Plant]]''.

It is unknown if the Envoy name will return should the [[Chevrolet TrailBlazer#Second generation (2012-present)|second generation of the TrailBlazer]] go on sale in the North American market.

The '''GX-2''' (Greyhound Experimental #2 – The Scenicruiser) was a prototype bus built for [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] that would eventually be developed into the [[PD-4501 Scenicruiser|Scenicruiser]].

After Greyhound's initial experiences with GX-1, the 50-seat double-decked bus, Greyhound President Orville Caesar decided that the next prototype would be a deck-and-a-half style. This decision resulted in the iconic silhouette of the Scenicruiser. It began in mid-1948 as a 35-foot design, but, in part, to accommodate more passengers, he directed his engineering department, which had obtained from GM a PD-3751,&lt;ref name=", Chicago, Illinois: 1954,  p. 4."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sills|first1=Joseph|title=The Two Level Intercity Coach|journal=Presented to the Society of Automotive Engineers National Transportation Meeting, The Sheraton Plaza, Boston, Massachusetts, October 18–20|date=1954|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; to add five feet in length to the upper deck.

==Design==
The design, introduced to Greyhound's executives in the fall of 1948, was "a coach with an observation dome following somewhat the general idea of the astrodome cars recently put in service by some of the railroads."&lt;ref name=MGE&gt;{{cite journal|title=Meeting of Greyhound Executives September 13 and 14|journal=Laurence A. Rossman Papers|date=1948|volume=Minnesota Historical Society|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Or, as Orville Caesar later summarized, "the observation dome model coach is basically a Silversides coach with a dome and the Model GX-1 front end added."&lt;ref name=MGE/&gt;

Unlike GX-1, the design patent for GX-2 did not name [[Raymond Loewy]]. Albert Boca, the patent holder, was a GM designer, as the 1941 Pontiac, Michigan, city directory reveals. The design patent D160059,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boca|first1=Albert|title=Google Patents|url=https://www.google.com/patents/USD160059|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; submitted and granted in 1950, was assigned to General Motors. 
The GX-2 was built by Greyhound engineers and mechanics in the Chicago plant of Greyhound Motors &amp; Supply Company with the active cooperation of Raymond Loewy Associates, industrial designers, and the styling section of [[General Motors]] Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Scenicruiser|journal=Mass Transportation|date=August 1949|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing==
Greyhound, from the GX-1 testing, had determined the value of a dual-engine approach as well as air leveling and shock absorption, so the focus for the GX-2 was on style and function, using a standard coach and increasing its height and length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sills|first1=Joseph|title=The Two Level Intercity Coach|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Constructed during 1948 and early 1949, it was revealed to the public on July 1, 1949, as the Greyhound Scenicruiser. It toured the country for testing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Test runs started on a 43 passenger bus with a raised dome at the rear|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 10, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; and refinements, in addition to encouraging the remaining state legislatures to pass 40-foot bus-length laws, during the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The First Greyhound Scenicruiser - GX-2 Film|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZDs_lBxMSQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; By June 1950, it had visited 46 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scenicruiser Bus is Displayed Here|date=June 6, 1950|page=2|newspaper=Janesville Daily Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The coach was 40 feet long, eight feet wide and almost 11 feet tall. It weighed 26,100 unloaded and 34,485 loaded. Unlike the future Scenicruiser, the GX-2 had its driving wheels at the very back of the coach. The intermediate tag axle, also called the dead axle, differed in having two wheels instead of four later.

The bus seated 10 on the lower deck and 33 on the top deck. One of its most striking design improvements was that the passengers in the rear compartment "... are seated in a raised dome with a wide windshield curved around the entire forward section to give an unobstructed view of the road ahead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Greyhound Bus Allows Rider To See Over Top|page=1|newspaper=The Weimar (Texas) Mercury|date=July 1, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six upper-level skylights provided illumination from the windshield to the rear, which had windows in the roof at the sides in a U-shaped configuration around the top back of the bus. A leather seated lounge provided a table for playing cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Greyhound Bus Last Word in Comfort, Luxury|date=May 16, 1950|page=10|newspaper=Helena (Montana) Independent Record}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new bus had many innovative features for the time, including a "... washroom and toilet facilities and a public address system designed both for announcements by the driver and for the playing of tape-recorded music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greyhound Line's New Cruiser To Be Displayed Here|page=11 |newspaper=The (Pittsfield, Massachusetts) Berkshire Evening Eagle|date=October 8, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; It even increased both heating and cooling temperatures automatically by four degrees when the headlights were turned on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greyhound ‘Scenicruiser’ Features an Unusual Air Conditioning System|page=104|publisher=Heating, Piping &amp; Air Conditioning|date=November 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engine==
The engine was the [[General Motors Diesel Division|GM Diesel]] 6-71 (426 cubic inches, 220 horsepower @ 2000 r.p.m.). Mounted transversely at the rear with three rubber mounts, it connected via angle drive to the rear axle through a 4-speed transmission. During the testing time, Greyhound added a two-speed clutch which became part of the original PD-4501 in 1954. The diesel also drove the hydraulic fluid pump, the alternator and a cooling fan. The hydraulic system operated the steering gear, but unlike the 4501 to come, it also worked the brakes and the six&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=General Specifications and Description of Greyhound 'Scenicruiser' Experimental Coach Model GX-2|journal=The Greyhound Corporation|date=July 15, 1949|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  windshield wipers. The seven gallons of fluid were pumped at a rate of 11 gallons per minute and generated a maximum pressure of 1500 PSI, with 900 PSI the norm. The muffler was mounted behind the rear bumper and the radiator was on the left rear side.

==Final design==
After two to three years of testing, Greyhound and GM finalized the design of the Scenicruiser that would enter service in July 1954. GX-2 went into Greyhound service around 1952 with [[Great Lakes Greyhound Lines]] (GLGL), running as G-7483 until around 1957. It was leased to the [[Ralph Marterie]] Orchestra for several years, and then sold by Greyhound to Sterling Stages of Warren, Ohio, which used it for charters. They in turn sold it to the [[Blue Ridge Quartet]]. From there, it disappeared and the first of the iconic Scenicruisers, the only hand-built example, was most likely scrapped near Nashville, Tennessee.

The '''GMC Denali''' nameplate is used by [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] on its top-of-the-line trucks and [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]]s in the line-up. Vehicles with the Denali trim option carry [[list price]]s up to 47% higher than those of the regular models. Prices range from $40,240 for [[GMC Terrain]] to (as of 2016) $81,270 for a top-of-the-line [[Chevrolet Suburban|Yukon XL Denali]]. The Denali nameplate is often used as an insignia or status symbol, and in particular is popular as a less costly alternative to the [[Cadillac Escalade]]. The Yukon Denali line typically represents 40% of Yukon sales in both units and dollars. In 2013 it sold more than 75,558 units of the Denali brand, which accounted for 20% of GMC's sales, making it one of GM's most successful sub-brands, all done without any advertising or promotion whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2014/02/28/gmc-denali-offerings-cash-cow-sales-up/ "GMC's Denali offerings are going great guns"] from Autoblog (February 28, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Denali]] nameplate started as the top-of-the-line version of the [[Chevrolet Tahoe|GMC Yukon]] for the 1999 model year. It was also GM's first attempt to go after sales from the new-for-1998 [[Lincoln Navigator]]. At the time of its introduction [[General Motors]] decided to give [[Cadillac]] its own luxury SUV so the Denali's exterior was shared with the 1999 [[Cadillac Escalade]], with only the front fascia and lower side body panels differing from the standard Yukon. Even though the Yukon was redesigned alongside the [[Chevrolet Suburban]] and [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] in 2000, the Denali, Escalade, and Tahoe Limited/[[Z71]] retained their 1990s base design.

The "Denali" moniker is derived from the name for the traditional, native name of [[Denali|the tallest mountain in North America]], and is also the name of the [[Denali National Park and Preserve|national park]] that surrounds the mountain, as well as a [[Denali State Park|state park]].

==1999&amp;ndash;2000==
In 1999 at the time of its introduction the [[Chevrolet Tahoe|Yukon Denali's]] exterior, which it later shared with the 1999 [[Cadillac Escalade]], differed from the standard Yukon in the front fascia and lower side body panels as well as having unique 16" DICKIE polished aluminum wheels and a special exhaust cutout for a right side-exiting cast exhaust tip. The interior of the Denali also featured several upgrades not available on the mainstream Yukon. These standard features included an upgraded Nuance leather interior, driver and passenger 6-way power seats with power lumbar support, front and rear heated seats, a [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] 7 speaker (including subwoofer) audio system, an in-dash cassette, single CD player and an in-console 6-disc CD changer. The Denali also didn't have a continuous door buzzer, instead it had an actual chime that would later be used in the 2001-2002 Tahoe and Yukon. Zebrano woodgrain accents decorated the front doors and center console. The front and rear doors featured unique "Yukon Denali" stitching in the panels.

The 350 cubic inch 5.7-litre 255 horsepower (L31) [[V8 engine|V8]] was the only engine offered. RPO ZM9 was standard which included Bilstein 46mm shock absorbers and 3.73 front and rear axle ratios as well as a locking rear differential. Separate coolers for the transmission and engine oil were also standard. The Denali upgrade also included GM's automatic transfer case which allowed for push button transitions from 2-wheel high to 4-wheel high to 4 wheel low or fully automatic switching from 2 wheel drive to 4 wheel drive.

==2001&amp;ndash;2006==
Even though the [[Chevrolet Tahoe|GMC Yukon]] was redesigned alongside the [[Chevrolet Suburban]] and [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] in 2000, the Denali and Escalade retained their 1990s base design. It was not until 2001 that the Denali was redesigned. GMC also introduced the extended-length (Suburban-based) Yukon XL Denali. Embossed side body panels and chrome surrounding the headlights differentiate the Yukon Denali from the regular Yukon. 2001 also saw the introduction of the honeycomb pattern grille which now has become the hallmark of the Denali nameplate. 2001 saw the introduction of the 6.0L V8 application in the standard-size Yukon in the Denali trim for $45,000.00 which it also shared with the Cadillac Escalade. The engine produced 320&amp;nbsp;hp upon its introduction, then was upgraded to 325&amp;nbsp;hp in 2003. 2001 also introduced a new upgraded interior and new options such as 20-inch wheels.

The previous (for 2001 only) ''C3'' model of the [[Chevrolet Silverado|GMC Sierra]] [[pickup truck]] was renamed ''Denali'' in late 2001 as a 2002 model.  The 2002–2004 Sierra Denali was equipped standard with a 325&amp;nbsp;hp 6.0[[Liter|L]] V8, all-wheel-drive, and [[Quadrasteer]], the 4-wheel steering system developed by General Motors.

For 2005-2006 and 2007, "Classic body style" Sierra Denalis were equipped with a 6.0L 345 HP V8. Additionally the trucks from 2005-2007 (2007 being classic body style) were changed to a crew cab with a 5'8" bed and did not have Quadrasteer as the 2001-2004 Sierra Denalis had.

==2007==
In 2007 the GMC Yukon and Sierra lines were completely revamped with the Denali included, now with a 6.2L V8 (producing 380 HP / 417&amp;nbsp;lb/ft) in the Yukon Denali and (producing 403 HP/ 417&amp;nbsp;lb/ft) in the Sierra Denali), six-speed automatic transmissions, and many new features and options such as power folding second row seats and rear backup camera. Styling was also changed, particularly the controversial grill and headlights, which made the Yukon look much less aggressive than any previous models. The MSRP's of the 2007 models were not increased.

==2008==
In 2008 there were few small changes such as the gauge cluster on Sierra Denali.

==GMC Denali XT concept (2008)==
[[File:GMC_Denali_XT_NY.jpg|thumb|GMC Denali XT concept photographed at the 2008 [[New York Auto Show]].]]
The [[GMC Denali XT]] is a concept hybrid pickup truck with unibody design using Zeta platform. It included 8.1L SIDI V-8 with Active Fuel Management engine rated {{convert|326|hp}} with E85 ethanol-capability and direct-injection, two-mode hybrid propulsion system, 23-inch aluminum wheels with [[Kumho Tires|Kumho]] 255/35/R23 front and [[Kumho Tires|Kumho]] 285/35/R23 tires, height-adjustable suspension, {{convert|1100|lb}} payload and {{convert|3500|lb}} towing capacities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2008/02/02/chicago-2008-gmc-denali-xt-four-door-flex-fuel-hybrid-ute/ Chicago '08 Preview: GMC Denali XT: Four-door, flex-fuel, hybrid Ute!]&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle was designed by GM's Australian design studios.

The vehicle was unveiled in 2008 Chicago Auto Show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2008/02/06/chicago-2008-gmc-denali-xt-concept-is-ute-ifu/ Chicago 2008: GMC Denali XT Concept is ute-iful]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[General Motors]] planned for a production version based on Epsilon II platform, it was reported the company cancelled the plan because the unibody design would not give much of an efficiency boost while losing capability for which buyers were willing to pay a premium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2009/09/21/report-gm-kills-plans-for-unibody-pickup-truck/ REPORT: GM kills plans for unibody pickup truck]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.pickuptrucks.com/2009/09/report-gm-nixes-unibody-pickup.html Report: GM Nixes Unibody Pickup Plan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==2009==
In 2009, minor changes were made to the Yukon Denali. These changes include 403HP instead of 380HP, Cooled and perforated leather seats (optional), [[Bluetooth]] Handsfree calling standard, and flat chrome insert/body colored bodyside moldings. Also a power tilt steering wheel is now standard. The Satellite Navigation System (optional) now has the added features of instant traffic updates, and re-routing options. Side Zone Blind Spot Alert is now optional.

==2010==
The [[GMC Acadia]] was added to the Denali lineup as a 2011 model.

==2012==
The GMC Terrain was added to the Denali lineup as a 2013 model.

==2014&amp;ndash;present==
GMC unveiled its next generation Denalis, beginning with a newly redesigned Sierra pickup for the 2014 model year in 2013, followed by the launching of the 2015 Yukon and Yukon XL SUVs in February 2014.

The GMC Canyon was added to the Denali lineup as a 2017 model.

The '''Chevrolet''' and '''GMC B series''' is a series of cowled chassis that were produced by [[General Motors]], primarily fitted with [[school bus]] bodies throughout its production.  Based on the medium-duty (Class 6-7) trucks produced by the Chevrolet and GMC divisions of General Motors, the B series was produced in three separate generations; GMC initially produced its own version separate from Chevrolet.   Introduced in 1966, the B series was redesigned in 1984 and 1992 as a 1993 model.

Following the end of a supply agreement with [[Blue Bird Corporation]], effectively leaving General Motors without a body manufacturer with which to supply chassis, the company exited production of full-size bus chassis, producing the later GMT560 solely as a cutaway-cab vehicle.  The [[Blue Bird Vision]] entered production in 2004, becoming the first conventional-style school bus produced without a second-party chassis.

As of 2017, General Motors remains a supplier of bus chassis for school bus and commercial bus use.  Currently, all examples are [[cutaway van chassis]] based on the GMT610 architecture (Chevrolet Express/GMC Savana).

== Background ==
Prior to 1966, all medium- and heavy-duty trucks of General Motors were derived heavily from the [[Chevrolet C/K|C/K series]] trucks (and the [[Chevrolet Task Force|Task Force]] trucks before them).  Although using a stronger frame and suspension, much of the bodywork was shared.  With the exception of divisionally-produced engines, the Chevrolet and GMC medium-duty trucks were largely identical to one another.  Consequently, the conventional-type school bus chassis used for both divisions were largely the same.

==First generation (1966–1983) ==

For 1966, GMC ended the use of a shared conventional bus chassis as it debuted its own version derived from its H-series heavy truck line; Chevrolet debuted its own design in 1967, derived from the C/K medium-duty line.  For 1971, both divisions consolidated conventional bus production solely to the C/K chassis.

For 1973, General Motors redesigned the entire C/K truck line, ranging from half-ton pickups to medium-duty trucks.  As Chevrolet and GMC had only adopted the C/K chassis together in 1971, GM would continue the production of the 1967-generation chassis for another decade.  After 16 years as a Chevrolet and 12 years of production as a GMC, the first-generation C/K bus chassis was retired after 1983.

=== Chevrolet (1967–1983)  ===
In 1967, Chevrolet moved the medium-duty C/K to a dedicated chassis, taking the school bus chassis with it.  As with the previous generation, the design was a rear-hinged "alligator"-design hood.  The division offered its conventional school bus chassis with Chevrolet-produced engines, including the 250 inline-6 (replaced by the 292 inline-6), 366 V8, and 427 V8.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;https://www.gmheritagecenter.com/docs/gm-heritage-archive/historical-brochures/GMC/100_YR_GMC_HISTORY_MAR09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In both Chevrolet and GMC school buses, the Allison AT475 3-speed automatic transmission became an option in 1971 with single or two-speed rear axles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1974, the powertrain lineup was modified, as all GMC-built engines were dropped (alongside all diesel engines).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In 1980, a diesel engine made its return as Detroit Diesel introduced an 8.2L  V8.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Dubbed the "Fuel Pincher", it was the first four-stroke engine produced by the company; the engine was available in naturally-aspirated and turbocharged forms.

In 1966, the GMC division moved its school bus chassis from the medium-duty C/K to the all new H6500 heavy truck. A forerunner of both the [[GMC Brigadier]] and [[GMC General]], the H-series trucks featured an all-steel [[Fascia (car)|front fascia]] with a center-hinged "butterfly" hood for engine access.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Alongside GMC V6 and V8 gasoline engines, GMC school bus chassis were available with Detroit Diesel 6V53 V6 diesels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://67-72chevytrucks.com/vboard/showthread.php?t=514312|title=1966-81 Chevy H/J Series - The 1947 - Present Chevrolet &amp; GMC Truck Message Board Network|website=67-72chevytrucks.com|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, GMC transitioned its medium-duty trucks to the Chevrolet-based C/K medium-duty chassis introduced in 1967.  The heavy-duty GMC school bus chassis remained in use by the division for 1970, before both divisions consolidated designs for 1971.

While General Motors redesigned its entire light and medium-duty C/K truck line for 1973, Chevrolet and GMC retained the previous-generation cowled bus chassis for nearly another decade.  For 1984, a second generation was introduced, consolidating conventional trucks and cowled bus chassis for the first time.  Codenamed B6, the redesign was again shared by both Chevrolet and GMC, differing only in grille design.  From the drivers' compartment, the B6 chassis shared the steering column with its predecessor (with nearly the same instrument panel).  

In a major design change, the rear-hinged hood was replaced by a standard front-hinged tilting hood, allowing improved engine access.  The 6.0L (366) and 7.0L (427) V8 engines made their return, along with the 8.2L Detroit Diesel "Fuel Pincher" V8.  In 1990, the 8.2L engine was discontinued.    

In 1985, General Motors developed a modified version of the B series for [[Ward Body Works]] as a chassis for the Ward Patriot school bus.  To allow for a shortened hood (to improve driver visibility), the front chassis of the C/K conventional was shortened for a configuration similar to that of the smaller Chevrolet/GMC P-chassis.  The "semi-forward control" design would be developed further by GM with the [[Thomas Vista]], another bus that would use a GM B-series chassis during its production.

For 1990, General Motors introduced its GMT530 medium-duty truck platform as the [[Chevrolet Kodiak|Chevrolet Kodiak/GMC TopKick]], replacing the previous trucks of that nameplate, the GMC Brigadier, and the medium-duty C/K product lines. B series based on the GMT530 entered production for 1992, as a 93 model year. As with its predecessor, the chassis was shared between Chevrolet and GMC, with only the grill differentiating the two.

The GMT530 B series was powered by a range of gasoline and diesel engines.  As gasoline engines were being phased out of school buses during the 1990s, the B series became the last full-size school bus to offer them, with a 6.0L (366 cubic inch) V8 as standard.  As the Kodiak/TopKick was renamed the C series in 1997, the 6.0L V8 was eventually phased out in favor of the Vortec 7.4L V8; the 7.4L V8 was replaced by an 8.1L Vortec V8 (one of the largest gasoline engines ever used in a school bus) in 2001.  The Caterpillar 3116 was the first diesel engine option, joined by the turbocharged [[Caterpillar 3126]] in 1997.  Along with Allison automatic transmissions, the GMT530 B series was available with either 5- or 6-speed manual transmissions.

The last manufacturer to offer a gasoline engine in a conventional-chassis school bus (prior to its reintroduction in 2016 in the Blue Bird Vision), a number of GM gasoline school buses were converted to use alternative fuels, including LPG (propane) and CNG (compressed natural gas).  When GM replaced the GMT 530 series of medium duty conventionals with the GMT 560 series in 2003, no direct replacement for the B series was offered.  However, the GMT560 would see use for bus builders with [[Cutaway van chassis|cutaway cab]] buses in many forms, alongside those based on the [[Freightliner Business Class M2|Freightliner M2]] and [[Ford F-650|Ford F-650 Super Duty]].

===Blue Bird CV200===
Prior to 1992, the B-series chassis was available to any school bus manufacturer.  That year, GM and [[Blue Bird Corporation|Blue Bird]] signed a supply and marketing agreement, with the latter company becoming the exclusive supplier of the then-new GMT530 bus chassis for the next 10 years.  The resulting model was named the CV200; while the GM B-7 (internal name for the GMT530-based bus chassis) was standard, [[Navistar International]] and [[Ford]] (later, [[Freightliner Trucks|Freightliner]]) chassis were available as options.

Along with the 1991 Navistar acquisition of [[AmTran]], the agreement was a part of a series of mergers and acquisitions in the school bus industry between body manufacturers and chassis suppliers, eventually crippling the market share of General Motors as a chassis supplier as the agreement was not renewed.  Effectively shut out of the industry as a full-size chassis supplier, General Motors ended chassis production in 2002 (2003 model) to concentrate on cutaway-chassis buses.

==Usage by body manufacturers==
While used nearly exclusively for school bus use, the B-series chassis was adapted for a wide variety of uses by body manufacturers, ranging from bookmobiles to police buses.  In the school bus industry, the General Motors chassis was popular for its wide range of engines.  During the 1980s and 1990s, its continued use of gasoline engines remained popular, as the powerplants were sometimes used as the basis for conversion to alternative fuels, including LPG (propane) and CNG (compressed natural gas).

Following the chassis and supply agreement between General Motors and Blue Bird in 1992, the B series was bodied exclusively by that company, nearly exclusively as a school bus.

The '''[[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] PD-4501 Scenicruiser''', manufactured by General Motors for [[The Greyhound Corporation]], was a  [[Three axle bus|three-axle]] [[monocoque]] two-level [[Coach (vehicle)|coach]] used by Greyhound from July 1954 into the mid-70's. 1,001 were made between 1954 and 1956.

The Scenicruiser became an [[cultural icon|icon]] of the [[American way of life]] due to its presence throughout the US in cities and along [[highways]] and popularity with the traveling public. The name was a [[portmanteau]] of the words "scenic" and "cruiser".

The high-level design concept of Scenicruiser resembles some of the rolling stock of the passenger-carrying [[railroad]]s of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], particularly their popular stainless steel [[dome car]]s. This type of two-level motorcoach body was common in the late forties in [[Western Europe]], including [[Great Britain]] where it was known as ''Observation coach''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.old-bus-photos.co.uk/?cat=226 Whitson RC35C] built on Maudslay, Leyland, AEC, and Foden chassis between 1949 and 1952 (accessed March 10, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of two-level monocoque body had been used earlier in the Spanish [[Pegaso Z-403]] two-axle coach, designed in 1949 and entered production in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pegasoesmicamion.com/PEGASO%20MONOCASCO.htm Pegaso Monocasco (monocoque) brochure 1951] accessed March 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Model PD-4501 as GMC called it was the most distinctive American ''parlor'' bus design of the modern era. It was the result of seven years of effort by Greyhound and GM Truck and Coach Division. The first GX1 prototype was based on a design by [[Raymond Loewy]] as {{US Patent|2,563,917}}. Originally conceived as a {{convert|35|ft|m|2|adj=on}} bus, Greyhound later used a tandem-axle {{convert|40|ft|m|2|adj=on}} prototype by Loewy called the [[GX-2]] to lobby for the lifting of length restrictions of buses longer than 35 feet in most states at the time.

Power for the production models was originally provided by a pair of [[Detroit Diesel Series 71|GM Diesel 4-71]] four cylinder engines of 160 HP each connected by a fluid coupling. Two engines were necessary because GM had never seen the need for a V8 version of its Series 71 diesel engine. Each coach had a single three-speed transmission with a manual [[Dual-clutch transmission|two-speed clutch]] for six forward speeds. There were some problems when the coaches were new because all of Greyhound's other models had four-speed manual transmissions that shifted differently than those in the Scenicruiser. This meant additional training for drivers, who mostly disliked the new system. This installation proved to be less than successful, and the 979 buses remaining in 1961-62 were rebuilt with 8V-71 engines and four-speed manual Spicer transmissions by the [[Marmon-Herrington Company]].

[[File:London Bus Museum Transportfest 2013 019 (10383698196).jpg|thumb|left|A preserved Scenicruiser on display in 2013]]
The first design prototype for the Scenicruiser, the GX1, was a [[double-decker bus|double decker]] with access from the lower deck and the driver seated on the upper deck. It was soon decided that a split-level design would be better because the GX1 was too tall for many Greyhound garages and lacked luggage space for 50 people. The [[GX-2]] had a lower level containing the driver's area and entrance with ten seats plus a restroom on the passenger's side and an upper level with 33 more seats. This arrangement also allowed a large baggage compartment underneath the second level. This design was called the [[GX-2]]. Both the GX1 and [[GX-2]] were actually built by Greyhound from 1947 to 1949 with help from GMC. In late 1951, GMC started work on its first prototype, called the EXP 331. It was completed in 1954 and had some unique features that were not used on the production versions. After the last PD 4501 prototype was built, it was rebuilt as a production model with serial number PD 4501-1001. The Scenicruiser was equipped with air-ride suspension and air conditioning. The coaches were unusual in having ten wheels. Each of the two rear axles had four wheels but only the forward axle was powered.

The Scenicruiser's popularity with the public inspired GM's later PD 4107 and PD 4903 [[GM Buffalo bus|Buffalo bus]] 35- and 40-foot models, which arrived nearly a decade later. They had a less obvious "second level" which ran most of the length of the coach, side windows from GMC's line of transit coaches and a smaller upper windshield in the front because the driver and first passenger seats were positioned higher. Unlike the Scenicruiser, these models were available for sale to all operators.

==Problems and effects on the North American bus industry==
[[Image:1955 Flxible VL100.jpg|thumb|right|1955 Flxible VistaLiner (VL100)]]
The Scenicruiser caused GMC's top competitors, Flxible and Beck, to bring out similar offerings. [[Flxible]] introduced the semi deck and a half Vista-Liner 100, a 35-foot coach (208 produced between 1955 and 1959) and Beck produced three similar 35 foot coach models for a total of 29 coaches. Beck also built twelve 40 foot Scenicruiser lookalikes in 1955 powered by the 300 HP Cummins NHRBS diesel engine. They were Beck's model DH1040 and some were delivered new to Queen City [[Trailways Transportation System|Trailways]] (later Continental Southeastern Lines). Most of Beck's 40 foot coaches were sold to operators in Cuba and Mexico. Beck had to repossess several of them and they later returned to the United States and were resold as used buses. A number of Vista-Liner 100's and at least one of the later Becks have been converted to motorhomes and are still on the road.

Mack Truck and Bus also produced a single model MV-620-D prototype in 1957 that was also 40 feet long but it found no takers even though Greyhound leased it for several months. This coach still exists in private hands in Ohio. Other two-level models introduced after the Scenicruiser were the [[New Flyer Industries|Western Flyer]] T-36-2L,and the impressive [[Multi-axle bus|four-axle]] twin-steer [[Sultana (bus)|Sultana]] Crucero Imperial.

As introduced, the Scenicruiser had some significant problems, particularly the drivetrain and cracking of the frame structure around the side windows in the rear quarter of the coach. GMC was not about to put a non-GM engine into its flagship coach nor was it willing to create a V8 version of its Series 71 diesel engine at the time, even though it certainly had the resources to do so. That meant GM's only solution was to use a pair of 4-71 engines. &lt;blockquote&gt;''Maintenance on the Scenicruiser was a constant headache – partly because of the complicated nature of some of the new systems (in the manner of [[Rube Goldberg]], some of the critics suggested), partly because some of the components were too new and unimproved (using new, unproved, and unimproved technology), partly because the diagnostic tools and techniques were inadequate, partly because the training and availability of mechanics (and maintenance supervisors and managers) for the new model were less than optimum, partly because the technical support and repair-parts support were less than optimum, and largely because of a combination of several of those factors – along with a few other explanations – including, sadly, occasional incidents of careless or intentional abuse of the new coaches by disgusted drivers or mechanics.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluehoundsandredhounds.info/barscen.html|title=Bluehounds and Redhounds, the histories of Greyhound and Trailways|author=Duncan Bryant Rushing|accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;GMC solved one major problem in the factory as the 1955 models were being produced. The original clutch was electrically operated. That meant the drivers could not make the clutch smoothly engage; it was either in or out. This caused lurches and jolts every time the driver started from a stop or changed gears. Both the passengers and drivers didn't like it. The electrical clutch linkage was replaced by a mechanical one which solved the problem. GMC gave Greyhound enough sets of parts to convert all of the previously made coaches. At the same time the windshield wipers were changed to a pantograph design which kept them in full contact with the glass at all times and this was also retrofitted to older coaches. The other problems were mostly solved starting in 1961 when all 979 Scenicruisers were rebuilt, costing Greyhound over [[United States dollar|$]]13 million.

The problems with the Scenicruisers greatly soured relations between Greyhound and GMC. Greyhound continued to buy GMC coaches with the PD 4104 up through 1960 and the PD 4106 from 1961 to 1964. Given the problems with the PD 4501, Greyhound had no interest in asking GMC to produce a second version of its signature coach based on the PD 4106's mechanicals and styling. Greyhound also bought some PD 4107 buses from GMC which were known as the "Buffalo" model. Greyhound purchased 362 of these buses in two orders (162 in 1966 and 200 more in 1967, with the 1966 units being trouble prone). The company never bought another GMC coach afterwards. In 1958 The Greyhound Corporation acquired a controlling interest in [[Motor Coach Industries]] (MCI), Limited, of Canada and by 1961 had full ownership of it. This led to the end of its need for GMC coaches by 1968. GMC's sales soon went into terminal decline as both Greyhound and Trailways were building their own coaches.

Beck left the bus and coach market in 1957, a year after being taken over by Mack. In 1960 Mack left the market except for a short time as an importer of rebadged Renault FR1 coaches between 1986 and 1989. Flxible built its last intercity coach in 1969 and their final transit coach in 1995. GMC exited the new coach market after producing the 1980 models and continued transit coach manufacturing until 1987.

==Companion model==
GMC also introduced its model PD 4901 in 1954 so as to have a 40-foot model for non-Greyhound operators. It was mechanically identical to the Scenicruiser, but the driver and passengers were all at nearly the same high level as the Scenicruiser's upper deck. Like the PD 4104, the PD 4901 had a flat floor so the seats were a few inches lower than in the PD 4501 which allowed larger overhead baggage racks. The only one produced was clad in gold anodized aluminum and GMC called it the Golden Chariot. No American operators in the country wanted to take on the additional complexity and fuel consumption of this dual engine model. Greyhound's troubles with its Scenicruisers were already well known, keeping potential buyers away and none were ordered. GMC leased it to Greyhound and then to several other smaller carriers in the northeast and finally sold it as a used bus. This coach is currently owned by Wilson Bus Lines in Massachusetts who plan to restore it to its former glory.

==Super Scenicruiser==
In 1961 and 1962, [[Marmon-Herrington]] rebuilt the existing Scenicruiser fleet for Greyhound, 22 having already been totaled in accidents. The rebuild included installing the newly-available Detroit Diesel 8V-71 engine and a 4-speed unsynchronized Spicer manual transmission in place of the twin 4-71 engines and 3-speed transmission with 2-speed splitter. Side reinforcement plates above the rear wheels and below the upper deck windows under the skin were added. The interiors were also freshened up, but this was done by Greyhound. After the rebuilding the ''Super Scenicruiser'' name replaced the ''Scenicruiser'' name on the sides of each coach.

In spite of the reinforcements, structural problems continued and the Scenicruisers that made it into the 1970s again had some external panels removed and further reinforcements added.

==Survival and sequels==
[[File:London Bus Museum Transportfest 2013 022 (10383676926).jpg|thumb|right|A preserved Scenicruiser in England, 2013]]
About 200 Scenicruisers were still in service when Greyhound withdrew them around 1975. As of 2015, some of these remain, many converted to motorhomes. Other owners are committed bus enthusiasts who have restored their buses to like-new condition. A number of them were bought as used buses and ran in the colors of their new owners for some years after leaving Greyhound. A few even ended up wearing Trailways red and white as they were bought by Trailways affiliate carriers.

The influence of the Scenicruiser may be seen in General Motors' 1964 [[Buick Sport Wagon]] and [[Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser]] [[station wagons]], both of which had stepped-up roofs and a raised skylight over the second row of seats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1964-1972-oldsmobile-vista-cruiser.htm HowStuffWorks.com article mentioning possibility of 1960s GM station wagons being inspired by Scenicruiser] Retrieved 2011-06-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://epautos.com/2010/10/04/oldsmobile-vista-cruiser-1964-1977/ Eric Peters Autos page citing possible Scenicruiser heritage for the Vista Cruiser] Retrieved 2011-06-18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art, music and literature==
The [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction|Pulitzer Prize]]-winning novel ''[[A Confederacy of Dunces]]'', by [[John Kennedy Toole]], includes many obsessively sarcastic references by his main character to a trip in a Scenicruiser coach, which he recounts as a traumatic ordeal.

Country singer [[Hoyt Axton]] (1938-1999) used a remodeled 1955 Scenicruiser, purchased from [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen|Commander Cody]], as his tour bus in the 1970s and '80's. "An Old Greyhound," a song he wrote about the bus, appears on his 1976 album ''Fearless''.

Scenicruiser 472, a 1955 model, gained regional fame as the tour bus for the [[Mission Mountain Wood Band]] from the mid-1970s to 1987.  It was said to have traveled over two million miles and as of 2014, was still roadworthy.&lt;ref name="Trib2014"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Madison|first1=Erin|title=Mission Mountain Wood Band bus finds Great Falls home|url=http://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/local/2014/10/03/mission-mountain-wood-band-bus-finds-great-falls-home/16629203/|website=Great Falls Tribune|accessdate=25 March 2017|language=en|date=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''GMC General''' (also known as the '''Chevrolet Bison''') is a heavy-duty ([[Truck classification|Class 8]]) truck&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/GM%20Trucks%20and%20Vans/1977_Trucks_and_Vans/1977%20Chevrolet%20Bison%20Brochure/index1.html|title=1977 Chevrolet Bison Brochure|last=Ristic-Petrovic|first=Dusan|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was assembled by the [[GMC (automobile)|GMC Truck and Coach Division]] of [[General Motors]].  The largest conventional-cab truck ever produced by General Motors, the product line was introduced for 1977, replacing the C/M 90/9500 trucks.  After 1981, the Chevrolet Bison was discontinued, following the withdrawal of Chevrolet heavy-truck production.  

In 1986, General Motors entered a joint venture with Volvo to produce heavy trucks, leading GMC to end production of the General conventional and [[GMC Astro|Astro]] cabover in 1987.&lt;ref name="GMCHeritage"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/A_Brief_Outline_of_the_First_Century_of_GMC_Truck_History|title=A Brief Outline of the First Century of GMC Truck History|author=Donald E.

The GMC General and Chevrolet Bison were assembled in [[Pontiac, Michigan]] at [[Pontiac East Assembly]] (alongside the Chevrolet Bruin and GMC/WhiteGMC Brigadier).  

== Background ==
In 1966, GMC Truck and Coach introduced its first dedicated heavy-duty trucks, moving away from trucks adapted from the smaller [[Chevrolet C/K|C/K line]].  The division introduced two lines using a common cab, the H/J-Series (93-inch BBC) and the C/M-Series (112-inch BBC).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gmheritagecenter.com/docs/gm-heritage-archive/historical-brochures/GMC/100_YR_GMC_HISTORY_MAR09.pdf|title=THE FIRST CENTURY OF GMC TRUCK HISTORY|last=Meyer|first=Donald|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using a longer hood, the C/M-series trucks were designed to accommodate larger diesel engines, such as the Cummins NH and Cummins V903, and the Detroit Diesel 8V71.  The center-hinged "butterfly" hood of the H/J-series was replaced on the C/M by a front-hinged fiberglass hood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;    Following the introduction of the medium-duty C/K in 1973, the 112-inch BBC truck was consolidated to the M-Series.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During 1977 and 1978, GMC Truck and Coach further split its heavy-duty truck range.  The Chevrolet M90/GMC M9500 were replaced by the Chevrolet Bison and GMC General in 1977, with the H/J range renamed the Chevrolet Bruin/GMC Brigadier in 1978.

== Design overview ==
[[File:1984 GMC General; Dual Headlights-Dashboard.JPG|left|thumb|1984 GMC General dashboard ]]
Similar in layout to the [[Ford L series|Ford LTL-9000]], [[International Transtar#Conventional|International Harvester Transtar 4300]], and [[Mack Super-Liner]], the Chevrolet Bison and GMC General are Class 8 conventional trucks.  Produced with an all-aluminum cab built by [[Budd Company|Budd]], the trucks were available in many different combinations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Two hood configurations were offered (108-inch or 116-inch BBC); along with a day cab, a 34-inch sleeper cab was offered, along with a walk-in sleeper cab (introduced in 1985).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While no gasoline engines were available, several diesel powerplants were available, with the Detroit Diesel 6-71 (later replaced by the 6V92) as the standard engine.  Alongside the 6-71, a buyer could choose the Cummins N-series, or Detroit Diesel 8V71 and 8V92.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Following its introduction in the GMC Astro, the Caterpillar 3406 was introduced in 1982.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When introduced in 1977, the Bison/General were available from dealers as [[Glider (automobiles)|vehicle gliders]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Essentially a complete truck with the exception of the engine, transmission, and rear axles, the incomplete vehicles were designed for a dual purpose: to either reinstall an existing powertrain in a new truck or to allow for further customization not available from a dealership.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Discontinuation ==
Following the launch of the product line, the GMC General quickly overtook the Chevrolet Bison in sales and market share.  In 1981, General Motors ended sales of heavy trucks by the Chevrolet Division, leading to the cancellation of the Chevrolet Bruin, Bison, and Titan. A major factor leading to the cancellation was lack of product support by Chevrolet dealers.  In contrast to other GM brands, a key requirement of GMC franchisees of the time was the ability to sell and service the entire GMC product line. In addition to light trucks, this meant a potential GMC franchise needed the ability to support medium-duty trucks, heavy-duty commercial trucks, the [[GMC motorhome]], P-chassis, and [[Chevrolet/GMC B series|school bus chassis]]. For a typical dealership, this meant dedicating profitable space that would have otherwise gone to selling passenger cars.

In 1986, [[Volvo Trucks|Volvo AB]] entered into a joint venture with General Motors in heavy-truck production, with Volvo taking an 85% stake.&lt;ref name="GMCHeritage" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Having acquired [[White Motor Company]] in 1980, the joint venture would do business as Volvo GM Heavy Truck Corporation, selling trucks under the combined WhiteGMC product badge.  Under the joint venture, GMC trucks were phased out in favor of White-designed Volvo GM products.  In 1987, the final GMC General was produced, followed by the Brigadier in 1988 (badged as a WhiteGMC); the withdrawal of the latter marked the exit of General Motors from the Class 8 truck segment.  

Following the GMC General, Volvo GM produced the WhiteGMC WC/WI Class 8 conventional, introduced in 1980 as the White Road Boss 2, the model line was produced through 2000 in various forms as a White, WhiteGMC, Autocar, and Volvo.

The '''Chevrolet Bruin''' and '''GMC Brigadier''' are [[heavy-duty truck|heavy-duty]] (Class 7-8) trucks that were assembled by the [[GMC (automobile)|GMC Truck and Coach Division]] of [[General Motors]].

As a Class 7-8 truck, the product line saw use with short-haul, vocational, and severe-service users.

All examples were assembled alongside medium-duty GM trucks and GM RTS buses at the [[Pontiac Assembly Center|GMC Truck &amp; Coach Pontiac Central Assembly]] facility in [[Pontiac, MI|Pontiac, Michigan]].

== Background ==
In 1966, General Motors split its heavy-duty trucks further apart from medium-duty models, giving them a distinct chassis and ending the use of the cab from the [[Chevrolet C/K|C/K-series pickup truck]].  The 1966 H/J-series ( H=single; J=tandem) was designed with a model-specific 93-inch BBC cab and chassis.  Alongside [[GMC V6 engine|GMC V6]] and [[Chevrolet big-block engine#427|Chevrolet 427 V8]] gasoline engines, the H/J trucks were available with Cummins, Detroit Diesel, and Caterpillar diesel engines.&lt;ref name="DEM37" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://67-72chevytrucks.com/vboard/showthread.php?t=514312|title=1966-81 Chevy H/J Series - The 1947 - Present Chevrolet &amp; GMC Truck Message Board Network|website=67-72chevytrucks.com|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The H/J-Series formed the basis of the C(later N)/M-series trucks; using a longer 114-inch BBC to accommodate larger diesel engines).  In 1977, the N/M-series was replaced by the Class 8 [[Chevrolet Bison|Chevrolet Bison/GMC General]] semitractor.  From 1966 to 1970, GMC would use a separate conventional school bus chassis from Chevrolet, basing it on the H6500 instead of the medium-duty Chevrolet C60 (in 1971, GMC would return to a medium-duty chassis).

== Design overview ==
[[File:Heavy Transporter of CCK Air Force Base 20111112.jpg|right|thumb|GMC Brigadier semitractor]]
In the mid-1970s, General Motors began shifting away from its alphanumeric nomenclature for truck names.  While still using the H/J name internally, the redesign brought new names to the vehicles.  At Chevrolet, Bruin was in line with several "frontier"-related nameplates (Bison, Bruin, Kodiak, Blazer, Silverado, Scottsdale, Cheyenne).  GMC took on its own pattern, adopting military-related nameplates (General, Brigadier, and TopKick; the latter being a slang term).

GMC introduced the Brigadier in a 9500 series, expanding to an 8000 series in 1979.  Chevrolet offered the Bruin in a 70, 80, and 90 series.  Externally, a Chevrolet Bruin is hard to distinguish from a GMC Brigadier, with the lone exception of the grille on butterfly-hood examples (on those, Bruins have two headlights while Brigadiers have four&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/GM%20Trucks%20and%20Vans/1979_Trucks_and_Vans/1979%20Chevrolet%20Bruin%20Brochure/image2.html|title=1979 Chevrolet Bruin Brochure|last=Ristic-Petrovic|first=Dusan|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Chassis/body ===
The Chevrolet Bruin/GMC Bruin carried over the H/J 9500 cab introduced in 1966, but with a number of changes.  Replacing the removable steel hood is a fully tilting fiberglass hood with a larger rectangular grille;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the larger hood features a redesigned radiator, featuring better engine cooling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DEM37" /&gt;   For durability, the previous-generation center-hinged "butterfly" hood remains available.  While produced with an optional cab airfoil, the cab is sold with either a one-piece or a two-piece windshield.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Chevrolet 427 gasoline V8 would be the standard engine for the Bruin/Brigadier.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In 1982, the Brigadier became powered exclusively by diesel engines.&lt;ref name="DEM37" /&gt;  Alongside the Detroit Diesel 6V53, 6V71, 6-71, 8V71, and 6V92, the Caterpillar 3208 were used alongside the Cummins NTC diesels.  In 1984, the Cummins L10 was introduced as an option.&lt;ref name="DEM37" /&gt;

Following the launch of the product line, the GMC Brigadier quickly overtook the Chevrolet Bruin in sales and market share.  After the 1981 model year, General Motors ended sales of heavy trucks by the Chevrolet Division, leading to the cancellation of the Chevrolet Bruin, Bison, and Titan.  A major factor leading to the cancellation was lack of product support by Chevrolet dealers.  In contrast to other brands, a key requirement of GMC franchisees of the time was the ability to sell and service the entire GMC product line.  In addition to light trucks, this meant a potential GMC franchise needed the ability to support medium-duty trucks, heavy-duty commercial trucks, the GMC motorhome, P-chassis, and school bus chassis.  For a typical dealership, this meant dedicating profitable space that would have otherwise gone to selling passenger cars.

In 1986, [[Volvo Trucks|Volvo AB]] entered into a joint venture with General Motors in heavy-truck production, with Volvo taking an 85% stake.  Having acquired [[White Motor Company]] in 1980, the joint venture would do business as Volvo GM Heavy Truck Corporation, selling trucks under the combined WhiteGMC product badge.  Under the joint venture, the slow-selling GMC General and Astro were replaced by WhiteGMC products; while the Brigadier would be replaced by the GMC C8500.

In 1990, General Motors redesigned the Chevrolet Kodiak/GMC TopKick. This included the C6500, C7500, and the new Class 8 C8500.

The '''Chevrolet Titan''' and '''GMC Astro''' are heavy-duty ([[Truck classification|Class 8]]) [[Cab over|cabover trucks]] that were manufactured by the [[GMC (automobile)|GMC Truck and Coach Division]] of [[General Motors]].  The largest cabover trucks ever produced by GM, the Titan (and more common Astro) were introduced for 1969, replacing the 1960-1968 GMC "Crackerbox" COEs.  The Astro and Titan would become the final trucks of the type assembled and marketed by General Motors, following the 1981 exit of Chevrolet from heavy truck sales and the 1986 creation of the [[Volvo Trucks|Volvo GM joint venture]].

The Chevrolet Titan and GMC Astro were assembled at [[Pontiac Assembly Center|Pontiac Truck &amp; Coach/Truck &amp; Bus]] (Pontiac East Assembly) in [[Pontiac, Michigan]], with the final GMC Astro produced in 1987.

In 1959, GMC introduced its Class 8 cabover trucks, replacing the previous "Cannonball" fixed-cab COEs.  Distinguished by its boxy appearance, it became nicknamed the "Crackerbox".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/A_Brief_Outline_of_the_First_Century_of_GMC_Truck_History|title=A Brief Outline of the First Century of GMC Truck History - Generations of GM|website=history.gmheritagecenter.com|access-date=2017-01-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161210181117/https://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/A_Brief_Outline_of_the_First_Century_of_GMC_Truck_History|archive-date=2016-12-10|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.gmheritagecenter.com/docs/gm-heritage-archive/historical-brochures/GMC/100_YR_GMC_HISTORY_MAR09.pdf|title=THE FIRST CENTURY OF GMC TRUCK HISTORY|last=Meyer|first=Donald E.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Available in a 48-inch BBC (bumper to back of cab) length, the truck was produced with an all-aluminum fully tilting cab.  Alongside a 702 cubic-inch GMC V12 gasoline engine, the truck was available with Detroit Diesel 6V71 and 8V71 diesels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Along with single or tandem axle configurations, the GMC "Crackerbox" was available with a [[sleeper cab]].

In the late 1960s, as American truck manufacturers introduced updated designs for cabover trucks, design work began on an all-new Class 8 cabover.  Expanding the product line to the Chevrolet brand, the replacement for the GMC Crackerbox sought to expand interior space, visibility, and driver ergonomics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For the 1969 model year, the GMC F was replaced by the GMC Astro, while the Chevrolet Titan 90 was unveiled for the 1970 model year.&lt;ref name="TitanUnveiling-01"&gt;See brochure {{Citation |title=1970 Chevrolet Movers - Full Line - From Blazer to Titan 90 |date=August 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TitanUnveiling-02"&gt;See brochure {{Citation |title=1970 Chevrolet Movers - Tilt Cabs, Series 70-80-90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GMC Astro/Chevrolet Titan are Class 8 cabover-engine (COE) trucks, sold in both single and tandem rear axle configurations.  In contrast to the Crackerbox, the cab of the Astro was lengthened nearly six inches into a 54-inch BBC length with two sleeper cab configurations available.  In what would be a distinguishing feature of the vehicle, the Astro/Titan was produced with a wraparound dashboard;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the speedometer and tachometer were placed directly in the line of sight of the driver while most secondary gauges were placed off to the side, based on their level of use.

In stark contrast to the boxy Crackerbox, the exterior of the Astro/Titan featured rounded body corners and wraparound windshield glass.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In 1975, GMC introduced a ''Dragfoiler'' [[Spoiler (car)|roof spoiler]] as an option.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In an option that became standard a year later, in 1979, GMC and Chevrolet offered the SS (Special Series) package.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Featuring a (much) larger radiator grille, improvements to exterior and interior trim, the SS package was meant to market the Astro/Titan towards owner-operators.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In 1983, the Aero Astro option package was released, largely as an effort to improve fuel economy.  Along with the Dragfoiler roof spoiler, the option package included body extension panels between the cab and trailer, an air dam below an extended bumper and an optimized radiator grille.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In a major change from precedent, when introduced in 1969, the Astro/Titan were marketed exclusively with diesel engines.  The base engine was the Detroit Diesel 6-71N, with the Detroit Diesel 8V71 and Cummins N-Series diesels as options.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In 1972, the Detroit Diesel 12V71 became available as an option; though rarely ordered, the V12 engine would remain through 1978.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Although Detroit Diesel had developed a gas-turbine version of the GMC Astro in the early 1970s, fuel-economy concerns would keep it out of production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In 1977, the Cummins KT450 and Caterpillar 3406 became options; the larger engines required the addition of a larger radiator.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In 1979, the 6-71 was replaced by the 6V92, making all available Detroit Diesel engines V-engines; the 6V71 was discontinued after 1980.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Discontinuation ==
Following the launch of the cabover product line in 1969, the GMC Astro quickly exceeded the Chevrolet Titan in sales and market share.  In 1981, General Motors ended sales of heavy trucks by the Chevrolet Division, leading to the cancellation of the Chevrolet Bruin, Bison, and Titan. A major factor leading to the cancellation was lack of support for heavy-duty trucks by Chevrolet dealers. In contrast to other GM brands, a key requirement of GMC franchisees of the time was the ability to sell and service the entire GMC product line. In addition to light trucks, this meant a potential GMC franchise needed the ability to support medium-duty trucks, heavy-duty commercial trucks, the GMC motorhome, P-chassis, and school bus chassis. For a typical dealership, this meant dedicating profitable space that would have otherwise gone to selling passenger cars.

In 1986, [[Volvo Trucks|Volvo AB]] entered into a joint venture with General Motors in heavy-truck production, with Volvo taking an 85% stake. Having already acquired [[White Motor Company]] in 1980, the joint venture would do business as Volvo GM Heavy Truck Corporation, selling trucks under the combined WhiteGMC product badge.  Under the joint venture, GMC trucks were phased out in favor of White-designed Volvo GM products.  The GMC Astro ceased production after the 1987 model year (coincidentally, two years after Chevrolet launched a [[Chevrolet Astro|van with the same name]]).

Although Volvo GM would continue sales of COE trucks under the White GMC and Western Star brands (the WhiteGMC WH and Western Star Cabover; both versions of the [[White Road Commander|White Road Commander II]]), the GMC Astro was never directly replaced by Volvo GM, Volvo, or General Motors.

The '''GMC Motorhome''' was manufactured by the [[GMC (automobile)|GMC Truck &amp; Coach Division]] of [[General Motors]] for model years 1973–1978 in [[Pontiac, Michigan]], USA — as the only complete [[motorhome]] built by a major auto/truck manufacturer.   Manufactured in {{Convert|23|and|26|ft|m|abbr=on}} lengths, the design was noted for its front-wheel drive and its low profile, fully integrated body.

In contrast to most motorhomes which were manufactured on drivetrain equipped frames supplied by a chassis manufacturer; GMC designed, engineered and built the entire vehicle, and in most cases the interiors, completely in-house. Empty shells were also supplied to other RV manufacturers for interior outfitting and to specialty manufacturers for custom outfitting, ranging from mail delivery and mobile training facilities to people movers and ambulances.

==Design and specifications==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
[[File:GMC Motorhome Clay Model.jpg|thumb|left|GMC Motorhome early 1/8 scale clay model]]
Industry rumors had been circulating for some time that GM was going to build a motorhome. On February 7, 1972, it was made official. About this time the new vehicle was known as the TVS-4, Travel Vehicle Streamlined. The motorhome design continued to evolve in the two main areas of styling and chassis. The Design Center was continuing with both the external and interior designs. There were twelve designers working with sketches and 1/8 scale (A-scale) clay models. Three or four of these 1/8 scale clay models were made, each with unique design characteristics, each refining their shapes closer to the final form. Once these models were completed, evaluated and approved, full sized drawings were made using 1/4&amp;nbsp;inch tape to outline the front, rear and side design. These drawings would guide the designers in the next stage: a full size clay model.

The clay full scale {{Convert|26|ft|m|adj=on}} motorhome was created. Once the shape was completed, the clay surface was “polished” with a sponge and cold water and finished with a silver-blue film of [[DI-NOC]], replicating the painted surface of a vehicle. Upon completion of the full scale clay, plaster cast segments were made of it. Dimensional drawings were made of this final design for tooling and early fiberglass prototype parts for the first prototype bodies.

The [[motorhome]] had a front-wheel-drive transaxle, which GM called '''Unified Powerplant Package''', originally used in the [[Oldsmobile Toronado]] and [[Cadillac Eldorado]] with an Oldsmobile {{Convert|455|cuin|l|abbr=on|sigfig=2 }} [[V8 engine|V8]] from the Toronado, but the later models made use of the {{Convert|403|cuin|l|abbr=on|sigfig=2 }} V8. Cadillac employed the {{Convert|501|cuin|l|abbr=on|sigfig=2 }} engine. Both used the GM-designated [[Turbo-Hydramatic 425]] automatic transmission, with a wide [[roller chain]] drive to connect the output of the longitudinally oriented engine to the transmission. The final drive was connected directly to the transmission, and power was fed to the front wheels using half-shafts that ran under the front portion of the engine. The engine was fueled with regular gasoline stored in two {{Convert|25|gal|l|adj=on}} tanks. 
[[File:GMC Motorhome Chassis.jpg|thumb|left|GMC Motorhome chassis]]
The GMC was equipped with front disc brakes and drums on all four rear wheels. The front-drive configuration eliminated the driveshaft and rear differential and solid axle found on most front-engined motorhomes. As a result, the floor could be built with about {{Convert|14|in|cm}} clearance above the roadway. The floor was too low for a rear cross axle, and GM designed the rear suspension as a tandem pair of wheels, mounted on bogies which rode on pins attached to the sides of the low-profile frame. With the exception of the wheel wells, the rear suspension does not intrude into the living space. The rear bogies are suspended using a double-ended convoluted air bag that is pressurized by an automatic leveling system to maintain the designed ride height. The leveling system can also be manually controlled to level the coach at a campsite. The overall chassis design, from the use of an existing [[GM E platform]] powertrain and a modified rear suspension has been considered an early ancestor of the crossover.

The motorhomes were built in either {{Convert|23|ft|m|adj=on}} or {{Convert|26|ft|m|adj=on}} length, with about 90% of the total production being the latter. The wheelbase from the front wheels to the centerline of the rear tandem pairs is {{Convert|140|in|cm}} for the {{Convert|23|ft|m|adj=on}} coach and {{Convert|160|in|cm}} for the {{Convert|26|ft|m|adj=on}} coach. All GMC Motorhomes are {{Convert|96|in|cm}} wide and about {{Convert|9|ft|m}} tall including the usually-installed roof air conditioner. Interior head room is {{Convert|76|in|cm}}.

Gross vehicle weight rating for the {{Convert|23|ft|m|adj=on}} coach was {{Convert|10,500|lb|kg}} and {{Convert|12,500|lb|kg}} for the {{Convert|26|ft|m|adj=on}} coach. Most GMCs with factory interiors have a {{Convert|30|usgal|l}} freshwater tank and a {{Convert|30|usgal|l}} holding tank.
[[File:GMC motorhome body-drop.jpg|thumb|GMC Motorhome production body-drop]]
Body construction consisted of a rigid frame made of welded aluminum extrusions. The body frame was mounted on the chassis steel ladder frame using body isolators. The floor was marine plywood, except where it sloped up at the extremities, where they were plate aluminum. The body panels are fiber reinforced plastic (fiberglass) below the waistline frame extrusion and at the ends. The upper side body and roof panels between the ends are sheet aluminum. GMCs are notable for their large expanse of windows, which redefined the RV industry at the time. They often had luxury features common on upper models of GM brands, such as [[cruise control]], [[air conditioning]], [[AM radio|AM]]/[[FM radio|FM]]/[[8-track cartridge|8-track]] sound systems, an aluminum/fiberglass body, as well as air suspension.

Rear lower compartments provide space for generators and propane tanks. GMCs were optionally supplied with generators from [[Onan]] in 4,000 watts and 6,000 watts, many of which are still in service. There were no driver's or passenger's doors at the front of the vehicle. A single door amidships on the right-hand side provided access to the main passenger compartment. At the back of the vehicle, the entire rear body panel could be taken off by loosening a series of bolts around its edges, allowing beds, appliances and other bulky items to be installed or removed.

==Production==
A total of 12,921 GMC Motorhomes were produced from model years 1973 to 1978. The interior of the motor home was constructed at the Gemini Corporation plant in Mt. Clemens, Michigan. Peter R. Fink, owner of Travco motor homes, was the CEO of Gemini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rvbusiness.com/tag/dodgetravco/ |title=Dodge/Travco |publisher=RVBusiness |date=July 6, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702130747/http://www.rvbusiness.com/tag/dodgetravco/ |archivedate=2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gemini operation featured a progressive team concept with teams of workers constructing rooms of the motor homes in full, rather than performing repetitive tasks on an assembly line. Beginning operation in 1972, the plant featured state-of-the-art equipment including one of the first programmable routers.  Gemini closed a few years after General Motors discontinued production of its motor homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michigancorporates.com/corp/230803.html |title=Gemini Corporation |publisher=Michigan Corporates: Company Profiles of Michigan |accessdate=2019-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 7,000 are currently listed in an international registry. Estimates suggest that at least 8,000 to 9,000 of the original production are still in running condition.

A press release datelined Pontiac, November 11, 1977, read as follows: “GMC Truck &amp; Coach Division of General Motors plans to discontinue producing luxury MotorHomes and similar TransMode multi-purpose vehicles and convert those plant facilities to expand truck operations, a GM vice president said today. Robert W. Truxell, general manager of GMC Truck &amp; Coach said, “As a result of this action, GMC will be able to utilize production facilities more effectively for servicing growing truck demands.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gmcmi.com/basic-history/ |title=GMC Motorhome History |first=William |last=Bryant |publisher=GMCMI |accessdate=2019-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor is that the driveline for the new for 1979 E platform which was in the process of being downsized was lighter duty and incompatible with the GVW of the GMC motorhome where the existing Oldsmobile-sourced driveline was being phased out of production (the 403 and THM425 transaxle were phased out and replaced with the Oldsmobile 350 and THM325 when the downsized E platform was under development.)

==Influences==
{{Synthesis|date=November 2017}}
{{Original research|section|date=November 2017}}
Prior to the introduction of the GMC Motor home, a handful of other manufacturers made use of a similar front-wheel drive configuration and inspired the GMC configuration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bdub.net/publications/sob-fwd/index.html |publisher=Bdub's Place |title=Other Toronado Powered Front Wheel Drive Motorhomes |first=Bill |last=Bryant |date=2003-09-10 |accessdate=2019-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included the [[Cortez Motor Home]] from the Clark Equipment Corporation which initially offered a four-speed manual transmission with front-wheel drive, available from 1963 to 1970 until the division was sold to Kent Industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cortezcoach.com/index.php/historical-info/cortez_history/ |title=Hey, what is a Cortez anyway? |date=2010 |publisher=CortezCoach.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906115452/http://www.cortezcoach.com/index.php/historical-info/cortez_history/ |archivedate=2010-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1972 to 1977, a redesigned Cortez-SD was manufactured, initially by Kent and later a group of investors, using the same Oldsmobile 455 and three-speed automatic transmission that the GMC motorhome adopted in 1973.

Another parallel design was the Revcon motor home, which, starting in 1971, was an all-aluminum body front-wheel drive coach, initially with the same Toronado drive train as the later GMC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://revconeers.com/ |title=The Revcon Motorhome |publisher=Revconeers.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403061030/http://revconeers.com/ |archivedate=2010-04-03 |access-date=2010-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1978, the Revcon took on a more aerodynamic design similar to the just-canceled GMC Motor home, which included a slant nose and dual rear axle, while adopting a [[Chevrolet]] [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#454|454]] engine and [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] 475 transmission. These were in production through 1990, with one coach built in 1991 using remaining components before the factory closed.&lt;ref name="RevconPI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://policeinterceptor.com/Revcon.htm |publisher=PoliceInterceptor.com |title=Support Page for wide-body 1987–1991 Revcon RV's |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721164810/http://policeinterceptor.com/Revcon.htm |archivedate=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''GMC Hummer EV''' is an upcoming off-road [[Electric car|electric]] vehicle series produced by [[General Motors]]. The new Hummer EV will be available in two variants, an SUV and a truck (dubbed "SUT"). The vehicles were introduced through a series of teasers on January 30, 2020, with the full market launch during the [[Super Bowl LIV]] on February 2, 2020. Official release will be on May 20, 2020, and the truck variant is expected to go on sale in late 2021.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30714182/gmc-hummer-ev-confirmed-2021/ |title = GMC's Hummer EV Pickup Is Real, Will Have 1000 HP |last = Capparella |first = Joey |date = 2020-01-30 |website = Car and Driver |language = en-US |access-date = 2020-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The [[Hummer]] series was marketed and sold by [[General Motors|GM]] from 1999 to 2010 as rugged, heavy-duty SUVs during their production cycles. Off-road capabilities, high fuel consumption, and low gas mileage were three traits commonly associated with the brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.edmunds.com/gmc/hummer-ev/ |title = 2022 GMC Hummer EV Prices, Reviews, and Pictures |website = Edmunds |language = en-us |access-date = 2020-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Production of the Hummer was eventually discontinued in 2009 due to rising fuel costs that led to dwindling demands, but GM retained the intellectual property rights for the Hummer name after its discontinuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21115040/gm-hummer-ev-truck-gmc-horsepower |title = The Hummer is coming back as a 1,000-horsepower electric truck |last = O'Kane |first = Sean |date = 2020-01-30 |website = The Verge |language = en |access-date = 2020-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leveraging on Hummer's brand recognition and GM's distribution network, the re-launched Hummer will be an environmentally friendly electric vehicle (EV) and GM's foray into the nascent EV truck market.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.outsideonline.com/2408788/electric-hummer-ev-truck |title = Hummer Is Back, and It’s…Electric?! |last = Siler |first = Wes |date = 2020-01-30 |website = Outside Online |language = en |access-date = 2020-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle will be marketed and sold through [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] dealerships.

The Hummer EV is reported to have {{convert|1000|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, generating {{convert|11500|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} torque from three electric motors. There will be one-, two- and three-motor variants, and the truck will come in RWD and AWD configurations. GMC's figure corresponds to wheel torque (similarly to the [[Tesla Roadster (2020)|second-generation Tesla Roadster]]), which is traditional motor torque multiplied through the transmission's drive ratio; this results in a motor torque figure of {{convert|715|-|834|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/gmc-hummer-ev-torque/|title=

On March 4th, 2020, GM announced several new details on the upcoming Hummer EV at an event showcasing future electric vehicles and technology. FIrst, GM confirmed that there would be two variants of the Hummer EV; a truck, the "Hummer EV SUT" (the variant teased during the Super Bowl), and an SUV, the newly announced "Hummer EV SUV." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motortrend.com/news/gmc-hummer-ev-sut-pickup-suv-details-preview/|title=2022 GMC Hummer EV Getting Pickup, SUV Versions - Both With 1,000 HP|date=2020-03-04|website = Motor Trend|language = en|access-date = 2020-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; While GM didn't release any images or allow any photos to be taken, the select journalists who saw both Hummers were permitted to share information the several design elements. Both variants have a removable targa top (like the [[Jeep Wrangler]]) that can be stored in the frunk, and large, 35 inch tires. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motortrend.com/news/gmc-hummer-ev-sut-pickup-suv-details-preview/|title=2022 GMC Hummer EV Getting Pickup, SUV Versions - Both With 1,000 HP|date=2020-03-04|website = Motor Trend|language = en|access-date = 2020-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, both variants extensively incorporate the old Hummer design language (particularly that of the [[Hummer H3]] and H3T), with an upright windshield, boxy shape, and aggresive, squared fender flares, with included running boards. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motortrend.com/news/gmc-hummer-ev-sut-pickup-suv-details-preview/|title=2022 GMC Hummer EV Getting Pickup, SUV Versions - Both With 1,000 HP|date=2020-03-04|website = Motor Trend|language = en|access-date = 2020-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the SUT version was said to have very large C-pillar "sails" in the back reminiscent of the [[Chevrolet Avalanche]]; but where the Avalanche added an external element to provide a slope to the back side of the C pillar, the Hummer’s C pillar ''itself'' is angled back to meet the bed. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.designnews.com/batteryenergy-storage/latest-on-gmcs-2022-hummer-suv-and-pickup/147263719662566/page/0/6|title=The Latest on GMC's 2022 Hummer SUV and Pickup|date=2020-03-09|website = Design News|language = en|access-date = 2020-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SUT also looked to possibly include the retracting rear window feature found in both the Avalanche and the [[Hummer H2]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.designnews.com/batteryenergy-storage/latest-on-gmcs-2022-hummer-suv-and-pickup/147263719662566/page/0/6|title=The Latest on GMC's 2022 Hummer SUV and Pickup|date=2020-03-09|website = Design News|language = en|access-date = 2020-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside, the Hummers each have a big upright 15.0-inch touchscreen, 12.0-inch instrument cluster, beefy steering wheel, and huge gearshift - the styling of the interiors was described as "weatherproof," "butch" and similar to the Jeep Wrangler. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motortrend.com/news/gmc-hummer-ev-sut-pickup-suv-details-preview/|title=2022 GMC Hummer EV Getting Pickup, SUV Versions - Both With 1,000 HP|date=2020-03-04|website = Motor Trend|language = en|access-date = 2020-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air suspension will be available on higher trim models.

== Marketing ==
On January 30, 2020, GM released three ''Quiet Revolution'' theme teasers of the Hummer EV. These teaser releases were followed up with the first marketing launch with Super Bowl ads on February 2, 2020 with [[LeBron James]] as the spokesperson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/hummer-electric-gmc-super-bowl-lebron-james/ |title = New Hummer EV will debut in Super Bowl ad with LeBron James |last = Paukert |first = Chris |website = Roadshow |language = en |access-date = 2020-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
The Hummer EV will be produced at GM's [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly]] plant in [[Michigan]]. Availability should begin in mid-2021. The company recently invested $2.2 billion in the plant for the production of electric vehicles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
